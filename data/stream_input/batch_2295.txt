B003H6KRIE|5.0|No problem at all.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value
0307887448|4.0|This is highly recommended for all the gamers out there or even the people who love anything referenced in the 80s. There was some plot devices and dialogue that I found completely silly or could have been improved upon. Still, I was entertained and glued to find out what was going to happen next.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|No problem at all.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value
B0053TMP24|5.0|Excellent read for young and old. It stays true to roots of Greek mythology. I would definitely recommend purchasing this book.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|No problem at all.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value
141659521X|4.0|This is another good one by Flynn . I rated it only a 4 star because I compare all his stuff to &#34;Term Limits&#34;. In my opinion the best one of his books I have read. Granted I have not read all of them.<br />I really liked this book.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game is fun, however it could be better if they keep adding more game quicker instead of having to wait for couple months.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great entertainment for the kids. Helps them multi task, plan ahead and create a strategy for the competitive ones. Very affordable, definitely recommend this game. All ages can have fun.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Seems to be pretty solid for a molded plastic.  It will do what I need it to, and I am glad I bought it.  Good price.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|While Steven Wilson's previous 2 solo albums were quite good, he nailed it this time.  With an all star band (Guthrie Govan, Marco Minneman and more) that really goes for it this is a must listen for any fan of great musicianship.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is enjoying every minute of thus game.  It presents challenges for her to work through, while her knowledge of horses gets expanded.
1439156816|4.0|When growing up he shared many accounts that give thoughtful insight into age groups.  These everyday life events could possibly be understood by any number of families.  More recently within his immediate family circle there are encouraging life successes also.  These successes build a progressive direction in writing while enjoying family life.<br />  Importantly he listens to others applying this to dialogue and character building in fiction.  Fictional characters are not drawn directly from real life.  His instruction is well explained for good storytelling, covering skills for the aspects of writing.<br />  Many examples with further reading are given in his outstanding book.  I learned enlightening connections in this well written book and highly recommend it.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|Recomiendo al vendedor del producto a tiempo en el envio, en la entrega, dando buenos resultados con la entrega en la comodidad el domicilio
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What an ending!  I have 1 more book and I'm going to be so sad when this trilogy is read!  It has been a very big part of the last couple of days for me since I can't put them down!  Wow....just wow!
B0063IH60K|1.0|1BORING 2BORING 3BORING 4BORING 5BORING 6BORING 7&8 VERY BORING 9&10 INCREDIBLY BORING  JUST NO FUN AT ALL  REAL BORING BAAAA
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Great movie and was able to get this purchase before I left for spring break making the purchase that much better
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Good game it's extremely fun. I hate the money issues though. If you like the Tycoon games and Jurassic Park you should get this game.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|We love this creative game.  It's so much fun to play for the whole family.  If you have a Lego fan, this is a must to buy!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a \\"can't put down\\" read full of unexpected twists and turns· Definately worth the time and money· Enjoy!
B0083WLKBA|5.0|I watched Season 3 and couldn't wait to get my hands on seasons 1&2. Every season is excellent. DA is so addicting. I can't wait for season 4 to begin. This set worked great on my USA DVD player.
1574216988|5.0|This is a great book and lots of fun.  I am having a great time with it. I love it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I just discovered DA this year. I watched Season 3 before seeing the first two seasons.... they did an excellent job of recapping just enough so I never felt lost. I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey. I can't wait for season 4. This version works in the USA, without any problems.
157421327X|5.0|A great beginning to a fun process.  I have had more fun since starting to Zentangle.  You will too.  Enjoy.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Técnicamente impecable, actuaciones realistas y muy buen manejo de suspenso. Desfortunadamente se vio opacada por la polémica que generó. Altamente recomendada.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is an absorbing yarn about the quest of the two lead characters to bring predators to justice.  In the grand tradition of modern-day thrillers, the two heros join forces in an attempt to overcome the long odds against them.<br /><br />The girl's character is a nice twist.  She has an Asperger's-like affliction that makes her emotionally unavailable and socially remote.  But she's a bit of an idiot savant when it comes to computers and investigations.  The focus of the book probably should have been more on her.  There is some attempt at character development here, but the book is more plot than character driven.<br /><br />The male hero is a crusading journalist who I find a bit less interesting than the girl and not entirely convincing.  More cynical and conservative American readers may be amused by the very different politics in Sweden.  The book rails against male sexual predators and amoral financial capitalists. The hero is politically-correct to the extreme. I really don't mind the lefty politics, but a good book has to have more subtle and interesting villains and heroes.<br /><br />The strength of the book is the cleverness of the plot and the ingenuity of the heroes in their attempt to solve the mysteries given them.  On the whole, a very enjoyable read.
B009ZQHQ84|4.0|Okay some schools need work, but I lot of it start at HOME! with small kids reading and doing math.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is such a great movie. It has everything you could want. Action, Romance, even a little comedy all with the gift of getting to watch Chris Hemsworth at his best. Thank you Kenneth Branagh for your most excellent vision. Well done!!!!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|If you are a fan of Philippa Gregory  ,which I am, you will not be disappointed.  It is typical of Philippa Gregory novels. Contains Intrigue and  Romance as well as plenty of information. I al3ways learn something when I read one of PG's books. There is a lot of research which goes into these books .You are not reading only make believe.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|My daughter (2) and I have watched this 4 times and it gets funnier every time we see it! It's smart comedy at it's best which is hard to come by for starters. I love this movie and everything about it. I only wish I had written it!
B003NX76BM|5.0|Excellent read.  Nora roberts always keeps your interest right to the end.  Suspense and romance.  I loved the two main characters.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I haven't seen this in a awhile but the prices was so great I had to buy it. I have a 2 year old and I'm sure she is going to love the rat. This movie is amazingly wonderful.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Loved the series and enjoyed the couple of scenes that were extended to this version. I am a happy owner of the series.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|A lot of people slam Maiden for constantly releasing live discs, DVDs and greatest hits sets but I think it's great - gives the fans something to enjoy.  I've seen the \\"Import\\" version of this and the quality is terrible.  Now we have a good version of classic few VHSs that are no longer available and we get some extras including The History Of pt 3.  If you are tired of these releases, don't buy them.  This is a great set regardless of it being another live set from this excellent band - UP THE IRONS !!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Best edition yet,  I would expect to pay for this app. It's that good. Each. shark is different. from each other. The continue option is cool too
0802473156|5.0|One of the best books I have read with clear, concise examples. Quick to read and understand - now on to implement! I'll be reading it again and have already been recommending it to friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|An absolutely amazing game. Love it! I could play it for hours on end and still not tire! Love  it!!!!
030758836X|5.0|THRILLING, AMAZING, ITS THE MOST WONDERFUL BOOK IVE READ THIS YEAR, EVERY PAGE IS FULL OF EXCITEMENT, ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR REALLY
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I first downloaded this app a few years ago when I purchased an I-touch.  It seemed a realiable, but basic product at that time.  I have since downloaded this app again to my I-phone, and it is much expanded with regards to content and functionality.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read this book over and over. If you loved the first this one is even better.<br />There are some really interesting turn of events in this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun, I git it yesterday. It's very addicting-but extremely fun to play. I'm trying to beat all my Facebook friends and its difficult to stop
6305428271|5.0|Michelle Pfeiffer really surprised me with her acting abilities in this movie.  Wish she did more movies like this. Watch it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I Bought this for my son in law as a gift. He said it was great and absolutely loved it.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|It has been watched like 3 times in one day. Really great. So exciting. Sad. And all in between.<br />It really was a nice story. And I hope in my mind they are still together and happy.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I enjoy the series, so I am biased in favor.  As to the product  arrived quickly, very good condition and DVDs are all fine.  Looking forward to buying season 3 from them ( which is a way away LOL ) But if you enjoy this series might as well purchase from good vendor.
1609611543|5.0|Wonderfully informative book, and shipped very fast! Highly recommended. In today's wheat obsessed society, this book points out many flaws in our eating habits that if changed, can result in a higher, happier quality of life.
B002QEXN8E|5.0|Very good quality for a live concert. Manu is a real singer, no studio editing to make vocals sound better. Everyone in the band contributes, the lead guitarist is a pimp, he can play classical, rock and roll and reggae guitar. The bass player creates cool sound effects vocally and the drummer is awesome as well.<br /><br />I don't speak Spanish fluently, just know some from high school, but it doesn't matter because this band rocks!<br /><br />Haven't watched the DVD, but i'm sure it is just as good.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was very realistic and spot on from a pilots point and from another alcoholic. The script and plot were fantastic and he did a great job in the role!
0451418433|5.0|I have read Book One, but haven't actually started this one yet....however I know his writing, and am sure it will be just as fascinating as Book One. Very good author....great story and a fine history lesson as well.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I was in Junior High during the time Argo took place and remember the takeover of the embassy well. I will admit that I didn't know as much about this story as I probably should have, but since it was classified, maybe not. Either way, it was a great blend of fact with entertaining Hollywood fiction. Affleck gets better with every movie he directs.
0744014549|5.0|Book was everything I expected.  It shipped a little faster than expected and arrived in perfect condition.  It is an art book about the art in the game making, so make sure you know what you are ordering
B004SIP7VM|4.0|Ultimately a depressing little movie, but still a very good flick. Amy Ryan was so believable as a white trash mother, I couldn't even like her when she was on The Office.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|The free app does just what I want it to, but if I am not linked to WI-FI it will not work. I don't know if the purchase upgrade has this requirement or not but it limits the use.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I went with a friend to see the movie in theaters and let me tell you there was a lot of sniffling in the theater and not a dry eye there.  Russell Crowe did do good as Javert and Hugh Jackman was AWESOME oh and he can sing to me all day and night 24/7.  Anne Hathaway did a very good and surprising job as Fantine.  You could just see the emotions pour out of a young factory worker who had a child and the other jealous ones who had her thrown out on the streets.  Yes i had wet eyes too and was sniffling but i also have the original musical recording on disc and i really liked it . (I could go on and on but nuff said on the subject lol)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham told this tale in a manner that was exciting and complex. It is a great addition to my library.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I like everything he writes...clean, sweet, romantic.....good plot.....you can count on that with Nicholas Sparks.  I would certainly recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I haven't read in years. Just bought a tablet (cheap) and went to Amazon for the app. It may not be a 'Kindle' but now I can read, order, examine before I buy - just great. Now I am reading again and that is a plus.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never watched the biggest Loser, so I didn't know Jillian.  This 20 minutes a day was challenging and gave me results.  I have lost 12 lbs (eating \\"clean\\" is part of it!) by diligently sticking to the SHRED.  I never missed a day.  Today is DAY 30.  Down a pant size, a dress size, a blouse size.  I have a rock hard stomach.  My thighs have some definition (like the old days), and I am seeing some nice cuts in my biceps and shoulders.  I am on my way, totally motivated, and back for the second edition:  EXTREME SHRED.  I can get through ANYTHING if it's just 20 minutes.  I could squeeze it in quickly and know I got an amazing workout.  Totally on a roll!  Don't hesitate, just do it.  It's not EASY, but it's doable.  Also excellent that she gives 3 levels, each with two versions:  beginner and advanced.  At the end of 30 days, I was doing Advanced level 3, but when I started, I couldn't even get through level 1, \\"beginner\\" without resting briefly here and there.  Have fun watching your fat melt away.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|Very disappointing. Sure wish they would have done the full soundtrack...what there is of it is fine, but, far too much is missing.<br />It's like ordering a dinner in a restaurant and instead of a  delicious meal, the waiter brings you a photo of what you could have eaten, had he served it to you.Very sad indeed.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is fun and it is enjoyable. U feel like I'm in control of the military lol. Im currently having a lot of fun.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Though I'm not personally a Bond fan, this DVD's great. My husband was quite pleased; Daniel Craig makes a believable and far more human Bond -- he gets banged up too -- no faking it with this hero! Great storyline & acting; more than enough to keep Bond fans well satisfied.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game.  Nice mixture of puzzles, hidden objects and just plain sleuthing.  I cannot wait to play the next episode.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We do like Game of Thrones, but this was even a bit more explicit than we had expected...so be forewarned -- other than that it is full of all the ususal murderous mayhem, deciets and lusts that make up day to day life for the fascinating denizens that roam about this land in their wildly diverse clans.
B00BDZV7WQ|1.0|This is the worst Wayne album I have ever purchased. It sounds like recycled lyrics and thrown together beats. Should have known it was going to be garbage when I saw Soulja Boy made a beat.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Better even than expected -- and I expected much! This did not diappoint! Will be a film to watch over and over and each time your  eye will discover new visiual delights! Wonderfully told story too!
B00ADS98FC|1.0|This could have been a good movie.  I do not understand why large girls are protrayed as sort of crude. the main character was not that way.  I do not not like the way women are protrayed in this movie.  All but the main character are protrayed as very shallow.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a wonderful film; the entire cast, direction and attention to detail make possible a full escape into the Paris of the 1800s. Enchanting and they all sing well too...yes, even Russell Crowe. Solid acting beautilly done editing, I just think it shluld have taken home the Oscar too.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Well described experience of being alone on the PCT and finding more than she knew possible.  Feel the effort of living putting one foot in front of the other and breathing.  Finding something to fill your heart and soul.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I've always loved this movie and recommend for anyone who loves a good tall tale story.  Very light hearted and will make you smile.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Spend some time with it.  Amazing music coupled with beautiful and complex lyrics. If your a fan of The Boatman's Call, you will like this one.  It is no Dig Lazarus Dig.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|The contrast between London Commodies/stock market.<br />To French Provonce setting is so much in itself the romance<br />that so many of us would LOVE to experience. Foriegn Intriege.<br />I have played this movie several times.  I continue to get emersed with the charictures.  All of them! Including the Jack Russel Dog!  Fantastic casting!<br />It very enjoyable!  Over and Over again!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|It won't let me log into Gameloft Live. As soon as this is fixed I'll give it 5 stars. Until then don't let this discourage you from playing it us still a lot of fun solo.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I just do not understand why the purchase of this was necessary for my kindle Fire. I have spoken to several owners who also had to purchase this. I have been a customer since Amazon was a brand new, has everything, values customer loyalty company. I hate to think that this was a known problem that should have been fixed on the manufactures end, that we are all paying for now.
B005URRCUY|4.0|I was slow to find the Black Keys, but better late than never! I like everything I've heard and El Camino is no exception.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Be sure to watch the whole movie. when i first started watching it i was unsure how good it was going to be.<br />There is at least one character for everyone!<br />it is unique, well written, Great for kids of different ages, shows the troubles of family members and how with love and understanding you can get through it.<br />It Really was Fantastic!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I got this game for my son and he loves it. I would highly recommend this game to anyone. I have this game on his tablet, and on my laptop.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I got this movie because when Whitney Houston died and it made me sad and I cry and this movie was the best movie she did so I wanted to get it and watch it and it very great movie.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game it is so fun. You can buy your own vehicles like tanks, monster trucks, jet skis and helicopters. You can crush cars, make big jumps, blow stuff up and steal cars! Well worth the money!
0345803493|5.0|I love this book it has such a wonderful story and it is such a interesting story. Anyone who is anyone should read this book very good book.
B00002N9ER|5.0|i got this for my mag lite an i have it drilled in my truck next to the driver seat its a nice holder
B009ION9EI|5.0|This book goes with the other two book and it is so good and it has romance and also it has sex in it but it is a story that I love so much and I have already read it and plan on reading it again after I read the other two again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've searched a few different calculator apps, and if you are looking for easy, large print, great graphics, and most importantly FREE.  Then this is the app for kindle that is above all the rest.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. I was surprised at Ben Affleck's amazing talent - I didn't realize he was so talented. Great movie, great (true) story, great acting by all.
B00011KHTM|2.0|Got this from a retailer online who claimed it was covered by the manufacturer's warranty. I didn't use it often but whenever i did, i had to make sure to move the cable through many angles in order to get it to work properly. contacted the seller for an exchange but he had a 30 day warranty contacted apple however they wouldn't cover it because i didn't buy it from them. So im pretty much stuck with an adapter that gives me a blue screen every time i use it to connect my macbook to my dell led monitor. i would not recommend buying this product. unless you get it directly from the apple store
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a fun HO game.  The puzzles were challenging without being too difficult or frustrating.  The graphics and storyline were well done.  I appreciated the map feature also.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys HO games.  Looked and worked beautiful on my Kindle HD 8.9.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Not as good as Iron Man 1, but 5 stars none the less. Acting was excellent. Plot was predictable, but it would have been very disappointing if the 'good guy' didn't win and 'get the girl' in the end. 8o)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  If I have one critique it would be that I wanted more closure at the end.  (or maybe I just wanted to keep reading because it was so good...)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|5 stars to a spectacular movie. Acting was excellent. Plot was predictable, but it would have been very disappointing if the 'good guys' didn't win in the end. 8o). Very entertaining interaction from the team as they worked out their differences. I'm hoping they'll continue the 'sibling rivalry' in Avengers 2.
0425263916|5.0|Awesome book, could not put it down.  Sad thing is that I now have to wait a couple months for the third book to arrive... Cannot wait,, going to drive me craaaaaazy till I can finish this series.. LOVED THE FIRST 2,  I loved Fifty Shades, but love these books a little more.  Now on to Anne Rice's old books Sleeping Beauty Trilogy and Story of O parts 1 and 2.  Crossfire Rules!!!!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|It may not be the most innovative sound, but JT always delivers on fun, likeable pop music that is easy to enjoy AND it's been released just in time for summer! The only drawback I found to this album was when I realized there are TWO BONUS tracks that weren't put out on the Amazon release.
1455519006|4.0|It was really good; with new charaters.  Is the kind of book that when you started is hard to put it down.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|The movie was too slow. Neither the kids nor the adults enjoyed watching it. There were deeper messages that were missed.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This was a great movie. I saw it over the Christmas holiday and loved it. The whole cast did an excellent job!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Overall it's a fun way to kill time...I wish you started off with a few more coins. Great for all ages.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This game did not come up right when IClicked on the game tab a dating site up.Got rid of the game right away.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|After reading &#34;fall of giants&#34; I am really enjoying the followup.<br />It is good reading and very mind provoking.<br />Cant wait for the third book
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nice easy read for an afternoon. Some suspense and intrigue followed by a happy ending, what more could a reader ask for? Watched the movie first and then read the book. Unusually, I liked the movie better.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very well done by cast and crew.  Jennifer Lawrence really did a super job.  Interesting twist on the have and have nots.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It takes a bit of time to see the brilliance of this novel set during WWII.  But the voice of &#34;death&#34; amazes the reader with profound and moving insights and the character development of the others who inhabit this tragic world stay with and challenge the reader.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Bought this because i liked the price. Fits great on my Baby Jogger Summit X3!  I can fit a lot of stuff in the middle compartment.
0375413405|5.0|The book is AMAZING! If, like me, you had a confused look on your face wondering what recipes meant when they said things like \\"fold\\" an egg, \\"sauce pan\\", or even wondered exactly how to properly beat an egg, the illustrations and directions in this book will guide you through!<br /><br />I really had no talent for cooking...seriously. But, like a lot of the people browsing this book, I saw the movie Julie & Julia, became fascinated with the delicious foods I saw, and wanted to see if Julia could teach ME to cook. Answer: she did!<br /><br />For my brother's birthday I cooked the amazing chicken in cream sauce with aromatic vegetables and the most delicious chocolate almond cake I've ever had. I was impressed with myself. The recipes were perfect, delicious, long, but written so well than even someone like me was able to follow them with success. Imagine going from never having cooked to making everything (even frosting) from scratch!<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone! Oh, and as a side note, while I'm sure the amount of butter used makes the recipes seem incredibly unhealthy (you definitely want to stick to \\"French portions\\"), the chicken sauce was so amazing that my incredibly PICKY husband and I ate all of the veggies deliciously =)
B005R32L66|5.0|We have friends in USA and Mexico.It is nice to see and talk with them on a regular basis.<br /><br />Good connection most of the time.<br /><br />Joe Fraser
B0035LJF2U|5.0|Awesome concert driven documentary of the band giving an awesome synopsis of what they were like in 1988. Great quality stuff.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|DC they have taken your superhero out of content. They have turned him into a soap opera but I like it. It is different espcially all the flasbacks of Green Arrow's origin. Oliver Queen where have you gone a world opens its arms to you. Bullseye.
B008Y7XNAK|3.0|ok action flic with a young Arnold and attractive Vanessa Williams The picture quality was excellent however it was the first time that my pictured buffered on three occasions
B006PTZNSY|2.0|I love the Pop side of Nicki Minaj but she is no Katy Perry... I cannot keep the album in my car for no more then 20 minutes
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I thought this clock app was pretty neat when I downloaded.  I have used it on several occasions it's more like having an old school alarm clock if you have the bigger kindle.  Very nice at night in a dark room.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I recently fell in love with Pop music. I love the new Era and this album was perfect for me.  My first Katy Perry Album
B0085OELXK|3.0|It wasn't a &#34;walk away from&#34; movie but didn't really grab me either, even with the all star cast.  Can't put my finger on it.  Just not my cup of tea.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I'm hooked on his books now. Thanks :) wondering which one to read next is a tough one.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|My grandsons loved the show and each one has an egg, so they play when ever they come to see us.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The hidden object aspect is nice but could be improved with more varied placement of the objects. Also acquiring needed supplies to continue to advance without purchase should be slightly easier.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|Not as energetic and challenging as I thought it woulld be.  i felt the response time to moving forward was too slow.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is a great action adventure that does justice to the original story and movie.  There is plenty of action, beautiful natural settings, romance, and illustrations of the bond of love and friendships.
1419705849|5.0|Let's just say that my son is not a huge fan of reading.  He'll read these books without one complaint.  That's a success as far as I'm concerned.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|not this writers finest but none the less an interesting read there were threads i would have liked to see followed that were dead ends but the theme was adhered to, the origins of some of the characters is a bit confusing i think the editor got a little too enthusiastic
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun a lot of challenging levels without it being crazy hard!! Great game play! Great story and fun levels! Kept my interest, I'm a big fan!
B000I0QKDS|5.0|If you like Jeff Beck this  solo album is a must. Another first is all lead vocals are by a then unknown Rod Stewart. Released in 1968 (I believe) , it has some classic &#34;Beck&#34; guitar work, and yes the wah-wah pedal was very popular at the time. Greensleves is a guitar instrumental by Beck on acoustic that haunts. What is really great is there are 8 bonus tracks!! , not on the original release.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book. Couldn't put it Down .Can't wait for the third book to come out. June is to far away!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I wish they had more shapes that just the cube.  But I really enjoy playing this.. It is a great stress reliever.  You just match the tiles until they are gone.  You can rotate the cube in 3-d
0060175184|5.0|The price was great and It came in good condition.  It was purchased as a gift for my dad and he loved it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Really interesting. I saw Tony Mendez speak in person.  Of course he said there was some scenes of pure Hollywood dramatization added to the story. However the truth of the story is amazing and this movie does a good job telling it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I really love this CD , Some Nights, after playing it several times I love all the songs, especially some nights, the drums get your feet tapping. Nate is my favorite singer at the moment. I also brought Pink's CD The Truth About Love because she sings a duet with Nate Ruess. I would recommend  it to people who like great music.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Not that this was uneventful but it wasn't storm of swords. Interesting twists not expected throughout the first four books that make this epic series more interesting. Death & resurrection (kinda) just a good part of he story. It certainly sets the stage for what seems to be a truly climatic epic &#34;winds of winter.&#34; Hurry up GRRM!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the BEST you can build huge houses and fly on creative mode. on survival mode you can fight monsters like creepers that EXPLODE, spiders thAt can climb  trees, skeletons that shoot arrows at you, zombies that attack  you.  you can also mine i like to look for diamonds i found this seed call jpgaming there are diamonds somewhere beneath  spawn there's a youtube video for it to find exactly where it is. you can also find iron, coal, red stone but u can't mine it yet, lapis.  in my opinion i like survival mode better than creative mode because you can do more stuff in survival. Here's  the diamond seed again  jpgaming no spaces. all lower case go on you tube and look up dia mond seeds and find the jpgaming one. i really have nothing else to say but i have to put 20 words down . so this is the best best best best best best best best best game ever. also i have this game for my kindle fire.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|&#34;Tess if the D'Urbervilles&#34; also should be titled &#34;Why we should have stopped slut-shaming in the 1890s (if not earlier!)&#34;<br /><br />Fascinating story that brings to life the plight of women in the world with issues of gender, power, sexuality, and religion.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. It's just fun! I downloaded the app, then my kids saw it &amp; downloaded it too. No need to spend real money, levels up nicely. Missions are fun!
0385349947|4.0|I did a full review at my blog: www(dot)drtabb(dot)blogspot(dot)com    I think she does a wonderful job of backing up her words with research and provides some really thought provoking ideas. This is a great read for someone considering going back to work, deciding if she wants to take time off work to raise children, a more seasoned worker, or someone just coming out of college.    I don't think I would ever want to be quite a committed worker as she is (i.e. racing back to the computer after I tuck my kids in at night) but I am not COO of one of the most profitable companies in the world. However, for the average person this book really applies to us as well.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Very well written, gripping and captivating. A must read for a serious fan. If you liked Final Empire then you will like this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is definitely a book to read before you see the movie. It is just excellent!  Books 2 & 3 are great too!!!
B00466HM28|5.0|love this!! i been making beats ever since i got it the price is good you cant beat the price good for making beats on the GO, small and simple easy to use
B009POHHRG|5.0|Dive deep into the past of the Batmans greatest foe..... The Joker. This being another story of Batman versus the Joker also dives into the back story of what made the Joker the man he is. As The Clown Prince Of Crime. A Fantastic Read. Highly Recommended To Any Fan Of Batman And The Joker.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|With network television getting more formulaic by the year, it's nice to see a show that is as fresh as it is entertaining.  With all of the 'eccentric expert helps the police' shows out there, it's easy to assume they are all alike. But even with the resurgence of the popularity of the Holmes character on screens both big and small, this show stands on it's own as an entertaining and unique modern take on the character and those who orbit him.
B00BESM14U|5.0|this was a great movie. The quality of the video was iffy though. I would suggest buying the actual DVD or Bluray disk and not deal with the hassle of waiting for it to load and what not.
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Got this game thinking my kids would like it, but now I'm hooked. It's fun and challenging, but some of the levels get pretty tricky. Highly recommend!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Beautiful video. Shows planet earth at its finest! Defiantly a must buy for nature lovers out there. 5 out of 5
B005PK56TA|5.0|I was thinking a horror series would be pretty lame. I must say that they did a great job with this one!! Even the opening credits are un-nerving!!!
0061148512|1.0|This rate is not because of the contents of the book. The edges of every single page of the book are awful! It looks like they didn't have the right tool to cut every page. I ordered this book to give it as a present, but I can't give this book, it's really the worst book I ever seen! Totally dissapointed =S
B0063IH60K|5.0|Once I found solitaire on my Kindle I play it everyday because it relaxes me. I will eventually add another game but for now solitaire is sufficient.
B000I9S64U|5.0|If you like sci fi then you are in for a treat. Based on the book. Wish it was longer.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|G5 never disappoints.  As per their usual : great graphics and storyline.  Good, challenging puzzles. The price is right.  Their games are usually 2.99 and that is pretty wonderful. Keep them coming!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I like the gravitational pull when playing space. makes for a pretty challenging game . I recommend this app. lol
B005IQZB14|5.0|Tis was a wonderful book!  I loved every moment of it.  I was really sad when it ended because I felt like Cheryl became my friend .
0694003611|5.0|Very popular and seemingly beloved story that my son reads to his daughter, I wanted her to have her own version.  The sturdy cardboard version fits the bill since she's only one year old but will grow to read it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed an extra one, to charge my Kindle when I was @ work, in addition to the one I already had to charge it @ home.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I am a great fan of British costume dramas and had been looking for a new one to watch. Lark Rise to Candleford is a four-series program, with each series containing 6 to 16 episodes. I've watched them all. It is loosely based on memoirs of the same name.<br />During the first series, we get to know the main characters and their worldviews. We learn that the poor in the tiny Hamlet of Lark Rise are proud and eschew charity. They mostly work the land for low wages, but the community is supportive and generally happy.<br /><br />We also meet Dorcas Lane, a woman who has inherited ownership of the local Candleford Post Office and forge. She has recently taken on a new employee, a former Lark Rise girl named Laura, who also happens to be her cousin's daughter. Through Laura, who also narrates the stories, we are taken to both worlds. We get a peek into daily life in the Post Office, which is also the home of Dorcas Lane and her employees.<br /><br />Dorcas Lane enjoys a life of privilege and takes on the role of village know-it-all and busy body. After a while, I found her character tedious and predicable, right down to the pursed nips and head nod. There is a lot of poor acting in this series perhaps due to marginal writing. The chief postman Thomas, for example, is very buttoned up and quotes scripture for every issue. For most of the series, we see a very two dimensional character who is also controlled by religion and Miss Lane, his employer. We meet two spinster sisters, the Miss Pratt's, who are seamstresses and own the local dress shop. Although ten years apart, they dress as twins in their fine clothes.<br /><br />For my part, I found the characters in Lark Rise much more interesting and believable. Laura's family for example. Her father is a stone craftsman and outspoken on politics and justice. Her mother is a smart and strong woman who knows when to support her husband's views and when to take him on.<br /><br />My favorite character for the whole series is Queenie, the hamlet elder stateswoman, healer, taker in of anyone who needs a place to stay, and dispenser of earthy wisdom. I think we all need a Queenie in our lives.<br /><br />The series shows us joy and loss, love, laughter, grief, pain, and many other human emotions. As mentioned before, the Lark Rise characters are the most real and believable. If you can get past some of the poor acting, particularly by Julia Sawahla as Dorcas, you'll enjoy Series one and all the others. I am not sorry I invested the time to watch this program. My higher star rating is a nod to the actors who created characters I could believe.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|When you need to wake up on time you need to just get this app and things will happen in an Amazing way.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|It's of course an awesome movie and a great journey.  This is mainly a product note.  Just received the disk pack today and learned that Ultraviolet no longer is providing iTunes codes for the digital copies.  The only way to access your digital copy is to create a Flixster/Ultraviolet account and view it through their system.  You supposedly can download a digital copy on your iPad, iPhone, Android, however you need to use a special Ultraviolet app to view that digital copy.  According to the back of the Hobbit disk cover, DOES NOT INCLUDE iTunes File, and not compatible with your iTunes library or Apple TV.  Just FYI.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|The music was good, story line was &#34;ok&#34;...  I would have been more upset if I'd gone to the movies and paid more $ to see it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good fun to play but you need a lot of patience if you are going to resist spending lots of real-life cash on this game!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Looking for a sure-thing?  Look no further - totally worth your time. Loved it - not a literary masterpiece - but a solidly good book.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Got to watch the whole season over 2 weeks to get caught up to speed with the current season's airing.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|My daughter loved it, and it makes a great father daughter movie time pleasant.  There's nothing about this story that is a surprise and really nothing that makes it anything but a good movie with a cute quirky actress and a safe predictable ending for my daughter to safely watch and get all dreamy about.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There are so many things posted on the site, you could surf for days and still not get to everything!  I am a DIY person and have already taken so many tips from the site for saving money, using natrual products for cleaning, design, and repurposing items.  It's wonderful!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|My wife started watching Walking Dead during the second season on our son's recommendation.  By missing the first season many points in the show were not clear.  Purchasing this disc allowed her to see the full series and understand the past history of the characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I thing this app is sweet I just upgraded it and it looks so much better  I prefer you look at the weather daily because it tells you the high and the low for each day.I highly recommend you download this app. Peace out,kk
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game. It is similar to Temple Run, but easier for younger children. Be aware though, if you remove it from your device and re-download it, it makes you start all over with 0 coins, 1x multiplier, no other characters or hover boards. My siblings and I had collected all 100 eggs and gotten the Rome chick board (I had also bought 3 other boards, one of which was from Rio and no longer available, collected close to 7500000 coins, unlocked Tricky and reached 27x multiplier) and with only 8 days of Rome left there is no way we will be able re-collect those 100 eggs. I hope the developer fixes this. I was a little disappointed when this happened.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I love a story where the girl is the hero. I don't want my daughter to aspire to be a princess. I want her to want to be the hero. Good lesson on how shallow and lame the prince is. Good job Elizabeth for dumping him... She is way too good for him anyway.<br />  I'd recommend this book to anyone who has a daughter, a niece or a granddaughter  who they care about and who they would offer an alternative to a Barbie as a role model.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Nice to have all her hits in one place. Thoroughly pleased with entire cd. Reinforces American Idol judges choice of a winner.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Very good over all.  A couple of areas where they could improve.  Bring back the &#34;how many people are following me feature.&#34;<br />This is not for vainity's sake, but to know if it is worth the effort to make well thought out post.<br /><br />It would be nice to know why a comment that I submitted was not posted, and how I could change the comment so that it could be posted.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This app does exactly what I needed it to do.  Easy to use and I especially like the large numbers on the pad.  I like to use the calculator for simple things,  I don't need fancy function keys.<br /><br />It is just what I need when at a restaurant for figuring the tip,or at the store for adding my purchases.
B008BM9L72|5.0|This was truly an Amazing Love story!  Get past what everyone is saying that it is all about S&M...  It is not, sure there are very explicit sex scenes in the books!  Nothing any good love story doesn't have.  My take on the trilogy...  It is about two people that are so very different in all aspects of life!  How they can find true love for one another and can overcome the odds that life sets before them!  Buy the books you will not be disappointed.  Happy reading!
0802473156|5.0|A great book to deeper insight of relationships. Leaning how to look at things from the other person's views is the best advice to prepare you and how and what to do v
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I've had the VHS tapes until now and it's even better than I expected!I received it on time and satisfactory.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 7 year old granddaughter gave this rating--says it's REALLY fun!  She spent the last hour or so playing it.
0062080237|4.0|I completely agree with many of the positive reviews. I honestly hadn't heard of American Gods before, and was loaned the book by a friend. It turned out to be a very pleasant surprise indeed. I love how Gaiman mixed fact with fiction, and creatively weaved a story unlike which I had read before. I'm looking forward to picking up some of his other books.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best drama series to come out since Roots. Incredibly gripping.Every episode leaves you hanging hard. You just can't wait for the next episode.  The best thing is that it is filmed right here in my home town of Albuquerque.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Great book. I really enjoyed it. Look forward to the next one. I have to write four more words. Now One.
B00009Z574|3.0|I am giving this record three stars primarily because of the four strong tracks on it that came from the original LP release of 1978 and the bonus tracks, some of which sound interesting.<br /><br />The original LP release contained everything here up to and including On the Silent Wings of Freedom. Now, IF I had been their very own Mogul Executive Producer, in the style of the pop music biz of the 50s or early 60s, in 1978 I would have advised them to scrap everything but Silent Wings, Future Times, Rejoice and Madrigal. These are each brilliant as YES music. I would have had them peg re-construction of this album on those four tracks. If they were really that attached to \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" I would have told them to put it out as a single, but keep it off the album. I might have told Chris Squire to work on a better development of his tune \\"Onward\\" which starts out nicely enough, but then gets stuck with some redundant key changes and seems to go on and on with a repetitive, melodramatically maudlin chorus. As it is, the song sounds like little more than a demo that someone stuck an orchestral track on to obscure the fact that the song does not go anywhere (there is, in fact, a much better version of this song on the live portion of their Keys To Ascension 1 release).I might have also had them save \\"Release, Release\\" but clean up the vocals, especially the chorus at the end, in which what sounds like a kinda' lushed up Steve Howe can be heard coming in with some rather dippy bottom harmonies as he careens magnificently around the song's main chords on his guitar. Beyond that, the other tracks should have been canned, and I would have then sent them back into the studio or rehearsal room to write more music, more legit YES music, and to cut out the gimmicky novelty songs about UFOs and Circuses in Heaven. I would have gotten the extra money from the record company to finance this, and even had them go ahead and stop work on it for touring, if necessary, and get back to it later; which is in fact what they did with Close to the Edge.<br /><br />I also would have told them to scrap the album title \\"Tormato\\" and the silly cover art that came with it. I would have told them to contract Roger Dean for another piece of album art and title the album On The Silent Wings of Freedom. But hey, that's just me.<br /><br />The answer to filling out the album with better material may have been found in a few of these bonus tracks. \\"Money\\" had a really interesting guitar riff from Howe, kind of in Western Swing style, with nice interplay with Wakeman. \\"You Can Be Saved\\" has a good chorus, \\"High\\" also presents a promising start and \\"Countryside\\" presents some really attractive instrumentation. Working to develop these songs some more might have led to a fitting replacement of my scrapped tracks and a strong YES album.back to it later; which is in fact what they did with Close to the Edge.<br /><br />I also would have told them to scrap the album title \\"Tormato\\" and the silly cover art that came with it.

B002C4YYEU|3.0|I bought this dvd to see what it was all about.  I found out and was not that impressed with it.  At least it didn't cost much.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Purchasing this CD/DVD was such a great deal that Amazon even put the music on my Home PC as soon as I bought it. I did not have to even wait to get the disc's in my hands to put the music on my phone. I just transferred the music from my PC to my phone and then waited for the purchase to arrive in my mail box in a few days!! No wait for the music. No wasting time ripping the CD's to .mp3's! Thanks Amazon!!
B001MTENOC|5.0|The first book I have read about the journey home. I really enjoyed it and believed it.  Could not put it down!
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|Here we go again! This is worse than the LOTR trilogy where we took 3 books and turned them into 3 (4 DVD) movies and released them over 4 years. This time we take a single 240 page book and we stretch it out into 3 separate movies. Release each one about a year apart, and then allow people to purchase each one for $35.00+ a piece after they have all been shown in the theatres. I (unfortunately) never saw The Hobbit in the theatres when it was released, so I was duped into purchasing the DVD/BlueRay set when it went on sale. I am old enough to remember the &#34;original&#34; animated movie The Hobbit that was originally shown on T.V. and it was superb for its time. So why (other than just being plain greedy) do we need to take a 2 hr. movie (with commercials at that) and stretch it out into 3 separate 240 minute movies??? Why else...... It is just &#34;good business!&#34; &#34;Who cares about what it costs the public!&#34; They are all stupid anyway! Heck! They will buy anything!<br /><br />The only thing that I would recommend to anyone about this movie is to BOYCOT the 2nd and 3rd release of this movie in the theatre and therefore send a STRONG message to MGM and all of the other movie company's to STOP taking advantage of the American Movie going Public!!!! Wait and buy the 2nd and 3rd release on DVD/BlueRay. That is what I am going to do!!
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani tells my story so well and it was encouraging to read how and why she 'died' and returned to live a fuller more complete life through the power of love.  It was an easy read and well written and touched my heart so I am rereading it often to gleam other thoughts that perhaps I missed the first time around.  Many illness are caused through incorrect and negative thinking and changing one's thought pattern can make miracles happen as she did--she is now living proof!  I highly recommend this book for everyone.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|A beautiful story. Great characters, excellent locations. Transported me right to that small town in France. One word of caution--don't keep a box of chocolates within reach. You'll be eating them all the way through the book!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|What a great story teller!  And so well written- I tried to slow down my reading speed to just relish the words and plot lines.  Can't wait to read more of him.  Hope I haven't read his best book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My oldest granddaughter loves this game and would probably play it continuously until my Kindle's battery ran out of juice. In addition to always giving her a goal to shoot for (excededing her highest score), it also helps her in improving her manual dexterity.
B00782O7NE|3.0|Unique, yes, but slow in places and definitely difficult to follow.  I would not watch it the second time.  It's a one hit wonder.
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen is one of the greatest bands of all times and Freddie Mercury was one of the most talented and exciting musicians in the history of popular music. Along with George Harrison's &#34;All Things Must Pass,&#34; this album set is a must for lovers of classic rock.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have seen the play of Les Miserables a couple times and I loved the movie as well. All of the actors and actresses did a fabulous job in the movie. I love the movie and I have watched it several times so far.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I enjoy playing while waiting for appointments. It is not to frustrating, and easy to try again! Granddaughter liked it also!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Oh my can't put it down!!<br />Keeps you on the edge<br />Wanting more and more such unexpected twists and turns
B00785P2QC|4.0|For those of us that don't like to be continuously connected to everyone's actions, likes and dislikes. This game just about forces you to log onto Facebook and Twitter. While these two companies are obviously funding G5 to get people to join. There needs to be a separate option to opt out. Please consider.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked Gone Girl but not the very overuse of the \\"F\\" word. It was not necessary. The ending was a surprise.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Excellent movie!  Great graphics and storyline!  You will not be disappointed.  I am looking forward to the next movie in the Hobbit series!!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I read the book and was very skeptical the movie would measure up but it definitely did-- brought the book to life!
B002BWP49C|5.0|I purchased the entire Saga and have truly enjoyed watching it each time.  Makes you want to be in love.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Providing free Kindle book instruction is a good start. There is lot to learn. One needs to be focused to follow the instructions.<br />I hope, it could be lot easier that what I read.<br />Honestly, I have not tried to make book yet. But with these instruction, I feel like I can make one.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I have watched the entire saga over and over again.  Always see something I may have missed in previous views.
B006S039YU|5.0|I love this movie! It is definitely one of the better contemporary Disney films and is entertaining for adults too :)
B007MCTTHY|5.0|You really can have fun with this game.  Levels keeps getting harder and harder.  Also this game is for all ages.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I'm impressed by Ann Frank's bravery and intelligence at such a young age. She is inspiration to all 15 yr old's. A must read for teenagers and adults.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Lost my original dvd that I purchased few years ago...could not live without it!  Perfect condition, super-fast shippment. Item just as described! Thanks!
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This movie is extremely funny and hits on so many points i've experienced since entering my 40's.  I love this movie and the cast was great.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have been bouncing in between this app and the dictionary.com one. I finally decided on this one. It's an easy interface, the definitions are easy to find and it really helped me the other day when I was working on a study guide. :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I ordered this book because of a recommendation from a friend. I simply couldn't put it down!!  It is geared toward a younger audience (late teens, early twenties??), but the story spans all ages. Loved ! :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a free calculator that does what it's supposed to. It is handy in a pinch. I have no complaints.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i read all 3 of these in a couple of weeks.  great stuff.  definitly recommend them - specially for a long flight!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a spiffy app that makes it easy and quick to clean out cell phone's junk files that accumulate with time. It saves a lot of time vs. removing the same with a file explorer.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|not read any stephen king since i was a kid but enjoyed this book.  bit more grown up i supose than his old stuff. liked it alot
B005F9CPG8|4.0|I was looking forward to getting this in the mail. I found myself singing along to most of the songs on this CD. I was, however a bit disappointed because there were so many other great songs that could have been put on this disc. It should have been a double disc set, in my opinion. But I don't regret buying it.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I have a hearing disability and use the closed captioning to assist me in understanding the dialogue in the movie.  Is the lack of closed captioning a technical or fiscal problem?  Perhaps purchasing Netflix would resolve the closed captioning problem.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|During the 1979 take-over of the American Embassy in Tehran, six Americans escape and are hidden in the Canadian Embassy.  The CIA hatches a plot to get them out by having them masquerade as members of a Canadian sci-fi film project.<br /><br />What a stunning movie.  It is unbearably tense and the ending left me breathless and in tears.  Director/Star Ben Affleck does a wonderful job and it's all the more harrowing because it's a true story.  John Goodman and Alan Arkin play Hollywood insiders and add a bit of much-needed humor in small roles.  Argo won the 2013 Best Picture Oscar and I enjoyed it very much.
B00A3T5CGU|2.0|I'm afraid that I deleted this app. It does not have my home address on it. Our homes have been here for about 8-9 years so the app is quite outdated.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Was prepared for a miserable experience after all the negative chatter. I loved the first films and feel the same about this one as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read all around. Touches on everything from love to war, and everything in between with nice twists here and there.
0385349947|5.0|I had to write a review while still reading Lean In. So much of what Sheryl has experienced and written about was gratifying to read - why? Because I realilzed how familiar her experiences were to what I and my female colleagues have lived through. Reading about it has helped provide me with a new perspective - so it wasn't just us struggling to get our voice heard. So many women just starting their careers could benefit from this as well. While I can't wait to finish reading the book, I already want to say a big THANK YOU, Sheryl, for your research and perspective and attention to an important topic. Please keep writing and speaking about this!
B000LTAY1U|2.0|This Seiko looks great and keeps good time ... BUT unless you wear it 24/7, the watch just stops cold a day after you take it off. So if you switch watches occasionally, you always have to reset it every time to put it on again. This is not a problem with Citizen watches. They've got some power gizmo that keeps the watch running long after you remove it. No need to reset it again and again.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun game while sitting and waiting around. I usually don't play games like this, but gave it a shot, and not at all disappointed.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|i could not stop watching it. it was riveting and exciting. i love history and the old castles and way of life. its very true to the way things were even when you didnt want them to be. awesome reality. if you are a fan you can not miss this second season. i cant wait for the third. i am one happy customer. colleen marvel
B009DKCBM8|5.0|Just me or anyone else find the hidden track (non bonus) of Cortez the Killer? Three bonus plus the hidden so I gave 5 stars for the entire audio package. I have the WAV files extracted from M2TS playing on the Oppo. Stay Psychedelic my friends!<br /><br />Well...  As for the hidden track one 36 minute HD song expanded into a separate M2TS container.  The lyrics for Cortez start within that container.  Didn't expect Horse Back to be 36 minutes.  Too awesome!
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I love Amazon's instant movies . Fast downloads & reliable. This movie is long so be prepared with drinks & snacks .
B0049U48G4|1.0|While this book may appeal to some readers I feel that the author tried to make the book more bulky by writing stories which didn't add any value to what he was trying to say.
B000PUB9I2|5.0|Wonderful collection of Cabrel's music. Live version of Samedi Soir Sur la Terre is really great. All my friends who listen to this song for the first time, they love it right away and want to know who the singer is. If you are learning to speak French, like I am, his music is a pleasurable way to do.
B008Y6SLL2|2.0|There was really nothing to the story, I know it was a Company like Enron, only because I keep up with CNBC but if you didn't keep up with the news, who would know what this was about.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I hesitated to start these books, and actually didn't read them for a long time after they were suggested to me. The reason is because they were recommended &#34;if you're a twilight fan, you'll love the hunger games&#34;. Well, yes, I am a twilight fan. But knowing nothing about the hunger games, I assumed that it was a vampire story, because of that comment. I am a twilight fan; that doesn't mean I want to read all the vampire stories out there. It took half of the first chapter for me to realize it wasn't about vampires! :)<br />These books are intense. I read all 3 in 3 days, then immediately started them again. Because once I got to the end of Mockingjay I felt like I needed to go back to the beginning and search for a little bit of normalcy. Once I got to the beginning it didn't take long to remember that the &#34;normalcy&#34; lasted maybe 2 pages. But even the second time I read them I couldn't put them down.<br />Ive just finished them for the third or 4th time. I'm a repeat reader when it comes to my favorites, what can I say.<br />Everyone should read these.
0345803507|5.0|Well I am waiting for the next book by this author, it was nice having all the books together so whenI finished one the other was ready to go..  Please let me know when it is published.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I usually play the free apps of the day for a few minutes then uninstall them. A few days later and I'm still playing this one.<br /><br />I already beat it in easy mode on my older (slower) tablet. I'm now playing it on my Note2. It seems to play much faster on the note2 which makes it more challenging.<br /><br />Definitely worth a few bucks. I don't normally say that, either.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I was a little disappointed with the climax. Other than that great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys psychology.
B00942G4UA|5.0|What an eye opener.  The segment about Monsanto suing farmers was incredible.<br />I don't think I'll ever buy a Tyson chicken again.
B009AP2G26|5.0|It's Glee!! need I say more. I don't think so, this is one of the greatest shows on right now!
B001V7SME2|4.0|It was a very good story, scary, but not gory.  I've seen other versions and this one was the best.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|Robben's playing is good.  He keeps his tone so simple and never plays more than he has to.  I loved the trombone and the B-3.<br />He's truly a genius.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing new features and functionality of the most important thing in common with the new version from the university of California press release of the most popular articles in this year
B0015AARJI|5.0|estoy conforme con mi compra de este control y si era lo que Yo queria, muchas gracias por lo rápido del envio, los felicito
B006DLP6JA|5.0|superior, muchiisiimo mejor q lo que antes poseia. De calidad superior y con mejor desempeño en el uso de material multimedia
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a while. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who loves romance novels.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love it. It's fun to play but sometimes when I want to see my friends it pauses.<br />You should buy it!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I AM AN ELEMENTARY TEACHER AND HAVE USED THIS MOVIE AS A LEARNING TOOL.  HERE YOU HAVE A CHARACTER WHO PLAYS A \\"BAD GUY\\" WHO IS LONGING TO BE GOOD AND HAVE WHAT EVERY ONE ELSE HAS, FRIENDSHIP, LOVE, FAMILY, A SENSE OF BELONGING. HE SEES THAT BEING GOOD IS REWARDED ALL THE TIME AND BEING BAD IS NOT.  HE IS LONELY.  EVERYONE SHUNS HIM, HE HAS NO FRIENDS, HE LIVES IN A DUMP, NO ONE SEES THE REAL HIM, JUST THE PART HE PLAY.  IT TOUCHES ON BULLYING, FIRST IMPRESSIONS, STEREO TYPES, BEING KIND TO ONE ANOTHER, ETC .... THIS IS A UNIQUE MOVIE AND IS WELL WORTH WATCHING.  IN THE END, HE REALIZES THAT WHAT HE PLAYS IS A CHARACTER AND NOT WHO HE REALLY IS.  EACH OF US PLAY OUR UNIQUE ROLE IN LIFE, ALL NEEDING EACH OTHER TO CREATE THAT SENSE OF BALANCE. IT IS A VERY WELL MADE MOVIE WORTH WATCHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Best series I 've read.  Five books in three months.  Starting again at the beginning to fill the time until the next book.
B008476HBM|3.0|I have wanted to read this for a long time.  If I had lived in the time period it would have helped me understand some of the story line.  I have to stop and read another book and come back to it.  I will finish it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was hooked from the first page . It's awesome I'm going to read it again. I strongly recommend this one
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Yep, I just couldn't stop once I started. This is the best cliffhanger type series I've gotten addicted to yet since Lost.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|An absolutely spell binding story beautifully told. Must see this movie - outstanding. One of the most spellbinding and fantastic story of art and inspiration.
B00127RAJY|5.0|WOW- I'm 37 and out of shape. My daughter is 17 and in ok shape. My husband is 45 and thought he was in shape.  We are doing this video and it's amazing how in just three workouts we can tell it's working because we all feel BETTER in shape.  Very fun but challenging.  Since it's only 20 mins you feel like you can do it daily
1401206905|3.0|It was on okay read.  I don't read much DC at all, so I don't really know how it compares to its contemporaries.  Also, since most of my Batman exposure is from the movies and Miller's [[ASIN:1563893428 Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]], it seemed pretty much the same as the rest.  Nothing really to make it stand out.  Compared to The Dark Knight Returns, the artwork is much more enjoyable.  It's not really in the same vein as most current books, but it's not as... childish/cartoony as some other big Batman books.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was an entertaining read, but it all seemed like I'd seen it before.  One review I saw mentioned something like, this is where the modern Batman started.  That could explain why it didn't seem too special.  It's what we've come to expect from Batman in general.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This is our third Swivel Sweeper and have loved it in the past. There is no change in the construction and does work well, however, the quality of the battery has deteriorated. It does not hold a charge like the previous ones we have had. You have to recharge it almost daily as in the past it was about once a week. Definately will not buy another.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool is a great read with superb descriptions and well-chosen language.  The story itself is unique and surprising; Howey understands how to build suspense and hold interest.  I really enjoyed it!
0062197266|5.0|I thought this to be a very good book.....especially for the price!  Something that could actually happen to someone.  I think a movie should be made!  Give it a go!
0061537969|5.0|Humans who love dogs should Sit! Stay! and Listen! to this beautifully crafted novel with an ending that draws all the threads together. Unlike &#34;A Dog's Purpose,&#34; also purportedly written by a dog, this canny canine is articulate in his expression of insights into the human predicament and the joys and challenges of undying love.<br />The finest book of its type. Unforgettable. My advice: Fetch! Read!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I think this book was a pretty good read.  Although, sometimes hard to follow, perhaps because I wasn't so riveted, I didn't quite understand who was talking at times.  Loved her novel, &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  Sharp Objects was good towards the end, but found parts of it boring.  Worth a read.  Have read so many books......really goooood books, that I have a hard time rating this high on my list.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I liked this movies ... Amazingly amazing :) ... I enjoyed for the first time Musical Movie! Powerful story about the French Revolution.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|In Business, most people will overlook video quality but the sound quality has to be top-notch.  I'm able to get that with the ATR-3350.  For the price, this is a GREAT buy!
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this version of Jane Austen's great story!  If you're fond of Jane, this is one to own.  Makes me wish for a mr. Darcy of my own!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A lot of action and adventure and many cool devices to fight crime!  A great movie for the whole family to sit and watch!  Bring out the popcorn and sodas cuz it's movie time!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I stumbled upon Lindsey Stirling's music by accident and just fell in love. She has a fresh, new sound that is very upbeat and is guaranteed to make you want to dance.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Action packed and exciting good movie that will keep you awake by all  means this one turns to be one hell of an adventure!!!
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I love these movies I have never laughed so much in my life. I have the first one and the second one and the rd one comes out in May. I will be buying that one for sure to have them all.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I gave Looper 4 stars for the convincing acting of the main characters. I also thought the the cinematography was good, along with the special effects for a futuristic movie.
B003K16P3M|4.0|I'd very much enjoyed reading this book, as a Fantasy fan i would recommend it, though i would have like a bit more of action and more descriptions of the surroundings instead of just focusing on the thoughts of the lead character.<br />but overall is very entertaining and easy to read. I look forward to reading the next installments.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this is the best  I have ever seen.  It gives you many differet books, to keep all kinds of notes on all of you activities  and keep them separated.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I was losing interest in this show last season for the direction it was going, but it seems to be improving as this season continues. Im glad I stuck around.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Purchased as a gift.  I personally like this series a lot.  The person I purchased it for is a big fan too!
B001P59V5Y|4.0|Great film with a lot of reasons to rewatch it to catch more and appreciate the fast pace of the witty comedy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.  I am glad I had the privilege of reading it. Well done sir
B009GED3HS|3.0|I enjoyed the show for a long time, but the last two seasons have been reaaaally phoned in.  Its probably good that it will be ending soon, or so they say.
1616890835|5.0|I loved this book, full of currant and vintage signs, with great interviews of old-school sign painters. If you enjoy sign art, you will love this book!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I enjoy it, despite it being a CW show where no one is allowed to be ugly or without designer clothing. The story is gripping enough to keep me interested.
B008N9AASC|5.0|One time-lapse sequence took 6 weeks for 8 seconds.  A 5 person crew worked absolute magic getting images from 25 countries in 5 continents.  Now THIS is a beautiful way to spend a LOT of money.  I don't know who backed these artists; but I'm grateful that they were supported to the extent that they were free to flex their creative abilities to such a miraculous end.  Watch it!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The first season really hit home with the supernatural and historical referencing, but this time around they just left me hoping that they'd leave this storyline behind and go back to the shows roots.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" is a familiar tasting nut in a whole new shell. Reading this, I felt the influence of a few of the old masters of science fiction. Many mention the influence of Heinlein, and it is there in the combination of fast moving plot occasionally interrupted by interesting essay. Otherwise, not really so much like Heinlein.<br /><br />To the premise of 75 year old retirees suddenly transformed into rejuvenated soldiers, Scalzi brings a lot of empathy.  The conflict of emotions and motivations not only seem plausible, they are correctly thought out and very real. A few places will choke you up, especially if you have lived long enough to hold fast and to care for long time companions, especially decades with a spouse you love deeply. Those sections hit hard, because you've either lived them or know you will some day. And if I had the out that Scalzi's characters do, I'd probably opt for it myself.<br /><br />Back to Heinlein, if you want this book to be a later day \\"Starship Troopers\\" it most definitely can fill that role. There is enough battle and convincingly crafted small unit tactics to scratch that itch. There is life and loss in the units and that feels real. But in reality, it isn't another \\"Starship Troopers\\". To stick it with that tag is not fair to the fine piece of originality Scalzi achieved with this novel. The sci-fi technology is nothing revolutionary. Genetic enhancements, jump drives, advanced human/computer interfaces, smart weapons ... it's all been done, and quite a few times. But in covering ground that is well plowed, Scalzi manages to arrange the furrows in new and interesting patterns that turn this book into a legitimate page turner.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, not a lot can be revealed in a review of \\"Old Man's War\\" without including spoilers, because there are surprises aplenty in this book. Finding out the answers is part of the \\"page turner\\" part, and you shouldn't be denied that pleasure.<br /><br />Highly recommended.mmended.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|A great improvement over Season 2.  While it ended well, I nearly gave up on it and am happy its picking up again. I loved the comics and while it loosely follows it, it was its own series from the beginning and does it well.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't put it down. Just captured me from page one. Follett is a master at reporting<br /> history definitively and developing his characters which some are carried over from<br />&#34;Fall of Giants&#34;. His best yet! (All 856 pages)!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great books, mostly great prices, and another way for you to read them off a webpage or kindle. Just wish theyd be more open-minded with the instant video app!
B007YLEMDE|5.0|Another collection of SRV at his best, working with other great blues artists. Get it and the price is right, you won't be disapointed.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|You could watch this and really understand the feeling and drive of each and every character, or you could sit with others and try to watch it in a theater or opera house and listen to fans sing along like 5 year olds at a Wiggles concert.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Find this game very hard to put down. I keep trying  to better my score and it seems as though the more you play the more active and involved your mind gets. Secondly gets more challenging with each level! So if you're wanting to just play and get it done it won't be a quickly conquered game for sure!
B00AKKS278|4.0|I needed this to fuel my brain and inspire my want to be a productive early riser. Thanks Hal!<br />'
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very addictive. Sadly I had to start all over by pushing wrong button. I was at level 30 until then and never used real money for anything.. Great game..........
B00000J2PH|5.0|You can never go wrong with a Carole King or James Taylor CD.  Music of the 70's is just too cool to forget!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This is a awesome classic, a must for any reader. I found it interesting from the start and could hardly put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses sooo much and I live in the suburbs so I cant get a horse this is getting me by without a real one
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Really had fun with this game.  Hope you make a Wraiths of Eden 2.  Definitely would share and recommend to friends.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play Spider Solitaire daily and I really enjoy this game on my Kindle. it is<br />quickly becoming my favorite game of choice.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A really fun game. Wish there was a sequel. I also wish the game was a little bit longer. The graphics were pretty good. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|very good read...everything is clearly described and it is written<br />so it is easily understood.  I have shared it with a friend and will share<br />it with othersd
B005CRQ4WO|5.0|Los libros siempre han sido y seran mil veces mejor que las peliculas. Es increible poder leer un libro y disfrutarlo de principio a fin.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun game with lots angles to figure out.<br />It is enjoyable to find  the best pathway to<br />the goal.  Lots of fun
B005ZUR724|3.0|who plays this on kindle fire I needa know cause I wanna Buy it but not iif no buddy plays anymore and is there still a monthly fee or is it free Now???&iquest;?????????
0061537969|5.0|Have told all my friends that this book is a MUST READ. All ages can identify with this GREAT story. Thank you, Mr. Stein!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a brilliantly. Good game I suggest. It to everybody and to the hatred of this game emotions. Are your opinion
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I didn't know anything about the Book (never read it at the time) so I came to watching it only because of actor Michael Fassbender. WOW! This film touched my heart and soul! I got butterflies in my stomach, I cried at the appropriate moments and it made me want to read the book which I did and now is my favorite book of all time!<br /><br />So I have Mr. Fassbender to thank for making me find my favorite book of all time!<br /><br />The film is about Jane Eyre(Mia Wasikowska), an orphan who is disliked/hated by her \\"family\\" and is shipped off to a cruel school. She grows up looking for a Governess position and finds it at Thornfield Hall, teaching a little French girl. There she meets the manor owner, Mr. Rochester (Michael Fassbender) and finds what she never expected in her life:love.<br /><br />It is a beautifully directed film that touches the innercore of Jane's soul. Although the novel lets you read Jane's thoughts, it is tried in this film with scenes of Jane pondering in her room or in a garden which are perfect substitution to (instead) the cliched voiceovers. It is a beautiful film that (at the time) left me not knowing what was gonna happen until the end of the film.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK: Watch the film first and if it stikes you as much as it did me,go get the book and happy reading!<br /><br />After reading the book, I love both book and film equally. Some parts in the film I love because they were not in the book and SHOULD'VE been! and other parts which are short in the film, are beautifully extended in the novel. So they play each other off.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game it really is fun and not really bad like I thought it would be for the price
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I loved this story -- it is a wonderfully different take on time travel. Although the book was advertised for young adults, I'm a grandmother and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It ended much too soon.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I thought I would get the series not just one episode. I wish someone would tell me how to get the whole year
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Very good app the best.  I will recommend to everyone else you will love it. Everyone should have it nice app.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I thought it was going to be about the seal team,but I was surprised to see the efforts of the spooks
B0086700CM|5.0|If you are looking for a cardio workout from your chair this is it!  This thing makes my heart race.  ANd I cuss a lot.  LOVE IT but I have to be in the mood.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I had not heard any of the songs prior to getting the CD in the mail today (yes, I prefer to get the hardcopy when available).  So, I was excited to put it on and listen to it all the way through.  I thought the opening song, Welcome to my World, dragged on and on and never broke out.  The second song, Angel, has a nice tempo change and riff halfway through but it never rocked out.  I won't go through the rest of the songs but suffice it to say this isn't as good as Playing the Angel, their best album post-Songs of Faith Love and Devotion.  I'm a true blue fan so I hope the next album, if produced, is better than this.  Look at Bowie's new album...it's worth buying.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|You should also get the tips and tricks companion woth the game.  In the beginning the game is easy but it gets VERY challenging, and unless you know how to build things it is not going to be a game you get through in a week.
B003QSMC18|4.0|It's just not one we would watch again and again.  The characters and the setting are great, but the music isn't the stuff of classics.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|This is a story about kinship, love, and determination.  Great morals!!  Highly recommended for whole family even grandma will love this one!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|The dictionary part is good but I could not get the audio, either input or output to work on my Galaxy III
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book. this book covers so many different topics that are so important. aside from all that....you will love, you will laugh, you will cry....I can't remember the last time that I read a book as amazing as this one!
B003YL4KS0|2.0|Wish I had ordered the paper version, because the translation to Kindle is poor.  The content is jumbled and incomplete on my Kindle.  (I have the original version).  The videos are not supported by my Kindle, which Amazon did not tell me during my purchase.  As for the content of this book itself -- I haven't tried any of the techniques so who knows.  Just wanted potential buyers to know that the original Kindle version is not worth the money, buy the paper version.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is a very fast paced game and a lot of fun.  Hard to stop once I get started on it.
0307961443|5.0|My only regret is waiting 34 years to pick up Kazuo Ishiguro.  Wow!  Like a completely placid pond with millions of creatures underneath.  This book is DEFINITELY not about what it means to be a butler, as other reviewers have stated.  It's about the universal human condition, and it is fiction of the highest order.
B00BEIN9VO|1.0|Dumb lyrics. Can't any mainstream write good lyrics that aren't filthy? Come back MJ. Producers write all the music these days and then you throw in some ridiculous lyrics about hoes and doing drugs. Let's promote healing and health and saving the world and not sending it into the gutter more, please.
B002PEP4QY|5.0|Seems silly to review a book 83 years after it has been written.  anyway, it certainly is more relevant today that since 1966 when the powers that be made most entheogenic, even naturally occurring alkaloids illegal, as now there is finally renewed interest is seeing whether these drugs improve man's lot in life---and a fairly recent Hopkins study has shown that it does, just provides a different framework and experiential component for an individual and basically makes them better adjusted.  This book is important is that we see that serious minded intellectuals used this as well as &#34;dirty hippies&#34;, for different purposes altogether. Bill W., the cofounder of A.A. used LSD for 5 years, many actors artists and musicians did as well to improve creativity, two Nobel Laureates, Francis Crick (the idea of a double helix came to him on LSD) and Kerry Mullin credit the drugs.  Certainly untold advances in computers, film, visual arts, even engineering have come from the cultural impact of these substances.  We are not talking about a drug of abuse, although the propaganda of the govt. contributed to much negative press. I hope to provide a little positive!
B000FCKRDI|5.0|Lisa Kleypas is one of those authors that I worship for. Her books are never a disappointment and I can always expect really really wonderful books. What sealed the deal for me was her Wallflower series. This is my favorite book from the series one that I will probably go back to time and time again. There aren't many books that tempt me into rereading it but this one is an exception.<br />Sebastian is probably one of the most rakish heroes created and Evie is incredibly likable and strong despite being a wallflower and having a stuttering problem when nervous. Rakes and nervous wallflowers always go so well together!! I absolutely love these two and what they go through. Sebastian matures so much and becomes respectable (despite running a gambling den) and Evie grows into herself and becomes a confidant woman.<br />The start of this book happens after Sebastian does something very reckless and desperate. Leading to which Evie goes to his place and proposes that they elope to Scotland for reasons of her own. This book should probably be read in order (it's the third one in the series) because it references to events that happened in the previous book. There are many books that follow the same plot line and characters but this one takes the top. It's one of the best historical romances I have read and if you haven't read it. Buy it and start reading it.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Here's the thing, you'd expect this to be campy bad acting fun ala the old Shaw Bros style movies.  But here's the rub, those movies had fun action sequences.  This movie doesn't have that.<br /><br />So you have bad acting, campy dialog, scenes that are edited all over the place AND low grade wire work, boring and poorly executed action sequences.<br /><br />I was even drunk watching this with friends and it wasn't that entertaining.<br /><br />Save your rental for something more entertaining.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My kids love Eric Carle so already just on the pics they love it. Repetition is great for little ones especially when it comes to counting.  The only complaint I have is that this app could have used a few mini games to kind of mix it up a little. Overall very beautiful app and worth it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome series!  Scary and weird!  Would recommend to anyone who like suspense! Watching season one now of this series.  Can't wait for the next series to start!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This app is pure candy. The music draws you in. The orbs are relaxing and the gameplay makes you slow down and really concentrate on what you are doing. You gotta have this!
0143122916|5.0|Shin Dong-hyuk's incredible true story is the topic of the book. The author relates the horrors of Shin's life in a North Korean prison camp. Shin was born in Camp 14. He grew up in the camp because the Kim dynasty decreed that the families of political enemies were to be punished up to three generations. Shin and his family were forced to subsist under near starvation conditions while being expected to fulfill heavy work quotas. Shin and his classmates were expected to follow the instructions of the martinet of a teacher and inform on other prisoners and their own blood relatives.<br /><br />Shin's relationship with his parents was never strong. He viewed them as rivals for food and privileges. Shin was hardened by the brutality and lack of affection that he witnessed in the camp on a daily basis. He informed on his mother and brother's plan to escape and was partly responsible for their execution.<br /><br />Shin was able to escape with the help of an educated and erudite fellow prisoner who had a greater awareness of life outside the camps. Shin became the only person to ever escape from the brutal Camp 14. Shin had difficulty integrating with the free communities in which he migrated. He emerged from the camp as a damaged individual. Recovery for him has been slow, halting, and with several setbacks.<br /><br />The author did a fine job of weighing Shin's testimony against that of former prison guards and political refugees from North Korea. His coverage was highly credible. Although there are spots where Shin changed his story, the author gave a detailed expalanation as to why Shin became less guarded and more revealing over time. Shin felt a great degree of guilt and remorse for how he treated his parents. At first, he wanted to make himself look better. Over time, he realized that he could only gain redemption through embracing the truth and telling his story to the public. This was a gripping and riveting book that should be read by anyone interested in modern human rights catastrophes.rn human rights catastrophes.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I could not wait til this became a movie, but feared getting my expectations up too high.  I have to say I was not disappointed in the least.  This adaptation of the Broadway play could not have been better.  Yes, there were some weak areas (and performances) but the overall movie was exceptional.<br />After seeing it in the theater, which I would definitely recommend, I looked forward to owning my own copy as well.  When I had the opportunity of pre-ordering it the week before release, I figured, I would save my self a trip to the store after the release.  What surprised me was that I actually received it on the day it released!  That was awesome for me.<br />Not that I was surprised, but the Pack met all my expectations as well.  Watched it that Saturday and spent the day watching all the extras that come with the Blue Ray.  What pleased me about this Combo Pack is that I got both the Blue Ray and the DVD, since I still have an old school DVD player.<br />Have not yet watched with the Director's comments, but that will be my next Saturday endeavor.<br />If I appear to be a fan, I am.  Great deal if you love the movie or would like to know what all the hoopla is about.<br />My children who grew up hearing the sound track told me after seeing the movie - &#34;Now I know what those songs meant.&#34;
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the discipline it gives me to read the Word every day. After a long day at work it is right there reminding me what is more important!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS NICE COSTUMES GOOD STORY LINE PLAN ON WATCHING IT AGAIN SOON AND RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS
B008WCP2KG|5.0|Gift for my adult daughter, as per her request at Christmas. What can I say? Gorgeous , oily, hunky guys, nearly naked writhing to music. Channings dancing is a phenom. Matt McC's performance was great. This movie is funny(at times) and fun to watch. Not too serious. We saw this at the cinema and loved it. But wished more of Channings dancing was in the theatrical cut. Amazing.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Same as others, once you've done them its gets boring and you want more difficult puzzles to do. Fun at the beginning
B005LAIGTG|4.0|Good movie. This was for my daughter as per her request. She loves it. She loves Rachel and Channing, so win-win for her!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Came in less than a week after ordering and in great shape. Seen cartoon version. now to see this one.
B0039USJMY|5.0|I love movies about the Royals, costume and period dramas. This movie is about young love and enduring love. This is one of my favorites. Right up there with The Kings Speech, The Queen, and Pride and Prejudice. The cast is wonderful. This movie is not very long, sadly. I didn't want it to end so soon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best season ever.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. So many surprises in each episode.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was a great series.  Of course Fox has killed almost everything Josh W has written way before it should be, but at least we got a little bit more with &#34;Serenity.&#34;
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I just picked up this series on a whim, not really expecting much, and it turns out I LOVED it! It's full of compelling characters, not just steamy bodice ripping one would expect from a &#34;romance&#34; novel. Great, great series!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I had never heard of Taylor Swift, but I often rely on Amazon reviews to explore new music venues.  She was rated very high by a lot of people, so why not try her.  I found her to be either pop or country, but I also liked how she expressed being a girl in her lyrics. I heard a joke about the number of breakup songs she had.  I didn't understand until I got this album.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was first Nicholas Sparks book to read. Sure I've saw The Notebook but never read anything by him. So glad I read this before watching the movie. Now to go get fit!
B0085PFG1U|2.0|It is a calculator without much zip.  Maybe I don't have a use for it at this time.  I also got the HP emulator and I like it much better.  It might be that is because HP is what I am used to.  Anymore I like to run things in spread sheets to maximize my analyses without re-entering more data, or repeating data sets.  Calculators in general have lost their utility.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I am a Santana fan - have every album. This is one of his best - can't stop playing it.
B004UO0SAO|4.0|I bought a couple of calculators.  This one is the one I like the best, however; I started thinking about calculators and why I even need one.  Most things I do with spreadsheets now days because the QA is such much easier than relying on calculations that are based on an ephemeral calculator.
B006ZCWTV0|3.0|My very first Springsteen album - I think it will take me a little time to get used to it.<br />Its very 'American' for Aussie tastes.
B0031RSBU0|4.0|Another in the great range of the Kurt Wallander series.  Found it to be a short quick read, but I think that is more a reflection on how good a page turner it is, you just can't put it down and just fly through it.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I rated this with 5 stars because it is easily top 5 for my all time favorites.  The characters are easily fallen in-love with and you just can't wait for a second one to be released.  One of the best soundtracks of any movie in my opinion as well.<br /><br />Definitely worth getting for the whole family
1457514508|5.0|This book reminds me of when artwork was being restored in the Sistine Chapel. You've spent your entire life having a vision of what the Sistine Chapel looked like and then slowly, as the original colours and detail emerge, that vision is forever changed.<br /><br />Gordonston is not unlike this process. Although the first images, in glorious medias res, are of a burial--surreptitious as it should be when someone's been murdered--the locale and key members of the tale are defined. Then with great care, the layer over each character is revealed to show its true face.<br /><br />This is an excellent story. The characters are clearly drawn if not from persons known to the author, then persons known to each one of us readers. The story is palimpsestic, it is the story of layers as well as connectivity. And at times, one might think things are too convenient or too close for comfort, but I believe we all know such small world stories.<br /><br />As one reads one cannot help but ask where one's own tragic flaw will lead. This is a mystery (peppered with wry humour) of classical proportions. One misdeed, uncorrected, or one impetuous gesture (Oedipus, did you really have to cut that man down at the crossroads?) and one's fate is sealed. Starting a book knowing someone is doomed is always a good and terrible thing. Reading a book realizing that each of us have often been steps away from doom is scary but exciting. We like to think we know better than that, would react better than that, but we don't always, do we?<br /><br />I know I don't.<br /><br />This book is larger-than-life while being sutured into reality. Would someone really put a hit on someone else for the insult of... well, I'll leave it to the reader. Perhaps. Any quick glance at a newspaper will tell you that yes, grudges do grow exponentially over 20+ years, yes, jealously can foster a rage blinding enough to.... and yes, perhaps that nice little old lady down the street has a secret room in her house which no one enters, not even the dog.<br /><br />Tension. Humour. A tightly woven web pulling the characters in before they know it.<br /><br />Innocent white lies and misunderstandings... that's the path the the everlasting barbecue. You've been warned. Now pick up after your dog, alright? Really. Always pick up after your dog.<br /><br />My only lament with this excellent book is that it ended; but I've been reassured by the author, Duncan Whitehead, that there is another in the works as well as a third novel, disconnected from this series.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is awesome and I love it. Don't lose track of your life with this game.a A's a a
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This has worked fairly well for me. It still has some background noise, but the battery goes a long time and it has proven to be highly versitale.
0316228532|5.0|Not sure why people don't like this book, I found very interesting and towards the end I couldn't put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas and inspiration for anything and everything! Pinterest has EVERYTHING: getting motivated to work out, thinking of changing hair style, figuring out how to put an outfit together, at home projects, decorating your living space, getting a tattoo, holiday ideas, etc. The list is never ending.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this app because it allows you to play with many different puzzles and most are free and come in packages of at least five as far as I have seen. And it is nottimed which makes it even more enjoyable. Get this app! You won't regret it! :)
B007N6NGYG|4.0|I think this game is a great way to spend some time with you kids. My little one loved the bright graphics and it really works your brain to solve some of the tracks! It does suffer from devices with less than optimal performance or touch-screens that aren't as sensitive.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I like kik but my concerns are that there are simply not enough people that can join in a group chat!!! And LOG OUT BUTTON PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|Some great scenes that are maybe too close to home, but lacking action! Acting was maybe a little overdone, but cute. Too slow moving for me presonally, but a couple scenes made it watchable.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|The graphics are good and this game has smooth gameplay. Would love to see more games like this. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The animation was great.  Who couldn't fall in love with this fiery redhead?  It was amusing, suspenseful and quite entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i love this series...i just wish it would download faster.  i recommend it to everyone and watch weekly.  i love norman reedus
B006W0QR1S|5.0|And then there's Ryan Gosling. WHat is not to like about this actor? It's a story that grips you and takes you down an unanticipated path. Very old-school, very dark, but beautiful too. And a great sound track.
B000PAAH3K|4.0|The book started very powerful t then started to drag in the middle but picked up again at the end. Using Thin-slicing to make major decisions did seem a bit radical at first but the case scenarios really put it into perspective and made me think of changing some habitual decision making strategies that I've been using that haven't worked out well for me. Overall definitely worth the read.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It was a good story overall; it kept me engaged. However, the CGI effects took it too far beyond the already fantastic storytelling... Otherwise, I enjoyed it.
B006GECE9Y|4.0|This browser has features that are a little different than Silk. It's It's so easy to enlarge the text. Now I'm able to view the videos that are featured on some of the websites. Using Dolphin is a pleasure!!!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This guy has become one of my favorite mystery writers.  I like the characters he develops.  Clearly not a one-trick pony.  Read it.
B00BYOEZTI|1.0|The sound playback was flawed....  playback through an LG BluRay player...  I have a  consistent fast broadband signal....  the audio of the movie sounded as if it were playing at half speed...  this has happened with no other movie.  I'm wondering if this is related to the unusual nature of the high speed hi-def sample rate at which the movie was produced.  Anyhow,  the movie was unwatchable.  Too bad.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|BRAVO TO THE NEW 52<br />I wasn't sure at first how I would enjoy the relaunch of DC, but fortunately I wasn't disappointed.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|the Blu-ray looks great.  it is so wonderful to get to see middle earth in such detail.  while the extras are a little light on this theatrical version, (more extras will be on the extended versions in the Fall) it was a must have for my collection.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|bought one of these for my boyfriend who is an avid hunter. he absolutely loves it. he loved it so much that his dad asked me for one for his birthday.! they both use these all the time and they dont use any other sharpener. :)
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Just as good as the first time every time.  With Daniel Craig as 007 & Judy Dench as M how can it miss?
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love jig saw puzzles and was trying to find a good app to keep me busy.<br />This one filled the bill. I love it.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I haven't seen this is years but now I have a kid and thought it was time to rent it.  As she is only three she was scared at first but watching it with us gave her courage and then after the first time she had to watch it again and again until the rental expired.  It has action, cuteness, scariness, a warm story, a villain, a hero, everything you could want.
B008AYA7WE|5.0|This is one app that can keep you busy but very addictive.  I cannot believe that I spend hours on this game.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed this movie.  Some of the incidents that happen in this movie we have had to deal with in our own family and some are a comment on modern families.  I think if you like comedy that most people can relate to you will like this movie.  If you are in your 20's and don't have kids or a long time significant other, this probably isn't going to be the movie for you although it might make you think about what is to come ;)  I am not yet 40 but close and have been married ten years, with one 3 year old kid and I felt like part of this movie is really how life is but in a funny way.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|My  husband  and I &#34;found&#34; this movie some years ago on the Biography channel on a Saturday morning. We missed about the first twenty minutes of the original show. However, when I asked a priest for recommendations in books or video, this happened to be the one of his favorites. It turned out to be the show we had watched before and were glad to have the complete biography on disc so we can watch it whenever we want. Great viewing for family and well done.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is a favorite!<br />Don't miss Facing the Giants either- it is the same cast, pretty much.<br />Fireproof is another great flick.<br />All three movies have great God messages and messages on why character should matter.<br />I would recommend this movie for anyone 12 and up.<br />The themes are extremely important for our tween and teen populations but anyone would like this movie...<br />I do not like violence AT ALL in a movie but was able to watch this without much difficulty.<br />It can be a great family film for the kids who are ready.<br />I would buy it again and again.
B008O9V4C2|1.0|Man.......I'm pissed. There is not an ounce of creativity in this entire album. Not a memorable tune to be found save for the 4th cut \\"Weather In My Head\\" which should have been the title of the album! Donald Fagen has basically \\"rapped\\" his way through the entire thing while adding his usual orchestrated bevy of background singers and some funky guitar licks that sound completely out of place! If you are looking for any semblance of the Steely Dan we all know and adore......you may want to sidestep this \\"bleep bleep bleep\\". The only way I'll get to enjoy this is if I can get a refund. What the other reviewers are listening to I just can't say but this is a huge disappointment to me!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I really loved this book.  I gave it 5 stars as the characters had personality and humor.  I cared about all of them.  Enough science to not make you just have to &#34;believe&#34; in the new reality, but not so much that you tuned out and skipped ahead a few pages (like The Forever War for me.)  I liked the portrayal of the older characters - it was very uplifting.  Scalzi's writing style kept me intersted and the actual story was a good mix of personal, military theory and science.  I'm interested enough in the story to read some further volumes of this series.  Can't wait!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a page turner. Great read...could hardly put it down  kept me guessing to the very end..full of sixpence....loved it..
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book kept you interested and you had to finish it.  I was disappointed when the true direction of the book became clear.  I actually really loved the different descriptions of the same events and relationship.  Really resonated with me up until... well you'll know that moment if you read the book.  In the end I'm not sure I really have a true idea of the &#34;truth&#34; for either character - maybe that's the point...  OK writing style.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|I ENJOYED THIS TIME TO TIME MOVIE.  I LIKE MAGGIE SMITH AND ALSO TIMOTHY SPALL.  I  THOUGHT IT WAS AN UNUSUAL STORY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO THE STORY LINE.  IT COULD HAVE  IT WAS ENGROSSING AND TIMOTHY PLAYED IT WELL  AS A YOUNGER BOY.  I FIRST SAW HIM  IN  &#34; CRANFORD &#34;.  HIS PART IN THAT MOVIE WAS THE APPROPRIATE AGE, HOWEVER HE SEEMED A LITTLE OLD FOR THIS PART.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I read this back in college nearly thirty years ago.  Some of the passges have come to me from time to time.  I decided to revisit the book and wish I had done so sooner.  Dr. Peck's ideas and theories are very insightful and helpful.
6304698690|3.0|THE GARDENS WERE TRULY A VERY CHILDLIKE FANTASY FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. I BELIEVE SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THE MOVIE HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN THIS DVD.  IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND KATE MABERLY A VERY PLEASANT LITTLE GIRL GIVEN HER SITUATION. I DO THINK CHILDREN OF ALL AGES CAN RELATE TO THIS FANTASY.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Magnificent acting with outstanding performances all around.  This has outstanding music which will last for a long, long time, it has already been in the theater for more than 25 years.<br />This should have won more oscars than it did, but on Oscar night the rendition of &#34;One more day&#34; by the cast received the best ovation of the night, it said it all.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|So many twists and turns, kept me guessing to the end.  Well written and very timely for a lot of what we see in our society today!
B00BF123WG|3.0|The first half of the movie was boring with little organization shown for such an operation,  The attack looked ill prepared, these lads in real life plan to the last degree to make sure things go right.  The only star is a woman Justin Chastain who was really good.<br />The story could have been directed with a lot more emphasis on Binladen.
B00947N6UG|4.0|I thought this film was just going to be another animated film with high expectations but with no substance. I watched it and I have to say it exceeded expectations. The characters are well developed and each are unique with their own skills and characteristics. The cast is an all star cast as well so thats a plus. If you like animated movies get it or you can get this for your kids!
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I didn't even know that Garbage had released a new CD, so glad I stumbled across this.  It's the same Garbage everyone knows and loves.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I like some Taylor Swift songs not all but I bought this CD because all the songs on it are pretty good. IF you like Swift then this CD is for you
B004GJYROG|5.0|I am glad I bought this, it's a nice blast from my past.  Great movie for kids that know the Looney Tunes, or need to be introduced to them.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|Pretty great deal when I bought this. If you are a fan of the new Batman movies then now is your chance to get all of them in one DVD set. I bought this for my friend and he loved it but thats also because he likes Batman as well as this new Batman
B003K16P3M|4.0|I like the concept of \\"Gracelings\\" . It reminds me of a new spin on mutants. I think she could have been more creative with the names of cities lol but overall I enjoyed the read and I would definitely recommend this to teenage girls...I think it has a positive message about standing up for what is right even when it would be easier to let those you feel superior make the decisions. I think there is also a message about accomplishing the impossible. ....well that's the summarized version anyway lol
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I bought this because I am a fan of Selena Gomez. It is not too bad of a film. It is extremely adorable and cute but it is basically your run of the mill cartoon. But they brought out an all star cast and the animation and creativity of all the characters are top notch. Great for family and kids
B00B2V66VS|3.0|My grandson likes this.  Was visiting him and he took my kindle and found this game and really enjoyed it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie then go watch it!!! If you don't understand Japanese anime then I suggest you don't watch this and if you do don't be like the rest of these ignorant opinionated fools and write a review that gives no legit reason as to why they didn't like it. I bet those people don't even know themselves why they didn't like it. I don't guarantee you will love it but if you don't understand it don't negatively criticize it. Those with unimaginative minds have no right to criticize the works of those with artistic and creative minds. If you think Spirited Away is crap then maybe you should go out and make a movie yourself and see how difficult it is! Hayao Miyazaki is extremely talented and has worked very hard to getting to where he is now for someone to talk smack about his movies without fully understanding them is a coward and a lazy fool.
B004PGO25O|5.0|It arrived as ordered, and on time!!! Thanks!!!! I will definitely order again!!!!!<br /><br />The product is exactly what I wanted!
0345472322|4.0|As the title of the post suggests, this book overused examples and could have been pared down to half the page count. The author had some really amazing examples and studies for readers (which is why I would still recommend reading it), but she tried using in a weird broken up repeating way that exhausted their usefulness. Otherwise, if you're a teacher, manager, coach, whatever, this is a good way to get a new perspective on things, for yourself and the way you work with others.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Was expecting a funny movie (Knocked Up 2) but it was kind of sad.  Couple of funny parts, but not hilarious.  Was disappoint.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|When I'm overwhelmed with something I've read and need a break, Baldacci is always a good choice. The book is well written in the Baldacci style. Short chapters that take you along for a ride. I always have to keep reading because I learn new things about a life style not a part of my world and I don't have to flex my brain. Just enjoyable.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|we watch it all the time its nice to be able to watch it whenever and it was very affordable
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game it's very exciting like ur actually running haha I love it, I have missed my subway stops plenty so if ur riding the subway play cautiously lol
B001UV4XFG|5.0|great buy and affordable too. I love it and my girls are very happy with it too we watch it alot
B005HSL626|4.0|Love it have to b careful of the bombs this game it's very addicting. I bought this b/c I love the car commercial with the pig lol
B008KGWWL6|5.0|There are many recordings of Ravel... But usually all you get is Bolero, Bolero, Bolero.. And then there is the Oistrach Trio recording of the Ravel Piano Trios...  So that leads you to suspect there is something more... and then, there is... Well, this..  the complete works in fourteen CDs...  It is all here.. Piano works, chamber strings, vocal and orchestral works..  and a selection of other artists who were contemporaneous...  A great contribution and worth every penny...!!!  I am very happy with it... a must for anyone who has interest...  So ephemeral.. gossamer like.. understated... so French.. but excruciatingly expressive... YOu have to hear this to believe it!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy playing this game it's a lot better on my kindle its much bigger plus it was free so that's even better
B0067R0APK|4.0|love this ap..does all it claims plus..but, always a but...screen icon is ugly with logo and big red sale<br /><br />banner..why???  come onchange that ugli icon..
0446572985|1.0|I've never read a book by this author so I thought I'd try.  I actually did get to the end, hoping against all hope that there would be something to tie the pieces of the plotline together but it didn't happen. It was far worse that I had anticipated...totally unbelievable and unplausible. What a total waste of time!  I do feel like burning the book! If he's a good author and has good books out there, unfortunately, he ruined it for me.  I will never pick up a book by this author again!  What a bunch of stupid rubbish!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I liked it, it was horribly short, it ended abruptly, but I liked where it was taking me. It drew me in immediately and left me wanting more a whole lot more! If it wasn't good, I wouldn't have wanted to read a novels worth of this story and that is exactly what I wanted after reading this!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I enjoyed this entire album. Every single song is great! I literally listen to it at least 3 times a day. This is a definite must buy!
B009LDXQGW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CD!!! Would recommend buying/downloading this cd!!! All three discs are worth listening too over and over!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Amazing! I love it! Couldn't stop reading it one of the best books I have ever ever ever ever read!
B00BF11STU|2.0|I dont know what to say, is it me, or are movies getting lamer and lamer every year. I cant believe this was nominated for an oscar..... then again... so was Avitar a few years back.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King killed it in this entertaining but yet truly concise memoir. On Writing should go down in history as one of the best writing guides available.<br />It made me realize many things that I was never before aware of. It's witty, straightforward truth grabs a hold of you and the anecdotes about his life path, writing tendencies, and many epiphanies are priceless (or just spend the ten bucks).
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I didn't know if i was going to like this game, but I have become absolutely addicted to it! I am playing whenever I have a free minute! Love IT!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was book amazing. It took me three days total to finish this book chose I was so sucked into the book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I am so glad to have found Wool. The entire existence of humanity, as far as anyone knows, has been reduced to a single population. They carry on their day to day tasks just like the generations did before them. They do the best that they can with finite resources and life isn't too bad until light starts to show through the cracks in society. It turns out that there has been a lot of deception going on to keep things running smoothly.<br /><br />My one criticism of the book (and what keeps me from having the 5 star tingles) is that very early on we know most of the secrets of the silo and have to be patient while the characters find them out. I understand that this is because the first \\"book\\" of Wool was a standalone short story (that definitely gave me the 5 star tingles) and everything else followed serially, but it was certainly frustrating as a reader to only be waiting for what happened next instead of feeling the drive of finding out the next secret.<br /><br />With that said, finding out what happened next was enough to keep me reading all the way through. The plot as a whole was compelling and interesting. I was emotionally connected to not only the individual characters, but to the silo as a whole. I worried about them as if I had a stake in how they turned out. The ending was satisfying yet rather open-ended. I can feel story ideas bubbling in my head, which is what I consider the mark of good world-building.<br /><br />P.S. This would make an excellent television show or miniseries.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been a big fan of zombies for long time. The walking dead season 3 was great! I'm totally anticipating season 4.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Easy to read, can't stop reading it and can be very life changing.<br />Really recommend it to every runner or wanna be runner.
B007SGM084|5.0|GREAT BOOKS!!!! I LOVE TO READ A BOOK YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN. I THINK THE SECOND BOOK WAS MY FAVORITE.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Watched with my teen boys and it was a nice movie.  They were engrossed and enjoyed it.  Would recommend for children or family watching.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I like it very much.  Very lightweight and protects my Kindle just as was needed.  Fits in my purfse just fine
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love love love this series and reading it for the 5th time! Hope next book after Mark of Athena comes out soon!
B00701L5XS|5.0|Use this app for Cub Scouting.  Very easy to understand.  Makes a great addition to knowledge base.  I would highly recommend.
B000FA675C|5.0|This was an enjoyable read with interesting notions. It was engaging in that I listened to it over the course of about three days. I would recommend it to folks that are into mysteries and culture. Have fun!
0763644765|5.0|This is the potty book that worked for our daughter.  She loved reading it before she started potty training, and then she asked for it while she was on the potty, and then also wanted to read it again at night and talk about her own potty experience.  When she started using the potty regularly, she yelled different lines from the book, and she likes to point out where the dog & cat go, etc.  This one really seemed to work for her, and it's super cute.
0593070631|5.0|This book takes fans so much closer into the lives of the boys and really creates a more personal connection with each of them. You will laugh and you will cry. A must read for any McFly fan!
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|I like this book. This series of books are good for any age group to read! I give this book 3 stars!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Luv this movie, just wish there were more extras in the regular DVD as I don't have blue ray yet.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|This was a great love story, but at time  was a little jumpy from story to story that it made it not so easy. But.  Great story of what family really means and love
B009GED3HS|5.0|While channel surfing i came across &#34;The Blitz&#34; episode of How I Met Your Mother, during Thanksgiving 2012.  From that episode I was hooked. When I made it back home I searched netflix for the series and to my luck, seasons 1-7 were available.  The rest is history.  I don't even have a cable network, but I make it my business to keep up with the latest episodes via amazon.  I think its well worth the $1.99.  This show is great for anyone looking for great romantic comedy, with enough drama to keep it from going overboaard.
B000IKQK7E|5.0|Amazing movie with a spectacular cast.  I have a daughter that hadn't seen the movie yet so we rented it and both laughed constantly for 2 hours.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hesitated reading this book because the movie looked really cheesy.  The book, however, was completely honest and well done.  I was entertained from start to finish and the characters made me feel truly invested.  It's also not often that you get a big smiley happy ending anymore.  Loved it.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was okay,and was funny at some parts.I feel bad for Greg in this book.I still recommend getting this book!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Sneaky. Dark. Frustrating in the best way possible.<br /><br />Flynn creates a world for her readers filled with unpretentious twists and turns.  The ending shocked me and left me thinking for a long while after.
0859537978|5.0|great beginning book for babies and pre k aged children,Its easy for them to hold on to and great for mommy and me time.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Absolutely one of the most addictive tv series out there. HBO has truly outdone themselves on this one. And it only keeps getting better! Of course if you enjoyed season 1 this second season will completely blow your mind.<br />After watching the first season it made me want to read the books which are just as amazing as the show. They pick the perfect actors/actresses to match the characters and they play them amazingly well.<br />I hardly ever pay for a physical copy of movies or tv since you can pretty much download anything for free these days, however this is one series I gladly will support and pay for.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was much better than Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I have always enjoyed survival stories a little green Friday would have been nice.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham never fails to deliver and The Racketeer is no exception. I always want to finish Grisham novels after reading the first chapter. Could not put this book down until reading the last word!
B000P0J09W|1.0|I remember really liking the Goonies, but it was many years ago.  Today wasn't a great day, so I decided to watch it.  Amazon said I could watch it instantly if I bought the DVD.  I have done this many times before, and love the feature.  So I have the DVD to watch later, but can watch it instantly for a few bucks more then the rental.  Not tonight I guess because the instant video is not in my library an hour after purchase, and it's getting to late to watch it now.  I will retract this review if the issue is fixed for me, but until then it will stay.  Just want to warn anyone planning on watching the instant version.
B006QSL9XC|5.0|I didn't know at first it was almost 4 hours!!!! but, I love the movie.  Gives you a good perspective on how the war was back then, regardless if north or south.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fine. Just solitaire on your computer. The only problem is all the pop up ads that come with it. I may have gotten past them all but if they continue I will probably delete the game. Not interested in ads every time I try to do something!
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for more than a year and have not been so excited about an album since Rob Dougan's Furious Angels or anything by E.S. Posthumous.  In short, I am jealous of anyone hearing this album for the first time.  It is an epic album with beautiful sounds colliding with heavy beats almost tribal-like, all flirting with Woodkid's simple vocal style and dark lyrics.<br /><br />The album does not disappoint, it is epic, it is different and it is a beautifully told story of a child growing up.  Please buy it, and please tell your friends about this album, it is rare to have such an explosive artist who can engage the imagination so well.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun but takes to long to upgrade on certain things.<br />Wish I could get more paper $ faster and not have to buy them with real $ !
B004P8JPS6|3.0|hoping it is far fetched!  It keeps your interest but seems to be a bit<br />unbelievable.  worth reading for enjoyment
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a fun book to read.  I had to keep reading just one more chapter before putting it down for the night.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The Rebirth of the Series is Awesome.  It is not as cheesy as the prior versions which were not bad.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The characters are round and fascinating, I am simply delighted by this series.  Many years ago I adored Upstairs, Downstairs, but found the Downstairs far more interesting than Upstairs.  Both parts of the household in this series are riveting !
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|HO sections were not very challenging. There was no other things to interact with in the HO scenes.A little more action would have made this game more challenging. G5 games usually are more thought provoking. Well, maybe next time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game. Totally addictive, love to play it all the time. I play it at home while I have down time, to help unwind and relax on my days off and after work.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|I sort of felt like I do when I go to a zoo and visit the snake house.  Creepy and sometimes pretty and gratefully  behind thick glass.  I watched most of the first two episodes and decided it was the same thing over and over again and too violent for my taste.  Then I watched the last episode to see if Vic received major pay back.  Poor little Vic.  A desk job and has to wear a tie -- SOOOO sad for him.  In the big picture:  Not enough pay back except he can't see his family anymore (lucky for them!!!).  What a monster.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Second half of this season hasn't had the punch that I was hoping for.  I would even say that the 2nd season is better than the 3rd...even though that doesn't seem to be the consensus.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love the &#34;boys&#34; , even Louis.  The continuous story line necessitates having the entire series to get the full effect.  Plan on buying the second season when it is released.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I can see how people without kids might not \\"get\\" the humor, but as parents ourselves, we thought this movie was hilarious. Well done!
B0054JELS4|5.0|Couldn't risk it going off the air without my having secured the whole lot for rewatching over and over.  The shows are just as good the second, or third, time around.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Initial levels are pretty easy but it does get progressively more difficult. Simple and addictive. Enjoying the brain workout. Highly recommend.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What a great movie...sat on the edge of my seat the whole time and then that unexpected ending..cannot wait for the next one...then the next one....this a watch over and over forever film..just like my lord of the rings collection..love love love it...
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|After hearing the first two singles that were released ahead of Comedown Machine, I wasn't sure if this was a Strokes album I'd fall in love with.  I can say safely after 7 listens, this is a really great record that does NOT disappoint!<br /><br />On first listen, the opening track Tap Out was still leaving me in a bit of doubt if I'd like what was to follow.  From hearing the singles and this song, it was immediately clear that Julian is trying to expand his vocal range.  Overall it works on this song, and while I don't think it's destined to be 'one of the best Strokes' songs ever', it is catchy and a good opener.<br /><br />I feel similarly about All the Time, that while it's a good song, it's nothing spectacular.  One Way Trigger is the stronger and more original single, which really finds Julian utilizing his falsetto range while being backed by peppy electronic music that has an 80s retro-feel to it.  This song would not have been out of place on Phrazes for the Young.<br /><br />Things progress nicely with Welcome to Japan, a choppy song with a cool chord progression that immediately grabbed me.  Like the previous track, there's a little bit of an 80s feel to this one (dare I say a little Duran-Duran vibe is present here?).<br /><br />80s Comedown Machine (the title-track, I suppose) is soft and dreamy and a bit melancholy.  It's a nice change in pace and a nice way to wrap up side one.  However, at this point I found myself asking - where's the rock?  Side 2 rectifies that situation immediately!<br /><br />50/50 starts with a rocking guitar lick, and as soon as the drums kick in, you'll be bouncing off the walls.  The chorus is a bit punky, with Julian sounding rough and raw.  This is more in the style of the old Strokes we all know and love.  A stand out track, for sure.<br /><br />Slow Animals continues what seems to be a theme of this album, Julian channeling his inner-Motown and giving his falsetto range its all.  I admit, at first I wasn't sure he waspulling it off, but now I know he is.  This is another catchy tune, and while not as mellow as 80s Comedown Machine, it still (to me, anyway) has a slightly sad vibe.<br /><br />Partners in Crime starts with a cool twangy guitar part, and when everything kicks in, it's clear this will rock.  It's more straight-forward than a lot of the other songs on here.  It's bouncy, it's poppy, it makes me smile - it's the Strokes!<br /><br />Chances is yet another laid back, synth driven, and pretty depressing song.  It's the type of song you'd listen to after a break-up and cry your eyes out.  Again, Julian hits some high notes on this one, and by this point I'm convinced he's doing it well.<br /><br />Happy Ending is a song I'm still not completely 'wow' about.  While certainly not bad, I feel the other material is better.<br /><br />For me, a true highlight is how the album ends.  Call It Fate, Call It Karma has a strange 50s jazzy vibe to it (equipped with falsetto vocals, of course), and the production matches!  It sounds like you're listening to this one on an old and scratchy phonograph.  The results work well.  It's a beautiful song and the perfect ending to a terrific album.<br /><br />Some bands peak too soon.  There is no doubt that 'Is This It?' was a special album, and the chances of The Strokes releasing something as good as it are very slim.  But that's only because you can't easily create a flawless master-piece; it's a shame that The Strokes constantly get held to an impossible standard.  I am so happy to have new Strokes music, and feel this album is a nice progression.  While the production and music isn't as bare-bones as their early stuff, I feel they utilize synths and effects in a way that always suits the songs, and they never over-indulge.  I also like how on this album it seems each song was approached with a 'wahtever works for THIS song, we'll do it' attitude.  The production varies a bit throughout, but in a good way that suits each track perfectly.While I'm not sure any track herein stands up against \\"Under the Cover of Darkness\\", I do feel overall that this is a much stronger record than Angles.  The songs flow better overall, and like with all Strokes albums, many of what I will call 'my favorite Strokes songs' are present here.  An excellent album that only gets better with each listen!
B005LAIIHG|1.0|This film may have been visually nice to see..but where is the story line..blab..no thanks..wont purchase.......perhaps a good time filler for a junior high class.......
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it.. its so life -like and realistic (: ... i recommend it to all horse lover's and anyone who likes games where you take care of animals and stuff.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Great story and I love the cinematography. A little hard to see at times but I think that was by design. I enjoyed it very much.
B005K17RU0|2.0|New update is awful.  I'll be changing to a new app as soon as possible.  &quot;If it ain't broke-don't fix it!&quot;
B00BP29SAA|5.0|This is great, and very easy to use. The kids get to let customers into their store, the customers always come with a child. Then the customers all need different things: coffee made, help selecting candy, help finding things on their list, help checking out, in the parking lot the kids can gather up the carts, and at the end the kids can help get the customers out of the store and into their cars with the items.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a fun little game that can be played quickly.  No skills are involved in playing the game.  On the free version you have to wait until the hearts reload in order to continue to play the game.
0812992784|5.0|He's a great writer with a wonderful voice, and entertaining if somewhat tragic story, and from the time I picked the book up to the time I finished it entirely I only put it down to eat sleep and attend to other necessities. It's a fabulously well-written book. If you enjoy Rushdies' other work, or just want a good memoir pick this up!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Navy seal account of Zero Dark Thirty.  Read this one after American Sniper and Damn Few.  Right in line with the others and like the others I picked it up every change I got.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|all aboard! This is a very interesting and fun game, a must for nostalgic train lover's. If you miss the switches, prepare for epic crashes!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Bosch can't wait til he works his first case with his daughter.  That will be a great book.
B004H6G0TI|3.0|Great game and concept but, you have a very limitied area to fly and you hit invisible walls on each side of the screen that make you stall you engine. If the game would allow for free fly from end to end, this game would recieve a 5 STAR rating
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good story with what I thought was a good ending!<br />I didn't see the ending happening and I'm excited to see the movie.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This is an awesome game you can do quests and earn money then buy new weapons and level up. It is multiplayer and you can fight others but you have to have a gameloft account and you can only play with other kindle fires. This game is fun but it gets boring sometimes and you need Internet to play. Still I enjoy it and like the style.<br /><br />Other comments say that there is an update and this game is terrible but the update is passed and if you redownload the app or get it after this review is posted it will work perfectly. Ignore the other reviews this game rocks and I like playing fighting games.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Loved it love it still play and kickin butt gotta write 20 words so still love it and still playin you can play offline thats the best ppart
B003F29D44|3.0|I watched it as an ethics course requirement.  Being from 1987 it was, of course, dated because of the advances in technology since them.  However, it was still enjoyable and offered a good story.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child can spin one he'll of a yarn.  I was 40% done with it and the fast paced action sounded like he was wrapping things up, but luckily for this reader it wasn't the case.  Can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love Fringe! It's my chill out after a long day. Really enjoying catching up from the beginning. Looking forward to seeing more episodes.
B009K0P10K|5.0|What can I say...I haven't missed an episode yet. I hate those Graysons :) and love seeing what Amber is going to do next.
0765342294|5.0|Shipping was quick and the product is pristine. I had to have this so I could reread it before the release of the movie. This is a piece of true Science Fiction Genius.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Seems to be a good game. Just getting started.Will come back later to give a more in-depth opinion. Hard to go d twenty words to describe or review, have only been playing five minutes.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I saw this was available I had to have it. It has been nearly a decade since I last watched this series and I still consider it one of the best ever shows ever made.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Low violence, free,does not give good instructions although my 7year old grandson was able to play with out any problem.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Good story, but kind of unreal. The flawed hero who finally admits how needy he is, something we can relate to
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I loved the movie, my playback has been stopping after about 1 hr. 15 min. on movies. I've updated, uninstalled, reinstalled flash as directed, now it won't play at all. Unfortunately it was while I was playing this back for the kids- aaarrghh.<br /><br />I'm a computer tech and Linux server admin now in school at NMSU Engineering College for Solar and Renewable resources, I was embarrassed.<br /><br />BUT, I loved the movie that at least I saw...
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Great production, wonderful scenery, great story, I would call this an epic film...romantic adventure, wonderful settings, I miss seeing this movie at the theatre....glad I bought it.....I could never get bored review it again and again...
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I thought this film would have been really funny considering I loved Knocked Up. I found most of the move to be nothing but a F bomb. There was only one scene that was actually good and I believe that is what they used in the previews. Sadly, this was a bit of a waste of time to watch and hoped it would have been better. I'm just happy I only spent $4.99 to rent it rather than buying it or seeing it in the theater.
174179403X|5.0|Really great book with good advices and after reading this book I have changed my plans and I´m looking forward to go Georgia in summer.
0736083863|5.0|I am a Pilates teacher of 11 years and it is a nice addition to my professional library.  Thank you.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Such a good and quick read, it really keeps you engaged. The character development is very good. A must read!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case does what I tell it to. It's really obedient. It smells nice, like leather, and isn't too hard to rotate. the stand works pretty well, and that MAGICAL ON/OFF OPEN/CLOSE FEATURE?!?! woah. Also my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; fit in PERFECTLY with no fuss, and it fits in snugly with no problems. THANKS MARWARE!
B009ME47H2|5.0|What I really liked about Easy voice recorder was that the sound was so clear whenever I recorded anything! It sounds great, and it is super easy to use! Love it!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I will admit that when i first saw the trailer for this, i misjudged this movie. I thought to myself \\"what a ridiculous looking  movie.\\" But recently I found out I was completely dead wrong about this Film. I do not know where to begin. Suraj Sharma plays the title character Pi and he does it realistically. Pi is everything I would hope to be in his situation: brave, courageous, and daring. This movie also proves (and does a really good job at it) that help can come from the most unlikely ally. That being said, the storyline is top notch in this film and it is deeply moving. The supporting cast is good, but the surprise in this film (and i think many will agree) are the effects and visuals. Ang Lee Deserves not only a tip of the hat, but in my opinion he deserves a standing ovation for making such an enjoyable film. Quoting one of the lines from the film \\"I was told you have a story that would make me believe in God,\\"  And in my honest opinion, this film has done that and so much more. 5 stars
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase. Jillian Michaels is a great trainer and after two weeks of working on level one, I am seeing results.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game it so addicting! Everyone in my house plays this games!  We try to beat each others scores. It is so uch fun
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Not at all happy with the customer service. Games freeze FREQUENTLY!! Very difficult to earn enough credits to adv to new games without spending a lot of real $$! The same shadows appear over n over again. Winning the htg's in slots is way too difficult and it's easy to blow thru several hundreds of thousands of credits just to finish a slot room. This game has some good qualities and is really fun to play when it's working properly...it's just such a shame that the customer means so little to them.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it it is addicting.  Fun to play while you are waiting at appointments or on the train etc.  It is fun for the whole family.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|Nice and aggresive album from Paradise Lost, i like a lot.. the booklet is so nice. Paradise lost Rules forever
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|Could'nt wait for this to come out since i loved Hurt Locker so much, that after renting it twice i finally bought it.  {Jeremy Renner was robbed at the oscars} but unfortunately this was another movie that did'nt live up to the hype. First of all it was almost impossible to understand the actors. I had to constantly stop and rewind hoping to figure out was was being said. {never could.} Secondly, did the director plan that the movie was completely about torture? Because that seemed to be the entire plot. And Jessica Chastaine never did anything to show she was the star of the movie. after awhile i was just noticing her hairstyles because i was so bored with her. Jason Clarke should have been the lead, he was a thousand times more interesting. The only reason i stayed to the end was i wanted to see them kill the bastard. The only reason i am giving the movie two stars i that the end of the movie was excellent. Finally, it became the movie i was expecting. My recommendation is, rent the movie, watch the first half hour then fast forward to when the S.E.A.L.s come into the movie. Take my word for it, you won't miss a thing.
B000001ELR|5.0|Creatures of the night, one of my favorites albums from KISS along with Music from Elder, Dressed to kill, Kiss, Rock n roll over. a very blowing mind classic!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I've listened to a few tracks also, but this was a Christmas present for my Mother, primarily.  She now is looking for the Duets #1, as this one was so good!

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This album is excellent, I heard it on Spotify and I knew I had to buy it. The case is very nice and the lyrics sheet is very colorful. I am more than pleased.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We loved both seasons of this show and cannot wait for season 3.  The acting as well as the plot was great.  Maggie Smith was given the best lines.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Great device. Charges rapidly. Excellent quality. Cord resists tangles. I recommend this product. I need seven more words so I can stop.
1416511946|5.0|So Amazing!  Was very well written.... I love Nikki even more now.  Highly recommend this book. I read it twice.

B000CCBCAS|5.0|Still fun to watch after many years. I like it when it cam out and stll do. Typical Hugh Grant movie but it is a good one.
0553801473|4.0|Nobody has any reason to read this unless they read the previous 4 books. At this point in the story, sometimes Martin seems to throw in odd twists just for the hell of it. Without any spoilers, I will say that these twists too often involve the death or resurrection of an important character.<br />Maybe he's trying to keep us wondering, maybe he's trying to tie up loose ends. The cumulative effect, over the course of thousands of fantasy pages, is an erosion of the story arc, and increasing skepticism (from the reader) about what significance any of this has. Maybe this is the author's intention, to portray the meandering, trivial, meaningless existence of these societies. The problem is that as the books' world becomes more meaningless, the book itself seems less significant.<br />This is a relatively minor complaint. The book is very well-written, the characters are fascinating, the world is immersive and eerily reminiscent of our world, in ways that constantly surprise you.<br />Much better than the work of any living author in the fantasy genre. Better than most of the dead ones, too.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Picture quality was good would get HD but the connection thru playstation is not as good as it used to be.
1582701709|5.0|Excellent book, very good advice. I enjoyed all of authors. I would recommend it to friends and family.  I will reread the book over and over.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Picture quality was good would get HD but the connection thru playstation is not as good as it used to be.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|The transfer of this film to Blu-Ray is done with great care and attention to detail.  I've seen &#34;Singing&#34; in 35mm and in my mind this Blu-Ray is a high fidelity recreation of that experience.  The choices that the director and team made back in the 1952 are preserved and presented exactly as they chose.  I never once got the feeling that a 21st century technician was over riding Mr. Donen.  And that is all you can ask of from a Blu-Ray.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|im not a huge reader but i loved this book! i loved it so much that when i went to go and see the movie i hated it so much! this book holds true to books are better then movies! amazing book anyone should read it!
B007N31ZLA|5.0|This is a beautiful rendition of a great movie.  I won't cover the actual movie since there is no point in that.  But I will talk about the Blu-Ray itself.  The picture is vivid and clear.  The scan/transfer is immaculate.  It feels like you are watching it as it was seen in its original theatrical release.  Previous DVDs transfers were a little too dark.  Not this one.  Whatever faults you may have with the film are from the original production.  Also, the sounds is excellent and the subtitles are accurate and unobtrusive.  Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you have the patience, it takes a little while to start getting money,but once you get into the game, it's hard to put down.
1608193381|2.0|The book is clearly more sensible than what passes for \\"economics\\" talk these days in the media - sloganeering.  However, it ultimately falls short because it is similarly ideologically driven as what it tries to debunk - the conservative economic orthodoxy.  The 23 things fall into 3 categories: (a) fairly obvious, but here to challenge the conservatives, (b) true, but used in a way that is twisted and flawed, (c) fundamentally incorrect.  An example of the first is prosperity doesn't necessarily trickle down.  An example of the second is rich country's income are higher because immigration control, not just because their citizens are more productive.  However, he then uses its mere existence to justify it - because it is so, it should be so.  He claims that economic systems are a function of its political underpinnings (which is true), and the way it is now - immigration control, should be the way it is (which is not true).  Under this paradigm, he naturally progresses to conclude a variety of claims under the third category, patently incorrect: that trade is bad (some will lose jobs), protectionism caused prosperity (US and UK), free trade led to UK's down fall (relative shrinkage of world's GDP), government can pick some winners (if they pick all losers, you would wonder how do they manage that).  The refutation of all these false claims would take too long and I do not intend to go into it.  Suffice it to show one example how his own deductions led to absurdity: he concludes that, Stalin, by suppressing farmer income, built the industrial base that defeated Germany, which is really what saved European freedom.  Part of parcel of that argument also assumes investment will always be good, because, well, investments lead to growth.  Left to the market, who knows surplus wealth will be invested or not, but left to Stalin, well, he will definitely invest.<br /><br />That said, the author did make a few interesting points worth thinking about, one of which is that limited liability allowed mass capital formation, but at the same time led to short term behavior; another is the agency problem of corporate management, head I win, tail you lose.  So worth a read, but keep your eyes open.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Better than the original looks great and is very addicting. Highly recommended it's guaranteed fun  for all ages it's a must have!!
B000J233SK|5.0|Loreena just rocks it. Pitch perfect and great selection of material. Haunting, melodic, evocative, a real must. if you love Celtic music.
B001NTZV4W|5.0|Brings back memories of the symphonic rock classics from the 70s. This album won't disappoint to the Rick Wakeman and Yes fans out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great story that I couldn't put down until Igot to the flat ending.  Then I felt duped, and couldn't feel anything about it excepted I wasted some reading time.
1579129129|5.0|I bought this book as a present for my sister and she loved it, spent hours going through its pages. the skulls are really interesting, lots of stuff we didn't know.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very easy down to Earth read. Much like Zero Dark Thirty but so much better from his POV. Highly recommend.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I have not stopped looking at this moving since I bought it. I LOVED it. The music is really good. the characteres are engaging even if they are college stereo types, Thank god for digital copy, its on my computer.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy this game, I use to play it on my pc,  but I was not that quick , but now I have it on my kindle I'm quick quick and enjoy it much more, play every day at least 3 times or more. Thanks for putting it on the kindle.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Cleverly written. Kept me hooked until the end with wanting to know what would happen next. Interesting and smart  main character.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I thought this film was quite simply brilliant,Daniel Day-Lewis pulls off one of the most memorable characters  in recent history.Daniel Plainview is what makes this movie which boiled down to it's core is a character study,there are many theories as to what this film is about,some have said it's about madness,religion,oil,capitalism,spirituality etc.And they are probably all right,the film is intentionally ambiguous and is very open to interpretation,I look forward  to seeing it a second time to get more from it.One of the biggest discussion is about Plainview and his adopted son H.W,does he truly love him or not,it really is hard to tell as Daniel is VERY complex,but if I was to say then I'd have to say yes he does love him,now I'm not 100 percent on that judgement but I think I'm right.There is no Good Vs Evil concept in this,Daniel and Eli are basically the same,both con men out for their own,Eli uses religion,Daniel uses oil.Both sacrifice their beliefs for power and money as evidenced by the scene where Daniel gets baptised so Bandy would give him the land even though he doesn't believe in god and Eli a snivelling coward who truly reveals himself for the wimp he is at the end when he calls god a superstition and himself a false prophet so he can get money from Daniel in the infamous \\"Milkshake\\"scene,The time jumps a lot,the entire film spans 28 years,people have commented that it goes on  too long and I think they must be crazy,I would happily watch another hour,just so I could find out more about Daniel Plainview,now to DDL's performance which truly deserved the oscar,he played the role so well you'd actually think that he was Plainview,with his recent oscar win for Lincoln DDL will go down as one of,if not the greatest actor of our time,not to say that talent goes with how many oscars you've won but it's good to know that his talent is appreciated.I guess as others have said you'll either love it or hate it,I for one love it,I think the haters are entitled to their opinion as we all do but I think they just don't like it because its unconventional,there is no Good Vs Evil,mostly just the power and greed of men which is a true reflection of the world that we live in today,so just give it a try,to see something a lot different from the typical Hollywood garbage nowadays.
B006LSZECO|3.0|.I thought the language was crude and not necessary as it did nothing to add to the storyline.  I think it does a good job of portraying a sociopath.  I would recommend it to someone who is interested in deviant behavior.  It was a little too &#34;dark &#34; for me and no redeeming qualities for either of the protagonists.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|The last film of the trilogy and the weakest by far,way too overhyped and is just quite simply boring.The plot is laughable and it seems Nolan just wanted it over with,it's a Batman film with like 20 minutes of Batman,Bane is good,not great but good as it would be a hard act to follow in Ledger's footsteps.Catwoman should have not even been in it,but she's there so Bruce can live happily ever after.Alfred and Lucius are hardly even in it which is disappointing and Miranda Tate was just there to serve as a plot twist,her death scene must be in the all time cheesiest moments in film history.And the ending,don't even get me started,it's so ridiculous and so Hollywood that it just cheapens the whole film in a way,there has been a gradual decline in the series,Batman Begins was fantastic,Dark Knight was great but this just falls flat for me,the plot holes are too much to bear and it just comes across as lazy,disappointing end to a great franchise.<br />P.S How bad does script writing get when the hero gets his identity blown as Batman simply because of the \\"Look in your eyes\\",I mean are these  the same people who wrote Begins and Dark Knight.Not impressed.
B000HZED8S|4.0|This movie is very entertaining and different from anything easel. If you like movies watch this one. I watch it every few weeks.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Completing the series for the grandchildren.  Everyone loves to watch it so I love it tooo.  family time on Saturdays
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved how it picked up right where the 1st book left off! Such a great book! Lots of great images !
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My husband and I really liked this movie. It had a good story line that caught my husbands attention as he was walking through the room. I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys animation and retro video games.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's performance and directing skills are amazing!. He, along with his all start cast, bring Hamlet to life as if we were there and lived in those times. After just a little while Shakespeare's diction and rhyme become as familiar as our current English language with the brilliant elocution of his prose by the actors. You will recognize many a now very famous face in the cast.  Whether a student, teacher, or just an interested reader, you will find this production worth the time (4 hours) and attention.  Watched it with my wife, an English teacher, who recommends it to her students. Enjoy.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|No, I don't walk the streets or sit at the dinner table with earphones on ... but ... I feel as though I am \\"inside\\" the movies I attend and even \\"inside\\" the TV studios  of my favorite talking heads, concerts or activities that I watch on TV. The first time I wore it to the theater, the feeling was beyond simply what I might expect from improved hearing.  Everything was personal and powerful.  Well worth the price -- and, oh yes, easy to operate with simple volume control.
1616550414|4.0|The printing is pretty good, vivid colors and no visible economy on the process. The paper is solid and it looks great. Colorful printings tend to shine a little more then I would like when reading light is upon it. The whole product looks great, but I'm not so sure it'll look great 5 years from now dispite my care. The cover laminated printing may peel off and the green paper that envelopes the cover already came with some minor bends, that when you look at it closely, you see that's unevitable, dispite the care you have while handling. But no big deal, I'm just being analytic. The overall is just amazing, no Zelda faz should pass on this.
0061906220|5.0|She can't read yet, but she memorized all the words, on all pages, and repeats the story over and over again. Excellent book, and really fun to read with a great message. You can go online and download the story read by the author, and it will show you how to sing the songs inside the story! great!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of the best films I have seen for a long time. A prime example of a good family movie that you don't have to worry about seeing with your children.
B001BW02B8|5.0|I like this album as much as Songs About Jane.  It's definitely worth buying the whole mp3 download... really good album.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|What can I say.  What a voice.  Michael Buble is phenomenal and its fun to watch him perform.  He has a cute sense of humor.  Always a fan.  Not enough of this style of music anymore so he is refreshing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I wanted the &#34;truth&#34; about the greatest mission that took a decade to complete. A story from someone that was willing to provide details without the fluff. It's an eye opening experience to read about the training, dedication and the sacrifice it takes to be one of the greatest elite forces in the world. A specialized group of men that wanted nothing more than to complete the mission they are given. This story is compelling from the beginning. I believe this is the closest we will ever get to the truth of taking down Osama Bin Laden and the real men that deserve all the credit for doing so. May God Bless them all now and forever.
B001O1O71C|5.0|That was an amazing twist at the end and I'm really thinking about how this actually happened to jews. Great book
B0057XMCLA|3.0|I've seen this movie a couple of times before in years past and remember thinking it was really good and couldn't wait to see the next in the series. When I found out the film series would not be continued, I decided to read the book series to find out what happens next. After completing the first book, I decided to watch the movie again. WOW!!! What a difference! I was SO DISAPPOINTED - from the beginning to the end. I love watching movies, but I agree with those who choose to read it instead. The book series is so much better.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this one because my book club was all excited about it. It was ok in my opinion. The end was disappointing. It's not the type of book I'd choose myself, I'm more into memoirs, so take that into consideration I suppose. The plot lines did remind me of a couple real-life cases, which I liked, but overall I wasn't WOWed by this book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is the most down to earth, real book I've ever read that was written by a soldier.  It really conveyed Chris' thoughts and feeling in an earthy way.  This book covers the constraints placed on soldiers and the lengths they must go to ensure they a not charge themselves.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|fun and colorful crashes when connecting to facebook. rts is well done but it's a bit over the  top for adults yo play.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|Initially the story was slow - but don't give up as the story is compelling, riveting and truly revealing.  To read first hand what Marcus endured is pronominal.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a history or interest in military events.  I would also recommend you read 'American Sniper - Both stories will open your eyes.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Super fun movies! Perfect addition to my collection. Comes with 3 actual blue ray disks that play in flawless quality. Fast ship, worth the money.<br />Amazon is the best and my favorite place to shop! :)
B004K00NMG|5.0|I already had a previous copy, but I guess I played it so much it broke. Hence the new one.
B008476HBM|5.0|A pleasure to read intricate love stories, with the language of the Victorian times. A story that happens in our everyday life, without the sirs and lady's...
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|If Jeffery Archer is not going to write another volume to this trilogy, it's the weirdest ending I have read for a very long time. Chris White
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Just too long and too complicated a read. I'll just catch the stage play and be satisfied with that much of the story.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I HATE this BECAUSE IT FROSE ON ME A LOT OF TIMES  and I never had a minute. 0 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has been a great app to have on airplane rides or waiting for appointments.  It has several options to choose from and I often win!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|This book obviously is only going to appeal to those who have listened and have been impacted by the music.<br /><br />Reading this memoir also gave me some insight into the creativity of a very talented man. It's sad that Pete had to suffer in order to find the energy / anger to write the material so many of us have enjoyed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is totally awesome. It is fun and has really good graphics for a video game. P.s. you get three gems if you write a review....

B0091REZMW|5.0|It gets hard as u get further in to it but it's loads of fun<br />And all ways keeps u interested I recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge.<br /><br /> Megan Higgens
B009WHO06C|5.0|Some reviewers said they found it hard to follow since the the chapters jump back and forth from past to present. It took me a couple chapters to get that straightened out, but as I became familiar with the characters, found the chapter change easy to follow. This is a hard story to read, because she gives details into how hard the round up of the Jews in France was, and the main focus was on the children. I love history, and I am really glad I read this. Came across it for our book club, and honestly wish it was a longer book.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This is badass. It's Clutch, what did you expect? They will never make bad music. There is no doubt about that.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I like books that have a twist at the end.  Didn't expect the way it ended.  Being a parent myself helped me relate to the characters and unconditional love for a child.
B002IEVZFK|5.0|These guys are badass. They have not let me down yet. I'm thinking they never will. Can't wait to see them live.
B002LII6KA|5.0|I love the Matrix and love extended versions of movies and what the directors had to say and the actors.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great background on these American fighters who deserve the title oh hero.  What they give up to serve is brought home by the author, but typical no whining.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Little Women is a great classic.  You can't go wrong with this title if you're into classics.  I got it for the IPAD for my girls to read.
B000MZHW4A|4.0|My students highly recommended this to me and it was great! Sad that humans are like this, but still a great movie.
B002R02FBS|5.0|We decided to buy all ultimate versions of Harry Potter.  I mean, why wouldn't you.  AND we decided to get the original version released in the UK, hence the Philosopher's stone instead of the Sorcerer's Stone.  And it's less expensive because it's not the norm here in the US.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is everything I imagined it would be. Romantic, thrilling, fun, etc. It captures you from the start and was impossible to put down!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Without the help of Amazon I would not be able to use my kindle.  They were nice enough to replace my cable for me at no charge. Thank you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|HOLY CROW!  I got this video and used it the first time last night.  OMG! Talk about total workout, I felt it everywhere today.  I feel like I got a good workout but am not so sore I cant move either.  I am an active person but not a fit person.  I want more definition and to lose a few pounds.  I think this will do it!  I have only did the level 1 so look forward to moving up!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I use Brown noise which is nice.  Otherwise I don't know how the other sounds work.  It drowned out the barking dog last night!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I grew up on CSNY but not Stills. \\"Carry On\\" though is like a deep gasping dunk in an ocean wave. Over and over, song after song his raspy energy just pushes. Sound quality is stupendous, nuanced, rounded. The set is just roughly chronological. The book's songlist has no \\"thoughts\\" about each song, just credits and production history but that contains its own surprises: Ringo, Bonnie Bramlett, Jimmy Page.  Bill Halverson shows up as again and again. And Calvin Samuels and Joe Vitale. FortyOne pages of essay. Pictures are unique views of images we've seen before. A page listing a bunch of Stills' session work. There's a dedication to Ahmet Ertegun, the Atlantic Records founder, and to Colette Lucas Sanson, Stills' former mother-in-law. I'm gleeful that the package follows the dense typology of the Graham Nash [[ASIN:B0018CVQFM Reflections]] and David Crosby [[ASIN:B000GUJYAQ Voyage]] boxsets. And in the end there's hours and hours of 82 songs of swaying, bounding blues and rock hard music.
B004NOH9LC|2.0|didn't expect it to be good - but was still disappointed. similar premise to newsroom (great show), except here the story line cheers for those pushing the news to be stupid/entertainment.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|A fun light-hearted movie you can watch over and over!  Ralph has a good heart and he is willing to give his life for a friend!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie had everything...suspense, some drama (but not overdone) and a history lesson. I especially liked the ending and the way the film intensity escalated and then came back down a notch before ending.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Good wins over evil!  Fear  is the enemy but good can win if we believe and are willing to fight for it!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Joss Whedon's best effort. Objects in Space is an amazing episode both for plot and subtext, who knew that existentialism could work on a tv show. Sadly only got one season, could spend much more time with this group of characters. Oh we'll, take what's given and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play on line  there isn't anything else to say about this game other than it is easy to play
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have been a fan of Emily Bronze medal in the for years  and have been wanting to reread this for a while. It is as good as I remember,even better with age I believe. I heartily recommend this  book .
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I used to just have a headlight, and rear light for commuting to work on my road bike, but sometimes cars still can't see you even with a bright neon reflective vest on. During the winter I had to commute home in the dark and it was extremely important that cars could see me. I heard great things about this light, and decided to give it a go.<br /><br />The light was easy to install and easy to configure to my favorite pattern, color, and brightness. Other people instantly noticed, people driving would turn their heads and see what was coming down the road, some of them almost drifted off the road! Pedestrians immediately notice and also sometimes comment, &#34;cool lights!&#34;<br /><br />The only con is that the batteries don't last as long as I would like them to, but because I commute, I use the lights quite often.<br /><br />I definitely would recommend this to anyone that wishes to be seen extremely well on busy roadways, especially at night.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a quick read. Enjoyed watching the growth of sky and holder. Would recommend it
B006L4MWVE|5.0|I can die happy after seeing this. Truly did introduce something new to the scene. Before the Hunger Games was such a \\"revolutionary\\" concept.
0738727326|5.0|Love everything about this deck. The artwork is beautiful and its my first deck :) Very satisfied and reccomended .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|If you love mystery and adventure then this book is for you.  5 star rating well deserved.  Well written, a page turner, and keeps you hopping till the end. There was only one thing that I thought could have been spread out more and that was the wrapping up of the loose ends in the story...people, events, etc.  I thought that last chapter(conclusion) was too clumped together. Highly recommended for those that love (Jack Reecher) type stories.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|We are enjoying my horse game get it u will love life like horses. My son loves paging and feeding part of it. Really enjoy playing on rainy days

B00005B36H|4.0|Hard to find in stores, and not available on itunes so its a good buy. Nice cover and good cd. One of my favorite albums. Of course just ripped and put on my ipod but still a good cd to get.
B00BESM14U|3.0|I liked this movie but found it to be a bit immature for my demographic (40s).  It reminded me very much of some of the teen 80s angst movies I saw way back when I was that age, when I had a real kinship for these types of stories and could relate a lot more.  Now that I am much older, it felt a bit vapid and predictable.  It wasn't totally bad though; I would characterize it as &#34;cute.&#34;
B0070UFMOW|2.0|I used this USB DAC, E9K desktop system and Hifiman HE-500. Source is FLAC files from MacBookPro. Unfortunately, it sounded horrible. I thought my FLAC files are not good enough so I tried the original record but sound quality was still very bad. Vocal was very harsh and lots of unpleasant background noises. Burning-in overnight also did not help.<br /><br />A week later, the 3.5mm adapter from Grado arrived. I tried the Hifiman HE-500 headphone directly with MBP, ipad, ipod and Droid phone.  The sound quality was much better this way.  Bass is not super deep but at least much more pleasant, refined and more detailed. I finally decided to return the whole set of Fiio and keep the 3.5mm Grado adapter instead.<br /><br />Despite glowing review of Fiio but to me, Fiio does not give a high quality sound and may not be compatible with Hifiman HE-500. You may need to step up further for HE-500. Build quality of Fiio is excellent and should last for many years.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|This has to be the most impressive opera presentation box ever issued - the thing must way 15 lbs and could be a piece of furniture. The blu-ray sound is incredible and really gives the sound stage set up in Vienna's Sofiensaal the platform it deserves. You can hear the operas without breaks, the material accompanying is informative and enlightening. A must buy for one of the greatest recordings ever made.
1607053551|5.0|I love the Amazon Prime membership, I see something I would like and in two days I have it.  I was excited about this book, I am very interested in fabric design.

Keep up the good work to all
B000RJW1Y2|5.0|plastic is cheap but at this price its ok.<br />works likes charm even on windows 8, 7 adn XP also on PS2 and PS3
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The story is addictive. Gone in one sitting. I am decades from being a young adult but the writing, the characters, and the involvement the authors builds have universal appeal. I have to agree with another reviewer who said  \\"However, the book is peppered with hand written letters and amazing vintage photographs which are hard to see and impossible to read on the Kindle. Purchasing this book in hard copy is the only way to go.\\"<br /><br />I found myself straining to see the pictures and reading the handwritten letters was painful but rewarding enough that I was glad I made the effort. If this is an early effort I can't wait for the next books by this author.
B001Q9E9F6|4.0|This is essential reading for anyone involved in E-business. The author's analysis provides thought-provoking material for designing a modern business model or distribution.<br />The Long Tail provides a visionary account of business and modern culture. Its analysis and lessons are instructive for anyone looking for an understanding of how to compete profitably as technology is transforming markets and businesses into niche providers. It provides good examples of companies which emerged according to this theory (consciously or unconsciously), validating the author's paradigm.<br />The author's theory, while providing a sound analysis of the forces at play in the market, has its limitations. It is not clear how some more traditional types of business will follow this model, or whether the market will ever evolve to the 98 percent rule, even in the Internet-based trade. More likely, there will always be mass market segments along with this model.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|When a movie gets as much press coverage as this one has gotten you can almost guarantee to be disappointed but I really was impressed. I'm 60 years old so lived through the time covered in the story but didn't know about the &#34;movie crew&#34; plot. Big &#34;Five Stars&#34; to Ben Affleck!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Have always liked the Merriam-Webster dictionary.  The electronic version is a valuable tool.  The feature which helps finding a word which is incorrectly spelled is great.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|416 pages.  I remember looking at that when I started this book and thought it was on the long side for new adult romance.  I now know why this book is 416 pages.  The first 200 pages sailed by and I was totally in love with both Travis and Abby.  There was even a resolution of a kind.  Then the whirlwind started.  I was angry at Stacey.  Then I was angry at Travis.  Then I was pissed at both of them.  I took a break.  I was emotional.  I was stressed.  A roller coaster is the ONLY way I can describe it, truly.  Then I figured it out.  This wasn't one story but several.  This one book feels like enough emotions and story to fill a whole series.  When I realized that, I breathed again.<br /><br />I really did experience too much for this one book.  So what does that say about the book, the characters?  To me is says that Jamie McGuire is a master storyteller.  I was so invested with these characters that I would have done better if I'd had a break such as a series gives you.  Don't get me wrong here, I would have been crazy waiting through a break, but I might have calmed down too.<br /><br />Travis.  This boy is a player.  He doesn't do girlfriends or dates.  But that doesn't stop the girls from trying to get his gorgeous attention.  Oh and this bad boy has more than a few issues.  He drinks, a lot.  He's covered in tats (so not an issue on him).  He's with a different girl every night - sometimes two at a time.  He fights for a living in an illegal fight group called the circle.  He comes from a family of 5 brothers, mostly like him.  His mother died when he was very young.  He has anger issues - and I do mean anger issues.  Do not piss the boy off.  But when he meets Abby and she doesn't giggle, running her fingers through her hair trying to get his attention, she gets his attention.  I equally loved him and wanted to strangle him.  And THAT is a huge compliment to the author.<br /><br />Add to Goodreads<br />Abby.  She's got secrets.  She's got skills (so not telling what those are).  She's running from her past.  She wants to be normal, go to college, get good grades and date the likes of Parker.  Parker, who is a little too perfect and perhaps even a little boring, can't hold Abby's attention when Travis decides they should be friends.  He insists actually.  At first, I was totally on her side but as the book went along, I also went from loving her to wanting to strange her then back again.<br /><br />Something that's different about this book is it's messy realness.  This relationship is the very definition of dysfunctional and yet the messy realness of it screams different.  It was so not a mess that gets figured out and then they are all smiles and puppies.  No this one has periods of goodness only to be messed up again.  Real.<br /><br />I'm super excited to read Walking Disaster, the story from Travis' point of view.  I can't wait to get inside his head and understand him better.  His charm and his temper are such a volatile ride and I really want to know what he's thinking.<br /><br />So this one has lots of violence, harsh language, sex, drinking and such in it.  It's clearly new adult and well worth the read.  You, too, can love and strangle Travis with me.ling what those are).  She's running from her past.

B00BWJARHO|4.0|This movie was definitely not as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The filming technique they used made it appear choppy at times. It seemed as though they wanted to market this towards a younger group. The action was not as good.
0151013837|4.0|\\"I know zoos are no longer in people's good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.\\" (23)<br /><br />A beautiful and remarkable story of faith and endurance. Provided with meticulous detail, this book pushes it's readers to the depths of human conviction and explores the journey for the will to live.<br /><br />I found this story sensational with it's wonderful descriptions and meticulous research on even the smallest detail. Whether discussing zoological history, or a daily routine, Yann Martel makes us feel like we're thrashing right along with Piscine, his misfortunate and what led up to his building beliefs. A seed was planted with Piscine and his investigative and curious mind in different religions and how, not only can they relate to one another and dwindle down to one central factor, but also how the elements of each religion benefit the soul in a variety of ways.<br /><br />\\"Things didn't turn out the way they were supposed to, but what can you do? You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.\\"<br />(120)<br /><br />Zoomorphism. It is foreshadowed (page 110,) and yet when we experience this trait with Pi Patel, it's still incredible. Faith wasn't the only factor in this plot, Pi's education and experience with zoo's and animals provided him with the patient skill of dealing with the animals on his boat, as well as the mysterious island he encounters. In essence, Faith provided him with the will to survive, while knowledge provided him with the tools.<br /><br />Offhand, I understand (for it is mentioned in the story; page 381) that the author needs the story to last 100 chapters, but some parts seemed unnecessary. I'm not just talking about the 1-2 sentence chapters, but also some of the deeply researched and extreme detailed parts of chapters. At times it made it difficult to focus and made me want to skim through parts of the chapter. This is the only main drawback I had with the novel.<br /><br />This being the illustrated version of the book, I can't continue on with the review without stating how extraordinarily beautiful the illustrations were. I would buy and re-read the book again for the illustrations alone. Tomislav Torjanac is truly a master, his art in bright bold colors, depicts the scenes with perfection. I'm now a huge fan of his!<br /><br />\\"Life is so beautiful that death has fallen love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can.\\"<br />(4)<br /><br />In all this story has the ability to lift spirits when you think about all one can endure in a span of seven months.<br />Seven months.

B002QCD2OG|4.0|I thought this would be a scary suspense tale. I was pleasantly surprised by a somewhat quirky and lighter-than-expected story. I really enjoyed it. My only problem was all the nudity... had to hide it from the kids.
1451627289|5.0|Very, very good novel. It is much deeper than one would think when first picking up this book. I highly recommend it to all you Stephen King fans.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|As you get into this book you find your self more and more submerged in the story. I enjoyed it and found myself caring about the characters as well as the unfolding mystery.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Interesting plot with increased awareness of flowers!  Also, very realistic description of the foster care system and subtle descriptors of mental health symptoms.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Excellent movie depicting life in the Ozarks.  Great writing, directing, acting. Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding. I recommend this film highly.  And for $1.99 for 24 hours rental, you can't beat the price
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is a lot of fun and I must admit I am hooked. Sit back and watch the team struggle through a world of unbelievable struggle.
B007JNWQZS|4.0|Great to have both movies in one location. My wife loves the convenience and the story of the bride in Tarantino's interpretation.

B005XN3150|5.0|I just watched the entre season, late. I really didn't think I would like this show but to my surprise, I LOVED IT!  It is a show that families can enjoy together. Very creative and great acting.

B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I have played Future Sex Love Sounds until it's practically worn through so I am a JT fan.  I was so looking forward to this especially after hearing him on SNL and Jimmy Fallon.  The songs that he performed on those shows (Pusher Love Girl, Suit and Tie, Mirrors) are the good ones, along with maybe one other, Don't Hold the Wall.  The rest in my opinion are just kind of filler and not worthy of being on this CD.  Another complaint I have is that all the songs are so loooong.  I mean every single one must go on for at least 5 minutes.  It just gets old, especially when it's the same thing being repeated over and over again.  My favorite song and in my opinion the best on the album is Mirror.  It's got heart and feeling that some of the other songs lack.  Suit and Tie has just got that catchy, swingy feel that makes you want to dance when you hear it.  Pusher Love Girl reminds me of some R&B  song from the 70's or 80's like a Barry White done in falsetto.  Overall, I guess I was a little disappointed.  I think I should have just bought the individual songs that I loved instead of the whole CD.  Still love you JT but this one was just so-so.
B009HSVHV2|3.0|This album is definitely the best of the albums since KISS recorded with the makeup back on. Some catchy tunes include Hell Or Hallelujah, Wall Of Sound, and All For The Love Of Rock n Roll. Paul Stanley really struggles with his voice on this album and can be tough to get through. Some songs are only novelties to the KISS persona, such as Freak, Back To The Stone Age, and Outta This World. This album is heavily carried on the backs of Gene Simmons and Eric Singer. Monster feels like a 10 in comparison to Sonic Boom. Coming from a huge KISS fan and fan of the originals, this is should be picked up even by the casual KISS fan. Some could argue its their best album since 1991's Revenge and others would argue their best since 1983's Creatures Of The Night. Either way its a reasonable return to heavy rock and may be the band's exit from the recording studio.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Helped a lot in getting our first books published. Gives you the necessary info to properly configure your book for kindle.
B00138J234|3.0|I picked this up because many many times ive seen this album featured on Best Albums of all time lists. I just didnt connect with me.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Affleck does a great job with this film. If your looking for action, look elsewhere. More suspenseful then anything. We loved it.
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|The album as a whole is great and does play a deserving homage to the Sound City City Studios. The names in the liner notes will encourage you to search further in the talent's back catalog.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Great movie that is unique in its genre.  Great cast and editing to make this movie actually a bit scary. Oh and it's pretty twisted
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian is a good workout instructor. Her videos are pretty intense, wouldn't really recommend for someone whose out of shape.
B00B8BR6CU|5.0|One of my top 5 all time movies.  Not a badly-acted role in the entire movie. Judi Dench is especially good as the Queen Elizabeth II (oscar-winning performance).  You need not be a Shakespeare fan to enjoy this clever fictional recreation of his life.  The soundtrack is wonderful, too.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Tri- fecta , John Wayne - James Stewart - Lee Marvin<br />Awesome Classic Western , a must have for your home media collection
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Sometimes I just need to be inspired. I really enjoy this book and bought it so I can read whenever I need inspiration.
0062213423|5.0|My niece loved this book, she couldn't stop thanking me for buying it for her.<br />I'm sure it left a big impact on her to get this book, she's a true fan.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It's a good thing I don't plan on going to Mars, because if I was in the main character's spot, I'd be dead by the end of the first chapter. This novel tells the story of an astronaut who, through a series of events, is left behind on Mars.  It is the story of his efforts to survive. Some reviewers have expressed disappointment in the level of detail included, but I respectfully disagree. The novel is in part a log, created by the main character for NASA's information. It's only natural that he would explain everything about his efforts to survive. While much of it went right over my head, I was fascinated by the idea that any of his projects might actually work.<br /><br />Unfortunately where the book disappoints, although only slightly, is the author's supposition that the main character has a great sense of humor. The comedy was unimpressive, but it was an admirable attempt.<br /><br />I would definitely read another book written by this author.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I was excited about Evernote right up until I had a password change imposed on me.  Now I can get help only if I pay the premium.  I am, or was, using it, mainly for lists and it was working well.  Since the password change, I have been trying for a week to reset it and seem to be in an endless loop and unable to access my data.  Unless I pay the upgrade, upcharge, I am on my own.  This is a total disgrace.  No other hardware or software company I have used or consulted over the last 30 years has had this attitude towards its customers.  So, over the course of a week with only e-mails I can't follow, I have gone from a 5-star rating to one; love to hate.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I haven't read a comic book in  20 years. Great artwork and story! Can't get enough of The Walking Dead!
B003U0I9U0|3.0|A great compilation of the group's key tracks throughout their years. The only miss is the inclusion of a remix of \\"the blood that moves the body\\", which truly stinks compared to the original. You have to add another CD (e.g. headlines and deadlines) to get the good version. But you can't go wrong with the rest of this if you're just looking for a greatest hits CD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The is a great book in conjunction with movie, check it out.  The book is very well written and easy to follow.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting for all ages. But it can be frustrating so don't consider this for kids under 6 ish. Otherwise it is really fun
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie with great actors.  At the end of the movie you do not want it to end. This is the type of movie you can watch morethan once and still get a warm feeling.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|When I rented this video i couldn't play it on tv through computer. When I went back and tried to fix problem i clicked the wrong video and got double billed for a movie I didn't get a chance to watch. Next time just wait for redbox.
B00947N6D8|4.0|I ordered the movie on price guarantee! That was awesome however it was supposed to come with 2 hoping eggs! OOps! Where are they?
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I sort of feel like this fell a little short of my expectations. Great world-building but word choice was at times painfully repetitive.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|I love this CD set.  Great music... sexy music... music to love by.  I would buy more by this artist.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is so addictive it should probably have its own PSA warning about the many hours you'll lose after downloading it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I recommend this to any endurance athlete. I may never run an ultra, but the message is clear. Anything is possible.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Always a great artist..a little less variety  in song choices than some of her other CDs, but a great addition
B009KEN87O|5.0|Nothing over the top fancy, just a great fast loading some game that is fun to play but all so challenging!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|this Movie is great my son watches it about twice a week that I know of maybe more when I'm not around but it seems to be on all the time, this shipped quickly and my son loves it !! :)
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|If you have not had the chance to watch Downton Abbey, you're really missing out. This is a great series with well built character.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|I have been listening to this CD from start to finish essentially for the last week. It is one of the few that you don't want to skip tracks on. I will confess to being a bit prejudiced since we were there for the recording and were blown away then. It is so uplifting and it just makes my day and points me to Jesus.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Can't believe I didn't already have this movie, as it is one of the best of all time.  One of the few great movies in the last 20 years.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I mean, it's the Godfather? How could it not be outstanding. The visual is not dramatically improved with the Bluray, but it is very good.
0061733199|5.0|I really hope I never need to use this book, but if I do the information in here is up most informative. Highly recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I like this book because it is different from anything I'd read before. The pictures are amazing. I think the story was written around the pictures.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much better than the first and totally addictive. It is entertaining to play and I loved it!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As it happens typically the movie doesn't follow the book completely.  While enjoyed the movie,  reading the book gives you the full story. Excellent read..
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|season one set the foundation for a great show. the premise is strong and acting great, but some parts can be corny and predictable.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Great read. I suggest it for any reader. I was engaging and exciting and I was unable to put the book down.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I already knew in my heart that Heaven is real. I am happy that Dr. Alexander has now put science behind it. Now maybe more people will believe.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|It won't let you log onto FB. If you try and play as a guest it makes a horrible noise even after you close the game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard about this show from other people and then heard a reference to it on Suits.  So i was curious and watched Episode 1, than episode 2.....I cant stop watching!!  I just finished season 2 last night and cant wait to start season 3!!  I cant believe that i didnt start watching this sooner.  It is absolutely addicting!!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|A little long winded, but really interesting. I especially liked the vending. I enjoyed that I could not guess what was coming next.
B001B2CPH2|4.0|I think this movie is kind tell us that, our best friends can become our worst enemy.  She is hot.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|If you have kids that are going to destroy this cover, get it, otherwise don't waste your money. Invest in one of the $30-40 covers... they are more durable and fit more snugly to the Kindle.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|What the hell is with your lovey dove free hugging Army? You haven't done any research and it really shows. Your soldiers behave like a bunch of wimps and their role of soldering seems to come secondary to aggrandizing the main character. In fact scratch that, all of the characters seem to be there for that purpose.  It's unrealistic and takes the story out of the story. Its like all of the characters have no other concerns than that of the main character.<br /><br />My review is harsh because you almost had something really good. You just destroyed it all by not taking the time to research the different characters roles and make them live it. Thats how you make a story come alive!  Don't lose heart just build your characters. And make your book longer don't give into the kindle disease of writing a short book for a quick buck!
B001BANK32|4.0|Totally different then the movie! A tragic story about a father battling his own demons both innard and outward ones. Terrifying, poiyant, well written, and just an all around thrilling page turner. Loved this book.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I watched the first 3 seasons in 4 weeks and so far, season 2 has been my favorite. The saying is great and I love how Lady Grantham is American.
B00B69UQEO|1.0|This is a disaster!<br />\\"Ultra\\" was their last good album. After that everything went downhill for DM.<br />Vocal that doesn't go with the melodies and cheesy beats became DM signature. I also think this album is overproduced.<br />If not for their name no record label would release this album. They should just retire.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Good script, stunts, cinematography, but lacked historical Bond's gadgets & toys. It was also different seeing a &#34;softer&#34; side of 007.
B00BF123WG|4.0|Interesting story... Kinda dark and hard to see the last 20 minutes. Nice to see how things supposedly transpired. Would recommend.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The power of creative thinking and man's selflessness... a must see! Surely a history lesson that should deem school consideration.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Luke Bryan is fun and consistent. He seems to have found a formula of girls + sun + beer + trucks = hit singles. And it works. Sometimes the songs all start to sound the same, but they are all fun.
B00AWD4I6C|5.0|Didn't know what to expect with the first one, but you have to see it to really understand and appreciate the sequels. Plus, hard not to love Milla Jovovich fighting for her life.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have more than one bible app on my kindle and this one is by far the best. Highly recommended by ME!!!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|If you like superpowers, monsters and a confused high school girl, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, there's probably not enough to keep it afloat.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book moved along nicely and kept the reader interested. I enjoyed the twists and turns along the way and I would love to see another book written.
B001P36OY2|3.0|Like others have said, it's not his best, but it's not terrible. It's sort of a classic dystopian future movie that has spurts of action with a lot of unanswered questions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally!  A no-nonsense calculator with some down-to earth extras.  Of course it can add and subtract.  Of course it is easy and intuitive to use.  Of course it works.  But it also allows you to backspace if you make an error entering a number.  And it shows the interim calculations when performing a percentage.  This is helpful to me when I calculate a sales receipt and have to itemize the sales tax.  The ads are non-obtrusive.  If you want a great basic calculator, this is it!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I'm not sure these movies will ever get old. This is probably the best one so far as the story keeps rolling on. You really have to admire the relentlessness of Milla Jovovich and Umbrella even after everything's that's happened. The only question is when they're gonna run out of bullets.
6301971272|5.0|I highly recommend getting this video WITH the special features DVD. The information about the Sibley Campaign and the Civil War in New Mexico enhanced my understanding about the movie immeasurable. The information about the music was OUTSTANDING! Learning about the restoration of the film was very insightful. Don't miss the background commentary by movie critics. Every bit helped me understand the story so much more...and the development of the characters.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite aspect was learning about the signature style of the director Sergio Leone, and his working relationship with Ennio Marconi. I never get tired of listening to the soundtrack.....(buy that too) which is really outstanding....even 43 years old. Some things  are timeless because the music is that good.<br /><br />It is very interesting to note that the new movie Django included music by Ennio Marconi.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I have to admit I was skeptical about replacing Sly, but he pulls it off. A pretty good remake as far as most remakes go.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have read this book a few times over the years and I never tire of it. There is so much more then in any of the many films made. It is a passhonet romantic novel, well worth reading.
B00AFEY354|5.0|LOVED this movie.  The ending surprised me, although in retrospect, the groundwork was there.  This isn't a cerebral movie requiring undivided attention, but it takes us back to a time when we didn't quite fit in and wondered...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|A great portrayal, the only changes from the books (which were few and far between) were positive ones. Highly recommended!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I was really excited by the reviews for this film, but after watching it (and wasting 2 hours of my life) I am extremely disappointed. There was no plot and the movie just dragged on - at two or three points I considered just stopping, but since I paid for the movie I didn't want to waste my money (plus I hopped it would get better). It doesn't get better, so just save yourself the time & money and watch something else.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best Bonds I've seen. Daniel Craig is a good Bond. Of course, Sean Connery is and always will be the original Bond. But Daniel Craig is still good.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Discovered many things I did not know about the out of office life of past presidents in addition to some behind the scenes maneuvers that made recent history more understandable.
1400067820|1.0|I really appreciate N.N.Taleb's Antifragile and I really like him. He built an amazing pedigree and he could have just tucked in behind the status quo - making more money than he could ever have spent, enjoying the respect & camaraderie of the highest echelons of the mainstream, but instead he writes books which pull back the curtains on \\"experts\\" and blow enormous holes in what one thinks one can know; he draws more attention to the Agency problem (can't be done enough), encourages people to tinker and take cheap options (essentially telling people to live!), and generally describes a way of treating situations in the world which are to the benefit of your children (endeavoring to be more antifragile). I love that people like him exist (is there another?); his family must be super proud of him.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This is an excellent movie, which is based on fact.  It is a must see for all History buffs! This movie depicts the Battle of Ia Drang Valley, the first major engagement between the NVA and American troops in Vietnam.
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|DVD arrived as was promised.  My grandson loves it!  I would recommend this to younger & older crowd - cute movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's cool I mean what else can you think of to add to the game I mean it's star wars and angrybirds :-) no doubt if there was a 10 star rating I would give it I love it that much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BHMF578|2.0|this was the best picture of the year...come now how did that get pushed to the head of the class - the cia?<br />ben you need to have more than one expression to be considered an actor. if I see another flick that has a child who does not live with his father... It would have got one star but I did like the bald guy..<br />Thank you Canada - for Hockey
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Can't be better than this .If your gave this a 1star rating you don't know what your talking about since there's a water graphic New powers you can't have anything better than this so it's good for 3:-).
B00BESFWBY|2.0|Why did you shot the whole thing in Santa Cruz - wanted to see more of the Coastside... pretty weak but good surf footage. Good to see El Granada in the background...
B0044DEAUA|5.0|It works great, I love it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy to use, set up<br />Voice Dialing- not perfect but it usually gets there- say the name slow<br />Battery Life- very long<br />Clear voice/sound quality<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bluetooth connection is really strong and if you aren't paying attention when you get close to your car it will switch to it<br /><br />Also it took me a while to get used to talking to the phone, instead of trying to raise my voice and shout, because the mike picks up better if you just talk normally, which is nicer on the vocal cords any way. (So this is sort of pro)
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I just turned it off. It was really weak. Not like the Joker version, weak....ho hum sorry Chris glad this is the last one.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I did not care for the story.  If one wasn't familiar with the technical world, he/she would understand nothing!  Seemed incomplete.
B008WOULPK|5.0|Great book about a fascinating woman and her fabulous life! So well written, I could not put it down once I started reading.
B007REV4YI|5.0|There are a few odd parts in the movie that make you think to yourself, &#34;how could that have ever been planned out&#34; but who knows.. This is one that you want to have a drink with and to not over think. Enjoy!
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|I think \\"weezy\\" is abusing his reputation, this album has a few catchy beats, but other than that, it's constant repetition of \\"b1tch3$\\" and his obsession with his genitalia and marijuana.<br /><br />MEGA FAIL, not even worth the bandwidth used to download this or the 100MB or so it take up on a 1TB storage<br /><br />Soon to be deleted
B004U8VWLE|3.0|With all the hype about the movie I expected much more. Explicit sex especially lesbian sex in a movie is crude at best. The story was confusing.
B0086HGW42|5.0|He artfully crafts a great album of unique and beautiful music that is so relaxing.  The lyrics are very deep and meaningful.  Some profanity but overall, a really good album
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|Why can't this be just one movie?  It's annoying to see these stories drug out to make more money.  I paused the movie  several times to see how much time was left.  You can feel it dragging on and on.  The only thing that kept me watching were the special effects, which were great. This could have been a great movie but the story was stretched out, it got quite boring and the acting was just OK.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Lincoln is a great movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It has a good script, great acting, and a worthy story to tell.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Enjoyed the videos as much as the books. Very well done. Can't wait for season 3! I don't know who enjoyed it more, my husband or myself!
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch never disapoints...Love the tunes..Keep them comming..P.s The Face mite be my new fav clutch tune..<br />Even thought it would be hard to top Imortal..
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series, season two was a bit of a teaser. I fell as though it went by quicker than the first season.
B006H5120E|4.0|this is a great movie, in 3d it does give it depth but not much more, not a lot of 3d, yes it is so clear and great for hd but not impressed at all with 3d, only two or three items stuck out, but still the depth i had to adjust on my sony 3d i moved it up to +2 and still not alot of 3d effects, but still liking the clear pic, sound not to impressed, i have a 7.1 dig. yamaha with hd play back, not alot of seperation between channals, rear had to turn up to 9db to get anything, so good price, good pic, not so over the hill sound.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Anyone who has not seen this movie...needs to!!! I was so angered by the content but happy to have been informed.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|can't get enough awsome hope they are doing more to this series will buy all episodes.it just takes to long for them to come out
B003B02O0A|5.0|I really liked the fact he allowed you to get to know each character in depth.  The story itself was compelling.
0061245097|5.0|Four years ago, Cat abandoned her lover Bones, as well as her former life to join a secret branch of the U.S. government that was formed to hunt vampires. She did it thinking it was the only way she'd be able to save Bones from the men that were threatening her.<br /><br />Now, however, she's facing Bones' sire Ian, as well as a contract on her life, when Bones suddenly reappears in her life. She is overjoyed to see him, but she knows it still won't work. Or will it?<br /><br />In the second book to the Night Huntress series, we get a lot more Cat and Bones action, more fighting, and some awesome new characters, in Don, Juan, Tate, Denise, and Annette. We also get to see more into the vampire world with glimpses of Ian, Spade, and Mencheres.<br /><br />I love this book, and honestly, I think it's my favorite of the whole series. It's the only copy I have of the series that's literally falling apart with how many times I've read this.<br /><br />This book is where we really get to see how Cat and Bones feel about each other, and heh, there's one certain scene where it's really obvious. If you don't know what I'm talking about, pick up the book. You won't regret it, if just for that scene. ;)<br /><br />We also get to meet what will become some key characters in later books. Don is the head of the governmental operation that Cat is the main \\"fighter\\" for. Tate is one of the men who follows her, who also happens to be in love with her, and Juan is another one of the followers, who is obsessed with women (this is not an overstatement. He's really that obsessed). Annette is one of the first vampires Bones ever changed, and Denise is Cat's best friend.<br /><br />This book picks up in an interesting spot, because when I picked up the book, I thought it would pick up immediately after the last book ended, but it doesn't; it picks up four years later. Which in truth, is a very good thing, since it develops the characters, as well as the scenes more.<br /><br />All in all, as I said, this is my favorite book of the series. If you haven't read the series, pick up the first book, and be prepared for the magnificent sequel.s I said, this is my favorite book of the series. If you haven't read the series, pick up the first book, and be prepared for the magnificent sequel.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|Season 1 was so great. I feel they lost their momentum this time around. I'm still watching though, in the hopes they find their soul again.
B005PR422K|4.0|Addresses the needs of traditional startup scenarios and embedded enterprise startups with common tools. Sensible and pragmatic approaches satisfies the velocity pangs of incubating startups. Yet utilises measurable scientific methods with a focus on useful growth measurements rather than deceptive glory numbers to provide a truthful reflection on progress. My only down note was the book is highly narrative - a reference section would making utilising the methods and patterns easier in the frenetic pace of any startup practice.<br /><br />I wish I had this book 10 years ago!
0765325950|5.0|Full of all the adventure, magic, and characters we have grown to love and hate! Am sad to see the end of this series of books. I cried, and was happy too!
B004MC8CA2|3.0|My bigest disappointment was the I could not go directly to a book or a section of Bible. Otherwise, seems to be ok.
B003568FR6|5.0|This is a fantastic deal for three quick, effective workouts that get your heartrate up and work your whole body. The only thing I would like to see would be a little more thorough of a warmup and cooldown, but I can do that on my own. Her main thing is to get the workout part in. I am not a huge Biggest Loser fan, but I really like Jillian Michael's videos. She might be annoying to some people at times, but I have done tons of workout videos and have never seen one that doesn't have a review criticizing the \\"annoying\\" instructor. So anyway, I think it is a great trio of workouts, and I mix them up over the course of the week with yoga, running, lifting weights in the gym, other workout videos, playing with my kids, housework, etc... They are a great deal and great for the time-pinched folks!
B007JNWQZS|5.0|excellent price, nothing to say... is kill bill. also got spanish sub and that's what i've been looking for.... just watch them both on my ps3 w/o a problem
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Such a fabulous book, written smartly and fully...right up my alley, with alchemy, genetics, and a myriad of creatures...one of the BEST books I have read in quite some time!
044654759X|5.0|I have the whole collection of his books and every one is perfect right to the end, price was good and I love hard cover books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm only sixteen and I loved this book. I'd recommend it but only for mature audiences but it's s amazing book and worth the time
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I loved the first one and couldn't wait to get through this one. I can't wait to buy the rest of the series
B007SGM084|5.0|At first the whole S&M I couldn't get into but I couldn't put the book down. I loved every paged and I will read it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book through and through. Can't wait to read the next one when I get home! Hopefully the next one is better.
B000000H6D|5.0|This is not a Gothic album.  None of Type O Negative's albums are.  If this is labeled as Goth, then you're buying into the Hot Topic definition<br /><br />Type O Negative has always been the sum of the contributions of all of the members, with Steele's lyrics, vocals, and humor being what got the band noticed.<br />I won't bother with the negative reviews or gush about how good the album is, as I am a fan and tastes are subjective.  I would advise that you grab the \\"Top Shelf\\" edition if you don't have the cd yet, abs listen for yourself<br />This is the album that broke them into the mainstream, and October Rust catapulted them to meteoric levels of Success.<br />This isn't Goth, this is honest sonic therapy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Im friends with the makers of the brand Microsoft. and i know what good is and this game is good.
B001G50SLE|5.0|My wife and I have periodic mini-film fests with the &#34;boys&#34;. Really enjoy the show and how the take on the evil of the week.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a deeply moving book  I have read it twice now in order to really understand the gravity of it. Simply superb
B003QSMCKO|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever ive loved this movie since i was a little kid and i always wanted to be a princess.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|High prices of bidding for my country (brazil) but even with this the product arrived in time and perfectly! Just an awsome service!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Enjoyed this series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is very good watching.  Both romantic and suspensful.  I really like most of the characters and I cannot wait for the next installment.  Thanks for a very good time.
B00BF11STU|2.0|There are so many reasons I didn't like this movie, but mainly it was so slow moving and I had to fight to stay awake.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I was excited to share these films with my wife for the first time.  The music from Williams is spectacular.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|I read the book with my sons and they loved it as much as I do. It was exciting to see everything come to life.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack can get anyone through a rough day.  Les Miserables is an epic story and it deserves this epic soundtrack!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game because you get to interact with the horse. In this game you can do things to help the horse and earn money.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed the book, it was a page turner. The main character was very good, and the ending wasn't expected.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book keeps you sucked in until the very last second. The entire story keeps you entertained and the ending is such. A twist that you'll never see it coming!
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|The movie moved along nicely. The story never got bogged down and the acting was good from beginning to end. It's definitely a adult film but it was very entertaining and avoided being dark and depressing considering the story line. The movie gave a upbeat and hopeful message while being very funny at the same time.
0811879542|5.0|You will have so much fun with this book for years to come.  It will become the GO TO Book.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Too melodramatic and the actress says about 300 words the entire movie.  Movie was entertaining but after all the hype from awards season, I didn't think it was that great.  Certainly a lot better war movies, even centering around 9/11.
B004QX07G4|5.0|When I first purchased this book, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The reviews were excellent and I love Ellen, so I figured I would give it a go.<br /><br />I am so glad I did. If you are looking for an uplifting book filled with random, comical (for lack of a better word) stuff, then this is the book for you. It truly is unique; completely unlike any book I have ever read before. You will not regret purchasing it. Enjoy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just keeps getting better. Great story with a little gotcha scare and some horror too.  Can't wait to watch the next one.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The charger is not working....the red light does not go on...older model because it doesn't have the magnetic piece so that when you hang it up...it's upright.  upright have had two before this and wanted . One for second floor of my home.<br /><br />It is completely useless because the battery cannot be charged.  charged.  Sorry I spent the money
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Ok I admit it. At the first listen this Delta Machine left me quite displaced. Better mastering than SOTU and PTA but no hit, no single, no memorable melody.<br />But... just wait: this is no 1 star review.<br />Listening DM DM over and over gave me the exact proportions of this nearly-masterpiece. Great sounds and arrangements, never trivial song structure and vocals. Oh, well, vocals... What actually happened to Dave's Voice? He sings better than ever on this DM DM. Like the blues singer he wasn't on SOFAD. And, more, Dave's touch on compositions finally balances Martin's songwriting.<br />Today DM are no more the 80s band we all used to love. Ben Hillier's touch is peculiar here. No more Alan Wilder memories, and why not, today's DM don't need him anymore. These are DM of our days, one of the greatest bands ever, still on the edge. The best DM album since Violator, and one of their best ever.
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this because I really like James Lee Burke's books.  Unfortunately, there were no captions available so it was useless for those of us with severe hearing problems.<br /><br />Get on the ball Amazon!
1451695195|5.0|Both my husband (who works in the science field) and I read this book.  It was amazing.  It had a huge impact on both of us and I've given it to several people.  Regardless of what religious beliefs one holds, this may change the way a person views things.  It was a very quick read.  I skimmed over some of the more &#34;medicalese&#34;, but what an amazing story, what a remarkable journey.  I've never read a book that touched me in the way this one did.  I highly recommend it to believers and non-believers alike.
B002VXGW2E|4.0|The entertainment was all that I anticipated. I thought the price a little high since I could have watched it on TV for free. The delivery was impeccable. Simple and just as promised. I will definitely use the system again. For me to love a movie takes a lot. I loved Les Miz if anyone cares because it was about love on all levels.
B00007KWHG|3.0|The songs are great, but some play louder than others.  Constantly need to adjust the sound level.  Poor digital equality.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|Let my brother play because he is just learned to count and loved it! Recommend for K-1st graders now he just loves this game
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game to use your brains. It starts easy and you'll learn the rules trough trial and error. Don't ask for the hints, just try again; with some common sense you can solve it. Careful not to get addicted to this game!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting--dramatic and funny.  The series has beautiful and historic backdrops, pulling you into the lives of the gentry and their servants.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I was in high school when the Ian Fleming books became popular and the movies became hits. I read the books and saw the movies, and debated the best Bond issue. Then the producers ran out of original Fleming stories but the movies continued and I began to lose interest...until the new three part prequel. From the origins of 007 in Casino Royale to the amazing ending of Skyfall which brilliantly tied the new to the old stories, James Bond is back and Daniel Craig is the best of the bunch. My immediate reaction after seeing Skyfall was that now the stage is set for the remake of all of the original stories, with updated technology, and of course, Bond will need a new Aston Martin now.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Not sure why but it seemed fun and relaxing to live life as a flying squirrel just trying to get a nut.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|Even those few non-Walking Dead fans out there will enjoy this recording. It's not all my type of music but recorded and mixed perfectly. Only complaint is the songs (except for two) are too short and there's only 8 of them. Leaves you wanting more!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use this app on a daily basis to do everything from placing and tracking orders to cross checking prices in stores.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simple game that is SO easy to learn and can provide hours of fun. Even young children can learn to play this game. As levels progress the challenges offer harder and harder challenges but most of them can be overcome with trial and error or simple planning.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Cast of characters and watching them as they workout. NO steroid use. Good story ! Good to see the routines each bodybuilder uses for certain muscle groups and how to &#34;Pack it On&#34;
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|It says that I purchased this but it has not been installed yet.  I have tried everything & so has my daughter & we do not know what to do.  It is very disgusting as no matter what I do it does not get installed.  I called this morning & when I got to talk with a guy I told him that I could not hear him and I guess he hung up because I then got the busy signal.  I am at a lose.  I really do want diamond dash but how to install it is another thing.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Come on it's Paul Rudd there will be some good moments.  This movie is long and feels like they should of wrapped it up about a hour sooner.  Funny meets depressing, then funny, then closer.  I'd watch it again but don't expect to laugh the entire movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|The ending is so amazing I was sweating and started screaming!!! :0<br />That was so awesome!!! I am now starting the second book!!! :0
B0031RAOVY|4.0|For a change it's not really a people movie - the peope are supporting characters to the canine.  We are dog people and so I warn you, we are bias.  I do not think the story would be good for all ages, as the movie is sad.  But for those of us who love our pets it is a real depiction of their loyality and devotion that we accept with gratitude.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|If you are in love with an alcoholic, you should watch this movie. It is an exercise in futility.  Get out of the relationship.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|It wasn't an easy read.  I didn't particularly enjoy the book as I was reading it, but I think it will haunt me.  I could easily believe the story line.  The woman/mother was real, if not a totally sympathetic character.  The author does use a lot of uncommon words.  It is a timely story and I'm sure one that will come back into my mind every time I hear about a young person entering a public place and killing.
B009PJ1Q82|1.0|Even in bad gay flicks, at least there is juicy sex. Not here, babe. The \\"plot\\" such as it is, is simple: Erik is infatuated, nay obsessed, with Paul. Paul is narcissistic, a bit schizophrenic, and self-destructive (i.e. crack head hustler). In their<br />nine-year relationship, he goes off for days and weeks on end, driving Erik crazy with worry. But Erik won't take no for an answer... and so on. Because there isn't much of a plot, the writer just drags it out and perseverates: he makes you think a resolution is around the corner, but it never is. Not worth the hour and forty-five minutes of monotony. A surprising bomb from the usually spot-on Yellow Bird production company, which brought us the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. In a word: DESPICABLE.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|My brother is in his mid-60's and very hard to buy gifts for.  He said the 3D effects on the movie were great.  He thought the movie might be too graphic and bloody, but said it was totally enjoyable with lots of action.  Since my brother is a man of few words, this was high praise indeed!  A successful gift!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I heard about this book on NPR, and amazon kept telling me to read it. I loved that it was a collected edition, I hate having to wait, having said that, when will more of these stories come, I want to know what happens to the people in silo 18, do they find honesty the best policy, or does it lead to war. Do they go and collect the children from silo 17 or send people over to make a colony.<br />I can hardly wait
B002VECM6S|5.0|A great movie for all ages!  The story is heart-warming and shocking if the story is new to you as it was to us.  One can't help but admire and envy the love in the Touhy family.  And Michael Oher is an inspiration to all of us.  It was different role for Sandra Bullock and she stepped up and did a great job of making Leigh Ann come alive.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game cuz its like a puzzle and you have to figure out how to get the awards.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I stopped watching this as soon as I saw what little clothes the blue girl was wearing.  They couldn't have come up with a skimpier outfit.  Disgusting.  The swearing is really annoying - makes the characters look like uneducated jerks.  This movie has no class.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is an awesome album for anyone's collection. I loved every track. I would suggest all of their CD's, way better than any Justin Bieber tween crap!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward is so talented and he continues to show it on this CD. I love the Nashville influence and the remix!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|awesome app. its good to for all. very use full for beginners. I would suggest this app to my pals.
0425263908|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put this book down &  couldn't wait to read the next one.  And I also can't wait for the last one which I've pre ordered!
B007JMW46U|5.0|I recommend this book to any one!! It is a stand alone story!! If you are looking for a great read this is the one.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I love this album! His music is inspiring. Tell me a story and Hope are my favorite songs. His stuff is so different from what is being played on the radio and I appreciate that.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|These were Christmas gifts and it was easy to find here. Both were very happy with it as a gift.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|For those of you who like cop/detective dramas, this is the one! Great characters and an awesome story like will keep you hooked from ist episode to the last.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love yahoo, i use it for all my electronics, its user friendly and all my friends use it as well so I am in contact with everyone I need to be with at all times.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I never buy TV shows for myself but I love this series so much that I have to have every season. The plot development is brilliant! Very entertaining, thought-provoking, and not gorey or unnecessarily violent. Excellent show!
0440241901|4.0|I'll confess. I'm not a big chick lit fan. In fact, I didn't disover Sophie Kinsella until about a month ago. I got a Kindle for Christmas and read my normal memoirs/intelligent literature, but then I somehow found this author. I have read \\"A Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"The Nanny Diaries,\\" and I'm sure my love for Jodi Picoult played a role.<br /><br />So I decided to go with a beach read after 3 very heavy indulgences. (Religious and fiction books). So I read \\"I've got your number\\" first and LOVED it. This book appealed to me 2nd on Sophie's list and I LOVED it. The breeziness, the romance (I like the do not disturb, offbounds types of romances that don't make it a sex novel), were very nice. I have seen it is \\"maybe\\" supposed to become a movie, though that rumor seems to have existed a long time. I hope it does happen.<br /><br />I have since read \\"Remember Me,\\" but I'm not too apt on the Shopaholic series or ones with a ghost and housekeeper. This plot pulled me in. Though, yes, unrealistic, it is better than a ghost or lawyer turning maid! Plus, the playing hard to get plot (without realizing it) is always more attractive than love with without obstacles. I liked Emma, though, when she spoke I thought she sounded like an idiot a lot of the time. I understand why Jack liked here, but she never came across as intelligent to me, in her musings or her correspondence. Well, I guess this is when you disengage from reality and realize it is all fiction. A fun read though!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Short game but fun quick brainteasers.  Basic concept but there is enough variation and twists that it keeps it fresh.
B004FRB3OQ|3.0|I found that this item worked, but that is was slightly too large for the slot and I was forced to sand it doen a little inorder for it to be a perfect fit.  For the price it was OK.
B002EWD0I6|3.0|I ordered Season One of Lark Rise to fill some time while I waited for the fourth season of Downton Abby.  I did notice that Mr. Bates from Downton Abby plays the father in Lark Rise, so I gave it a try.  It is certainly not Downton, but it never claimed to be.  Personally I found it to be something near to the British version of \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and I can't say I was impressed at all.  The story line is sweet, but I was expecting something a bit more complex and Lark Rise just does not have it.  Glad I just ordered season one, and not the entire series, as I likely will not even finish season one, but give it to my grandkids to watch.  Cute and sweet, but just not the captivating story line I was hoping to find.
B0045XGRQE|1.0|This is the second movie that has problems during streaming and reduce the quality, not sure if it worth to rent in HD
0061537969|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I just love it. Not only is it a delightful story about a dog and his human(s), but it is a book of life lessons. I have already ordered several for friends.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best Masterpiece Series ever! Wasn't expecting what happened at the end of this season, because I purposely don't read spoiler alerts. Looking forward to season 4 to see what happens!
B000BZISTE|5.0|i love the movie i have it on vhs but it doesnt work anymore i was happy to find it on dvd
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really great game to pass the time! With every level you just want to keep playing. Would recommend for anyone.
B004SBX112|5.0|I was never able to get this to work on my Kindle FireHD.  In fact it never showed up on my device at all!!<br />This is a retraction to my above review.  Right after I wrote this I brought my Kindle Fire to work and when I clicked on the game it worked!!  Being skeptical I tried it at home and it worked there too.<br />I love this game there are so many level to each Season.  Though I admit that I am stuck at several of them.  All in all it's an awesome game.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Very happy with the overall product. It does exactly what it was advertised to do. The front cover that gets used as a stand works alright, although I was expecting the stand to be more sturdy. Also, I get the sense that it will become increasingly flimsy over time.<br /><br />Bottom line: it works and is worth it for the price
B0052FG750|5.0|I've been collecting music for over 40 years. Albums,Cassetts,8 tracks and CD's.<br />This is by far one of the best values I've ever aquired. $24 bucks..$4 a CD!!! All 6 CD are 40th anniversary remastered. Thank you to The Doors,Warner Brothers UK & Amazon. If your on the fence...get off it and buy this Doors collection.<br /> All 6 of the albums in their entirety.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I ever played with horses. I love the fact you can buy more then one and even win a black one. It's a must have for all horse lovers.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I like it was the first time in my opinion of the most important thing is for a long time ago that I have been happy to be a good day and night and I am going through wroth to you
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As a lover of medieval fantasy, I found this book to be absolutely fantastic. The characters were believable, and the emotional roller coaster this book took me on was delightful. I'm ecstatic to read more in the series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love all these games... there really isn't anything that I would change.. having to do things to getinvestment points sucks but u gotta make money somehow
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|This is an important film and should be seen because it stimulates thought about what is right and what is wrong in the never-ending \\"war on terror\\".<br /><br />But I object to being forced to buy a DVD and a Digital Download, neither of which I want, in order to get a Blu-Ray disc. This is Hollywood just inviting piracy.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|The espionage and suspense intrigued me. I also liked the author's writing style. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys mystery and espionage.
0920668372|5.0|I have bought many copies of this book because it vividly, and simply, puts the life cycle in perspective.  The love and care for a child goes full cycle as the child later becomes the caretaker of the mother, and then the caretaker of his own child. He then knows what love his mother had for him.  Warning:  It will make you cry.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I expected more from this book which came highly recommended. I wish the main character, the narrator, could have drawn me in more emotionally. Although the story (content) was good, I watched from a distance.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautifully shot, excellent cast and story.  I especially love how everyone has strict manors throughout the house, downstairs and upstairs.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|The minecraft free version  gives you infinite time but doesn't save but survival does so they are both not good but if you combined them it would be awesome.
030758836X|4.0|I liked the book, but did not like the ending or the foul language.  The book was extremely well-written with strong characters.
B0013O123Q|1.0|I score this film a zero. I keep wondering how and why I decided to even see this film...it was utterly awful and unintresting to watch
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|I've seen this movie 20-25 times and never tire of it... it is a seamless timeless work of art; where story, design, photography, cast, vfx, editorial, sound, music, etc. create pure synergistic alchemy... & the HD mastering carefully nurtures and maintains the beautiful photo chemical original...<br /><br />If you haven't seen it in a while (week or more) do yourself a favor; get loaded, mix up some 'White Russians', put your feet up, surrender yourself to 'dudeology' and enjoy the ride...
0062014102|5.0|I have always been interested in understanding more about deeper truth in life and wrote a book &#34;How do I find inner peace, a step by step guide&#34; before reading The Holographic Universe. What makes the book wonderful is that Michael Talbot's orientation is scientific, yet relatively easy to understand, and he covers a wide variety of fascinating topics.<br /><br />For the first couple of chapters, I was constantly putting the book aside to do further research on the topics he raised such as how the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Center over twenty years, documented statistically significant variation in machines, when students sat nearby and concentrated on a desired outcome. The head of that center was a rocket scientist who initially was highly skeptical of the possibility raised by one of his students, yet could not ignore the evidence they uncovered.<br /><br />I also found the work of Dr. Stanislav Grof fascinating in the way he expanded the frontiers of psychology by developing a more holistic approach.<br /><br />For some time I have known of the placebo effect, yet Talbot's chapter on &#34;The Body Holographic&#34; went into details of which I had been unaware. For example, how multiple personality disordered individuals shift between personalities resulting in profound measurable, physical changes. Also intriguing were people who through language or mental deficiency, were unable to comprehend the severity of their terminal diagnosis, and exhibited a 30% lower mortality rate.<br /><br />I continue to contemplate how a hologram is able to contain the entire image in each fragment of a broken holograph, but the basic idea is that everything is interconnected, and the image is complete in every part.<br /><br />For some time I have known of the quantum physics principle known as &#34;non-locality&#34; or &#34;entanglement&#34; yet I found the exploration in this book fascinating. For example I handed a relative the book opened to the foreword where this is discussed in the second paragraph, asking them to read the first paragraph and see if they didn't feel compelled to continue reading more, and they too found the material very interesting.<br /><br />I just loved reading this book and actually, went through it a second time, laughing often, not because it is humorous, but because profound issues are explored so clearly. On the second reading, I hit the part that kind of rocked my world in a way that changed my ordinary waking consciousness, when I read about the image formed on the retina of the eye not actually being &#34;out there&#34; as part of the question regarding how we distinguish between sensation within or outside of our body, and how our brain does the interpretation.<br /><br />Talbot includes detailed references and I found myself often flipping to the back of the book to check the Bibliography, and then doing my own follow up research of the topics mentioned, which were also fascinating and enlightening. It may be that due to my prior exposure to many of these topics I found them easy to assimilate, yet I imagine anyone with an interest in understanding more about the nature of the universe would find Talbot's book worthwhile.where this is discussed in the second paragraph, asking them to read the first paragraph and see if they didn't feel compelled to continue reading more, and they too found the material very interesting.<br /><br />I just loved reading this book and actually, went through it a second time, laughing often, not because it is humorous, but because profound issues are explored so clearly.

B002QCD2OG|3.0|The story is great, but it could use some updating. The &#34;musical&#34; scenes of people romping around gardens were tedious, at best, laughably outdated at worst.
B000002H5I|5.0|I LIKE TWO SONGS IN THIS CD ! I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT FOR MYSELF ,BUT ENDED UP GIVING IT TO MY FRIEND , SO NOW I'LL HAVE TO BUY ONE FOR MYSELF AGAIN ! I RECOMMEND THIS CD !
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|Looks like the series was trying to take advantage of the paranormal mania (which I enjoy) while tapping into a strong female lead. The first season seemed choppy....characters, developement & story lines. Season two seems to have found its footing & the storylines have more depth. Only problem was having to trudge thru the first season to enjoy the second
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this game is very fun because you get to do lots of things like driving cars flying planes and much much more.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|not sure if I really liked the movie or not, not so sure of the ending. I think I expected something different.

B00BWJARHO|2.0|One of my rules is to rent first and then decide whether a video is worth the purchase price.  Amazon Live has made this very convenient, but this time I feel I have been ripped off.<br /><br />\\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\", that is available for rent, is not the complete Hobbit, the story end just as the party gets to see the Lonely Mountain. I went back through the descriptions and there is no mention that this is only part of the story.  From the reviews, it sounds like the full story will be available in December, but it would be nice if the description mentioned this.<br /><br />I was never a big fan of the Hobbit by itself.  Having listened to the many BBC / Radio Play renditions and accept that Producers/Directors are going to change things from the book, I found what there was of the story entertaining and the padding scenes helped.<br /><br />That said, even if there is a Extended Hobbit, that covers the whole story and even if this is offered with the Trilogy - I am going to pass, I have a problem with how this was marketed.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins gives a fine performance here, looks nothing really like Hitchcock but nails his style and personality. In spite showing his warts, it is a very loving portrait of the man.  Really helps if you have seem Psycho and North By Northwest prior to watching this one.
B00B9RIAMI|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this album ever since the Iron EP. It does not disappoint! Totally amazing. I heartily recommend to people who like music.
B00BWJ7LYG|1.0|Never actually watched to movie (got a refund) because everytime I started watching it, about 1 minute into the movie the sound would suddening change and would sound like it was going through a voice changer (very low tones and distorted). Appears to be spome issue (only with some movies) when you watch the movie via the LG Smart tv box. Thid also happened when we rented &#34;Argo&#34;, but did NOT happen for &#34;Here Comes the Boom&#34; and &#34;zero Dark Thirty&#34;.

B00AO2S45W|3.0|Before I dive in to the review, I must say that this review is a copy of the one I posted on the \\"Radio Creme Brulee\\" station blog that I write for. Now that I've said that, here goes:<br /><br />British chanteuse Dido writes and sings unapologetically from the heart and personal experience. That is a bold decision given the rather narrow and limiting confines of what is considered \\"marketable\\" pop music today. Sometimes, this ethic of Dido's works in her favor from a commercial standpoint (albums such as \\"No Angel\\" and \\"Life For Rent\\"). With her last album \\"Safe trip Home\\", it clearly did NOT. The album was a reflection of some of the unpleasant experiences of her life. Lyrically, it was still on point but the overall mood was downbeat and somber. It undoubtedly polarized Dido's fanbase and had many people labeling the album as being certifiably \\"boring\\". Fortunately, for most of us, Dido returns to being the artist we all know and love on \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" - her latest album<br /><br />A few months ago, \\"Girl Who Got Away\\" was touted as Dido's return to a classic sound dominated by her electronic roots and to the sound that propelled her to stardom back in 2000. It also helps that she was in a happier place personally when she wrote and recorded this album. In fact, she was pregnant with her son Stanley during the recording process. That happiness definitely translates to a substantial portion of the album. On her latest offering, Dido constantly plays \\"jump rope\\" with the line dividing her \\"popstar\\" persona from her \\"downtempo electronic music\\" persona.<br /><br />The album's opener and lead single \\"No Freedom\\" is a down-tempo acoustic ballad that will probably make listeners and skeptics wonder if Dido was actually being serious about her return to her electronic roots. While the core of the song is beautiful, it also serves as an example of the fact that the \\"treatment\\" of a song is probably as important as the song's core. The production on the track is fairly pedestrian and does not do justice to the song one bit. For those of you that want to know what the song COULD have sounded like, check out the lush jviewz remix of \\"No Freedom\\". It is one of two missed opportunities on this album.  One cannot help but think that the current album production on this song dilutes its core.<br /><br />The album's title track is its indisputable highlight and is without a doubt one of the musical highlights of Dido's career. On \\"Girl Who Got Away\\", Dido showcases her trademark cracked falsetto and allows her vocals to drift in a soundscape defined by light electronic embellishments. The bit where she sings the lines below are absolutely sublime and are bound to leave the listener longing for more.<br /><br />I know what it's like<br />To be passed over<br />To go unnoticed<br />To be clumsy get things wrong<br />and I know what it's like<br />To arrive too late<br />To be told to leave<br />To be walked upon<br /><br />\\"Just Say Yes\\" has the ability to transport the listener to an imaginary scene of a mystery movie that follows the movie's protagonist through the streets of Paris. The song's mildly ominous-sounding production constantly flits from sparse electronic beats to lush string arrangements. It definitely marks one the album's most sophisticated musical moments. For a few seconds, the song also features an acapella section by Dido thus proving that she does not need to rely on production to hide any shortcoming in vocal ability. She has no vocal shortcomings whatsoever.<br /><br />\\"Everything to Lose\\" is the album's single biggest missed opportunity. This song was featured on the soundtrack of the motion picture \\"Sex and the City 2\\" back in 2010 without much fanfare. As a result, the brilliant uptempo track went unnoticed. Typically, soundtracks are a great way to get exposure for a track. It clearly did not work with the \\"Sex and City 2\\" soundtrack. This album features an Armin Van Buuren remix of the song. It goes to prove, once again, that the treatment of a song can undermine its merits. Dido should have featured the original version with its addictive falsetto-induced \\"oh oh oh\\" on the album and also released it as the album's lead single. After alienating fans that liked Dido more for her sonic appeal as opposed to her lyrical competency with \\"Safe Trip Home\\", \\"Everything to lose\\" would have served as the perfect vehicle to win those fans back. It would have allowed for the repositioning she needed in the pop music landscape.<br /><br />\\"End Of Night\\" builds on \\"Just Say Yes\\" by being more mid-tempo and with a few additional layers of production. In fact, it is one of the most obvious single-worthy tracks on the album. There is a certain familiarity that emanates from the song's harmony-driven chorus:<br /><br />I feel nothing<br />When you cry<br />I hear nothing<br />See no need to reply<br />I can smile now<br />And turn away<br />Come over here<br />So you can see me walk away<br />And celebrate<br />The end of night<br />The end of night<br /><br />\\"Let's Run Away\\" (currently only available on the album's deluxe version)  is quite similar in its overall sound to \\"End Of Night\\" and is definitely one of the album's highlights. \\"Let Us Move On\\" is the musical twin of \\"Here With Me\\" - Dido's second single from her debut album \\"No Angel\\". For those that liked \\"Here with me\\", \\"Let Us Move On\\" will be everything they wanted and more. It features a rap segment by Kendrick Lamar. Frankly, the song would have worked without Lamar's bit just fine too.<br /><br />Dido's vocal competency is probably best showcased on the album's acoustic track \\"Sitting On The Roof of the world\\". While the song by itself is not particularly memorable , it does demonstrate that Dido just might be one of the finest and most unique female vocalists of the modern era of pop music.<br /><br />Despite the album's few missed opportunities, Dido still has plenty to offer on \\"Girl Who Got Away\\". She may have also gained some significant ground in regaining some of the \\"fan\\" goodwill that she lost with her \\"Safe Trip Home\\" album. I sincerely hope she continues to make music for many years to come. The pop world needs more artists like her - unique, classy, talented, and artistically fearless., once again, that the treatment of a song can undermine its merits.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I wasn't sure about this one when I got it, and the first levels are really simple. But, the more complex puzzles are challenging.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I fell in love with the tv series for Pretty Little Liars but I never really bothered with the books. I figured they would turn me off the series but that's so far from the truth! I am in love! These books are even more addicting than the show but it's as if they're two variations that go well together.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|I have read a fair amount of Beatle books and almost didn't pick this one up.  I couldn't be more pleased with the Geoff Emerick.  He had a great perspective on what it was like being in the control booth while Beatles were recording songs.  What is even more entertaining is how he reminds us how &#34;Basic&#34; recording was in the 60's and what they had to do as engineers to create the Beatle sound.  The whole idea of what is standard practice today was initiated somewhere and Mr. Emerick sheds light on many of the discoveries.  His assessment of each of the Beatles personalities are derived by his interaction with them.  I found the book very entertaining and was sorry to reach the ending chapter.  If you thought you heard it all, you really haven't ..... read this book.
0307744434|4.0|I really loved this book. I have never been to a circus but Erin Morgenstern put my fantasy circus to words. Every page that I turned put me into a different world with endless possibilities for the imagination to grab. The story held my attention till the every last page with an ending that I do not think could have ended differently. I know now that if I was to ever go to a circus, I would be extremely disappointed because I know it will never be like this.
B0047VSW30|3.0|This movie has great sets, costumes, and visual effects, but, ironically, while its main message is about escaping prejudice and asking questions, it presents a fairly prejudiced view of the ancient world. It mainly plays into modern prejudices which have a tendency to overly idealize female figures from the past and to also overly demonize Christianity relative to its time and to demonize both religious and political authorities of any sort. I don't think that Hypatia herself would be very happy (looking down from one of Plotinus' upper celestial realms?) if viewers didn't ask some questions and research the truth behind these historical characters and places (what really happened to the Great Library of Alexandria? Was Christianity in the 4th century best characterized as a violent mob of intolerant fanatics? Was Hypatia really that young and good-looking? How was Christianity different from prior religions in regards to encouraging violence, or in regards to the importance of women in public community (in Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc)? If there's one good message in this movie, it's that, like Hypatia, we should ask questions.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I'd better at once make it clear that \\"No Angel\\" and \\"Life for Rent\\" still are my favorite Dido albums. Both albums contain such a rare large number of great songs and I always gladly return to these her first two albums.<br /><br />You had to wait for five years on Dido's third album \\"Safe Trip Home\\" from 2008. Personal events in Didos life were reflected on this album, which had a distinctly sad tone and which was significantly less commercial.<br /><br />\\"Safe Trip Home\\" contained fewer \\"big\\" songs than the first two albums, but it has a warm and honest feel that compensates the less distinctive songwriting. Songs like \\"Look No Further\\", \\"Quiet Times\\" and \\"Northern Skies\\" are individually very strong songs, which also helps to lift this album.<br /><br />Now five years have passed again, and Dido has just released her fourth album. One can hardly say that her music has taken a revolutionary turn, but there is generally a far more easy mood on the album, which is also to a greater extent than previously is spiced with electronic elements.<br /><br />I do, however, feel, like iI did with \\"Safe Trip Home\\", that some songs sound a little too similar, especially if you choose deleuxe version, which contains six extra tracks.<br /><br />\\"No Freedom\\" is a great pop song which has a sound close to the \\"Life For Rent\\" album.<br /><br />The quiet and almost acoustic \\"Sitting on the Roof of the World\\", is for me another the album's great songs.<br /><br />Some songs take longer to embrace. Among the songs that have grown on me are \\"Loveless Hearts\\" and \\"End of Night\\".<br /><br />On the bonus disc, which generally keeps the level of CD 1 songs like \\"All I See\\" and \\"Lost\\" are my preliminary favorites.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I had brain surgery in 2009, so I definitely can relate to movies like this. Especially the movie 50 50. But aside from being able to connect with this movie, I thought it was very funny throughout the whole movie, while still being able to tell its story. I saw this movie in Theaters, but I definitely plan on buying the Blu-ray also.<br /><br />I guess you can say I'm somewhat picky when it comes to which Blu-rays I buy. Either the graphics have to be GORGEOUS, like Avatar, Battleship, Total Recall, etc. Or it has to be a really good movie. This movie is very good, and the woman is sexy, so why wouldn't I want that in Blu-ray? lol.
B008P9M614|1.0|When I pulled the DVD's out of the box a pile of broken plastic fell into my lap. EVERY SINGLE case was broken!
B005MQW5RI|5.0|The 3d is really good , almost feel like I'm at the movie! I have bought other 3d movies b4 but this one definitely beat most on the quality , plus it a really good movie aswell
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I just love this book I can't wait until the house of Hades comes out I have read all of Rick riordins  books
0230749615|5.0|and the video is as wonderful. Love both the Gruffalo and the follow up - Gruffalo's Child. HIGHLY recommend for all ages!
044024613X|4.0|This is a pretty good book.  It's an interesting story well told.  Just who the villain is is shifty: is it the one accused of murder or the ambitious prosecutor or someone else?  I would recommend this book for a good read.
B00821PCJS|5.0|An awesome blend of drama and mans struggle to retain its humanity mixed  with the perfect amount of science fiction thrown in.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed playing.Good story with creepy graphics. Hidden objects werenot too difficult and the mini games were challenging but not hard to figure out. It was over too quickly though!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very fast moving,lots of twists to the plot.  I kept changing my mind about the characters.  I  have recommended this book to friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Even though this story has an interesting and unusual plot, I found the ending rather unbelievable.  I actually almost threw the book against the wall when I finished it.  I felt robbed of a believable novel.  Too many things were left up in the air and Amy should be in jail as far as I could see.  I don't understand how this book has remained on the bestseller list for so long!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|What can you daylight Harry Potter's in one collection. Success at Christmas. Everyone has enjoyed a movie marathon that did not disappoint
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|it was a really good movie i would watch it over n over. might reant it again it was good
B00000FC5H|5.0|This isn't my favorite genre of music, but my friends love dance music.  If you remember,  music was in a battle between those who liked the softer side such as the Eagles, AC/DC hard rockers, Southern rock; 38Special, Allman Bros, etc.etc.<br />To me, EW&F was the class of there genre of music.  We all know there songs, rythem, sythsizer melody blends.
0788803743|5.0|Loved it
B005M0R4X4|5.0|We love Downton Abbey on blu ray! What a visual treat. However, I bought this version because it claimed to be the \\"uncut version\\". I've watched it twice now and I don't see anything new that I didn't see on PBS.  Can anyone explain to me why they can call this \\"uncut\\"????
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Loved it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another excellent Nicholas Sparks book. Just finished reading it and cannot wait to see the movie. You will not be able to put this book down.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I did not find the book as convincing as its author deems it to be.  It was very similar to other NDEs that I've read about.  The medical preamble was somewhat tedious to get through.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Great sound. Great band. Two really great song on this album. Just need to get some more of their albums.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I had a little trouble getting started but the development of the characters is excellent and I couldn't put it down. Great read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really good game. the only thing i don't like is some of the games are really difficult to complete.
1939416019|2.0|At first the book took off like a classic fantasy story, boy wants to become soldier, discovers he has magic powers and a destiny. OK, I have done it before, but its a classic for a reason. Unfortunately every time we turn around the main character is thrown into another \\"crazy\\" and \\"lucky\\" circumstance where through powers or by destiny, he prevails. While he is \\"training\\" to be a knight, I think he only spends about a day in training, the rest are spent in \\"crazy\\" circumstances left and right.<br /><br />While I like the characters, the plot is too ham-handed and contrived, and the characters are too stereotypical for my tastes.
B005GRTNXC|2.0|Her first 2 cds were awesome. Disappointed in this one. Every song sounds the same. Maybe next time Leona :-(
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Cheap and gets the job done. What more can you ask for. I would definitely buy this product next time I need it.
B002A9VJ40|3.0|It's so corny that it is funny today. This movie was all the rage when it came out. I know because I remember when it did. Now it's lame. And not because it's not filled with CGI and all of todays other movie trickery but because I'm older and it's so predicatable. Anyway if you want a good laugh while walking down memory land by all means watch it. and if you want a real laugh, watch &#34;Hot Shots&#34; immediately after
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We enjoyed the trilogy of &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; and were hoping for &#34;The Hobbit.&#34;  I like Jackson's choice of actor for Bilbo better than his choice of actor for Frodo.  The film is not true to the book, of course, but the movie is a pleasant entertainment.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool  I recommend it to people 6 and up its so fun.any one who likes horse's get this game
B00992CF6W|3.0|after I stopped playing to go to sleep I came back to my game me and my friend worked together on and my house, tools, chests, and everything else was gone as if I had reset my world to the begining.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|This is an ultimate of love and dedication.<br />Worth the watch.<br />Jude Law is a favorite and Nicole Kidman is.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I haven't read a book that had my romantic heart fluttering in a long time. Perfect rhythm and just the right length. Thanks Ms. Kelly.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I really like this movie!<br />Foreign movies have such great stories to tell.<br />Watched it many times before buying it.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|The first thing I noticed was the graphic quality. Its pretty obvious that Candy Rufus Games was trying to make a cheaper port for Minecraft PE. I don't blame, nor do I condemn. I would do the same. My only issue is ultimately is the controls. Especially for a higher end tablet, I feel like I'm either gonna break my screen trying do move a block, or slide right off of it with the look axis. Its slippery and dense. I know its still an alpha release, but so is MCPE, but Mojang has a better contol system. I wouldn't waste your time. Just go for Pocket Edition. Its well worth the 7 dollars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|He put this on the kindle and his tablet and now can work on his projects all ove the place. Doesn't tie in to his other versions, but he can still &#34;practice gathering supplies
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was the best book out of the Heroes of Olympus series so far. Can't wait for the House of Hades
B0081336FO|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Sherlock Holmes.. this just extended that further.  While I was visiting a co-worker in Calgary, he and his wife had been watching Season 1 and were talking about how good of a show it was.  I sat down and watched the first/second episode.. at that time I was hooked on this series.<br /><br />I just finished up Season 2 last night -- what a fantastic show!  I really hope they continue with it.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This movie is a classic, good movie to show why it is good stay true to yourself and your convictions.
B009LGO88E|4.0|it is also bulky and heavy. it does make the 3DS much more comfortable in controls though. after 2 hours of mario 3d land my hands were bothering me i have carpal tunnel, this fixed it, but its a bit heavier, and i dont like that the second analog works with like 1-2 games thats it. also the L and R button replacements dont work, unless the game supports a second analog, so you have to reach in to hit the shoulder buttons still. this is good for games that dont require much use of L and R, but terrible for games that do.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great book til the last page. I'm pretty sure that this is the most frustrating ending I have ever come across. Disappointing.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I love Bon Jovi, the old songs as well as the new.  Over the years, they have evolved in their style and songwriting to show their maturity and attention to the world around them.  I think for the majority of us who have &#34;grown up&#34; with them, we can really relate to what becomes important to us as we grow older and so self-involved.  Thanks guys, for another great album that I can turn up and sing along with, while at the same time causing me to think about others!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Look. This game is definitely a great game. Very addictive and better than the first. But recently it crashed on me so I had uninstall and install again. Although, this game is amazing!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I loved this disc so much it will be played at my wedding, I will be walking to &#34;ho hey &#34; and &#34; flowers in her hair&#34;. Loved that I could listen to the whole cd before it was delivered. Thanks amazon
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|you shouldn't get this app there are 2 adds for a movie each time you pass a level and it annoys the heck out of me don't get this app get one without adds
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Terrible. I thought it would be funny to watch the over-dramatic acting. And it was, for about 45 minutes. After Anne Hathaway died things became much less entertaining. Also, the movie went into standard definition for about an hour even though the internet connection was fine. Always happens when renting from Amazon.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|Do not buy again from Doremi Music USA. The case was broken and the CD has been played for so many times.
B007STXHTM|5.0|This product shipped fast and looks great! Can't wait to use it in Mexico in a few months for snorkeling at the Riviera Maya barrier reef!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I don't like some of the creepy images in the hidden object scenes, nor do I like the eerie whispering sound effects. I just turned t hose off and was able to enjoy it better.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Awesome movie. Makes you laugh till your sides hurt and you pissed yourself a little. Not for young kids under 16.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I wish it were longer, but it's a good bang for your buck. I Can't wait for the next one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love this bag, it is perfectly designed for cameras with kits. I love that material which was used in this bag are solid and great. I love it. Will recommend it for my photographer friends cuz inside the bag there are many sections for lenses.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this game I cant stop playing it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish there was a second one I am almost done with this one
B00002ZMNV|5.0|The Metallica's perfomance in this DVD is simple amazing... a quite unique concert... I realy recommend it... I love it
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This movie is amazing it is so worth buying this movie it is a great movie it is worth the money
B0062KMDZ2|3.0|Yes, Brendan Fraser is far from an academy award actor and this silly story has been told quite enough times by now. But just the same, it was good campy fun watching it in 3d at home (our first foray into 3d movies on the new 73&#34; 3d TV). There were a number of cool 'pop out' scenes to really get you going; in one scene, someone lit a road flare, and while gripping it in hand, they suddenly thrust their hand straight at the viewer, my wife and I both jumped out of the way as it looked so real coming straight out of the screen into your face. In another scene we caught ourselves swatting our arms as these little bird like creatures seemed to infiltrate our living room! Kids would probably really enjoy this experience.<br /><br />Alas, I'm looking way forward to watching the 3d's Avatar and Life of Pi!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool. I love this game. It is very fun.love it love it love it.I love it so much.you will like it to like me.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This was a gift and to be honest I have not seen this movie , it's not fair to give you my opinion. I was told it's very action packed and a great addition ... Suspencful , get it !!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great graphics, challenging puzzles, and a great storyline. Can't wait for next one. Keep up the good work.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|this move was spectacular, spiritual and well worth it. I can see why it won so many awards .<br />Get this for your cd library .
0765350386|5.0|This book kept me turning the pages--stayed in bed this morning until I finished it. The only bad thing about it--I immediately wanted to read the second book in the series. And that's what a good series does--leaves you wanting more.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Finally something worth watching on TV it gets the boot!<br />Does not say much for the types of programs the &#34;elite&#34; believe WE want.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this, heartbreaking at times, humbling, nicely developed characters, overall a good read.  I will be reading more books by this author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so great !!!!!!!!!!! that's all I have to say I love it. make more please I have nothing more. to say this sucks and then and then and the and then
B00969GFFU|5.0|Brilliant writing style that immediately draws you into the strangest, most beautiful story of a modern family in modern messed up times.  Yet hopeful in the end.
0913866156|5.0|Yes, this is one of the best decks of all time. Watch for sales though cause you can find it cheap!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Awesome movie! great graphics, amazing story line and amazing character development. I really like the symbolism and the moral of the film.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I totally recommend this book  im beginning book two. Its an amazing plot, and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did. Flew thru it in 3 days
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I could not get this thing to sharpen anything. I tried this on several different knives, but had no success! Do not recommend this for anything. Do not waste your money.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This volume is great! I literally read this in 2 hours. It is worth the time! It's interesting to see the difference between the comics and the show.
B00846WWVM|4.0|Fun game!  I'm coordinatedly challenged so it's probably not very difficult for kids, but I'm finding it a little bit so!
1401311091|5.0|Liked the  story line with all the twists and t urns in the plot. Looking forward to more in the coming books!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I ever played who ever made this game you sued be rich in you are very lucky and you sued make a subway surfers 2. And my name is Jonathan Cooper look me up on my Facebook page.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This game is a great way to blow off some time.I enjoyed the ability to change the challenges so easily.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app because I use it for homework and its awesome so I hope u get this app
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The greatest app I've ever downloaded. Instant addiction, not to mention the fact that you get dinosaur babies. Hatch them, feed them, evolve them. Friggin awesome!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good book. I wasn't really wanting to read it but after the first chapter I was hooked
B008PPUMVY|1.0|Yes, I love Frank Zappa... and most of his changes and bands,  HOWEVER, I can not get myself to like Joe's Garage, and I know why.  Notice I said \\"most\\" of his bands?????  This particular band that began and finished Joe's Garage did not have the SOUL that his bands before or after had.  Was it Ike Willis?  Was Zappa drained from Lather and the Lather/Herb Cohen confrontation????  Was he just tired?  All I know is that even Orchestral Favorites, Sleep Dirt, Studio Tan ( what a concept, right?), and Live in New York were better than Joe's Garage ..... They were better even though they were supposedly chopped and diced by Warner Brothers....Frank Zappa was a genius, a man with a CLUE, and this is evident from his earliest works right on through..... to Joe's Garage. Finito.  Johnny P.  A Vaultmeister....
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Halle is HOT! Not to mention her outfit :-)<br /><br />Story interesting, she overheard something, which she didn't<br /><br />Not saleena but meow!
0394800192|5.0|I remember reading this when I was a child, so I bought the board book version for my 2yo. We were happily reading along and then - to me at least - it stopped abruptly. I was disappointed and my son was underwhelmed. So I got this copy for him; THIS is what I remembered loving as a kid! The rhythm is fun, the story is silly, and my son loves to count the apples.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: the board book stops when the lion, tiger, and dog each get 10 apples on their heads, and skips the roller skates. The paper-page version keeps going, and is at least twice as long. In short: buy this, not that.
0688014291|4.0|Plenty of relevant advice, improve relationships with employees and develope management skills. Fantastic book with an amazing narrative, extremely well written and a real pleasure to read.
B00589WJB6|4.0|These guys have a modern form of garage rock 'n' soul. Very good! They are good live and on record!
B000M343BM|5.0|then again, if you haven't seen this movie, you've probably been living under a rock for the past twenty years.  This movie is truly one of the classics.  Great characters, fun plot, and i still get chills every time at the end of the movie.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have to say that I am more of a dystopian kinda girl but when a friend recommended the Fever Series, I was blown away. Not only was I not able to put the books down, I was extremely upset when the series finally ended. :(  You will fall in love with both Barrons and Mac equally.  I don't care what genre you prefer, a good read is a good read and this series is a MUST READ!
8866131105|5.0|Got this as a new years gift for my BF and this stuff works great! Plenty of space on each day, and each day is divided into hours. Too bad the hours stop at like 10 or 11, cuz we all are so used to work till 3 or 4 in the morning!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|So far it is a really good app. But I'm having trouble getting the music. wedded. need. more info. donn that part.  other the. that its very good
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am usually not a post-apocalyptic fan, but this really held my attention. Mr. Howey is also a really good writer. I certainly will be reading the Shift omnibus!
1401300529|3.0|being a retired military person , I was looking forward to a book about the hardships endured by the troops.  Instead , I got a book about MacArthur and the politics of the period. Disappointed......
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heroes and villains, love and loss--and the costuming--in a beautiful setting!  What will Violet say next?  I can't wait for Season 3!
B004I744AS|5.0|Finally got a dictionary that does what the $$$$ provides.  Great for my crossword usage.  I also use it everyday usage and find it very useable.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Good set up for the future Marvel movies. Needed more story background on Odin and Asgard but they can always do that in the Thor sequels. But if you enjoy the world of Marvel Comics to movies then you will enjoy this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a fun game I rate it 5 stars you should keep this game if you download it.
B0074EIQUG|3.0|but I found it did not live up to my expectations. I didn't return it, but it was somewhat disappointing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great season!  Love the characters and so much is happening.  It's going to be a long wait for the next season.  Excellent show!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great Movie, comes in blue-ray, 2-part 3-D disc, has a speacial features disc, and a regular D.V.D disk. Makes the perfect gift for anyone. I Highly Recomend It.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I liked the previous 2 seasons better.  The finale was a little disappointing but can't wait for Season 4.  A lot of unexpected things happen on this season though.
B008M721MS|5.0|Skype is the greatest thing. When my son was deployed to Iraq and even since he came back it has helped us to still feel close to one another.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have only completed a little bit but do far so good! graphics are nice on the kindle fire, and the items are not super easy to find.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I gave this book a five. It contains the perfect emotions words. Ad John Green&#60;3 I fell in love with Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster
B009WO7NQO|5.0|4 year old boy did not want to stop playing. It was mentally fun and challenging for him to go to the many levels.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|its a fun game.  the whole point of it is to eat and upgrade your shark.  in the end your goal is to be become the great white shark.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is a loud amplifier. It's true to its name: it greatly amplifies your audio. I pair up an ATH-m50 with this FiiO E11 whenever I want to convert my headphone to a full-pledge speaker. It's surprisingly loud and clear!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|It is a good show that is a re-imagining of the classic fairytales.  I sat down with others to watch it and quickly was hooked.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It's a great adapter that works when you need one for your Macbook Pro Retina 2013. There's no negative feedback I can think of with this item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. but it can get a little lagey other wise amazing and is just so fun to play
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My grandson loves this game,he is 8 and has been playing all week . Great free game ,lots of fun for the family
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The HD connection to Amazon was great.  I watch mostly the free Amazon Prime movies and I almost forgot my PIN.  For a James Bond movie it was ok.  I'm glad I did not go see this in a theater.  If you are a hard core James Bond fan then you have already seen this, it you are looking for an action packed movie then this one is pretty standard.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|It was exactly what I ordered but it just didn't work with my iPad.  My iPad said it didn't have enough power for the accessories.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I bought this game but was unable do download to my kindle fire! Should have been warned before I made my purchase!
B00A8ZZ2Z0|3.0|Why only three stars? It's a good album. Sadly for me nothing sticks out as memorable except for the first two songs. Gambling with the Devil, for me, was a masterpiece on the other hand Straight out of hell has everything but the memorable, catchy riffs and lyrics. Recommended of course but the magic is watered down.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|was surprised how much my fiancee and i liked this show. its very well done. was put off by the graphic sex scenes and could frankly do without so many, but the story lines and the characters you love to hate sucked us in. wish that a season was more than 10 episodes. we're on season 2 now and they just go so fast.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Justin has stepped out of the box and it is awesome...something for everyone in this CD!  I recommend this to all ages!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good, fun. Bit like cafe world. Quality of picture on Kindle Fire he is amazing. Probably more a kids game. Thanks.
B0095P31L6|2.0|I found this movie to be very dark, depressing and lacking much of any interest. My son and his friends weren't terribly impressed, either, and didn't finish watching it, thankfully!
0800177177|4.0|I liked the picture quality, i liked the costumes, and stuff. But I felt something was missing. I love Ms. Rider in this movie and the other actors as well..... But, something was missing, just don't know what it is...... I love the quote,&#34;I've crossed oceans of time to find you&#34;, great pickup line;) Gentleman, but needed something else.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|great tool to look up words one is not sure of the meaning and quite convenient as well; it's great
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was just as good as Kate Morton's previous books.  It was very twisty, turny and i could not put it down.  I highly recommend it.
B003MC5N28|3.0|I understand why this book is so popular--it has a great premise and the writing style is simple and effective. I was hooked after the firs  chapter and read the whole thing in one sitting.<br />A warning though: the book ends very abruptly and does not solve any of the dilemmas that the author builds up to through the first 70% of the book. What lies outside of the community? Are all of the other communities in the world the same as the one Jonas leaves? How is it that the citizens are unable to see color? What happens to Jonas's family?<br />The bottom line is that the book is a great read, but the ending is very unsatisfying. Basically, Jonas runs away from the oppressive society he grew up in. We don't get to find out where he ends up. He doesn't make any differences in his society. His whole struggle is essentially useless.<br />Maybe these questions are answered in the sequels, but it looks like the other books in the series are separate stories focusing on different characters.<br />Three stars for a great idea and and a well written book. Two stars off for meaninglessness.
B0058O84G0|4.0|This is an entertaining book, I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because there were moments I was bored with the descriptions of battles and fights. Around 200 pages could have been cut here.
B00123KF54|5.0|A must have for the CSN Enthusiast, Some of their best work was in this album. Can't beat the bonus tracks
B005I6EVUG|4.0|This is a very pretty case.  My one problem is I think I need an elastic band to hold it closed.  Maybe that is the old lady in me, but that is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Seaon 2 kept me engaged thoughout all the episodes.  Maggie Smith is amazing in her role. I recomend watching Season 1 first.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I absolutely love this movie but I gave the 3D release only 3 stars. After watching the extended cut version on blue ray, which I own, you can't go back to watching the theatrical release again. The movie is so much more complete and more comprehensive in the extended form. For example you see Jake on earth and he is revieled as a man that is in his heart a defender of the downtrodden when he comes to the rescue of a woman who is being abused, although she does not appreciate the act.<br />In the theatrical release they never really explain how Natiri knows English. The extended cut give you more background into how Grace taught English and we learn that Natiri's sister was killed by the humans. That is why when we first see Natiri she draws her bow and is ready to kill Jake, until the sprite intervenes.<br />Shortly after Jake learns to fly his banshee, he says \\"I was a stone cold hunter\\" It never made sense in the original release, until you see the extended cut because the line comes after a very dramatic hunting sequence where Jake and Tsute both kill massive stermbeasts from the air riding their banshees.<br />There are several other extended cut sequence that make the film more enjoyable and fill the story holes from the original. The extended version special features has some scenes that did not make it into either release. There are a few scene that explore Norm and Trudy's relationship, including a bed scene.<br />Bottom line, I don't think the 3D version is worth it if you have not seen the directors extended version yet. See the extend version first and then if you really must, then get the 3D version it's only 20 bucks after all.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My wife and I loved the second series, quality was great and we are now waiting patiently for the next series to become available.We also were pleased by the prompt service especially coming all the way from the states.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the most boringest app ever I hate if you love  facebook this app will make you don't like it. I'm not kidding I hate facebook now. I did like it at first then I was like XD ya facebook rocks! now I'm like :/ boring. don't get this app
B000FCK65W|4.0|This book takes an interesting twist by telling a story through the eyes of a child in a family that struggles through life during very trying times. Makes you realize how often we all take the simple things in life for granted. Very powerfully written.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|THIS GAME IS SOOOOOO BORING MY SISTER GOT IT AND SHE SAID SHE LOVED IT AND IM SITTING THERE LIKE WHAT THA AND SHE IS LIKE NO DON'T DELETE IT AND IM LIKE OK THEN SHE GO TO EAT AND THEN SHE LOOKED ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND SHE IS LIKE WHERE IS MY GAME? AND IM LIKE I DON'T KNOW THEN I WAKKED AWAY BUT I REALLY DELETED IT IT WAS BORING SAVE YIME AND DON'T GET THIS APP. ITS BORING BTW I LOVE CAMERON BOYCE AND TAYLOR SWIFT OK BYE PEOPLE :) FYI IM A GIRL BYE!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It is a wonderfully illustrated game. It is simply fun. I especially love the cats and rocket cars. I also love the fact that you can interact and enjoy the characters.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An engaging read, but by the end I wanted to kill both of the main characters myself. Not sure if that means the author did her job or not. One could argue that she did as she got me to feel very strongly about the two lead characters. On the other hand - if I was supposed to feel sympathy for either one of them, I did not.
159668139X|5.0|I bought this book because I got my first loom from someone in town.  I have to say this is a great step by step guide, it goes over everything from types of shuttles, different warping methods, how to weave and has some patterns.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Great concept and plot, does not focus on the annoying sub-stories about how the future is different, good action scenes.  Would watch again.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|the  movie  is  awesome  and  people should  see it<br />cause  this  movie  shows  how love  can be forever  and  break  all  the rules
B008RA3X5E|4.0|i like the app but would like to see the current time displayed on the home page instead of 8:05.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Truth be told, I had no expectations when I first saw this movie in theaters.  I didn't even truly have a slight interest in the other LoTR films either.<br /><br />I have to say though, after seeing The Hobbit, I truly enjoyed it.  It is a great story with full characters and beautiful imagery.  Seeing this film made me go back and watch the other LoTR films (which I enjoyed immensely).  I've even gone as far as to start reading the books now.  The Hobbit peaked my interest into the universe that is known as Middle Earth and I highly recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My kids love this game, they play it all the time.  I have like 3 or 4 different angry birds on my kindle.  The game is very cute and fun to play, I would recommend it to all.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not sure why people think this is so great, it is porn pure and simple. I was influenced to get this one because some of my friends raved about it. As I was reading it at work one day during a break and I felt my mouth gape open, I thought Holy Crap! I cant read this at work! it is porn and doesnt really interest me.....
B0000SVW8G|5.0|worked well just what we ordered.  packaged well.  came within the time frame specified.  not sure what else to say.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I Love this CD!!! I turn it on and up loud and dance around the house! It has the really great songs from the movie which I also love!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Loved this season and love the whole show. Everything about it is wonderful! The cast is amazing and the script is really good too!
B0015AARJI|1.0|The product I received is not a Sony PS3 controller.  It's from a Chinese manufactured imposter.  The picture on the product page is completely misleading.  No where on the packaging or the actual product does it say &#34;Sony&#34;.  Even the packaging has &#34;Double Shock&#34; and &#34;PS III&#34; on it rather than DualShock and PS3.  For nearly $50 I expected the real thing.  This product may have been acceptable for $15.  I instantly returned it.  I expected far more for this purchase made from Amazon, LLC.  SHAME ON YOU!  Seriously, I just can't believe they think they can pass these fake controllers for the real thing.<br />I'll just make a trip to my local big box store so I can be assured to receive exactly what I pay for next time.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Loved this season and love the whole show. Everything about it is wonderful! The cast is amazing and the script is really good too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great read, wonderful author.  I am looking forward to the conclusion and more work from Mr. Howey.  For what it is worth, I give my highest recommendation for this and the sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cool game I love my horse I have beauty and my sister also likes to feed her didn't cost a thing because it was free.
B00005N6KG|5.0|In general, I prefer over-your head headphones over the other variety. But most of them are so heavy and uncomfortable that I want to shake it off of me pretty quickly. The Sony Ultra Lightweight takes care of the problem - it's truly lightweight and you can adjust the length as well. Price is good, too!
B00BESLT6G|3.0|This movie was okay.  I liked the first one better.  This one was a bit creepier.  I love te toryline though.
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|The game is pretty cool. The game pieces are pretty detailed and heavy. The game cards are funny. I'm not sure what else to say... it's Monopoly lol The only complaints I had was the packaging - which I didn't think was a good reason to take stars off. But the product came really bent, and not just the box. We opened it and the gameboard was bent too.
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|Even though my mailing address is Uk, this DVD is in US or Canada format, and thus unplayable on UK  DVD player. I would have thought this anomaly could have been noticed. Money wasted, unless I go to the trouble to return it .Yours disgruntled, Maurice Mc Elhone
B00008MZ0N|5.0|got here really quick and plays great love this movie will do bussness with this person again in the future.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|10 songs of mediocrity. If you like Suit&Tie, then I would guess you would like this album. Seriously, he came so weak on this. Some tracks even sound the same. JT has an amazing voice but this album is simply not good. Same old verses we've heard from other artists over the years, well these past months actually! I have to give this a 2/5 because disregarding the lyrics, JT's voice itself delivers a smooth and soothing sound. Oh, \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\" is definitely the worst song on the album. The catchy \\"Spaceship Coupe\\" has everything going for it on the other hand.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This game is charming but it lacks an option for lefted play. Lefties will find that their dominant hand obscures the ponies during the mini games.<br />Furthermore the developers' feedback form rejects my email address as invalid and I strongly dislike the requirement for social media connections. Not having Facebook essentially kills one's ability to progress in the game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching a little late in the game but have now completed season and working on season 2.  With Amazon Prime season 2 is free.  There were a couple of buffering issues on the ipad but streaming thorugh my WII console  delivers wonderful sound and video quality.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Cinematography was excellent.  The story was quite good as well.  Overall very enjoyable movie.  Definitely recommend it.  Probably not good for little kids.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator.  First of all it was free,  makes basic calculations as well as advanced, has huge pad so very easy to see, has swipe, copy, memory function.  Highly recommend.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Just another well written novel by one of the best writers in the business. Love Harry and his never say never attitude. Keep them coming Mr. Connelly.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have ever read.  I can't wait to start on the sequel.  This book was recommended to me by a friend in Berlin and I have continued to recommend it to all my friends.  Well worth the time it takes to read this fascinating story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie before reading the book and loved it. Now that I have read the book I cannot WAIT to read the next before the Catching Fire movie releases!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show in my opinion is the best TV show ever made, all genres considered. It has it all, action, drama, romance, violence..... you name it. Nothing I'd change in it and this blu ray looks amazing. The extra stuff is nice too.
B008C1WVJW|5.0|One of the best recordings ever. Iva has really outdone himself on this one with a great collection of songs that really stand the test of time and outstanding vocals. What a great addition to also have the DVD containing concert footage. Icehouse was one of the rare bands made for live performances. This is a must for any collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|We are not talking about a Pollyanna kind of optimism here, no no, instead this is a bit of a grown up version of Perks of Being a Wallflower with characters that you cannot help but love in the end...
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It's an interesting story, but not great and not well written.  The Red Circle and Outlaw Platoon are far better books.
B00BMVTTJ4|3.0|White orc? Violence added? The Hobbit is such a fantastic story I don't understand why all this extra &#34;crap&#34; was added on.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an amazing game! !!!!!!!!  I think everybody should get it. I do think that at certain points it goes to slow.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|I have to say I would never pay the store's $17 for this toy. I bought mine for $0.50 at a yard sale. That said I do really like this toy. My daughter hates tummy time and will scream and flip to her back right away. This toy had her playing on her tummy for a good 15 minutes! As I said I got it at a yard sale and the paint is faded so I'm guessing it's been well loved by several babies. Given that it still functions perfectly. The music plays strongly, the mirror is in great condition and you can still set it between rolling freely and staying still. The light in the head still works perfect too. So this toy is VERY durable. However, for $17 this toy should move on it's own. I also think the promotional pictures could easily lead someone to believe this toy moves on it's own. Still very happy with it, especially at the price I got it for!
B006O6F932|5.0|Bought for my 5 yrs Nice and she just absolutely loved it. and her friends loved it and her parents loved it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I was looking for a replacement of a similar sony product that I had for over 7 years. It was discontinued so I got this pair. I suggest get few more while the cost stays at that price. Its a great sound quality at the price point. I use it in GYM and holds great for heavy use. Only con is i wish the cable is a bit longer
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game for all ages and is constantly coming up with new up grades. Never had any problems with the server. Some of the dragons could be a little easier to breed.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie! My son and I couldnt step away from the tv the whole time! This movie was very gripping .
098555780X|5.0|This book has detailed descriptions and pictures that provide easy instruction for learning how to start fusion ties.  Highly recommended.
B008EKOO46|4.0|Heady and enthralling. &#34;The World Until Yesterday&#34; should be required reading for all. An important addition to the anthropological canon.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I own a few older Macs.  This FireWire 800 to 400 adapter has saved me by allowing me to use Target Mode to get data off the older Macs.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Yes it's risque but it's so much more than that. It's hard to describe. It was such a beautiful story & had all the wonderful fictional characteristics of a love story. The twist at the end was a nice & unexpected (for me anyways) touch to the book. Kept it unique. I definitely recommend it!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was captivating from start to finish. I can't wait to read the second! Don't watch the movie first, it's not nearly as good
159315724X|5.0|Definately a read & re-read. You may read some similar ideas elsewhere, but he lays things out very well & easy to implement. They offered free worksheets online for the exercises he recommends in the book. I would recommend reading it through first then go back & read & implement one chapter at a time.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Im a LOL fan and this is great for a mobile version, and its free! they can improve their grafics a little.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|man  this was excellently done with hopkins starring bigtime!!!  a thriller full of suspense, mind games and action.  really well done.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Patty's grandson LUKAS thinks it is awesome, don't you think so? l mean who thought of Survivalcraft! (Even though l got killed by dogs every time!)<br /><br />LUKAS (10 years old)
B005LAIGWS|5.0|We are very satisfied due to getting it in a reasonable fast time!!!! Disk and disk cover in good shape!!!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I LOVE this cd! It is wonderful! I enjoy the songs and Rod Stewart's voice. I would recommend this CD to everyone!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies! It stinks that they don't make childrens movies quite as good as they used to anymore! These kind of movies had a moral to them, our new kid movies mostly just contain a plot that entertains the audience and that's it! Not to mention the countless innuendos both in todays movies and cartoons!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|Probably one of the worst Disney films I have ever seen. This movie is boring and predictable. Save your money, it's just not worth seeing.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This set of games are enjoyable. The challenge section keeps a person on their toes.  It would be nice to have opponents to play against.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This album really is amazing! The first time I heard SAIL was on the radio, when I was sick of everything on my ipod. I instantly fell in love with the song and immediately bought the album. Naturally, none of the other songs on the record sound like SAIL. At first I was disappointed because the darker edge that sail has was not really found on any of the other tracks. I listened to the record once through and put it down for a while...too long.<br /><br />A friend of mine heard SAIL and wanted to hear more so I let him borrow the album. Of course this reignited my interest and we both went through the album together over about 4 days time. I soon began to realize how each song is unique from the others, yet the entire album is wonderfully arranged and delivered. I could do without the 2nd track, it seems like a silly second intro. Other than that I listen to the album all the way through at least a few times a month. When I want something I can enjoy all the way through, AWOLNATION. When I want something to pick up my spirits, AWOLNATION. When I want to introduce new music to someone, AWOLNATION. If there is ever a doubt or question that goes unanswered, the answer is clearly...AWOLNATION.
B007N85POS|5.0|there are endless hours of angry birds with numerous scenes and levels and levels to unlock.. the whole family loves it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is certainly worthy of masterpiece! I can't seem to get enough of Downton. Well written and very well acted.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|The first track, Slinky Thing, is a great start, but the CD kind of rambles on from there.  I'll buy anything he puts out - the worst of it is better than most everything else - but a bit too clever.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I know this was a true story but the ending still had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have used this and solitaire to feel my free minutes on board airplane. The time passes fast and the games get tougher. Really great games to fill the idle time at home, too, while watching these lame TV shows on the networks!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Disclaimer: I tried using only the spreadsheet application and the word processing application.<br /><br />I have a large spreadsheet of 200+ rows 10 columns, but no real formulas:  I need to filter and sort and to display the sheet by scrolling and zooming.  I get the impression that I am taxing the Kindle's CPU greatly.<br /><br />Disclaimer #2: After much trial-and-error, with little help from the HELP function, I did find SORT and FILTER.  Apparently the strange icon activates both features.  I sure wish the documentation was better.  (And, yes, I did search for \\"sort\\".)<br /><br />There is a strange icon on the screen, but when I clicked on it a messages appeared for a few milliseconds.  The icon consists of a funnel and \\"az\\" arranged vertically.<br /><br />The table feature in the word application lacks a way to extend the table by adding rows.<br /><br />I have to figure out how to replace all EOLs by 2 EOLs (thereby double-spacing a Word document of many hundreds of lines.
B0081L391C|4.0|I didn't expect much the first time I watched this movie, but was pleasantly surprised at all the laugh out loud moments.  I find myself watching it  every now and again, just to get a laugh.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|A great story as only life can write them. Everyone does a superb job in bringing this touching story to the screen.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie had funny moments, but I expected more.  Don't waste your money renting it from Amazon.  Rent it for $1.20 @ Redbox.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Dark Knight Rises did not achieve epic stature, but that is my fault for expecting that it might,  An engaging action drama.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie.  It is entertaining.  I have watched it with her a few times and find myself wanting to watch it to the end.  Worth a look.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very  amazing, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! AWESOMENESS packed in this suspenseful book by Suzanne Collins!
