B007DIQC90|4.0|Great album...definitely worth the buy! Love their unique sounds and even better songs! Was a bit worried about purchasing their first album, but it seriously won't disappoint. I could listen to it all day!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was was absolutely amazing. The story line alone is a great read. I would suggest this to buy only interested women, buy men too.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic! I bought 4 other CD's at the same time and haven't even played the others. I have this CD on constant repeat. All of Ellie's songs are memorable and won't be skipped. Great CD..you won't regret buying her album!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The story is compelling and the characters solid enough for me to be able to feel like I was in the world
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. Pain in butt to review...won't let me type want I want nor will it skip this phase
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I was wondering if it was possible that this movie could really be this bad, with all these A list super hero actors in it, after hearing from others who gave it a bad mention. I just should have passed but like morbid curiosity of watching a train wreck, I couldn't turn away. The plot stunk, the movie was full of shooting and things blowing up and guys getting killed, what else would you expect. I just didn't know how you get all those guys like Sly, Arnold, Bruce, Chuck etc to blend and maybe it just can't happen. If you want ro watch a movie that has all of them in one film that you can see them and enjoy in one movie, then I guess that is a plus, but anything else I just couldn't think of a positive.
B0091REZMW|1.0|i had this app on my smart phone and loved it. it is way different on my kindle... i dislikeit and will be removing it.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I am not a book reader, and I heard that there is a book that this movie was based on, and this film follows the book better than the other movie with Arnold from a few years back. That said, they both were entertaining. I enjoyed them both, and this one I found that although there were some very different concepts of the movie (everything stays happening on Earth on this movie), I liked this just fine. With new technology and special effects, the movie was really neat, but I wouldn't get too cranked comparing it against the earlier one with the Governor.
B00005KARK|5.0|This is a moral movie and can help a little one on their way to a good value system.  My grandson is 3 1/2 yrs. and this movie<br />has sparked some great little conversations between us. Dumbo is a hero for him already.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I am the Stones Authority. I remember seeing this as a midnight movie in 1978. Well, really, I didn't remember much, but then the DVD. Oh yeah. When watching this thing people need to keep in mind that it is 1972. Concerts and big time rock and roll were still evolving - the modest staging is really quite remarkable to behold - even for a major act like the Rolling Stones. As well, the venues from which these performances were pulled to make the full length DVD \\"concert\\" were quite modest as well. They played two shows in Fort Worth and they played two shows in Houston at Hofheinz Pavillion. Now, I don't know much about the venue in Fort Worth, but I can tell you that Hofheinz is a quite small basketball arena on the University of Houston that might seat four thousand. Today it is a dark and dank dump. Whenever I am there I can't help but think - this is where the Stones played? Doesn't seem possible. It wasn't like they were just breaking out and needed the gig! Now, keeping all this in mind, keep also in mind the limitations of the technology of the day - particularly live concert production, both for recording the live music and filming it. Can't be compared with today. Clearly there is no real lighting director on this thing - or it would have never been lit like this for film. There is probably no real director - or the camera angles and shot selections would have been a bit different for sure, but all that aside and looking past all that - as you should - what this film captures is quite amazing. A very tuned up and hungry Rolling Stones in a fairly raw and intimate setting - no frills staging, just the band - blowing it out. This is a time capsule - given that it is 40 years ago. 40 flipping years ago. The Rolling Stones are very good. And this is as good as anything for proof of how good a guitar player Keith is, but, of course, it is also a record of just how amazing the very young Mick Taylor is. And Jagger is no slouch either. The energy is full blast start to finish. Now, they could control that because they were picking and choosing between four shows worth of performances, but still... I can't play this DVD enough. \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Bitch\\" open the \\"show\\" - it is a hell of a one two punch. The version of \\"Dead Flowers\\" is just terrific. \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Love In Vain\\" back to back are wonderful. Taylor's slide on \\"Vain\\" is inspired and the version from the film \\"Gimme Shelter\\" has nothing on this one. But perhaps the absolute dynamite blow you away track - and not a particular favorite of mine, but here it just sets everything on fire - is this version of \\"All Down the Line\\". I've never heard it that good. And it just maybe be the best single live performance of a song captured of the Stones. I mean, it is that good. Jaw dropping good. Bill is just pumping the locomotive - that bass line is just throbbing and there are a couple of down the line shots where you pretty much see the whole band and it is like you are watching one whole organism moving to the groove. It's mind blowing. Taylor smokes it too. It is just nuts. I really could go on and on about this DVD and every track - including Keith's great guitar work on \\"Bye Bye Johnny\\" - even though the camera guys miss a lot of it, you hear it baby. And then the dual closers \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" just leave you wanting more. Oh, to have been there - in that little dump of an arena! After you watch this DVD - and see through the years and technological limitations - there is no band today that carries that kind of energy into a show today, leaves it all out on the stage like they do for these shows. The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World. For a reason.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Item arrived in very good time and is perfect, the box doesn't have any damage. Thanks, made a young lady very happy for Xmas.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Got all the Bond movies. I am a sucker for the franchise. I also like Daniel Craig and the new approach that they are doing with these films. This is the follow on story to \\"Casino Royale\\" and a lot of folks do not like it at all, but I do. It really isn't all that bad. I think its reputation suffers at bit because \\"Casino\\" was so damn good - which is the best Bond movie, or certainly in the top three best Bond movies. It's always tough to follow an act like that. If you like Bond then you will probably enjoy it and forget it. Pick it up cheap from one of the resellers.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book reminded me of 50 shades but in my opinion was better written.  It was a page turner and kept me engaged.  I can't wait until the last one comes out.
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game is pretty straightforward and requires similar strategies as sudoku, but each level ends with a fun picture as the reward! Highly recommended for hours of entertainment.

0307950689|2.0|Book 3, in the Robert Langton series<br /><br />Set in Washington D.C. this thriller follows \\"Angels & Demons \\"and features the rugged, good-looking Harvard \\"symboligist\\" Robert Langdon and is based primary on Freemasonry for its theme and major characters.<br /><br />This story is more of the same formulaic blend of hi-speed chase and mystical rituals that has Robert on a frantic quest for a priestly lore hidden beneath the monuments of Washington DC.<br /><br />Robert is summoned to Washington by his mentor, Peter Solomon, to speak at a prestigious Smithsonian fundraiser but once there his friend is nowhere to be found. He soon finds out he was tricked and lured there for other reasons, moments later, in an adjacent room, screams are heard when the tattooed severed hand of Peter is found.<br /><br />Robert realizes the tattoos are an invitation to unlock mysteries of the ancients....and here we go with the style of writing admirers have come to expect, a very predictable ride followers have been on before. Every few pages the plot arrives at a precipice and then just leaves you hanging. When the action resumes and the tension is on upswing once again we are faced with a barrage of punctuation and italics. I really didn't expect deep thoughts, reach writing, a well-constructed pool of characters or a realistic storyline, nevertheless I was entertained by this rather silly far-fetched mystery.<br /><br />I don't know what Robert has up his sleeve for the next adventure but I will probably have it on my to be read list, a change of pace and a good laugh is always reinvigorating.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved it!!! cant wait for the #2 to come out...would recommend it to anyone that loves hidden object games. please hurry and make #2 !!!!
B009FRG8IW|3.0|This is a review of the Deluxe version, I have not listened to the regular version.  Also, I only own the Deluxe version of Until One, and have not heard the regular version. Until One Deluxe is a 5 star release, it is imaginative and for its time, pretty revolutionary (something not easily accomplished with this type of music).  It is a journey and it is probably the best DJ mix Ive heard since the heyday of Paul Oakenfold.  This Deluxe version however, is not worth the money.  It is a mix mash of songs, some of them re-imagined from Until One, and many of them new.  The problem is, that if not for John Martins amazingly complex and beautiful vocal style and lyrics, the songs are typical of contemporary pop songs ala Rihanna.  If you are tired of the typical disco love song by a female vocal, you are going to hear this album and think \\"Ugh, not more of this again\\".  However like I mention, the John Martin tracks are phenomenal, and I am excitedly awaiting his own album, which, regardless of what style he uses- his voice is amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good strategy game. Multitasking involved. Building, collecting, hunting, and many decisions to make throughout the game. It can be very addictive.
B00940XIGU|4.0|Pretty decent all in all, not his best but not his worst.  The style is getting old however. I dont really have much to add, except that I wonder if I could have saved myself 10$ and just bought the regular version.
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|I really would like to say that I loved the game however after purchase on my kindle fire, I received an error that there was a problem.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am hopelessly in love with this book. Wow.<br />There are no words to describe how I was just effected by this book.<br />I cannot wait to read more from Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />I have no words for this book other then read it!!
B007FZ7QAA|5.0|This is a great album and addition to any Chris Brown Collection BUT you must know that even though it is the Clean version that only means that there are no MAJOR expletives heard, there ARE however PLENTY of songs that are anything but clean as in the things that are said. Words like STRIP, NAKED, SEX, are there and the songs are still graphic!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but this book deserved it!! I can honestly say that this book  is wonderful, it absolutely tugs at your heart strings and keeps you interested until the last page. This book is totally gut wrenching and heartbreaking!! I loved every second of it:):):):):):)
B0052SF6CM|5.0|This is such an amazing Album, I already LOVE Calvin Harris and this album only solidified that. There are only 2 songs that i dont care for but it still is TOTALLY worth having!

B007FEZQF8|5.0|I liked this book because it was a quick read, and close to buy different than the shows. I would recommend this book to people who like The Walking Dead tv shows and people who need something out to read to pass the time
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful book of love and learning about your inner strength.  What power one can have when they overcome fear in all forms.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This book captured plantation life and the codes and secret behaviors that were necessary for daily survival. It also captured the loneliness that the mistress of the house experienced
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I chose to give it 5 stars for a few reasons. One is that I mainly wanted to see the deleted scenes to get a better idea of the movie of what they were trying to accomplish and how the movie would be different with alternate scenes/ending/beginning. Another is the superb quality and sound! Absolutely brilliant on a nice 5.1 surround sound system (a must!).<br /><br />What I learned from looking at the deleted scenes is that the movie was heavily cut down in length and content. That is most likely why it confused so many viewers overall and it's typical hollywood &#34;no more than 2 hrs&#34; movie since the average humans attention span is so short, they just cut down all movies to be short and to the point. I think they could have done a much better job overall especially with the dumb crew members which is the main thing that I wished they did different in this movie. After watching the entire movie in blue ray after watching the commentary/deleted scenes, it did alter my view on the engineers. At first I thought they were just the evil creators of humans but after they seen how we try to play gods in making our own creations, it was no wonder they turned on us to destroy us. They were highly disappointed in us.<br /><br />I highly recommend this blue ray collection to anyone who wants to really get to know more about the movie and watch it in superb quality.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|What can I say - I like Bujold's writing style and her stories.  This is another in her Vorkosigan universe.  Is it space opera? Absolutely.  This woman can write.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|perfect alarm clock app<br />- loud enough<br />- can choose app sounds or music as alarm<br />- cool display<br />- shows current weather<br />- can be used as a clock if you have a stand it would be perfect<br />only one flaw and it has a maximum of just 3 alarms
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love Harry, so any story about him is appreciated.  However, this one was a bit less exciting than the others, but sill compelling.  Maybe Harry is getting past his prime and ready to hang up his badge?  I hope not! I enjoy his relationship with &#34;Mads&#34; and how he is always silently criticizing his parenting skills.  Difficult for him in his line of work and being a single dad.  The story developed really well...finding the bad guys and others who were around in 1992.  Very interesting.  Loved the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very addicting game! Can't seem to get out of this game!!! I would recommend this game to everyone of all ages!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. I grew up with Beatrix Potter's books (well, some of them) and find it interesting to learn about her life and the how her books came to be published.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story that is depicted in this movie, though it is sad. I enjoyed the acting and the beauty of the places where Miss Potter spends her time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was very good just what I would expect for the Olympus saga it had its twist and turns and it lived up to its reputation
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I enjoyed this version of Pride and Prejudice. The story moves quickly, so my husband will watch it with me, but sometimes I miss the full development of the relationships and situations that are explored more in other versions of this story.<br /><br />However, the views and landscapes are breathtaking! The whole movie has the feeling of art through the cinematography and the lighting and the shots used. This is a gorgeous movie and I enjoy watching it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm on level 31 and normally I get rid of games like this fast. But this game is awesome !!!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|Different to what I'm used to reading but enjoyable. I can't wait to read book 2. I highly recommend this trilogy. Well written and exciting story line. Lauren Oliver has.  Great imagination.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I always like G5 games. And this one is no exception. Great game to play in your spare time daily.
B004CURZFC|4.0|Great 3d.  Feels like it wants to be an epic then remembers its a kids movie bout mid way. Good, fun very good cg, top notch transfer.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My son wanted to watch and so I'd the rest of the family so we watched and loved it glad we own it and it is in my library on line. We can watch any time anywhere with wifi. Or down load it to my iPad  great.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Compelling and surprising. This book leads you down a path and suddenly drops you into a sweet and unexpected abyss.
0307719774|5.0|I bought this gift for my wife for Christmas and she loved it because the New Year is supposed to be when you start the book. Excellent gift for someone whose life is just starting.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like the game but the custamers are so inpatient it just gets me mad but other than that the game is cool
B008D30K7E|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time,and the first I have felt the need to review.<br />Allans back story, interspersed with his current adventures, explains a lot about the 20th century, from an inconsolable 9 year old future North Korean dictator to how Truman received the news he was the next president and how Nixon chose the path he did.<br />Meanwhile, in the present, he is chased across Sweden wanted for murder, in the company of an elderly thief, a hot dog stand owner/almost vet/almost doctor/almost architect, an elephant and others in a yellow scania bus.<br />I laughed out loud and had trouble putting this book down, it has everything.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Appaloosa is a great movie! The filming and story line is great if love westerns! Ed Harris does a fantastic job!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written, incredible account...a must read for anyone in homeland security. I could not put the book down once I started it. I highly recommend it!

B009VB97EY|3.0|It was an ok movie. But guess that's to be expected of a stripper type movie, not much story to it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Fabulous!  Of course, I lovre the Phantom and Ramin Karimloo's voice is  superb!
1932735410|5.0|Nobody better prepares candidates for the PMP than Rita. Very concise and practical tips for the exam and real world projects.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Fantastic!  Excellent follow-up to The Phantom!

B00914JWSW|5.0|Great album for Barbra fans, I especially loved &#34;Try to Win a Friend&#34;.  Barbra with a country flavor!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reading plans and being able to have access offline to the bible offline.  Anything that encourages spending time with God's Word is a help.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is such an adorable movie.  My kids love to watch it.  Please keep in mind parents that television should always be monitored and she be used in moderation.  With that being said, Brave is an adorable movie
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing solitaire and my husband put me on to this one.  I just got a new Kindle Fire and that's where I play Sprider.

B00007LTIL|5.0|I love the song &#34;Broke down palace&#34; Its really hare to fine. The rest of the cd is really good too!!
B008G33OJM|3.0|The blu-ray version of this concert is not defective, is just that it was recorded in PAL, which is the European format for videos.  If your blu-ray player is capable of handle both standars (NTSC and/or PAL) you're going to be able to enjoy the full concert.<br /><br />This is a great concert for sure.  It is a MUST-HAVE in your collection!!<br /><br />Enjoy!! (because I did!).
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book isn't worth your time. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about; it's Danielle Steel with spanking.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|This is a good album. It is the type of album that grows on you. For me it was an acquired taste. Once I gave it a couple of listens it really grew on me.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|great movie,  great action,  what a love story.  make you wish you were a vamp,  or a vampire.  maybe even a werewolf.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|couldn't put the book down the first time I read. book # 2 got a little over board how many big &#34;O's&#34; she could have. The second time read the book, I realized I missed a lot of the small details with the story.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Great movie, it's Cher what more should I say. love it, love it, love it,  Great music and dancing.  Cher is timeless.  a total must have for eveyone
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely love Pretty Little Liars. One of the best shows right now. So addicting and the characters are awesome.
B008602KQI|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my 11 yr old granddaughter who is a big Hunger Games fan. She loves the book series and found this movie to be very good.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Takes you on a mini version of the motion picture, which I also loved! Music is great and full of passion!
B009157BWU|5.0|This movie is funny, heart breaking and is full of love. The movie is narrated and he is very funny. I can watch this movie like 20 times in a row.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|The book featured a variety of animals, not just humans. Everyone's dialogue is written in English which makes the nonhuman animals easy to understand. Thus making them easily relatable to those who are looking to connect their own struggles with one of these jungle/non jungle creatures. I hope you find the answers your looking for whilst you enjoy this Kipling classic!
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This is the second part of the movie. It is very entertaining you cant just watch one movie without the other. You have to watch the first one and trust me you will get hooked once you watch it.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|The app opened upside down and I couldn't find anyway to get it right side up.  Yes, I tried changing the orientation of the tablet but that didn't cause it to right itself so I deleted it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fast moving story with thought provoking ideas and very unexpected twists and turns.  I will be anxious to see if there will be additional books to continue this series.  I couldn't put it down.
1476712042|5.0|I really love this book.  Can't wait for the 2nd book in series to come out.  Will definitely re-read this one.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|This is for anybody that loves musical perfection, whether you are a musician or just a music lover. Steve Via at his best. Check it out!

0143143492|5.0|At first I was unsure about the tone of the authors voice in the reading of his book, but after a few minutes I enjoyed it.<br />I love this audiobook.  I feel like I'm hearing the same information over and over, but I'm really not.  I'm comparing this to<br />other theories on life such as those told on The Four Agreement, and Conversation's with God.<br /><br />I find myself on the edge of each CD.  Totally recommend it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was an extremely well done sequel to the Bourne series.  The references back to the last film were very instrumental in the development of this film.  I loved it and will most likely watch it several times.
B004DM0UII|4.0|* Note: This is an Internet radio app. You will not find your local radio stations. This is clearly stated in the description *<br /><br />XiiaLive is a fabulous app. I like the variety of options you're given. You can view your history, tag songs you'd like to remember, set alarms, change the theme, even scan stations.<br /><br />The interface is clean and it offers alternatives when I'm tired of listening to the same songs on my Mp3 player and the radio.<br /><br />One feature I appreciate about TuneIn that this app doesn't have is the ability to easily search using city and state. XiiaLive's results are shown as one long, random list, no categorizing or in any kind of order. And you have to type in the call letters / city yourself instead of conveniently choosing from a list.<br /><br />There is also no way to easily access the app. Instead of being able to simply swipe down the menu and see song info, you have to go all the way into the app from the homepage. Major design flaw and major annoyance.<br /><br />That being said, I've discovered some great online radio stations and new music. I dig this app and recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been waiting for another book series like this. I loved how you developed the characters. Also giving them each their own chapters was great. It wasn't confusing or anything. Awesome, awesome, awesome cookbook must read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i love it feels like im actually  in the story and you never get stuck bc the game helps you throught entire game also they have a bonus game and makes the ending to this game such happy one love it!!!
B003NX76BM|4.0|The Search captvates your attention right away and takes a turn that is not expected.  The book would be better without the use of vulgar four-letter words.  It is not necessary to use such language to write a good book.  I hope Nora Roberts will eliminate such language from her otherwise very skillful writing.  John Grisham's books do not contain such vulgar words, and he is a very successful and well sought author.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I like most davaid Baldacci books and this book did not disappoint me.  Great and fast read.  Take out the minimum word requirement for reviews.  I will not be doing any further reviews that require a specific number of words in order to be considered complete.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This was a purchase as a Christmas gift as one of the items on a list of suggestions. So I am assuming the person likes this group. I haven't heard it so can't comment.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|In my opinion, Lego Technic style building models are some of the most challanging and the most fun kits to build. My child loves these products (and so do I). She learns discipline, organization, and even a bit of engineering while I get to spend quality time helping her with the build. Dad's need more toys like ths. :-)
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Anybody that likes Michael, will love this CD.  Listen to it all the time.  Get it, you won't be dissapointed.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|I watch this movie to see if it was in good condition it seen to freeze up a little at one point in the movie, but over all it was good...
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I loved this album though I could be bias because I am a Hanson fan. I thought most of the songs were rather catchy and the kind that could stay with you for days and days. If you are a Hanson fan then I recommend this album. Also if you aren't a fan but would like to test out their new music I would say try Give A Little or Thinkin Bout Something. Those are the two songs my cousin who is a non-Hanson fan likes.<br /><br />Ratings for all of the Songs<br /><br />Waiting For This-4/5<br />Thinkin Bout Somethin-5/5<br />Kiss Me When You Come Home-5/5<br />Carry You There-4/5<br />Give A Little-5/5<br />Make It Out Alive-4/5<br />And I Waited-5/5<br />Use Me Up-5/5<br />These Walls-5/5<br />Musical Ride-5/5<br />Voice In The Chorus-3/5<br />Me Myself and I-5/5

B00AESN8XY|5.0|how can you go wrong? you get to unleash a plague that kills all humanity! what a great game  it works perfectly  on my kindle fire... my first 5 star review qnd that is saying something.
1594744475|5.0|I want to bring culture into my room without it being a cumbersome process.  The idea of building a bento box with the kids allows me to bring culture into the room while also supporting the kids creativity and supporting hands in learning.  As a home economics teacher the elements of creativity and hands on are important.  This book also support decision making and choice as every picture makes you want to make &#34;that one!&#34;  Great book!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Dracula is one of my favourite books; it's not just a horror story--it's a story about humanity too. it may not be the easiest read for today's casual readers but it's worth it!
0062086529|4.0|I found this book as I was reading something else.  Since I had never read it myself I thought it a good book to have as a reference.  I haven't used it in class yet but I do think it is an iconic book for people of all ages to refer to when thinking about what they want to do with their lives and remembering what is really important in life.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|Love all the games stay up all night playing ,have great offers only complaint i think the jackpots should be easier to win
B0006J28L4|5.0|Malcolm X was the first nonfiction book I every read.  I thought the beginning was pretty boring but the ending was good.  I remember reading the book because it was the first one I read with the art of discipline - I finished it because I said I was going to read it and not because iI enjoyed it so much.  As I reflect on that process and I each the DVD I can appreciate even more the value of following through on your beliefs.  This is a good DVD that will allow for adults and young people to discuss the effects of making choices in your life, influencing the opinions of others, the art of life long learning and how learning can change the choices you make and standing up for what you believe in even if it makes others uncomfortable.  A man's story that is full of rich conversations about topics that will forever be relevant.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Any person who enjoys Les Miserables music will enjoy this DVD.  Great voices and music. I would recommend this DVD.
0984074422|5.0|Bringing cultural intelligent into the classroom is one of my goals.  This book, which was recommend to me, is a wonderful way to show children how what they eat and how much &#34;a dollar goes&#34; means in very real terms around the world.  The pictures are good and the impact it has on kids is immediate.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book  was highly publicized, so I wanted to read it before seeing the movie. I couldn't put it down.
1932100660|5.0|It was not my intent to read this study but after watching Forks Over Knives I couldn't see any way around learning more about the background of the documentary.  I am glad I took the time to read it.  It well worth my time and effort.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take charge of their health and/or those who have kids.  The gift of health is a valuable one.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This movie is a classic.  It's been beloved by countless children and adults since the 1970's..  This introduced the world to Luke, Han, Vader, Obi-Wan, Leia, Jedi,  Light Sabers, The Falcon, R2D2, and C-3PO.  Fans never tire of seeing all of them.  Death Star is the biggest part of this movie - figuratively and literally. It's the reason Leia came to Tattooine.  Why R2 needed to find Obi-Wan. Why Leia was held and tortured.  The duel between Obi-Wan and Vader was aboard the Death Star.  Han, Luke, and Leia bond while escaping the Death. Vader defends it and Luke defeats it.    The Death Star's primary weapon had the power to destroy entire planets - to literally/physically end a world.  The turbo weapons on the outside would have been able to hold off a fleet even without the main weapon.  Also thousands of Tie Fighters were on board.  The whole thing was the size of a moon.  But it wasn't at all like a moon.  It was all metal, smooth, sterile, and inorganic. It was completely lifeless - except for it's population. Over 1 million sentient being were aboard.  Troopers, Officers, Civilian Workers, and Slaves - Including Wookiee Slaves.  It was designed to be invulnerable to attack.  To be able to destroy and defeat anything. It was meant to be so vast and powerful that the sight of it would overpower most people.  It was meant to be completely under Tarkin's control, and the means by which Tarkin, Vader, and the Emperor would rule the entire galaxy by Fear.  The Death Star the the physical embodiment of how the Empire saw itself, and of the Empire's Dominance.  When it was destroyed, that was more than a victory.  It blasted a place into galactic memory.  It marked a major turning point away from the Empire and the Dark Side.  Also: Vader had said &#34;The Ability to destroy a Planet is insignificant next to the Power of the Force.&#34;  Luke proved him right by destroying the Death Star.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I enjoyed the move.  I hope anyone who enjoy action movies would enjoy this one.  Great actorsand they work really well together too.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|ok i don't run across fantasy like this very often.  it's one of the most original takes on magic i've ever run across and how the author takes things into account is fascinating.  if you like modern fantasy you'll love this book.
B009MO57H6|5.0|Some say this movie is not a really good one and had questions about n elevator moving and why.  Well yeah your not giving the movie a five stars.  But if you enjoy action movies and enjoy the action and actresses and actors then I think you will be giving this a five stars like I am.
0670023329|5.0|If you think America should use diplomacy when dealing with a dictator or that America and North Korea are the same you need to read this book.
0399160450|4.0|This 848 page book is typical length for Clancy, but it's almost like someone else wrote this book, because it lacks all the typical Clancy minutiae. Normally if someone were to ask Clancy what time it was, he'd describe a watch. All this incredible detail became a drag about half way through most of his novels and I had decided to quit reading him as a result. Not the case in Threat Vector. It was easy to read (all 848 pages) and enjoyable: I recommend this read, it's not typical Clancy.
159420411X|5.0|I have highly enjoyed Nate's writing style and have learned a lot of interesting things about the way we perceive statistics. It's been a while since my last stats class, this book made what I had forgotten, as well as some topics I hadn't gotten, very accessible.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Pudding Monsters is really fun like Cut The Rope.  The levels are challenging and fun!  It's confusing sometimes, but over all Pudding Monsters is really fun!
0307352145|4.0|This book is ok, not simple reading and not engaging but interesting in a professional way, might improve as I get farther along.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A very strategic fun puzzle game that will keep you entertained! I love the calming peaceful effect it has on me.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I purchased this season 1 of Homeland after hearing so much talk about how good this show is. I dont get Showtime so I purchased the blu ray.  This is the kind of show that makes your eyes bug out of your head when you watch it.  It is thrilling, suspenseful, and it makes you sit and think and try to figure it out like a puzzle.  It's the kind of show that you end up sitting and watching every episode back to back to back to find out what happens next. This show is definitely as good as I have heard and if you like the kind of shoes that keep you on the edge of your seat, you will love this.  After watching season one I ended up calling up my cable provider and convincing them to give me free Showtime for 6 months so I can start watching season 2 On Demand. Highly recommended!!
B001QFZADA|5.0|This was an excellent read ,very informative. I will use what I read here i my everyday life while dealing with others
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good Book, quite entertaining, I couldn't put it down. It was quite well written and exciting.Loved every page of it.
1616614609|5.0|Netrunner can initially seem like it has quite the steep learning curve, and to be honest, it does; however, once you nail down the rules and mechanisms of the game, what you'll find is a highly engaging card game that allows for a high degree of strategy. There is some luck involved--if you're not getting the cards you need, you can't really do much. This is rarely ever much an issue though. Just make sure to pick a faction (whether corp or runner) that suits your play style. Personally I always go with Kate as my runner and Haas-Bioroid or Jinteki as my corporation. Choosing the faction which suits your style makes a huge difference, so make sure to experiment to find which is best for you. Overall, I can't recommend the game enough. I absolutely love it and intend to hold on to it for as long as possible (or until the cards themselves are damaged beyond recognition).
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a very useful tool; I use it daily; it is also quite helpful and I have it on my i-phone.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|What can I say. Figma have done Samus justice, possibly way more justice than nintendo ever did!?<br /><br />Absolutely quality figure, 100% perfect replica from other M, really good articulation, and just overall great product presentation and quality.<br /><br />Big big big bigups Figma. Worth every penny!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I love this soundtrack, but I was really disappointed that it didn't include \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" or \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" (non-epilogue version)... I thought those were two songs were very powerful parts in the movie... It's sad they didn't make it to the Soundtrack.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's free, and there are a LOT of new settings in which to fling a bird.  It's challenging without being impossible.  And it's just fun.  Yes, there are ads, but they are not terribly intrusive.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Of course I knew that Zep had reunited for a 1-off show on 12/10/2007, & as a drummer for 23 years, I was aware that the \\"Son Of Thunder\\" was to take his Father's throne (he made the cover of 'Modern Drummer' magazine's Jan '08 issue)! The day after the show, I watched some horribly sounding & shakey YouTube clips of the show, but @ least I got the jist of the performance. Fast-forward to December 2012! I just recieved my issue of 'DRUM!'magazine & Bonzo is on the cover; a tribute issue to the Thunder Of Drums himself! As I read an interview w/ Jason Bonham recalling the '07 show, I notice a mention of that show being released on a DVD entitled \\"Celebration Day\\"! WHAT?! I instantly go to Amazon.com to search it out-& there it is! Filled w/ excitment, I order it-& make sure to pay for the NEXT DAY shipping! The next morning UPS arrives w/ it! I quickly sit myself in front of my 5.1 audio/video system & pop it in...AMAZING!!! All 16 tracks-from 'Good Times, Bad Times' to 'Rock And Roll'-perfect! Page, Plant & Jonsey still have it in spades, & Jason? He played his Father's drum parts masterfully-note for note, but more importantly he played w/ PASSION & fire! His Father's shoes are HUGE to fill, but Jason was able to succeed & then some! From drummer to drummer, my hatgoes off to him. The Dolby Digital 5.1 was incredible! I felt the bass drum kicks in my chest! I own all of Zep's albums, & have all of their DVDs that have been released, but this 1, despite the absence of Bonzo, may be my favorite! Kudos for the packaging, booklet w/ notes from each band mamber, & the CDs too! The show is split in 2 as far as the audio CDs are concerned-8 tracks per CD. This Set is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who calls themselves a Led Zeppelin fan!
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|I loved this movie! More about a relationship between father and daughter with some baseball thrown in. It was great!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Overall it was a cute and funny movie. If you like singing movies then you will like this one. .
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Once again a movie full of ridiculous sexual &#34;humor.&#34;  Cute in places, but way over done.<br />Four more words required.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read,I recommend it to anyone that is interested in mythology and adventurous books
1469984202|5.0|I hardly ever give 5 stars. I'm one of those annoying people who always finds some room for improvement. That's the case with Wool Omnibus, too, so I originally gave this book 4 stars.<br /><br />But then I smacked myself upside my head. If any book deserves 5 stars, it's the Wool Omnibus. (Hmmm. Maybe I've finally matured.)<br /><br />Although all stories in this volume are well worth reading, the opening story was a particularly good stand-alone. It also does a nice job setting the stage for what follows. Throughout the omnibus, the characters are all three dimensional, thereby making the multiple viewpoint approach very enjoyable.<br /><br />I did lose track of who the main protagonist should be for a little while. Sometimes it seemed there was no \\"good guy;\\" everyone was a little bit in the wrong. But maybe that's reality--and dystopian.<br /><br />I was sometimes pulled out of the story when my suspension of disbelief was overstretched. However, since this is dystopian SF, I shunted such complaints aside by deciding this book is somewhat allegorical and not necessarily required to be realistic.<br /><br />One small problem for me was that, in later parts, potentially exciting scenes were sometimes bogged down with unimportant/uninteresting details. I found myself skimming. But that was a relatively minor issue. I was well pleased with the ending and will certainly be reading future installments of this saga.<br /><br />(Note: I tend to assume \\"dystopian\\" fiction will be depressing. For some reason, this book did not depress me, perhaps because of the well-rounded, often likable characters. Or perhaps because, for this book, \\"dystopian\\" is not the same as \\"hopeless.\\")
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is such an addicting game. The sound effects and graphics are amazing & make it feel like I'm actually playing the game at an arcade! It's quite a challenge to earn prizes and bonus coins! I can't get enough of Coin Dozer!
B001F12J0C|4.0|Fairly fast-paced action movies.  Good plot, a good cast, good locations and good acting.  It does a really good job of taking a somewhat fringe concept and making it realistic.  Particularly the fight sequences.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars because it can relate to any kid that has a hard time getting a date to a dance. I recommend this book to 8-10 year old kids.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I Dl'd the trial and plyed with it util it ran out so purchased the full edition.  I have a C771 Commader and the stock keyboard kind-of blows.  Also being vision impaired it can be a PITA to hit the right keys so texting becomes a ten-minute hate affair to send one sentence at times.<br /><br />SK3 had the option to use voise to text and that is my primary use for it.<br /><br />Let me review the keyboard itself first-not bad, I do make fewer mistakes in typing, however some things like a ' are three or four steps away on the keyboard that is my biggest issue.<br /><br />The voice is supposed to learn.  Ok, I'll see as it goes.  At anyrate it wants me to allow it to access my email, Facebook and so on to learn from me-no thanks, that means less privacy and it constantly monitoring when I type meaning it would likely suck my battery dry.<br /><br />So it has to just learn from me.<br /><br />At any rate the V2T is about 90% correct if one speaks normally and at standard talking speed.  It goes up between 98 and 100% if one enunciaes oneself properly, speaks a bit slower and uses shorter sentences.  You must pre-think what you are going to say because a pause where you say &#34;Uh..&#34; or &#34;Hmmm...&#34; may come out looking rather silly as the AI reinterprets it into some word that does not go with the sentence.<br /><br />SW3 has good ratings and I thought enough of it to purchase.  With those minor caveats and [[hopefully]] it having the avility to improve I do think it is a lifesaver for someoe like me who hates typing/texting-I am a photographer and models and clients seem to love to text so life is what it is and one must adapt.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down!! It was better than the first by far! The ending definitely keeps me interested in finishing the trilogy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's great to play when you are sick and no one wants to come around you. :(<br />It doesn't take a lot of effort and it can wait for throwing ups while playing.
0446554995|4.0|Overall, another well done Agent Pendergast novel. It was a little tedious at one point, but they quickly moved on. It does wrap up one story line, creates another and provides some additional background on one of the recurring characters. A good read.
B004JMZWMG|5.0|I'm just replacing my old album and wasn't sure I could even find this on cd.  I received my order quickly.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made.  Set during WWII, it tells the story of two star crossed lovers,  negotiating Nazism, patriotic duty,  secrets, love and friendship... Bogey at his best,  Bergman is ethereal and the supporting cast is outstanding!  You won't be disappointed.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I wished it worked but it is very hard to use on a kindle fire. The kindle needs A G.P.S
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Anyone who loved Pollyanna will also love Pollyanna Grows Up. The Glad Girl is back, and just as charming. As always, there are misunderstandings because people make assumptions about each other rather than actually communicating, but if people actually communicated, there wouldn't be any books or movies or sitcoms. The ending of this book has enough misunderstandings to be worthy of any episode of Three 's Company.
B0094LV1D6|4.0|Certainly not my first time watching it, but really enjoyed it again.  Watched it with my 11 year old son.
B003L20IHO|5.0|This movie will tug at your heart, make you laugh and cry at the same time, shock and dismay, and all in all a great film for all ages.  The lead character, played by Zac Efron, was genuine, believable and dramatic.  The scenes of the racing was exciting and made you feel like you were right in the middle of the race.  The twist was shocking at first, mysterious later, and resolved with will power by each character.  Zac is the brother that everyone trys to aspire to.  This is an excellent movie!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I can not ware to get it I have herd that it is fun -Riley. Elizabeth. rohr I am 15 years. old
B0091UA5E6|2.0|For an action movie, it needs a lot more action and a lot less bad drama and cheesy dialogue. Pass.
B0009P5YXO|1.0|This toy fell apart within minutes of opening the box. Made of cheap plastic. It looked great but don't be fooled. I do not reccomed buying!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Best .99 cents I've spent in a long time.  I loved this book.  My wife is reading it.  I loved the story of the policeman investigating the burglary of her house and thought the burglar had cleaned them out because their house was so empty.  Everyone is in a different spot as far as how many possessions they think are necessary/desirable, but Miss Minimalist gives you lots to think about in regard to your possessions.  I highly recommend this book.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|I bought this cover for the Kindle I bought for my son. It keeps the Kindle from getting damaged and basic enough for a Kid to use.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I like anything by Steve Tyrell - wish he made more cd's.  Also, like all the American Songbook cd's by Rod Stewart.  The Christmas cd got bad reviews in the paper, but I liked it.  As for Moonrise Kingdom - my son recommended it, and I thought it was just kooky.  Saw in today's paper it's up for an award for I think original screenplay.  Just my opinion!
B009E3EY38|5.0|First of all there could only be a few reasons that you didn't think this rocked. Either your Dvd / sound system needs an upgrade, you never really were a Led Zeppelin fan or your hearing and vision is impaired.<br />  I really thought the blue ray dvd rocked from beginning to end. Yeah ok they are older'er, but they all seemed to really enjoy each other and what it was they were doing.<br />And it showed in every aspect in my opinion of the performance.<br />It sounded great and I think the song choices were unique and very well put together, along with the sound and the video it was on point.<br />I have been listening to Led Zep since 1974 and to see them together again , enjoying what they were doing and putting something together that made me say F'n aye after almost every song makes me want more. One could only hope !<br />  If you have enjoyed them  and the music for as long as I have you have to have this in your collection !  They put musicians their age to shame! And ones that are much younger, a definite legend of our time and performers that will likely never be seen again !<br /><br />Worth every penny !
B000PC6A3E|5.0|A real super hero movie, real man with no super powers!!! Great beginning to an amazing trilogy!! Swear to me!!!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Christmas classic and definitely a must watch on Christmas eve in my opinion with your little ones or even adults!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a fun game. It is a nice idea to allow you to pick a winning game. Sometimes I like to actually win a game.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|It was a great movie! Good storyline for kids and big kids! Only problem I had was it stopped in the middle of loading the movie and in the middle of watching it and so I ended up having to buy it again...
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I enjoy all the twists and turns this has.  Just when I think I have it figured out, no I don't.
B008OOYALE|5.0|its very fun. i enjoy playing it and helping others playing it out, however; there is a problem with the kindle fire version. you cant buy/breed for the virtue/pink dragons or pink hybrids.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooooooooo addictive it is a great time killer anyone who doesn't have this app is stupid so if U R reading my review and you don't have it buy it right now! you are missing out on a lot of fun ..........
B004QX07G4|5.0|A  great book to curl up with and get taken away.  A nice break from World War II novels and such...
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I rated this book a 5 because it tied the other two together.  I did not want to put it down.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|dylan is a great artist and i like this albums songs not my favorite album not yet anyway but these things grow on you

B001QD5OSS|3.0|It was a pretty good movie. I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching it. I'd watch it again sometime.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I *love* this game!  I'm not usually into games but decided to try this  out on my new kindle fire out of curiosity.  Before I realized it, I had been playing for three hours!  Wow!  Honestly, I only stopped due to the one negative about this game - it isn't actually free!  They give you just enough play time to get you hooked and then suddenly you can't play anymore until you pay $2.99 to unlock the rest of the game.  That was a huge letdown considering the description says the game is free rather than a trial.  Very misleading...  This one negative is the only reason I felt I couldn't give the game a full five stars.<br /><br />With that being said, I need to finish this review quickly so I can go  pay to unlock the rest if the game!  Yes, it's that good.  Great spooky storyline, great graphics, customizable difficulty level, neat puzzles that actually make you think a bit...  Lots of great features packed into an addictive little game and even great for us horror film or fiction lovers that aren't typically gamers.  Check it out!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is perfect for putting a quick utility edge on a knife when you don't have time to sharpen it properly.  It's great for sharpening serrated edges, too.  SJS Commercial shipped this within hours of me ordering it and I can’t say enough about their customer service.  I will definitely do business with them again.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game is super fun for brony fans its a game that entertains me a lot this is not a rip off
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was really action packed it was a really good price of writing I want you to read this book
B005ZUR724|5.0|Having been a former.WOW player I am amazed at its similarities!!! Great game if u like the role playing type.game! My husband and I can play together on our kindles and enjoy it... runs flawlessly!!!
B00AAX68HG|1.0|So I just started to download  the game and while it was downloading on my kindle fire hd you know how on the dip you press on it and it comes down it wasn't the and it said it was downloading at the the app store so when it was installing It just disappeared and  said download again so that's why I recommend you not to buy this app and that why I give it one star.
B008J05EL8|1.0|The OfficeSuite Font Package does not work.  It will not open, and the office suite it is supposed to enhance doesn't even recognize it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! I couldn't stop reading until I was done! I can't wait to read the next one... going to start it now!
0425252868|5.0|The story of Franz and Charlie is one for the ages and is definitely inspiring for those of us who have served in uniform during a time of conflict or in a combat environment.  Through this story the author really drove home some of the realities and sacrifices made by combat veterans and the human experience in a chaotic environment such as the skies over Germany during World War II.  I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book and I'm sure I will read it more than a few times.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have this &#34;app&#34; on my Kindle Fire HD, but I am not sure I would really call it an app. I was looking for something to have a more user friendly FB experience than I was getting just using the Silk browser. But this app doesn't look any different from what I see when I access FB on the web using Silk. I'm not sure what the benefit of this thing is other than as a shortcut.
B000QCSA54|3.0|I liked this book, but it is more of a book about view points.  It does not give you any step by step instructions.  All in all, I enjoyed reading this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was as nervous as Ana to read this book and found myself as anxious and scared to keep reading! I loved and hated the ending, one as passionately as the other. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|been following this series all along.  Good movie.  Wife liked it also.  blah blah, stuipd 16 words needed thingy needs to go.
B009JZTOG8|3.0|I'm not a big fan of fairy tales but I enjoy the blending of reality and fantasy, plus it's nice to know a character a little bit by only hearing their name.<br /><br />My gripes with this show are the following:<br /><br />They keep trying to make this point that love conquers all but I know this isn't true but it's good to give into a fantasy every once in a while, right?<br /><br />The good characters in the story also keep treating these despicable characters with the utmost respect and kindness, possibly out of some hope in changing them but then they don't even try to help them to be better people which is a good reflection of modern society and how it has imperfectly accepted pacifism.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Love it all over again on Mobile. This is the classic Dreamcast game that you know and love for fans of the original - one of the first dial up online experiences on a gaming console. Train your brain with this game. It's fun, odd, and dare I say it; cute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good story. Interesting read I have never seen the movie but liked the book.  I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Two more words
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Will not load my news feed at all.  Takes a long time to switch between anything. This app really needs help.  I was excited to see that Kindle finally had a facebook app only to be highly disappointed :(.  Please fix it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typical Grisham and almost impossible to stop reading. It takes twists and turns that are unexpected and has  a surprise ending that is completely unexpected. Very easy book to read more than once.  Highly recommended if you want a great story that holds your interest right up to the end.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I love this show, and I order this as a gift.  Great way of spending some time at home and laugh!!!
0670026603|5.0|I took a chance buying this book.  In the fist few chapters you gain a very good understanding of Louisa, Will, and the families.  They pull you in and challenge you with there own individuality.  I chuckled, I laughed, and I cried while reading this story.<br /><br />Excellent writing Jojo Moyes!<br /><br />I plan on reading more of your books!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have not laugh so much in years, this show is really entertaining. I have watch every episode and I don't get tired of it!!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a wonderfully written true story.  I was interested to find out that most of the German airmen were against the Hitler regime and that they had a higher respect for human life than even some of the Americans.
B00APUQKDG|4.0|This movie was good! The word I guess I would use for Rob in this Movie is &#34;RAW&#34;! Definitely showed a broader range of Robs acting abilities! In the beginning I was sort of lost as to what the movie was about but over all I got the meaning of what the movie was about! I Like Robert Pattinson and  believe he is really a talented actor and would like to see him in many more movies to come! I Think he is Gorgeous!
030759565X|5.0|I have been following smitten kitchen for years. I pre-ordered this book as soon as it was announced on Mrs. Perelman's blog. Along with a lot of loyal smitten kitchen followers I was originally drawn in with the photography of honest, pure food. This book is an amazing extension of the blog filled with amusing stories, real-life practical cooking times, and yes, stunning photos of food.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son's and I are hooked on this series...never watched it when it ran in real time...but we love the fact that we are able to catch up on Amazon. Now we are counting the days until the series resumes in Feb. Not a series for young kids...however my 13 yr old and 19 yr old both enjoy it. More gruesome than I normally would watch, but I love the actors and am hooked into the story  line. Can't wait to see what happens.
B001U887VU|5.0|I really like these crocs shoes they are warm ,easy to put on and a great deal for the winter..would recommend for any one who loves Crocs...

B005ZMTXMY|5.0|will younger kids may not grasp the concept of the movie, they will love russell, carl and dug.  adults will become teary eyed at the love story of carl and ellie. great movie
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My five year old daughter loves lps. Downloaded this to her new kindle and was slowing her how  to play. One of the quests required she make a friend, so now mommy and daddy are playing so she can play with friends. We are all enjoying. playing it together.
0316187216|5.0|Abercrombie is the only author I put on level with George RR Martin, and this is my favorite of his books so far. The pacing is relentless, and the reader's connection to the characters deep. I've had the pleasure of getting to know the gritty world created from Abercrombie's deliciously depraved mind, which added much to the joy of this book for me, but Red Country easily stands on its own. That said, a working history with the true identity of Lamb is a major bonus. This is the kind of book that makes life a little better. Knowing that you have this gem waiting for you to pick up during down times, or otherwise sneak to during up times is good for one's constitution. I particularly enjoyed the western, frontier themes of the novel and the diligent, well-informed homage Abercrombie shows to the genre. Highly recommended. I look forward to the inevitable film adaptation one day.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I just love this CD. Celine's voice is so soft. The songs are beautiful and I love Anne Geddes' work.  I bought it for my niece who just had a baby girl. Her husband is a photographer so I thought that this would be the perfect CD. It is out of print so I was glad to get it here.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Entire transaction was excellent and the DVD was very good becuase it has no commercials and you don't have to wait a week between episodes.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a very very good game, some of the levels are really hard but all are doable, I can feel my brain working (ha ha)  it's  a lot of fun, recommended.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|This one had an original story line, excellent animation and enough visual jokes to engage the whole family. None of the nudge, nudge, wink, wink inappropriate humor that goes over the heads of the kids watching, but titillates the adults (thank goodness!). I really enjoyed this one, so did the kids.

0525953728|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my brother-in-law, he specifically requested it.  Book arrived within a week.  The price was excellent.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book comprises a series of letters by Eva, the mother of Kevin who killed 7 of his classmates, a teacher and a cafeteria worker at his school, to her estranged husband Franklin. Told exclusively from the perspective of the mother, the story offers an insightful narrative into Kevin's childhood and asks the question whether some children are destined to \\"go bad\\". A series of childhood incidents are conveyed and Eva is left wondering whether it is her fault that Kevin went on a murderous rampage or whether he would have done so regardless of his upbringing.<br /><br />The book starts slowly, in fact it took me months (during which I finished a number of other books) to reach 20%. Once Kevin is born, the story dramatically picks up pace and becomes very interesting and by about 50% it was a struggle to put the book down. The reader feels the frustration of Eva and sympathises with her. Yet, in the early stages of Kevin's childhood is also left wondering precisely what the other side of the story might be or if Eva's viewpoint is not clouded. However, by the time Kevin is 10, the reader is in no doubt that Kevin's behaviour is indeed as deliberate and calculated as his mother suggests. While no explanation or excuse is offered for the massacre of his classmates, the story evokes powerful emotions, questions and gets the reader thinking. What are the warning signs for a child who poses a threat to his/her fellow students? Is there even such a thing as classic warning signs? It is undoubtedly a fantastic novel designed to get one thinking about child-parent relationships, parental interaction and relationships and even society as a whole.<br /><br />Very often, authors will add a twist in the tale which end up being predictable or in some instances spoils the story altogether. However, the twist at the end of this book was very well executed and I honestly did not see it coming. The twist also adds another subtle layer to the story which then leaves the reader pondering long after finishing the book since now the story can be analysed from an entirely different perspective than while reading the book.<br /><br />There are only two negative comments I can give about the book. Firstly, as previously mentioned it takes long to get invested in the book. Secondly, the author has a beautiful writing style but often uses very \\"flowery\\" language.  While I am also a lover of words and enjoy authors with an extensive vocabulary who challenge their readers, there were often entire passages which were written in convoluted language and had to be read multiple times before the meaning thereof could be grasped. I feel that the author could have found middle ground in this instance by still employing the beautiful writing style but simplifying the language without losing meaning or using only everyday, run-of-the-mill vocabulary.<br /><br />\\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" is a brilliant novel and is highly recommended.
B003ZTQN1I|3.0|I was disappointed that the main songs were not sung by Leighton Meester or Garrett Hedlund.  They did a fabulous job in the motion picture.  Faith Hill ended up singing on the CD, and I gotta say, her version was pale and uninspired.
B006YC74E8|1.0|would not load, ended up locking up my fire hd, was a lesson in frustration futility that I did not need.  spent a hour on trying to get it to load and another hour trying to unfreeze
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Very predictable but OK. Nothing great and the same plot line that you expect from this author's writing style....a little drawn out. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I've owned world of goo on other platforms, so it's the same game nothing more nothing less. It's still a great game but I would have like to see some changes, especially for the tablet format. It seems everything was simply scaled down, even the buttons and some of them are now way to small. The retry screen only has a &#34;retry&#34; and a &#34;cancel&#34; button, they're about 10 pixels high, barely clickable. Other than similar failures of UI guidelines the game itself plays great. It would have been nice to see it take advantage of the accelerometer or touch screen but it's no more than a port, no features added sadly.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Would recommend this book to everyone, especially those with a bent toward the history of slavery and the Civil War. It was a page turner for me and I could really picture the characters and the surroundings portrayed. Loved it. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
B0090P98Z4|5.0|best game iv played for kindle yet. iv noticed that most game from glu are pretty good. iv very happy with this game
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Articulate depiction of Alzheimer's both from the person afflicted and the family dynamics....it was absolutely one of the best books I've read all year!!! It shows the remarkable spirit of one women's journey and how she impacts the lives of all those in her life. A must read!!  Jane P. South Bend, Ind
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I was just happy to catch up with the third season - I couldnt find it on netflix, hulu etc. The show was not as good quality /clear as I was expecting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great story, well developed characters that you come to love and respect . You got the picture of the horrors that people endured in WWII and yet their spirit endured. Highly recommend. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
0525953728|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I'm an avid military supporter and have read many of the published books written by Army Soldiers/Marines/SEALS - this one is tops.  I did not read anything that would violate OPSEC or any other &#34;secret squirrel&#34; the military is hoping to keep secret.  This book kept me wanting to turn the page and read more.  Usually books written by service members are very technical and hard to follow.  This account is factual, down to Earth, tell it like it is and don't sugar coat anything.  I can see why Uncle Sam (more specifically the Obama administration) doesn't like the book, and wants to pull it off the market, because it is clear that the SEALS of this operation didn't have respect for Obama as president, but had to obey his orders as their CIF.  My favorite part of the whole book is when the comrades joked about how they never were invited to the White House for a beer with the CIF (after they were invited by him), and the joke was that they bet their comrade fell for the whole &#34;hope and change&#34; thing too.  Either way, excellent book!  I've encouraged my students to read this book as well.  Girls as well as boys seem to enjoy the first hand account.  God Bless the Troops and bring them home soon!
B00338QENI|5.0|Loved the book and going to hear the author give a lecture at the local college in February regarding the collaboration with the family.I am interested in science and the development of the HELA cells is a remarkable story!! Great Book. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
0345803485|1.0|Disgusting book.  How ANYONE could read this book - especially females - and think this book is &#34;romantic&#34; is beyond me. The book tries to make it look like women should fall in love with any man (weirdo) who wants to dominate and abuse women for pleasure.  How ANY woman would see this as a loving way for a man to respect her is ludicrous.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt and read up to slightly over 200 pages - albeit after page 68 I was 100% turned off - I then skimmed until I reached a contract that was to be signed between both male/female justifying treating each other in a less than respectable way, and at that point the book went into the trash where it belonged.  Don't waste your time reading nonsense.  This author throws in a few words that she must have looked up in a Thesaurus so that we'd think it was intelligently written - guess again - trash is trash no matter how you write it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My all time favorite book....you laugh, you cry, you have every emotion with this wonderful story!!! I had gone back and re-read the book two more times, and I love it MORE each time. FABULOUS. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
0345803507|1.0|I bought all 3 of these based on everyone ranting and raving how &#34;great&#34; they were.  After 200 pages of the first book I tossed all of them in the trash where they belong.  See my review of the first book.  Disgusting.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Good read that was recommended by a friend. I was never aware that his happened in France during World War II, so was interesting piece of history. Jane P. South Bend, Ind
0345803493|1.0|I bought all 3 of these based on everyone ranting and raving how &#34;great&#34; they were.  After 200 pages of the first book I tossed all of them in the trash where they belong.  See my review of the first book.  Disgusting.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This is a book unlike my usual selections. The story was interesting, but did not capture my ongoing need for something of quality. The end of the book was where I wanted the character to be, and i have no interest in reading any further books in the trilogy.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend because he kind of has a little obsession for zombies, and he loves the book. He said he would recommend for anyone who shares his same obsession. :)
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have read pretty much every book Mr. Connelly has written and I have enjoyed most of them, including this one, though some of them felt like Connelly &#34;phoned them in&#34;.<br /><br />Also, Harry,s endless recriminations about his relationship with his daughter did nothing to further the story and became annoying after a while.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this for my sister in law because she really wanted it, and when she opened it for Christmas she was so excited. She says the book was great and she would only recommend it for mature audiences. :)
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I have the actual book from about 3 years ago. My friend worked at a coffee/bookstore and they gave out prototype/sample books from different companies and Shiver was one of the books she brought home with her. =D I tell ya, One of the best reads I had that year. It's fun and really has a great way of making me giddy. Now it makes me want to pull it off the shelf and flip through it!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Kind of predictable but in general a nice concept. The characters were interesting and the story was a good read.
B009ZM74F8|5.0|One of Christian Bale's best movies by far. The introduction of the 'gun kata' as a form of martial art is awesome. I wish there were more movies like this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and the characters! So suspenseful, keeps you interested the entire time. I can't wait for the 2nd half of the season starts!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's been an incredibly long time since I've read something this good, worth every penny!!!<br />I could read it over and over!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Entertaining and unpredictable.  Worth checking out out for a fun read if you like mysterious and crazy all wrapped into one story.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I have 7 & 8 year old girls who have loved this simple game. It has occupied them for hours at a time with no questions of how to do this or that. Simple game they enjoyed!!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Riahana has done it again with this album. She has a song for every instance and moment. Diamond is my favorite
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|i am now a big megadeth fan cause of this set right here and listen to it & treasure it .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading The Hunger Games which helped me visualize the story better when reading it. If you liked the movie you will love this book. You really get to understand Katniss and the issues she has had to live with in her life. The relationships are amazing and the personal conflicts she has once she enters the arena are unforgettable. Highly recommend! I'm a husband, by the way, so this book isn't just for girls.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great value. Great game. Looking forward to playing the others.<br />It's hard  to put down. Very addicting.<br />If you like HOG games this a good one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This story has a great plot, and characters one cares about and becomes invested in - I think these are key to a great story. What makes great writing though is to make the world being created believable, and there was just one thing in the logic of this world I couldn't get past.<br />In a world where the technology is advanced enough for emails, radio signals, and heat-resistant materials that everyone in the silo knows about, I can't fathom that the simple technology of a wench and pulley system would not have been insisted upon by everyone, developed, and used.  It doesn't take a high-tech mind to see the efficiency of having such a thing in that environment and I don't think the desire for one would have been effectively repressed by IT (there certainly doesn't seem to be anything in the Pact regarding talk of what good a bucket tied to a rope would do for moving things up and down the silo!).<br />This fact bothered me a lot as the characters deal with the logistical issues of using stairs for everything.  I couldn't believe it and it made this story less plausible than it could have been.  I hope the author addresses this somehow in future books......
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I love the new way I can instantly watch movies this is the best way to kill time thanks amazon
B002BRRTUO|4.0|It's a fun movie with a great soundtrack! Includes a couple good actors to balance out the pretty ones who aren't so great.
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't think I will ever buy a regular book again the digital world is do much better Whoot to kindle
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book until two weeks ago. It's now in my top five books of all time. It can be best described as Matrix meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with a dash of Snow Crash. I was instantly hooked as I started reading this book and sped through it faster than any book I've read. The characters are deep and interesting, the plot is strong and never slowed. I especially recommend this book to game designers and technologists as I think it paints a fairly accurate picture of the world in ~30 years. I can't really find any fault with the book and I am looking forward to Cline's next book.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Thought this would be a much better movie than it was. Very slow and you see all of the funny parts in the perview
B009JBZH54|4.0|I bought the Dark Knight trilogy as a Christmas gift for my 13-year-old Batman-crazed daughter.  She, my husband, and I watched all 3 movies during the Christmas break (my husband and I had already seen the first 2) and we all really enjoyed them.  In my opinion, the first 2 movies are better than the third (The Dark Knight Rises has several VERY slow sections), but the trilogy is a great option if you enjoy the Batman movies - and it was definitely a great value.  I would recommend this item to a friend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! I would recommend this to anyone who read the first book of the series! I couldn't put it down, any spare second i had I was buried in it.
B005LAII08|3.0|I ordered this collector's edition for my daughter for Christmas.  The DVD plays well and we love the movie (we saw it in the theater last summer).  However, the blue-ray disc (&#34;regular&#34;, not the 3-D version) has a spot in it where the movie gets &#34;stuck&#34;.  I thought it was just a glitch with the blu-ray disc, so I returned the entire collection for another one (which arrived quickly - kudos to Amazon!).  I was disgusted when the &#34;new&#34; blu-ray had the exact same problem.  Apparently the companies who manufacture these products don't care about the quality.  I will be contacting Disney/Pixar directly to complain about the fact that they mass-produced an inferior product.  I still gave the collection 3 stars since the DVD and the &#34;extras&#34; all play well and we truly love the movie - and Amazon's shipping was fantastic!
B007DA2FHG|1.0|I have had real good luck with the streaming service from Amazon.  It works much better than Netflix.  Unfortunately after I purchased this product, I can no longer say that I have had real good luck.  Maybe some day after the Christmas rush I'll be able to view this movie.
0756697875|4.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she loves Legos and Batman is her VERY favorite thing right now.  She really enjoys the book and has spent hours looking through all the different Lego sets that are available.  The Batman figure that comes with the book is great, too!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|A wonderful combining of the past, with the present.  While not everyone from the series is present in this season, it stills brings things into focus of the past-the current-and the future(?)-or not...if things don't work out.  A very enjoyable fantasy based series, about 2 somewhat average joes...and how they came into being.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had higher expectations for this book since it was selected selected as one of the best of 2012.  I found the story line to be disturbing.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|As with many other reviewers, I find that the news feed only shows a few posts. It also won't record my likes. I'd really like to use FB on my Kindle Fire so please get this fixed.
B0099114WO|4.0|Great movie. Have it as a Christmas present and ended up watching it myself. The person who received it loved it to

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book made so many emotions go though me at once. I was happy, mad, sad. It was a short but truly amazing book
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Heart breaking tough story but enjoyed reading it. Looking forward to the next book. Are you ready for it also.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book was very cute although at times not so easy to follow. I liked the story line a lot and of course the happy ending.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The perks of being a wallflower is an amazing book that I would recommend to anyone who is in the mood for a great read about going through your teenager tears. This also helped me because I am not yet in high school and through this book I have learned not to be a wallflower, and do what I want. It also taught me that I shouldn't be afraid of what anybody thinks or feels about me.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was okay... it wasn't that funny as the others... I would give it 3 stars..... Nice enough ending twist.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book a lot better than the second one. It had twists and turns and finally a happy ending for Kat.
B001KZI2WW|4.0|My first pair was Santa Cruz \\"realtree\\" size 12. Fit perfect.<br /><br />Love them, VERY LIGHT, COMFORTABLE and odor resistant.<br /><br />After about 8 months, they were showing more wear than I thought they should....but they were so darn comfortable that I didnt care so I ordered 2 more pair for a black friday buy one get one free sale.<br /><br />Well, these 2 pair were WAY TOO SMALL. They were made in Mexico whereas my other pair was made in China.<br /><br />When I called to return them, they were out of regular santa cruz so I had them send a size 13 of the Santa Crux RX.<br /><br />And they are too big. Im keeping them, but they dont fit as well as my first pair. And part of it is my feet are long & skinny and these shoes are for folks with thicker feet.<br /><br />Cant say enough of the lightness, comfort and the lack of odor. Durability is below average but the positives make up for them.<br /><br />Just wish I could find a pair that fit like my first pair.<br /><br />Oh and I dont particularly like the \\"ruffled\\" look with the threads hanging out. The RX has a more refined look. But neither is particulary good for cold weather. So Id LIKE to be able to wear them out in 20-30 degree weather but I find myself going with the old lace up sneakers instead.<br /><br />They make them with a furry inside but I was afraid that might mess up the sizing even worse. But also, I think the fur would make them smell like my stinky feet and one of the best thing about crocs is the lack of odor.
B001NLCBJI|5.0|Lost in Translation is arguably Bill Murray's best movie to date and has the most memorable start ever! BM is sublime as the jaded middle aged American film star on assignment abroad; in a role he was born to play. Scarlett Johansson is equally convincing as the sensitive and lonely newlywed whose chance meeting with Murray in Tokyo morphs into an unlikely search for love and life's meaning. Old and new Japan as experienced by both outsiders, its glitz and tradition, holds an increasingly beguiling fascination that becomes an intriguing movie theme in itself. The Zen like soundtrack: an eclectic mix of western and oriental song and sound simply magnifies the disjuncture banality and beauty of modern urban Japan. Without doubt repeat viewing of LIT is a pleasure. The DVD I bought (in China) has the soundtrack as an extra.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really having a great time with this game - it reminds me of the Nancy drew games that we play in the computer - highly addictive

B0015DYIH2|5.0|It's too bad that this book in it entirety is the last of the series. Such a good read and I will it. I loved the passion, loyalty, changes in Jacob and the never ending love of Bella and Edward through every challenge.

1439170916|5.0|This detailed book examining the history of our awareness of cancer and how it is treated contains areas of interest to public policy readers.<br /><br />The Surgeon General Luther Terry report linking cigarettes to cancer wakened the public to the dangers of cigarettes. Millions responded by quitting smoking. this was not without controversy. The tobacco industry was politically strong as an employer of many voters in several states and as a lobbying force. The Food and Drug Administration was persuaded not to declare cigarettes as a drug, The Federal Trade Commission did act to restrict cigarette advertising and required health warnings posted on cigarettes. Congress was persuaded by the tobacco industry to tone down the warnings to not include that they can cause cancer.<br /><br />Anti-tobacco activists was spurred into action by the weakened Congressional action. Mary Lasker led a group, along with others, to lobby Congress. She was aided by Senators Lister Hill and Edward Kennedy. Hill retired and scandal diminished Kennedy's effectiveness.<br /><br />A government panel issued in 1970 called for a great national investment in cancer research, A lesser program was eventually approved by Congress and President Nixon.
1594489505|5.0|While not quite as good as the Kite Runner, I put it as a must read with its predessor for those who wish to understand Afganistan, its history and our (USA) place (or non-place) in its ages-old civil. religious and political strife!
B0078XFYDA|4.0|I thought this was a really good read and sped through the book. I do like Richard Dawkins' books and have read a couple of other ones. I did think that this book is probably targeted at a young adult audience as some passages in tend to be over simplified but then he builds up each chapter this way and reveals some interesting facts, byt the end of the chapter I did feel like i had learnt something new.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Best camp stove ever. sturdy, compact and will run on a variety of fuels. I have bought 3 and recommended it to many friends and family, even a couple of strangers.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The writing in this series is best viewed by watching from the first season on through. Just like with &#34;Friends&#34; there are so many inside jokes sprinkled through out that you only pick up on them if you have been watching from the beginning. Now, in their sixth season, the writers have a mature amount of material to deal with it. Loved the Wedding from Space idea. Now that all the boys have someone but Raj, how will that play out? Can't wait to see more. Finally a series where I feel like I belong!
B004I744AS|5.0|I like to keep a dictionary handy because I'm a nerd. Recently, I read a response to a blog comment I made in a news forum stating that I had misused several words ( which the commenter then misspelled). I pulled up this handy app which not only confirmed the spelling and definition, but gave clear usage examples. Thank you, dictionary! Now.. how can I send this app to the person who thinks &quot;albeit&quot; is Albert and &quot;litany&quot; is not even a word? ;)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Its cool how you fly with a jetpack and you can change the jetpacks. My favorite jetpack is the is the steam powered  jetpack.I love this app!!!
B008MX7Z32|3.0|This light is super bright and I enjoy that feature.  However, it doesn't turn or go in different positions so I don't like that.<br />If I am reading or doing a crossword in bed, it tends to fall over because it is a bit top heavy.  But I do appreciate the brightness; I have tried several other book lights that are not bright enough for me to be able to do the puzzles, but this one is.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I am a huge fan of CM I have watched every episode multiple times. I am hooked fan 4 life!!!!

0321885112|5.0|Mike Rohde has put together a great handbook on Sketchnotes.  The book is an easy read with plenty of examples and \\"how-to's\\".  I think the part I like best is that he included lots of examples from other people besides himself.  Seeing the wide range of sketchnote styles helps the reader feel like there is many ways to do sketchnotes or that you have to do it Mike's way to get it right.  Plus you see the range of possibilities and methods.  This really helped me.  Another part that I thought was significant is his emphasis that you don't have to be a great or even good artist to do sketchnotes.  With minimal drawing skills you can begin to get value from the sketchnotes method.  The handbook is wonderfully reproduced and crammed full of ideas to get your creative juices flowing.  Lots to love here and easy to understand.  If you are a visual person like me and taking pages and pages of copious notes just doesn't work for you sketchnotes is the way to go and Mike's book is the best way to get started.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|This product arrived in excellent shape and on time.I gave it as a Christmas gift to a Elm street<br />fan.Nothing beats the orginal Nightmare and all the ones to follow.A gift any fan would love to have.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Ok i am a major minecrafter I thought that these worlds would be bigger I also thought that creative mode for this would have more items and item descriptions. I for  one think the controls are hard to use. The survival is great.overall I think that this is worth 1$ if you have a Xbox360 and 20$ get minecraft Xbox 360 edition
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This arrived in perfect shape and right on time. Would never hought a show about<br />Zombies would leave you hanging for more but it did and i orded the complete 2cd season<br />to go with it.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I've been listening to The Weeknd since his first mixtape, House of Balloons, and I absolutely adore his work. His sound is very individualistic and his voice is gorgeous. He is one of my favorite artists so I would recommend his music to anyone. The album is a great price for the amount of music you receive if you don't already have the mixtapes.
B00000DG1R|5.0|This is awesome for the fan of Duran Duran.Its compiled with favorite songs.<br />This arrived in great shape and in the time given to arrived.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|This movie was hilarious, even more so than Kung-Fu Hustle. However you have to know what your watching...this is a spoof of the old kung-fu movies with a more modern twist (i.e., soccer). The humor is therefore not typical US slapstick, and there are certainly cultural influences to the flavor of the production. If you watch it with that in mind, you will find this to be worth the money.
B004L49K20|5.0|Its been along time since i bought a album by Duran Duran.It was in excellent condition and<br />arrived on time.The album is really good takes you back to their ealier stuff. I liked it and if you like<br /> Duran Duran you will enjoy this.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I like the Movie because it was a real challenge to keep up  with the different level of the dreams. It really made me think about what I thought life is really about.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|My husband found out last night that he's going to be laid off at the end of the month. Last day's gonna be the 26th, 3 weeks from today. I started reading this book before I found out about all this, but this just makes the lessons that much more poignant.    Stayed awake by myself most of the night, though I did sleep for about 4 hours. Wasn't really worrying, just kinda thinking about the situation and considering it from a few different angles. Thought that I probably could be stressed out and nervous about this, but knew that that wouldn't help us solve the problem quicker, so decided not to do that.    My husband seems under pressure, though he was composed about it last night and this morning (though we still prayed together about it multiple times), and he slept pretty well. He knows that he's been thinking about getting a new, better job/career/business for a long time, so we're both taking this as just one extra push forward to get ourselves out there and not wait around for every little thing to fall into place. I've been coming to terms with this for a while as well.    As for me, I'm still in the process of pursuing voice acting as a career (though I haven't e-mailed my demos to agents since I had our baby Alex, since I wanted to rest up for a while), and am working on multiple other projects as well, including writing a couple books (fiction and non-fiction), researching internet marketing (both the niche internet marketing and actually learning how to market on the internet, as they are two VERY different things XD), behavioral psychology, mindset, and probably at least 5 or 6 different other subjects for QUITE a long time, making a miniscule amount of money because who has time for putting it all into place when THERE ARE LITERALLY MILLIONS OF BOOKS I HAVE YET TO READ AND I GOTTA CATCH 'EM ALL?!    So, I decided to stop being a crazy person in that regard (I have, for the last few days, made close to zero progress on the new website/blog I'm buildingbecause I'm having trouble figuring out how to put clickable links in a Wordpress page and WE CAN'T MOVE ON TILL WE GET THAT ALL TAKEN CARE OF, CAN WE?!). So, uh, yeah, I'm gonna start focusing my time more on the things I can do and the things that matter (and that I can leverage) and ask questions from people who can help when I need something taken care of quickly (and I will ask about those LINKS!!! later on today, I already have a couple people in mind, but if anybody here has any ideas, I would certainly love to hear from you. XD). But I just want to be able to do something meaningful and help a lot of people, while also being able to receive a lot of money for it and spending ample amounts of time together as a family as well.    And this will also include widening my scope for a job of my own (as long as it makes financial sense to have someone else take care of the baby, or if my husband can), and help my husband look for a job/career/business as well, and being open to anything greater as well coming along, of course. =)    And if we do end up having to be homeless for a while, in addition to all that I've learned so far about going for the \\"big wins\\" and things that matter, at least I'm also learning from reading this book how to catch and cook pigeons and squirrels. XD    (JUST KIDDING WE PROBABLY WON'T BE HOMELESS PLEASE DON'T WORRY MOM AND DAD OK?!? XD)    But yeah, this is actually a really great book, I'd even say it's more like a user's manual (Tim calls it a \\"choose-your-own adventure\\" book, which I love) to learn basically anything rather than a non-fiction \\"novel\\", which might be where a lot of the confusion seems to be coming from in other reviews, as it can jump around a lot on the topics, since its layout IS more like a manual.    - Liz Chen
031606792X|5.0|worked well, packages came quickly and I loved the service , it is really good product not bad at all, I would recommend it to anyone

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly, going into this novel I was expecting a bit of an easy teen read. However, I couldn't have been more off the mark. This is a remarkable story, and to explain it anymore thoroughly would ruin the experience completely for the next reader. If I can offer any advice it would be to not pass up this gripping story!
B005CQWDT8|1.0|We were excited for the whole blu ray experience and found out that it skips through a lot of the movie.  Not watchable
B000THCKHU|5.0|If you liked Songs From the Wood you'll like Heavy Horses.  They might as well called it Songs from the Wood II.  The best Tull line-up (IMHO)  BArriemore Barlow and Glenn Cornick are the least appreciated drummer and bass player ever in my book.  The folky time period from Minstrel in the Gallery to Stormwatch was my favorite period period and this one falls right in the middle.  Incredibly tight musicianship.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|This book is awesome i love it i can't wait for the next book to come out peace and prosperity
B0063IH60K|5.0|mobilityware makes greatapps use this one on my ipad and iphone and ipods as well. my cats enjoy helping me as well.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Refreshing to find a game without violence, even simulated. Would definitely recommend for all platforms and all ages. My daughter started playing in kindergarden and couldn't put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting into with these books. Im just glad I could download them all on my kindle... waiting for the next book would have killed me!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Frustrating that many products do not show up in the search. Limited useability. Would like to see a more dynamic app from such a rich company.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The book is so much talked about I was curious. Lincoln was dealing with people who were patriots and had the countries well being above there own. Fast forward these people of today with the greed and self interest are traitors
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Sometimes you find remakes that aren't up to par. Not in this case. Susan's renditions of these famous Broadway songs is phenomenal. She really did a fantastic job doing these. The arrangement of Somewhere Over the Rainbow is a bit odd, but that's not her fault. She still sang it great. I love her voice, so happy for her success.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just throwin' the kudos. Great app. Love the straight up calculator. Does what need like an old school calc.  Thx!!
B002WIDRM6|4.0|wonderful record love this group also got the new albun & christmas one, very pleased alway listening. got it in costco tho.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for my partner for Christmas. I saw the boxed set at Target for $34, so there was little difference between the two prices except I found on Amazon it qualified for free shipping and I was sold. Or the books were, lol.<br /><br />Either way, it came earlier than it said it would and I saved a few bucks and another trip to the stores to search for the cheapest prices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Five stars - definitely kept me wanting more! I absolutely can not wait to read the last one - buying it today!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy of books is so awesome. Every woman should read them! Your husband may get tired of you though!!!
B007JWKLP6|5.0|Marty rocks this.  A great great watch.  Buy it now.  It's worth the price, as I've watched it twice !!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is very useful for analyzing your wi-fi signal strength.  Nice interface, easy to use, and just plain cool.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is no doubt addicting but I think it is missing some safety features. Therr are not enough safeguards for purchases. I accidentally purchased land several times due to accidental screen touches It would be much better if there was a smaller and second screen asking if the purchase was truly intended. I lost a lot of money unintentionally.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|That's all I have. Now, to take a break and come back to the second book in a few days.
B001MYIXAC|1.0|Not happy to receive the older version and not the version shown on page. Page mentions: Subtitle Details: This product features the theatrical version of English subtitles. Version received does not have theatrical subtitles, has different cover art, and is a Canadian import copy.  Returning for refund, will have to search elsewhere for corrected version with theatrical subtitles included. Old version has dumbed down subtitles with poor translation.
B000I186FW|5.0|Possibly the best movie that I have ever seen. Natalie Portman with a English accent is a little weird, but still one of the best movies. Love how it portrays the tyranny of the government.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Seasons 1 & 2 were both excellent!  It is as if each character is the star in their own right.
B0086700CM|5.0|you should get this game because its relly fun. and cool you get to get new people and wall paper
B005FITIGO|5.0|I loved this movie -- great ensemble acting.  It starts with an analyst dicovering impending financial disaster for his employer and then moves up the chain of command meeting by meeting as they contemplate what to do and the moral implications.  Altho' we know from recent events what's about to happen, this movie is great at creating tension and drama during the meetings and implementation of the final decision.
B000091BNB|5.0|king diamond is one of the best vocalist and artist musician on his genre<br />no one like kim bendixxxx diamond
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great continuation of the series. Discovering more about these special agents that are genetically altered and the government agency that controls them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The season is wonderful. The way to view the episodes was flawless. I love tv passes. I would use amazon instant video again.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Easy read and enjoyable, I liked how straight to the point this book was,would recommend to anyone who wants go be a better speaker or listener
B006P96PAO|5.0|It's Great. It's Great. for me in any state in this State of Texas or the other 49 States in these United States.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really like this book, because it keeps you from not reading it. Each time you think it's gonna get boring, it get more interesting.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|It's Great. It's Great. for me in any state in this State of Texas or the other 49 States in these United States.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|My wife and I are huge Led Zeppelin fans, and were happy to see this concert offered on Blu-Ray disk.  The 5.1 surround sound is fantastic, and the visuals are breathtaking.  As a guitarist, I was especially blown away by the artistry of Jimmy Page.  The close ups of his fingerwork are astonishing.  By watching this concert on a big screen TV in HD, it is truly the next best thing to being there.  This Blu-Ray & CD package gets a big 5 stars!
B001EBYMB2|5.0|It's Great. It's Great. for me in any state in this State of Texas or the other 49 States in these United States.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read a lot of really great books recently but this one is now at the top of the list. This was amazingly written, thoughtful ,filled with emotion, angst all intertwined right to the very last word. I could not stop turning the pages and just breathed this book in. I have never read a book like this that had me so conflicted in what's right or wrong, but it was without the best book I have ever read . If you are deciding whether or not to read this ,don't wait on  more minute. Worth every second of your life.
B000TGJ8F8|2.0|I didn't realize that this HD DVD wouldn't work in my regular DVD player or my Blu-Ray player.<br />It's worthless to me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book is a bit different than the movie but is great none the less. Excelent for any teenager, great fast read for an adult.
235250080X|5.0|An important book for identifying the equipment used by the US Army during WWII. The books shows a lot of equipment that I have never seen before.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I chose this app for two reasons, it was free and it tells my weather is great design that I can understand.<br />Thank you
141694737X|5.0|I LOVE this little book. My 18 month old daughter loves to &#34;read&#34; and the flaps make it very fun for her. I totally recommend this for any early book lover
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I had not watched the 3D version yet but if the Blu Ray version is an indication of the vewing results, then, I am going to be pleased beyond expectations.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It will take a lot for me NOT to read every single Colleen Hoover book she writes.  He writing style is superb! Excellent character development, keeping them true to form throughout.<br /><br />Hopeless was a painfully beautiful story you'll never want to experience first hand.  You will feel tons of emotions throughout this book and will hope your daughters are lucky enough to find a boy like Holder.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I laughed, I cried. I pondered the human race and felt a deeper gratitude for living in 2013 America. A great and moving book yet I will only ever read it once.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Just like the TV show 'Castle'. Book hold your interest. I like all the Richard Castle series. Can't wait for the next Nikki Heat epidode.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a really different kind of story.  I liked the way it was written.  You feel bad for the husband but then you think he married her.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Oliver Stone is at his best in this page turner. The introduction of a few new characters really breathes life into the old coot. Would have liked a little more detail to the action sequences, but Baldacci seems to focus more on character relationships....and that's a good thing I think.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|This is a very basic editing app. It is okay if you only want to do very easy or basic edits. There are other apps that are much more detailed.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|i LOVE this movie.  The fact that its Disney doesn't even matter.  It's got a good positive message.  Highly recommend.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I liked this season and will also buy the next two seasons.  I would have liked it better if they had stayed with the theme of the book a little closer.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It is an extremely addictive game.  My husband loves it.  The neighbor children love it.  We will have to try the other games in the series.
B008QOH1NG|5.0|Well the boy's made another live dvd and I would say they are still kickin' out the jams quite well!  They play most of their popular one's and a few new ones too. Musicianship is tight and the twin leads and trade off's of Michael & Oz are most excellent, while Tim lays down some cool bass riffage and Robert follows with lots of nice fills. Overall the sound quality sounded pretty amazing on my Yamha 7- channel surround sound system....sending my neighbors screaming for more!!<br />Michael's vocal's have tamed down over the yrs. and he doesent get some of the high notes he once did, but he is pushin' 50, so with that said....he still sound rather awesome and they still put on a good show....plus have not lost any talent whatsoever!<br />This is a good buy for anyone who like high voltage rock'nroll !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing ending. Shows what can happen to the world. I cried! Best series you can probably find. It's not a \\"happily ever after\\" book. It's as radiant as the sun.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|After hearing the awful news of Whitney's death, I rushed to buy a CD. I didn't own any Whitney music at all. I chose this one, and listened in my car for days. I never tire of this compilation. There may be more extensive collections, but for a listener who just wants  some basic Whitney, this fills the bill. I was perfectly content. I was reduced to tears many times, and think I will be forever when I hear &#34;I will Always Love You&#34;...
B007D2XSW0|4.0|no matter what I put on in the extras they will never stay on my pictures but everything else is fine.I bought the app so I am Abel to put on the stickers and things but it never stays on when it loads it, just diapers.I only got it to work three times. but everything else is wonderful great app
B007U4DIM6|4.0|What a good movie to showcase Hispanic culture, including the quinceanera celebration. And if you love chihuahuas, it's a win-win.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is pretty cool I like every thing about it. this is one of the bet games I have ever seen this is amazing!!!!!!!!!!
B001EC3JME|4.0|Nite Ize product is a great product because it is very flexible and sturdy.  I use it at work and it works great.  I can see hands free just place light downward and work.  Hands free and comfort should be in description when buying this product.  I have seen holder that are all plastic similar to this one if you want something different.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|i liked this movie but it was really only mildly funny. worth watching but definitely not one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Too many pop-ups.  But it's free, so what can you do?  I like Mahjong in general, so I'd download it again, I guess
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Grabs your attention on the first page and never lets go. You never know whats going to happen next. So interesting that i read it in 3 days.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Typical of Led Zep.....absolutely fantastic. Another Band from the 70's that keeps on keeping on. Great, awesome, brilliant, excellent, thanks
1451695195|3.0|This book is one of many on this exciting subject.  I've read them all.  What I didn't like about this one, is that the author had a rather odd initial experience that I don't want folks to think is going to happen to them, too.  What happens when we get to the other side is highly personal, and this man's initial experience in my opinion was not pleasant.  What makes his book &#34;special&#34; is that he is a doctor, so that's supposed to make us more willing to believe that Yes Virginia, there IS an Afterlife.  Read Raymond Moody M.D.'s books.  This is but one book on the subject, and if it convinces skeptics, well and good.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I have two big maglites, one  in my kitchen, and one in my truck.  They're really nice lights. and I strive to keep them unmarred - and of course I want them to be instantly available, especially in the dark.  So. one lived in a crowded drawer and the other in a crowded glove-box.  Neither was really satisfactory.  These little brackets are a great solution - the lamps are securely stored, and in a manner which leaves them immune to damage or even marring.  And, the lamps are instantly available, and I have so positioned them that I can reliably find them in the dark.  These brackets - they come in pairs - are really cheap, but  yet they are very well made, and very finely finished.  Pure quality!  They were easy to install, and hold the lamps perfectly.  They are easy to use, yet unfailing at their task of holding the lamps.  These little units are a pure joy as physical objects, especially to a person like myself who is very deep into tools and craft.  And I genuinely believe that the pursuit of perfection in craft is one of the most potent engines of creativity.  I just like these little brackets a lot!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was excellent and constantly keep you wanting more. Can't wait to read the next book. She was able to turn this adventure into a romance, on pin and needles to see what happens.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This recording is so raw and real. I love it. There are certainly \\"prettier\\" recordings of this music out there but this one is a great addition to any les mis collection!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good book I love the hunger games
0375842209|5.0|he loved it! said the book was supposed to be amazing. it got here so fast, awesome!  Good job sender
B0063IH60K|4.0|A good product for free! The pop-ups can be slightly annoying but they only appear at the beginning of the game so do not interrupt whilst you are playing
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this is a HUGE minecraft copycat the controls are awful the one thing you have in here you dont have in the mcpe is the crafting is different, but its the same as the mcpc crafting
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Hey good book lots of action a good amount of romance this will make you never want to put this book down
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First off, whoever said it wasn't a happy ending, it was bad, or Katniss wasn't good in her role. Shut up. It was great, of course! It did have a happy ending and she was good. That's all
0446580848|1.0|I've read all of DeMille's books and collected them in hardcover.  This will be my last.  I'm on page 256 of about 600 and not sure I'll finish.  Cory's humor is more like whining.  You owe me my money back Mr. DeMille.<br /><br />Ok.  I did finish it last night.  Here's my suggestion.  Read the first couple chapters for setup, then skip a couple hundred pages until they get to Yemen.  Read every other page until they leave for Aden and then go from there.  The last couple hundred pages were classic DeMille, but it was a terrible effort to get there.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far one of the best books that I have read in a long time. Very deep. Made waterfalls pour from my eyes. It definitely one of my favorites. I will have no problem rereading this book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a really great book to read. I would recommend reading this book to anyone who likes romance novels.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. The detail was great and he made me feel great about myself because making friends and going through high school is tough but I absolutely loved this book.
0316113506|2.0|Disappointing. The first 20 pages of the book tell the story, the rest is a bunch of mumbling about cells and mytochondia and alike. Basically, if you want to live longer and be smarter - exercise will help. If you want your kids to get better grades at school - exercise in the mornings should help. Exercise clears up our thinking and helps us \\"think better\\". That's pretty much all you will take away from this book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It's addicting. You can't put the book down! I loved the action. It was a truly amazing book. I would recommend it to everyone.
B008CLI4N4|3.0|I think the information sleeve was missing inside, and there were some bends in the DVD set. Somebody definitely tampered with it. Come on amazon!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the upgrade button doesn't work, and sometimes crashes when opening.....when it opens, it works fine.  (five more words required to submit) haha
B009X00E18|5.0|I have similar cover for my kindle fire, so since I love that one. I just had to get this and I love this one too
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is beautiful story about the struggles and hardships faced by teenagers. It shows how even though life can be unfair and confusing there are some things worh living for like love, friendship, and family. It inspires young adults to keep fighting, keep living, and stay strong, because there will always be obstacles in life, but withou th obstaces there woul never be that feeling of overcoming horrible things. So just remember to stay strong.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put it down. It is so intriguing and captivating. Totally obsessed. Read all three in just a few days..
B008ALA6DW|5.0|When your MacBook Air can't get a wifi signal, you will discover that it has no Ethernet jack.<br />(Lots of folks realize that their Air does not come with a CD drive, but very few seem to realize that there is no place to attach an ethernet cable).<br /><br />This device will adapt an ethernet cable to the thunderbolt (aka mini display) port.<br />Works great!<br /><br />Do note, however, that it in your Network preferences, it will appear as Thunderbolt Ethernet instead of Ethernet. But works the same in all other respects.<br /><br />I highly recommend this. No Mac Book Air should be w/out it.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B009MO5G90|4.0|I am probably the minority on this opinion, but I did not think the film was that bad. As others have stated, it did lack a bit in storyline, was more action than anything else. To be honest, I am not unhappy there was a lack of storyline. Most of the movies do not really follow the game, (this seems to go for just about every game made into a movie) and if there was a bit more storyline, I would most likely be disappointed. But that is just my opinion. All you people out there who love a lot of action should check this film out!  There is a WHOLE lotta action in this film . My major con in this film would be the 3D effects. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of 3D in the film.
B0076L9W9Q|3.0|this CD sounds like CRAP. i love this band and their material, but this CD does them no justice whatsoever. there is little or no dynamic range. it is all just very LOUD. one of the things i like most about these guyz are Lzzy's vocals and they are just lost in the mix on this.<br /><br />i have a decent stereo system and perhaps it is too 'revealing', but also have MANY other CDs that sound excellent. not this one. hell, it sounded better on youtube when i previewed it with some cheap headphones before purchasing the CD.<br /><br />love the band, hate the CD. i'm still a fan, but very disappointed with this particular disc. five stars for halestorm, 1 star for the CD, thus 3 stars overall rating...
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This box set is wonderful!  You get the discs in a normal blu-ray case if you want to keep it somewhere else.  You also get a music box that's big enough to store a few pieces of jewelry or other small items.  There is a large book with pictures of the movie and behind the scenes info about the movie and the musical.  It also has some historical info about the real family that I thought was very interesting.  You get a smaller book and some individual pictures in a envelope.  If you are a fan of this movie, I highly recommend this set!  My children have had as much fun looking through it as I have.  They love that it is based on a real family and that they can read about that in the set.  Also, would make a wonderful gift for any fan!
B000M39HB8|5.0|I have loved this movie for years--and always had to search the tv listings around Christmas time to see it. Now I have it whenever I want it!
B001QL5MAA|5.0|I knew Reynold's was famous for Space Opera but it wasn't till I read it that I learned he is master of hard sci-fi as well. Brilliant novel especially considering this was his first
0345803507|2.0|Ana and Christian apparently have sex every 15 minutes, if the book is to be believed. And Ana suggesting he use the crop on her or flog her or tie her up. Really? I think the author could have used a good thesaurus. The dialogue was so repetitive. And can anyone tell me how you \\"look through your lashes\\"?? Ana is always looking or peeking through her lashes. Do her lashes grow straight down in front of her eyes?? Try as I might, I find it impossible to look or peek through my lashes. Mine curl upwards. The suggestion is as silly as saying she peeked through her ears at him. And \\"laters\\"... I got sick of everyone in the book using that. Really just a silly trilogy. If you must read, get it at the library. Don't waste your money.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I always am pleased with the books for my kindle to iPad, much better than wasting trees. The prices are always reasonable, much less than a hardback book. The book was the night circus, I have to admit because or the holidays I have not finished the book.  The Night Circus
1846551455|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my wife who has read all of the other books written by Jo Nesbo.  She was completely blown away with the gift.  It was professionally wrapped and was received as promised.  I would certainly use this book supplier again.  Thanks
B00A03WBVI|5.0|One Direction is amazing, their voices are so individually unique. There are very few albums I can listen to from start to finish and Take Me Home is on it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Quickly lets me know the percentage of my charge also since the horrible charger that can with the kindle no longer works, it lets me know if its actually charging while plugged in cause I was having problems with having an orange light but wasn't charging the kindle.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Have not had it long enough to critique it but what I have done so far, I like it. It is very similar to what I can do on a desktop so it is fun to have on the go.
B007RX32TY|1.0|I don't want to be mean, but I think this music, and the positive reviews call for a dose of tough love.  Too many people fancy themselves music critics with good taste.  They write nice things about mediocre material and it's becoming an epidemic.<br /><br />This group seems to me to be the product of people learning to sing, play instruments, write lyrics and experiment with recording software, synthesizers and electronic drums.  I like the overall dreamy aesthetic.  Props on that aspect of their sense of taste.  Decent mastering.  I also like the record pops, but it is sad that that is one of the things I like most about it.  The pops create a nice ambiance that does enhance the music.  The trouble is that the music needs the enhancement.<br /><br />The singer is weak and breathy in a bad way.  They tried to cover themselves up with cathedrals of reverb.  The music is kinda disco rock meets casio, meets kid playing on the keyboard for the first time.  There is a clear lack of rhythmic sensibility.<br /><br />It's great that it is so easy for almost anyone to mess around with software and relatively cheap microphones and come out with something that sounds like a band, but it doesn't improve the quality of their writing or performances. I honestly think they should just quit making music.<br /><br />Shame on Pitchfork for listing this among some of the better albums of the year.  It is dime a dozen music.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I really do not understand what everyone was looking at that rated this movie more than two stars, because this picture was less than funny it was down right horrible and full of nothing but explicit language.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a amazing the 60th time I read.It was a great book for young avid readers and Harry potter fans
0880796863|3.0|Beautiful pictures, but the minor arcana cards do not have their titles on them.  Ie the two of cups in most decks will say &#34;love&#34; on the card, this deck doesn't have that, just the picture and a number 2.  So if you are very familiar with the tarot this is fine, but if you're more of a beginner you may prefer a deck with these titles on the cards.  The major arcana cards do have their titles on the cards.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love the mystery and puzzle aspect of the game. These are my favorite types of games. I will buy this game and I don't buy too many games so that says a lot.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Not his best but a good read. I am not sure the premium price of $14.99 is worth it any longer.
B002N14GPE|5.0|This was a very good movie.. I definitely did not expect the surprise ending... intense, suspenful and a very a good thriller. Actors were solid.. I would recommend the movie... this is Evil at its' worst!!!

B005NKIQ26|5.0|My daughter loves Justin Bieber for some reason and so this was a perfect Christmas present, even though it has meant I have had to listen to it
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Excellent thought provoking movie. Clive Owens is awesome in it. Great storyline, well directed and Michael Caine shines in it.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It's nothing Seth McFarlane hasn't done before, and it gets really old about half way through. It's. rude, crude, and has no redeeming qualities.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|A charming story that lets you know, a person can't survive in the world alone and it's always good to have someone there.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I feel that I have started to feel that Facebook is something that I don't need in my life anymore!  I enjoy seeing the pictures others put on but I'm thinking about dropping it.
B000002VSN|4.0|Love Whitney with anything she does.  The soundtrack to the movie is outstanding and enjoyed listening to it reminding me of the movie I so enjoyed.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have to say that this is probably my favorite game to play on my Kindle!  It's addicting and easy to play!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Love the guy who sings these songs.  The man is multi lingual and sings like he knows the languages well.  I loved listening
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This version of the movie came out when I was in high school. In fact, it  premiered in Iowa, where Meridith Wilson was from.  Our high school band marched in the parade there, along with other schools bands.  All of us got to so see the movie and it's always held many memories for me.  I'm enjoying having my own copy!
B004EPZ034|5.0|I admit it, I'm a Chipmunks fan but that's because of my husband...  This was a great movie, good plot, and taught a lesson on top of it all!  Even the girl Chipmunks shined in this movie. I feel that this is as good as the first movie they did.<br /><br />Anyone with kids or anyone who is a kid at heart will be charmed by this movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|After comparing this app with other weather apps, I have definitely decided that I like the features of this one the best!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good book. I would have like to read it before watching the movie. I may have given it 4 stars. There is really nothing new or very different not included in the film. I am looking forward to reading the second one, though.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I was not impressed with this app and will probably not be using it.  I like the Weather Channel better.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great series. Kept my attention and had me wanting more. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing read. Enjoy
0307279189|5.0|What a great way to be inspired to get out and run. The book was written very well and it keeps the readers interest to keep turning the pages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG! I loved this book.  At first I really didnt know what to expect and I had no clue what was going to happen next.  Could not put this book down, loved all the characters, felt like I was Sky and Holder ..... well .....Please send him my way!!!<br />MUST Read!!!
B000LW7LOU|5.0|Great movies and awesome scenes. Glad to have it in my collection!<br />A lot of battle scenes that were realistic!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really like this game. it's really fun. I love how you can have neighbors and they can send you stuff if you need it. so what if it asked you to buy stuff with real money! just say no. but because of this, I would not recommend this for a small child. again, very fun game. I enjoy it :)
B003VANOFY|2.0|I'm not going to rip these things apart in a review when I think they are pretty solid, but I think that engineering and customer service are a bit lacking.  That being said, I have a few things that really set me off and I'm going to &#34;touch&#34; on them here.<br /><br />1.  In a world where everyone apparently seems to think that they need to create a new USB style of connector, they don't.  Just ONE person needs to make one that does't suck.  And if you are going to make a new one, make it in a shape where NO ONE can accidentally insert a connector in the wrong way.  It is not Logitech's fault for falling in line with this nonsense, but this headset has a connector type where you must closely inspect both the plug and the socket, try several times, and fail.  This tradition was started with the original USB port, which could not have been less well thought through if the connector had been shaped like a swastika.  I expect more from Logitech.<br /><br />2.  The sound quality is very good, but not outstanding.  Audiophiles will have more to say about that, but I have no further comment.  The bass is solid.  The wireless range is very good ~20 ft, depending on obstructions.  The battery time is OK.  Unlike other sets, you can charge it while using, but how in hell the other sets missed the ball on that I cannot understand.  So its hard to make it a plus, but its less crappy than others in that department if that does anything for you.  This set could knock it out of the park if it had only a few things it is missing:  the charger connector is absurd - a trapezoid 7mm across that can sort of go in and get stuck in the wrong direction is so ***** bad, I cannot believe that this connector exists (it is not a logitech creation, but they unforgivably used it), I would like to speak to its creator's management and push them in front of a bus for not realizing that computer scientists are not in touch with the human machine interface side of electronics.  You can NOT let the same people that work the software end of things come anywhere near the physical design of a plug that customers use, they do not know how to do that.  Even taking all that into account, this connector -  WOW, just WOW.  Logitech should know better.<br /><br />FYI ELECTRONICS COMPANIES - STOP USING THESE CONNECTORS.  30 SECONDS OF HUMAN TESTING WOULD SHOW YOU THAT THE DESIGN OF THE CONNECTOR IS FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED. YOU DID NO TESTING, IT IS OBVIOUS.  HERE'S A HINT - AVOID SYMMETRY.  USE GUIDES TO AVOID CONNECTOR DAMAGE.  KEY THE CONNECTORS IN A WAY THAT HUMANS CAN SEE.<br /><br />3.  As a result, my set is broken because the recessed small rounded trapezoidal slot has been rammed into the device due to time after time of shoving the connector into it with no way of knowing whether the connector was aligned correctly.<br /><br />It is hard to get so many complex things this right and get such important simple things this WRONG.  Logitech has done a solid job with the software, wireless radio aspect, hotkey functionality, surround sound emulation and other areas, which require much more engineering than a plug.  I will not condemn Logitech on this, they are not the ones that created nonsense connectors, so I'll leave it at that.

B00000612P|5.0|I love the Definitive Rod Stewart, but did not get all the songs that I wanted; therefore, I had to buy this CD as well
B0076XIS4O|4.0|As I get older, my tastes in music get more eclectic but my search<br />for new music tends to be disappointed. I've gotten to the point where<br />NPR's \\"All Songs Considered\\" usually provides me with new artists,<br />and that's where I found Grimes.<br /><br />For someone who said they made their album in Garageband, this is quite<br />a unique album. Grimes make FM synthesis (think the DX7 and other 80's synths)<br />cool, which has been a struggle since analog style synths seem to be<br />more popular option in electronic music. The sampler at the end of \\"Oblivion\\"<br />and the single delay synth at the beginning of \\"Be a Body\\" are excellent<br />examples of this, but not the only outstanding uses of it on the album.<br /><br />The other strength of Grimes is her vocal arrangements. They aren't often<br />overly complicated (You'll realize when you listen to this and see live<br />videos of her she's doing a lot of looping),but she does a lot with very<br />little. Many people have complained about her \\"chipmunk voice\\" (\\"Eight\\"),<br />but it's limited to one song as a main vocal. There are also times she<br />hits Minnie Riperton-esque \\"Loving You\\" highs. That surprised the hell out<br />of me. Now, when you put the vocal arrangement and the FM synthesis<br />arrangements together, you realize the brilliance of this album. I've been<br />listening to this album non-stop for over a month now.<br /><br />As much as this album is one of the few albums I loved this year (others<br />include Sleigh Bells \\"Reign of Terror\\" and School of Seven Bell's \\"Ghostery\\")<br />there are some faults. I will admit, I could listen from \\"Genesis\\" to \\"Skin\\" (Songs 2-12)<br />and consider it a solid album on those songs alone. However, all the songs<br />under 2 minutes (with the exception of \\"Eight\\") are weak and act as filler on the<br />album. Also, the Amazon exclusive song \\"Angel\\" and the iTunes exclusive \\"Christmas Song\\"<br />are not worth it either. Some of the songs (mainly the 2 minute ones) are<br />produced poorly and sometimes end unexpectedly. Despite those few errors, this is<br />an excellent album that may surprise you if you usually consider FM synthesis intolerable.<br />If the short pieces weren't on there, this would be 5 stars.he 2 minute ones) are<br />produced poorly and sometimes end unexpectedly.

B009MF56GC|5.0|You have to give all the &#34;over the hill gang&#34; a lot of credit for putting this film together.

031265068X|4.0|Marc Rich got screwed by a government that was out of control.  I thought so at the time, and although this biographer spends too much time on the subject compared to a 'proper' biography, he won't come out and say it.  That seems like it is half the book.<br />I wish that all those pages had instead described some of the deals done by Mr. Rich, the challenges of logistics of trades, the challenges of financing the trades and actually moving the sums around the world, the banks and bankers involved, how the trades were hedged, and even who tried to cheat him or steal from him.  Mr. Rich, if he is trading today, is the only survivor of the previous, and first, generation of oil traders.  Could he not now talk about trades done 30 years ago? About the interaction with old-line grain traders such as Dreyfus, Continental/Fribourg, and Cargill as they took up oil trading?  Or how new-comers like ADM were able to move into traditional commodities like rubber, cocoa, cotton, and sugar?<br />Mr. Rich was good.  I liked the book, one of the best on trading since &#34;Merchants of Grain&#34;, but Mr. Rich's story has yet to be told, and I am afraid it won't be while he is still able to tell it himself.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Although I still prefer reading novels in their more physical state, with ink and paper and more of a presence in one's hands, every now and then I do not mind reading on the Kindle (especially when it is the middle of the night and you just finished reading a book and want the next in the series, but there are no stores open, and you can't wait.)
0374275637|1.0|When you read a psychology book, you first ask yourself 'does this describe me?'  Then you ask 'does this describe anyone I know?'  Then you ask 'does this describe any portion of society that I know?'<br />With negative answers to all three questions, I then wondered where the science was that would save this from a label of 'pop psychology.  Couldn't find it.<br />Couldn't even find recognizable statistics, which is the branch of science used by those who can only observe, rather than make creative connections.<br />Why'd I bother reading half the book?  Because it had been widely referenced by starry-eyed writers for investment trade publications, probably because the author had been given a prize.  As they described it, the author had an explanation for irrational investment behavior, which is supposed to be the norm.<br />Unfortunately, it didn't describe the behavior of the investors whose millions I oversaw.  Does the author manage the tens of millions that were in my custody?  Not likely.  So how could we expect him to have meaningful conclusions?  Or even correct conclusions?<br />At that point I almost gave up, but skimmed the second half in case he had anything of interest to say, whether right or wrong.  Half an hour later I posted the book for resale.

0316228532|5.0|I just finished the book and granted, I did listen to it on CD.  But I loved it!  I read a few chapters of Harry Potter when it first came out but never went back to it. I picked this up from the library on a whim and thought it was great!  I love character driven books and felt this one did a good job of exploring a wide variety of people, particularly the chaos and emotions of those in poverty and substance abuse situations.  I hear people relating their experiences with this all the time in my work and thought J.K. Rowling nailed it.  These stories were true to many people's lives and experiences and I thought similar to other novelists, like Julia Glass, Kate Morton, Pat Conroy, and Barbara Kingsolver who talk about the ugly,complex sides of people and don't simply label them as good or evil.  I hope she continues to write this type of fiction!
0307352145|1.0|She uses less-than-interesting word choice, messy in-text citation and the obnoxious &#34;something something which we will learn about later&#34; ever so prevalent in sloppy, pieced together essays written by unfocused teens.  I was promised a new and interesting insight into introvert lifestyle but it seems I've only been provided with common sense on paper, coupled with ambiguous stories that are only relevant when MADE relevant.  If you're as creative and intelligent as the author claims introverts to be, you wouldn't need some petty self-help book to tell you that.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Dark Arcana: the Carnival is definetly one of the more entertaining games I've played on the Kindle Fire. I would absolutley recommend it to anyone' even if you are just a casual player.
0790729725|4.0|good movie
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game<br />Totally agree that you can see how much the kids love this game and the best possible price
B000MCH5P4|4.0|good movie
146500632X|5.0|This was a christmas present for my daughter. She is absolutely in love with this band and she was so happy to received this calendar. She loved that they had their pictures on their birthday months.
B000089A06|4.0|creepy
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This book is really amazing! Every recipe is so delicious, and you feel like trying every single one.<br />I highly recommend any Ottolenghi book!
B008602KQI|5.0|My nephew asked for it for Christmas, loves it, he was thrilled for  it.  I was thrilled for the price and quick delivery.
B004K00NMG|4.0|This movie was cute, but Rasmussen was great for the adults, but more scary for the little ones.  Imwould not recommend this for. timid children.
B00003CXA2|5.0|looking for the perfect Christmas gift, found this online and he loves it, especially the added 'extras' in this special collector's edition.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter.  We watched it together.  It is a perfect movie for a little girl.  Ther are no scary parts,  just good clean fairy fun.  I loved it and will be buying more of the fairy DVDs in the,future.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I drew frog characters for my stick people! It was cute. Lots of fun achievements to earn after you beat the game. I could easily waist hours on this game, lol.
B005LAIISU|5.0|When there are sequels one is always suspicious that the story will be &#34;same plot, different setting&#34;. This is not the case.  This is a great, fun, original tale.  We, adults and children alike loved it.
1847674844|5.0|Worth every penny! Love the illustrations. he story flows beautifully. More entertaining than I had imagined. Will be buying more of Simon Tofield's work.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This was a gift for my son.  We watched it together.  It was good.  The action was there, the girl was there, if there was no previous Bourne movies it would have been great, but there were previous Bourne movies.  This was not the best Bourne movie.
B008MBXFEM|5.0|Love every song. It flows and captures the movie so brilliantly. I can picture the scenes they belong to and it is brilliant.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas.  She said she had seen it in the movie theater and did not mention anything untoward about it.  I however found the bears quite unsettling for one so young.  She is 3 &3/4 years.  She climbed up in my lap when the bears were fighting. I was able to reassure her, by telling her the bear, which was her mother after a spell was put on her, was fighting to protect her little girl.  She saw the fight in a different light after that.  A little scary for the timid child.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|Love every minute of it. It is brilliantly done. Will be buying the other ones for the other two movies.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Print to small,cannot increase font, hard to read for seniors.<br />May be fine for young eyes.<br />Also takes to long to locate your location
B007SYWFRM|4.0|When I watch TV, I enjoy playing this! Don't have to keep a close eye on it. The animations are cute!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoy Demille's writing style, not too heavy, great dialogue as always.  The story is current which should interest those who remain current.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is a great photo editor and it has made the pictures i have taken on my Kindle Fire HD beautiful.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great Harry Bosch story.  Connelly can't write fast enough for me.  Like other Bosch tales, I only put it down when driving.
B009HELT3C|3.0|sequels of successful movies are often not so good.  This was the case with MIB 3.  As  before, the special effects are fun, but the story line is getting tired, &#34;been there, done that&#34;.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best RPGs I've played in a long time. It takes awhile to get used to the characters and the high school setting but once you do, it feels surreal. A must-buy for the Vita.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game was suggested by my daughter and I am addicted to this. It is a simple concept which seems so easy but it gradually gets harder and harder. Its great.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Spoiler alert.  Michelle saves herself from her suddenly animated house by shooting it with a shotgun.  And thats as good as this one got.  Well cast, well directed, great costumes...but nothing can overcome a mediocre script.  Sigh.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A feel good , must read. I couldn't stop smiling. You will absolutely fall in love with Charlie and his personality.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book should be read by anyone that just wants a refreshing read.  The book is written with the POV of a young Shepherd that you won't be able to resist.  Slight humor, many journeys and if you really pay attention, plenty AHA moments.<br /><br />This book gave me a refreshing start to the new year.  I just smiled inside out.  A fable wrapped in a story and tied with lessons anyone can relate to.<br /><br />Paulo Coelho has a tremendous gift with putting pen to paper and weaving a story seamlessly.  I just loved this book and know that I can and will read it again and again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very intense and heart wrenching. Wish and hope for more stories about Mockingjay and Peeta. Maybe we'll here about their children...
0307454568|5.0|This whole series by Larsson is one of the better series that I've read in the last 5 years. It captured my attention from the very first book, and held it all the way through to the end. Not many authors can do this, but Larsson definitely did!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Well written, original and thought provokingwith a surprise twist towards the end of the story.  This is a great read.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Pretty dang funny. Of course, since it's a Seth McFarlane movie, be prepared for a lot of references that you may or may not really get, but it doesn't detract from just how hilarious it is.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great!!  Read it in 2 days······ I couldn't put it down!!!  Definitely would recommend to anyone for a great book that will pull you right in!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|previews were the best. 16 more words required, 16 more words required, 16 more words required, 16 more words required
B005HF1BHO|5.0|Just not sure why I have to pay for it now when it use to be free ( I am prime member)? Its very sad, because now I ma looking for something else to watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a heart drenching story!  I couldn't put it down.  I love all the characters although I wish Sky and Holder were older.  They are too matured in their thought process and action for 18-year-old kids.  Perhaps the life experience had toughen them somewhat.  I will seek out books from this author.  She is a definitely good writer, no doubt about that.  Her characters and real and her details are clearly described without unnecessary lengthen verbiage.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is very insightful! I can't wait to practice the lessons. This book is a very easy read and keeps your interests the whole way through.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love Fifty Shades this book is amazing! Gideon and Eva have their own story to tell that will keep you reading and going crazy for the next book to come out! Such a wonderful love story with Passion and heat that makes you crave dark and dangerous! Highly recommended! Kudos to such an amazing writer Sylvia Day!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love puzzles and mysterious. This game encompasses both. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this game will give you his of fun!
B0037QM8YA|5.0|Loved it!  Definitely not for small children but very well done. The acting by everyone was stellar and very true life sadly!
0449808068|5.0|Grace Coddington herself reads the audio version of her memoir.<br /> Her nuances and inflections lend a quality that could be lost if you we're reading it yourself. She's funny and fiery in her opinions.<br />Looking at her &#34;Vogue&#34; contributions will never be the same once you know some of the behind the scenes goings-on.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|dude I just fatted on this waffle that I found on a sink in the cabin in the woods on a Monday at twelve pm
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really didn't want to go to this movie, but I'm glad I did. Her writing is so simple but she's a grand storyteller and draws you right in.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|well i read this book and it was jus not fantastic i could not get my face out of the book and the author uses great detail in all her work cant wait to read her next book.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Love the No Quarter!  Cool to see them with Bonham jr., Page still rips it up.  you wont be sorry.
B0060D196K|5.0|We enjoyed watching this movie which teaches some valuable lessons while having cool effects.  Some parts are a scary for younger (&#60; 7 yrs) viewers but its a great story overall.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|what can I say about a great holiday, Christmas movie for all ages! I gave this to my grandchildren and my patient!
B007SGM084|2.0|First one is good. Second one meh. Third one terrible. Took me forever to finish it. Sorry, this saga glorifies abusive relationships and the writing isn't that great. If I have to hear about her stupid inner goddess one more time I will puke!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is great game to get your mind settled.  I like it because there is just one objective which is easy.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love this series. This was actually a gift for my best friend but I really enjoy this series as well.
1451695195|5.0|I am amazed at the scientific information this author provides, and the way he explains his experience during his days in coma. It is a true miracle that he made it back to life, and I am very grateful that he wrote this book. I will give it as gifts to my friends and family.
0316286850|5.0|Great makeup tips and skin care ideas. I love how it teaches you step by step. Definitely improved my makeup skills.
1608871088|5.0|The book is perfect, the conditions are the best, also i would recommend this one the most because of the graphics. Thank you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Always been team Gale but I guess these books were good. I read them in less than 2 days. I couldnt put these books down. So good.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really good an and I'm 12 so hope you love like I did err enjoy im am going to read all again
B000FC12SM|4.0|It was okay. I mean a lot of it made sense. i read it once, maybe will read it once more.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|SADLY I HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO WRTE ABOUT THIS MOVIE I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WAS GONG IN MY LIFE JUST A HORRIBLE FILM I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT SORRY
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very thought provoking, a true page turner.  Would highly recommend to others.  I loved the development of characters and scenery.  A fabulous read!
B0093FNZT6|3.0|In all honesty I personally found the book to be a hard read very disjointed and without the ebb and flow of many other Authors. The content was interesting but predicable.  Perception of the soul took second place to earthly bonds of both love and rejection. Out of body experiences happen to many different people in many different ways, we all glimpse higher realms of conscienous the Tibetan Monks have those light years advantages mostly gained through medication and  the reduction of ego as we know it.<br />The poems were beautiful and the interesting use of quotes by gifted people showed a desire for intellectually  rich artist mind.  Wishing Dr Eben Alexander well and may his spiritual road be bright, may he feel comfortable in his new travels..
030759565X|5.0|Our daughter follows Deb Perelman online and has used many of her recipes. She requested this the day it came out and I purchased it as a Christmas gift.  She has spent hours reading Debs commentary and I know we'll get to enjoy some more delicious treats.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I need to finish the story now. at first it seems like the story doesn't have a clear direction and at times I am frustrated even with the heroine katniss but half way in the book the return to the games was a blow coming from no where and unlike the first book once it reaches the climax and all the pieces fit together you dive off a cliff in the next three pages and the book is done.  Like I said I need to finish the story now the suspense of what will happen is killing me.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The new actor lacks the ice coolness of the original actor. Seems like a steroided adolescent.  Script too twisted to couple with original series.  Weak history. Good photography, special effects.
B006XBSAP2|4.0|It's a great album, but only gets four stars because its kind of a rip-off. I was expecting something new but it was basically her previous album plus just a few new ones.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I love this movie. It took me a while to be able to get this, so I was happy the digital copy still worked. The bonus disc was good.  I liked the deleted scene of Spock's birth the best.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This was like watching Family Guy, but not as good because the regular characters were missing.  The voice should have been different.  Funny moments but not the great laughs we were expecting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We got hooked on this series while visiting some friends.  We sat for 6 hours watching seasons one and two.  When we got home I bought season 1 & 2 so I could watch again.  I've already pre-purchased season 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very helpful on checking my home work when my parents can't help me &amp; it's very fast ( it doesn't take foreevveerrree to open) I luv it
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I could not put the book down!  Dr. Alexander writes well. I was a skeptic of whether Heaven exists.  Dr. Alexander, who is a neurosurgeon and also a skeptic of Near Death Experiences has become a believer, since he, himself, experienced it while in a week-long coma.  I enjoyed his taking the reader through his journey to Heaven.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Found it is only 'highlights', not all of the songs etc... Should've got my cue  from the title &#34;Highlights from the motion picture.....&#34;  However, that being said, I'm glad I sprung for it.<br />Have read comments elsewhere/everywhere that the singing is not to par with the stage show.  Several reasons were stated.  Within 10 minutes of watching the movie, the actors were no longer the actors; they WERE the characters, and I found the singing to be excellent, totally within character.  I did not miss the 'rerecord until it's perfect'  studio work.<br /><br />a '4' only because of the limited 'highlights /tracks'
B0089M0CT0|5.0|Love this album!! It is timeless. Has a lot of creativity! A must have for lovers of Can, and rock music with a creative edge!!!
B007712XAU|5.0|I had watched it on TV but watching it this time I had missed some parts so I really am glad I bought it have watched it several times as I did not see the Christmas scene at all on TV so did not kmow that Matthew had pop the question to Mary and she accepted..Charlotte Brumbelow
B008M721MS|5.0|I love skype and always use it it is much better In hd for kindle fire hd 7&quot;and a smart way to connect with friends and family hope you have a fun time enjoying it thank you for it time
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am truly 100% speechless. $ $ - - - $ $ $  - $ @  -/ / :/!//::/  /
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. play for hours. need more friends for more towns. add me if you like. just like the old sim games
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed function of this app does not work properly! Half-loaded items are every where on the cover page!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was just as good as the first book....This series is amazing! One you just can't put down!! A must read!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I bought this for my son.<br />He loved the movie and has watched it many times.<br />Great gift idea for all ages.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|After the Dark Knight I really felt that  the franchise would have a very hard time living up to expectations. Well folks they didn't disappoint with the Dark Knight Rises! What makes these movies excellent are the villains. The villain perhaps isn't 100% at par with the Joker but is sure damn close! Check it out you won't be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time. I was amazed at the in depth descriptiveness of everything. And i cant wait to start reading the next book \\"Catching Fire\\"
B007KDFWRG|5.0|The marriage of Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi created one great duo, and finalized one great band! From Susan's vocals  to Derek's guitar work, this is great music played LIVE!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|For a young girl with only a fifth grade education. This book was well written and Jaycee seems to be on a great path to recovery.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read in a long time. I read all 3 in 3days my husband said that maybe he shouldn't have bought this kindle for me because I was reading even when I was cooking. I absolutely loved this series.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very enthralling and so beautifully detailed with wonderful graphics. I couldn't stop playing once I started. Very dark and creepy, but it was well balanced.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I love this book!  Could not put it down!  Was left wanting more at the end she should have carried it out just a little bit more!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|As a person who suffers from auto-immune disease and multiple food intolerances, I've done a lot of investigation into how food is grown and processed. This movie hits the nail on the head and reinforces what I've been telling my family about GMOs. Thank you for making it. Now I'm even more determined to buy local and organic foods. I'm recommending this movie to all of my friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I love ebooks. They are my addiction but throughout the whole book the characters and the emotions just weren't enough. I appreciated how the author came up with a somewhat  clever plot but everything was predictable. I kept waiting for something to happen, I wanted the characters to live up to their potential but I found myself disappointed with the lack of descriptions and details.<br /><br />Spoiler: The relationship between Sky and Holder was beautiful but there was no real dilemma or conflict between, it just felt stagnant. Even Sky's day to day life was well boring and I have a hard time believing that a 17-year-old could go through life without knowing technology, especially when she had a best friend who would naturally introduce her to such things. The scene where she finally approached her father was surreal, I just wanted to smack my forehead at some of the actions Sky and Holder took. How many people have the courage to approach their abuser days after they realize they had one? Close to none.The story fell short of my expectations. I give it a three stars for its direct message, which is that we can overcome/
B009VB7QQA|2.0|A few good fight scenes loosely tied together by an intriguing, but never developed, plot and vast, unexplained passages of time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book makes you think about life, what it means, and the people you are spending it with. It forces you to look at yourself and your choices and if you are truly happy where you are. I would recommend this book to my friends. \\" I feel infinite\\" - Charlie
B0097PW7H8|5.0|No issues. Great app!!!!!!  Works as described  and why do you need so many words, makes it so I do want to rate it! Isn't 5 stars and great app enough?
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Good price for a classic we all love.  Somehow, these works are enjoyable when they are not required reading and are reding for fun.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie to watch. Had low expectation prior to watching it but was very entertained throughout the entire movie. Great plot lines
B0089XH38M|5.0|Very good product for Android phones, a must. I installed on my phone and found errors immediately. I recommend it to all Android users.
B00A757EFW|5.0|i love pac-man-lite i may order the full pac-man and i will be visiting best buy to learn more about my new kindle fire
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is the second Kate Morton book I've read.  She weaves a great story that grips the reader through the twists and turns.  I'm now reading everything she writes!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hate Fox for ending this show. But at least now I can watch it when ever I want. Great Package. Worth every dime.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|IMHO not up to Tom Clancy's standards from early works.  Co-writer maybe?  Just not happy with the effort.  Perhaps next time.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I love the books (read them all three times) and couldn't fathom how anyone could make a movie or a movie series from them, but am very impressed. The writers' and director's adaptations have remained true to the books in storyline and in characterization.  Excellent.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read most all of this authors works and usually like them, except for the Gold Coast books where I really hated the characters. Maybe they are typical of the Gold Coast inhabitants who might be depraved snobs but I do not know that and this type of behavior is just not something I enjoy. I usually also like the John Corey books. This one started off good but it just turned into a lot of talking, talking, talking. I kept waiting for the action which didn't come until the very end and was just an anticlimax because the anticipation just went on too long and everything that you anticipated might happen never did. Demille's research on the area was creditable and interesting as usual, but the plot just got washed away with all the jabbering and delayed action.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Easy and fun game for any age. Have to put some thought when searching for animals but, it makes the game fun.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|Not worth the money at all. Very teeny tiny set with very teeny tiny blocks. Cost $90.00 for a 4&#34; by 4&#34; box of barely there blocks.<br />Don<br />t buy it ....not worth it at all.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|The music is catchy. Connie Britton is fantastic. Would recommend the CD. As well as the show. Can't wait for the next soundtrack!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor Swift has put out another great album.  You've got some slower country songs and some upbeat more poppish songs.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|For the couple of minutes that it let me play... my first attempt... I found it very challenging in a good way. Has many different games and modes to pass. But I absolutely hate force quits so the rating is a three.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book had all the components that I love in a good read. It had family, love, suspense, mystery, and murder. It had a good twist in the end.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and was stunned because she knew it was a new release. She was so excited!
B008M721MS|3.0|this book is very good I love .y kindle I use it e everyday. and the whole house wants to hide it to. I will keep it forever and won'tst nobody else use it. it's mine.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|They were so helpful and I got my phone in two days. Very easy instruction on how to activate and transfer contacts. And I didn’t have to wait for my rebate. Best of all you only pay tax on the price you buy the phone for not the 700.00+ actual  price of the phone. Yes amazon
B0091REZMW|4.0|its very much fun an quite addictive its very mind challenging I like it a lot and cant wait to see what's is going on in the next  levels
6304936362|5.0|The DVD I bought to replace a favourite video casette which had suffered electo-magnetic  mutilation.  The DVD picture quality surpasses the tape even at its best, the captions are a help given the background sound and the choice of normal or wide-screen is an interesting novelty for me.
0979019753|4.0|Although this is the best journal I've seen for helping to stay on track toward meeting goals, there is one thing I'd change.<br /><br />Hal includes beneficial excerpts from the Miracle Morning book to help make sure you're prepared to use the journal effectively. Every week he prompts you to write your goals for the week and write a review of the week. He even includes a 6 month check up and end of year check up, which are beneficial after any period of time you choose. So if you use this journal it should pull you towards accomplishing the things you want to by helping you become the person you need to become. By reading what he includes before the journal and keeping yourself accountable to using the journaling section you will improve yourself.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change is having more writing space. The daily journal entry spaces are relatively small for people that write a lot like me. I have a seperate journal for details of the main points I'm jotting in this journal, but I'd prefer to keep it all in one place.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Well, I did enjoy this movie while my husband ended up going to bed halfway thru it. The movie is about a group of  people and the ways they choose to get on with their lives while staying in India.  The hotel everyone has chosen to stay at is most definitely a work in progress for its young owner. The characters and their humor gives this movie a warm and positive feeling. This is not a thrill a minute movie but floats you along for a quick trip to a place where in the end everything works out. Don't some of us need that from time to time? Least I forget I shall watch this more than once and apparently for my husband this is a great sleep aid so it does double duty.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Saw this on GPBS and bought it for a mutual acquaintence.  Wish I would have kept it.  Joe is a great blues guitarist.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|What more can you say. All of them are excellent. I've always been a huge Spiderman fan going back to the comic books. Movies are well made and acting is top notch. Fun entertainment for the whole family. However I had gotten feedback from some folks that Spiderman 3 does have a character that can be a little frightening to smaller children!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Caution: This is a violent movie... (as if you couldn't tell;) However, the most upsetting loss of life is not taken without sadness or regret.  This is a fast paced movie, with an interesting concept and has a lot going on... you may want to watch it more than once.
B004BSWC8A|4.0|Meryl Streep is such a compelling actress and Kevin Bacon is always a great manipulative, conniving character. While I realize this is an older movie, a coworker had told me about it so I finally purchased it and watched it. Very good movie. Lots of action and suspense. Nowadays, most movies are pretty predictable but it was still an exciting ride the whole way. Definitely worth the price and time to watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good follow up to first book.  I liked the new characters and the story line between Katniss, Peeta and Gale.  I don't like torture, so had to just get through that stuff.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|One of my all time favorites movies. I can watch it over and over again. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton are outstanding!!!
B000A0K2JO|1.0|It says it is a USB KEYBOARD TO PS/2 Adapter. I plugged my USB keyboard with this and it doesn't work. On booting the computer reports no keyboard connected.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app, it works great.  This is a great free app. I highly recommend it!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This movie was purchased for my daughter that is a Kindergarten teacher.  She loves Dr. Seuss, therefore, LOVES the movie - and can't beat the price on Amazon!  As for my review of the movie, if you are a true Seuss fan, you will like his \\"corny\\" way of expressing his opinions.  Now, about the movie (just in case you don't know), the movie was on the banned list In California some time back.  It is more about \\"green\\" issues which would have horrified my husband since he is a Mining Engineer (tee hee).  Here is an article that can explain the contoversy before purchasing it for 5-year-olds. :-)  [...]
B003L77G10|5.0|season 3 was by far the best, but this season was great also and highly recommended if you enjoyed season 1.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am in the 40 + bracket so watching zombies and the &#34;walking dead&#34; does not entertain me, but this is a &#34;must have&#34; for the late teen/ early 20s generation.  This is the ONLY series that my son has downloaded from Amazon while he has been at college...so if you are purchasing it for someone in that age range (my son is 21), he/she will love it.
B008Y73QDY|5.0|Never mind my opinion, my 2 year old spent 55 minutes unmoving, unblinking, mesmerized and that is amazing. Even then she stayed attentive till nearly the end of the movie.<br /><br />And, really, that says it all.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|My husband purchased this seperately for my Kindle for Christmas and it was already included in the package.  Before purchasing, be sure that it will not already be in your box when it arrives because you probably won't need 2. :-)  It was included in the 8.9 inch Kindle Fire. :-)
0783225857|5.0|Dated, but this still is powerful. Great application of a powerful story to film for reflection and a powerful impact.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I am in the 40+ age range and I can't say that this movie is to my &#34;liking&#34;.  However, my son is 21 and is a true bowler - in college majoring in Bowling Management.  He has all the bowling movies.. and this is just one to add to the collection.  The movie is geared toward &#34;male&#34; humor.  A+ from my son... D from my experience having to watch the movie. :-)
B0063IH60K|4.0|In my work I have times where I have to wait for processes to run.  I often use this game to fill the voids..
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|&#34;Ted&#34; doesn't even deserve one star!  For this trash Seth MacFarlane is being lauded?  Give me a break.  There are middle school boys who could make up something better than this.  It's little more than an excuse to spew a lot of dirty words--as if the characters, like little kids, have just discovered them.<br /><br />Prior to this I had some respect for Mark Wahlberg and his much-touted &#34;family man&#34; image.  No more.  Does he let his own  small children hear this sort of thing or talk this way?  I have no problem with &#34;mature&#34; plots and language, but &#34;Ted&#34; is just a bunch of gratuitous foul utterances and repulsive situations strung together for maximum &#34;shock&#34; value.  For this I'm supposed to pay good money?  There are genuine porn producers who would be embarrassed to present such a dimwitted disaster.<br /><br />Seriously, a hooker who defecates on the floor in the midst of an orgy with a teddy bear?  Is MacFarlane kidding?  Yuck!  Is he just giving us a peek into his own weirdly quirky adolescent fantasies?  If so, I'd rather he keep them to himself instead of inviting me to pay to witness their being played out on the screen.<br /><br />Words (clean ones at least) cannot describe how dreadful &#34;Ted&#34; is.<br /><br />Color me &#34;repulsed,&#34; &#34;sickened,&#34; and &#34;cheated.&#34;<br /><br />alexei18
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this app was well worth the money.  great graphics and sound.  a must have for mystery and hidden object lovers.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|This is the best Christmas cd ever!! My granddaughter turned me on to it years ago. I listen to it numerous times every holiday season and I buy copies to give as presents.
B004DM0UII|1.0|The description says it gives access to local radio,but their not in the search logs and every scan come up with stations from the other side of the mud ball. I'm glad this was free cause I would definitely want a refund,horrible app.
B004G6009K|5.0|This is a great movie.  Plot, characters, songs, digital effects, its all there.  The 3D versions is very well done and adds depth.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a fairly good depiction of history in South America during Colonial times.  Good sets and acting.  One to watch again.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Joss Whedon knows what he is doing.  Watch this show and you will not be disappointed.  Don't try searching for &#34;3 never before aired episodes&#34;.  This is refering to the fact that only 11 episodes were originally aired.  There are only 14 total.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I got this drum for my nephew and he LOVED it!  As soon as he opened it, he began beating on the drum pretty hard.  I admit, I was a little worried because I read a review that said they had theirs break from that...but Nope, it was awesome and he loved it...he kept going back to playing.  His parents liked it because it wasnt too loud and made different sounds when you hit it in different places so it was really a neat drum.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So easy to use and see. Love it!<br />I have MS and it is large enough to use with my shaky hands.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I started to read I could not put it down.  Awesome book.<br />Will recommend to friends and family members.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I ordered this on my kindle before it even came out.  It's a must read and gives such a pure account of a heavenly visit.  I have no doubt of the author's experiences and hope that those that still doubt will investigate the documentation given by this neurosurgeon who explains the medical conditions resulting in his brain death and subsequent journey into the light.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Best couple of hours I've spent in a long time!  I love this movie and miss the days when the people spoke.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Thirteen reasons why was a book that showed inspiration and brought a view of life most people don't see. It was a book that brings you behind the scenes to a teenage girls life and the hostility that some may face.  Most defiantly is a sad book but still had a light at the end of the tunnel. I highly recommend teenagers and young adults to take a chance to read and be inspired by this book. All around great book.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|I have used several keyboard-type piano apps, and this is the only one that I can say does what it should do.  It can be used without the aid of pre-programmed tunes, but it does have quite a few tunes that can be programmed so that the user plays the notes.  However, the user must also be familiar with the tune so as to play the each note with the correct duration.  This app has a 2-octave range, whereas the other similar apps I have tried only have 1 octave or less.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Showed up at the house early and was exactly what I wanted. It Came in the plastic wrap and everything!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This is such a great movie. I've watched it 4 times already. Can't get enough. It is a great movie. Highly recommended! Not for kids though.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Great story for the whole family. The high quality animation really enhanced the movie and seemed almost realistic while watching.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I actually meant<br />To put 4  stars b/c I actually liked this book. It was a little depressing but good.
B005HSL626|4.0|The game itself is certainly thrilling.  The kids love it but I am sometimes concerned about them being addicted to a game focused on slicing things up.  Good thing about it is that the object being reduced is fruit.  In moderation, it is pretty neat even for us adults.  Works well with a mouse or on a phone but can be difficult to control on a tablet.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so awesome and it kept me in a place where I could not stop reading it. I can't wait to read the rest!!!!!!
B000JMKO3C|4.0|Wow! This book was awesome! Sometimes routine does seem pretty crazy, and when you think far away from outside the box you still get the crazy look. So, might as we look crazy doing the things that makes you happy. This is definitely a 're-read to keep me in check.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I thought this book was hilarious I recommend this book who is ever looking for a funny book and a friendship book
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A Very entertaining game withfun puzzles and good graphics. I Will pay the extra for complete game. Try thee free version is great so you can see if you like it
B00A77II0U|5.0|I have played many games like this but this one tops it off it was spine chilling and adventurous and bold
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Although it is getting a little bit repitive with one of the brothers coming back each new season from Hell, Purgatory, ect. I am never disappointed. I love the back stories of purgatory and Sams attempt at a normal life. Great to see Castiel back, we knew he would be though, I mean he as become as integrel a character as Bobby, which I waiting to return also.  There is also new interesting characters like Garth(love him) and Benny to add some new flavor and keeps it from getting stale. This show has always been more about the people and relationships than battling the Supernatural and I think this is what keeps most of us coming back for more.
B00555X8OA|4.0|At every turn of a page this book shows us how our encounters with the world around us influences what we see, think and do.  I read the book a little at a time and looked forward to each time I picked it up.  There's so much in the book that reading it all at once would give me less then tasting it bit by bit.
0061537969|5.0|This is the best book to read and it is so sad and sweet at the same time.  Kept my interest through the whole book.
0321857895|5.0|Encouraging faster, more efficient note taking is a useful contribution to busy readers and lecture/conference/meeting attendees.<br />This book has enormous appeal to those of us committed to strategic planning and sifting through vast quantities of material, then trying to make sense of it all so a client can see the big picture as an orderly pattern. As a long time fan of mind mapping, I agree  with the author's view that pictures are an important aspect of memory, short and long term.<br />Bob Miller<br />Marketing Consultant and lecturer<br />Australia
B004WDRT1Y|2.0|hi when I by it said blue ray 3d but only one disc is 3d so very disappointed and 3d of first movie any way
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great television for mature audiences.  A better value than buying the season DVD or subcribing to Showtime for this single series.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|It probably helps if you've seen the Jason Bourne series. If you like them you will like this. Same formula, It might be interesting if Jason Bourne met up with Aaron Cross in a new movie.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|My husband originally got this book and I had no idea about it, but once I started reading I just couldn't put it down. Loved every page. I laughed throughout and enjoyed the storyline. Definitely would read again.
B009A87Z6U|2.0|i am more upset because this wont play on my PS3 because it says &#34;region b only.&#34; which to me is complete rubbish.  I was just hoping to be able to watch this movie with no issues and now it doesnt even work. SUCK!
B006O2QNOU|3.0|This movie is another one in a line of movies I have recently watched that have incredibly good actors playing parts that were really just not worthy of their acting ability.  Whether that is the fault of the casting director, the actor (poor role selection) or some issue on directing it is hard to say, but this movie just never gels.  Ultimately the viewer comes away unsatisfied.  The movie includes 3 Academy Award winning actors - Jeremy Irons (Academy Award for [[ASIN:B001RGGXRU Reversal of Fortune]] Reversal of Fortune), Kevin Spacey (Academy Award for [[ASIN:B005721Y7Y American Beauty]] American Beauty) and Stanley Tucci (Academy Award for [[ASIN:B003IBEH02 The Lovely Bones]] The Lovely Bones).  Add to that several other very good well known actors - and I was expecting a much better movie.<br /><br />The movie takes place in basically a 24 hr period inside an investment firm.  A senior investment manager is working on some kind of project - the day that the firm is laying off 80% of its work force.  The senior manager is let go, and as he walks out, he hands a thumb drive to a younger analyst who survived the cut (this is the first hint this movie is not going to be very good, the idea that security would have allowed this guy to take a thumbrive with him is not realistic).  He says something like \\"take a look\\" and so as the young analyst's friends go out for a nite of drinking to celebrate surviving the cut, the young analyst \\"solves\\" the missing pieces of the work of the senior manager, calls his friends and shows them this \\"startling\\" discovery.  At this point, a series more and more senior people are \\"called in\\" to view this discovery, and each level up, the seriousness of this discovery becomes more an more alarming.<br /><br />The movie then just goes into stupid mode.  It is like 2 am when the office manager (played by Kevin Spacey) is called back, and he calls some guy who is really not introduced well (played by Simon Baker) who is younger, better dressed, and seems like some kind of useless middleman.  He then calls the head of the board (played by Jeremy Irons) and then somehow magically the entire board is called in, they all show up at like 4am spotlessly dressed.  Meanwhile, the young analyst and his friend who also survived the cut are out looking for the senior manager who was fired.  They cannot reach him because his blackberry was turned off . . . and so on.  It just gets dumb at this point because these two young guys are wandering around New York (they stop at a strip club for some reason) and just are all over the place looking for the senior manager.  They come back, then a more senior guy (played by Paul Bettany) goes out with them.<br /><br />The young analyst is a nuclear engineer who left his prior job for more money etc.  There are just too many characters in the movie that are not introduced or whose role really is not explained.  Like, why is Demi Moore's character in this movie even there?  I never did get what her position was exactly.  Eventually the characters start pointing fingers at each other over this \\"discovery\\" which the viewer still has no idea what they discovered.  Eventually the viewer finds out - sort of - what the discovery is (and I will not list it here and spoil the movie).  Let me just say that the full explanation of the discovery is totally anticlimactic.<br /><br />I co-teach a graduate engineering law and ethics course, and I was hoping this movie might provide some prescient statements of ethical or social/moral issues.  It really doesn't.  In the end, the investment firm engages in a \\"fire sale\\" and ruins its reputation in the saving of the firm.  The viewer is supposed to connect this I guess to the Bear Stearns failure in 2007.  However, there is no real explanation of what a \\"risk manager\\" is or what hedging is.  It just came off as flat to me.  Yes, the characters are mostly sycophants and narcissists (and mostly well acted this way) - but, where there is an opportunity for some reflection and moral self-analysis by some of the characters - they never do - even the fired senior manager and the idealistic young analyst ultimately just join the rest of the characters in the grand fire sale scheme.<br /><br />The lack of character development, lack of cohesive story, and the random interactions of the characters just makes a mess of the movie.ortunity for some reflection and moral self-analysis by some of the characters - they never do - even the fired senior manager and the idealistic young analyst ultimately just join the rest of the characters in the grand fire sale scheme.<br /><br />The lack of character development, lack of cohesive story, and the random interactions of the characters just makes a mess of the movie.
0425263908|5.0|If you loved Fifty Shades of Gray, you will love this book. This Crossfire Novel by Sylvia Day, is an awesome read. I can't wait until the final book comes out.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|The book is interesting to me, an established introvert, but it provides more than I'd ever want to know about the subject. It exaggerates the trials of an introvert.

034580404X|2.0|There is plenty more good soft-porn out there and even more that is racy.  Read &#34;The Pearl&#34; if you want some good porn
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great app. that works consistently well and gives players of all levels a great workout for their brain. Highly recommend it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's nice to have my personal email box at my finger tips at all times whether on my computer, kindle or my phone.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|You might wonder why we need another recording of Les Miz.  I thought so too, until I watched this.  Great performances by the cast, Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis and Samantha Barks stand out.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's nice to see what's going on with my friends and relatives at the push of a button. However, it's missing a few things you can only get on the computer version, like some sharing and game item retrieval.
0451418433|5.0|OMG. I haven't been able to put this put down. The book is very well written and exciting. Ken Follett must have done so much history research to intertwine his characters with real history and world events. You must read Fall of Giants where it all began and continue with Winter of the World. I can't wait to get my hands on the third book.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's fun to use when bored but it's difficult to navigate in some ways. No way to pin things that I have found on the internet onto my kindle or iPhone version that I have found yet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very simple and convenient for what I need it for. Well designed and very easy to use. I use it often, for quick calculations.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|If you are looking for laughter, look no further than Continental Drift.  As with all of the Ice Age movies, it will lighten your day.
B00AAX68HG|2.0|If you are a little kid who is easily amused then you might like this game. I found it easy and boring. The characters were silly and spoke gibberish. I deleted after flying through a bunch of levels. Considering how much space it takes I'd say this game is not worth your time to download. It gets two stars since the game works without crashing.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I loved NSYNC and BSB, even NKOTB. This is just as fun and super catchy. Can't get enough of it...even though I'm almost 30. No Shame.
0812580346|4.0|cool read. I just wish ABC hadn't canceled the show. fascinating concept especially if you're big on physics combined w/ some interesting side bar stories.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I received Creationary for Christmas and have played it twice. Once with an eight-year old. and once with a group of adults (I was the youngest at 33!)<br /><br />Both times we had fun playing but there are few challenges with this game. One is packaging. It needs a lid for the inner tray or maybe a deeper tray. I found that I had to use Press N Seal wrap to keep the bricks in their spots between uses, otherwise transporting or storing this game caused all the bricks to jumble together. Not a huge problem, but if you want to quickly sit down and play, having the pieces mixed together is harder to start with.<br /><br />The pictures on the cards are hard to build. The 8 year old had fun building but didn't know what a lot of the pictures were meant to be-she had no idea what the Eiffel Tower was. The adults, admittedly not Lego fans, had no idea where to start building with even the \\"easy\\" pictures. They knew what the object was, but didn't know where to even start. Perhaps a beginning set of cards where the object is shown already built with bricks so people get more of an idea of where to start and are not as overwhelmed?<br /><br />The bricks themselves seem, at first, to be plentiful. And, to be honest, the number is fine. However, the basic building blocks are lacking. You might be given 2 yellow 2X2, but need 8. You can mix colors, yes, but overall, I found that the basic ones are lacking. I may be adding more over time as I figure out the ones we need the most (such as more roof tiles!).<br /><br />That being said, we all had a lot of fun playing and trying to guess what someone was building. It will be a game I pull out often in the future. I doubt a non-Lego lover would end up with this game as it seems to be geared towards those who already build and have an idea on how the bricks work together.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was hesitant  to read this series because of the hype surrounding  the new movies. I thought it would be similar to the twilight series. I could never have been more wrong. I was immediately swept up in the story and finished all three books in two days. Katniss is a real character and I respect that Collins showed how terrifying taking lives can be for one who survives it. As a reader I fell in love with Peeta and he is a character you can root for. Overall one of the best books I've read in a long time!!!
B0058W74UY|2.0|This app was to support adobe, so it said.  Again I was disappointed, it does not<br />support any items that need an Adobe like flash.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I seriously can't wait for the next book. I put it all together while I was reading but the book still never drew me away. It was just amazing ;)
B007D2XSW0|1.0|this app stopped working after 10 hours it wouldn't let me add images into the picture put stickers on and then it just froze. if it didn't do that it would be awesome get the free version it didn't freeze and it had most of the stuff on this version
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a good read.  Would recommend this book, would be interested in reading more from this author. Good job.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a reader, but decided to download this book because of all the buzz I've heard about it...DEFINITELY glad I did!! Read it in less than a week and already have the others downloaded, I would recommend to ANYONE!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a book that kept you reading. A good book to sit down to on lonely night. Lovely ending.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I don't think I needsay anything f the &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; series. It's also on Netflix but I buy these for my son as a collection. Watch episode one and you'll be hooked for the rest.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|First off, I haven't read any of the books, so I have no idea if they \\"butchered\\" A Clash of Kings or not, and frankly I don't care. I'm a huge HBO fan - The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood are some of the best shows of all time, and of course there's The Wire which is in a class of its own. I'm not much of a fantasy guy, though I've always been a fan of The Lord of the Rings films and the first few Wheel of Time books. I wasn't sure what to expect with Game of Thrones, but dived in with an open mind.<br /><br />The first season was absolutely enthralling. A detailed and morally complex world with vast scope, intriguing characters and politics that (ironically) feel more realistic than your typical premium cable period-piece, despite doubling as an epic fantasy. The cast is more-or-less first-rate, as is the direction, cinematography and music. The first season invoked a child-like sense of wonder while simultaneously providing a rich, adult-themed story to chew on - the best of both worlds. Every plot-point, from The Wall to Winterfell to King's Landing to the eastern lands - all of them displayed an incredible amount of possibility and potential.<br /><br />Season Two, on the other hand, is poorly paced and sloppily written, and feels more like a soap opera at times due to the simplified camerawork and excessive two-on-two character scenes (reminds me of the Star Wars prequels where 90% of the dialogue takes place between two characters in a room, usually both sitting down. Very, very lame). The characters and storylines that once held me on the edge of my seat now begin to bore me, as we're subjected to some slow build-up to a big clash of conflicting leaders that results..in..something? This Game isn't half as interesting as the first one.<br /><br />Not much changes by the time we're finished with the season...Joffrey still has the throne. Stannis still wants the throne. No one knows what Varys wants. Littlefinger hasn't developed at all. We still don'tknow what happened to Benjen, and the story beyond the wall moves at a snail-pace. Theon is still a moron. Robb is still planning his big war. Sansa is still stuck in King's Landing, and the Kingslayer, while released, is still in Stark (er...Catelyn)-influenced capture by Brienne. Hmm. I'm all for a slow build, but throw us a freakin bone at some point! Some of these storylines just simply don't merit the amount of time they take to unfold, and the lack of resolution rubs me the wrong way (The first season managed to provide some epic payoffs alongside the juicy cliffhangers). The shifts in narrative, which were handled deftly in Season 1, feel awkward this time. Even the music has taken a step down toward cliche melodies and melodrama (whatever happened to the cool, chilling stuff like the White Walker theme?).<br /><br />There were scenes I can tell were *supposed* to be epic (the brutal murder of a character at Winterfell, for example) but just lacked any real emotional impact. There was always something missing, events just sort of happened without moving me at all.<br /><br />The dialogue is also very hit-or-miss, and when it misses, it's some cliche, cringe-worthy stuff. The only episode with great dialogue is Episode 9, Blackwater, written by George RR Martin himself. Maybe he should have written all the episodes?<br /><br />There were a few moments I enjoyed (particularly the Blackwater episode and the finale, which were quite good) but for the most part, this was a massive disappointment, and I have no idea why it's getting such glowing reviews. I'll be back for Season 3 though! :)
1423140605|5.0|Easy read and enjoyable. I love this whole series. In fact I love each series this author has written. It's a must buy for fun easy book lovers.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Fun but repetitive. This a game made to help pass the time. It doesn't really stand on its own for entertainment purposes.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|Pro:  I love the board game version and this is a perfect clone of the board game experience.  It manages legal plays, scoring, etc in a very clear and quick manner which would help someone who has never played before quite a bit.<br />Con:Battery life!  This app eats more power than any other game or app I've ever had on my phone.  Wouldn't be a problem if you're on a tablet at home, but on my galaxy nexus it makes for more frequent charging.<br />Only other con is that I'm used to playing with more expansions, so this feels a bit short.  I would buy a pack of expansions for this in a heartbeat.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story kept me interested until the last page.  Sad yes, but very very well written. The characters were true to life.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|What can I say, I wish it were still on sale,  I would have bought more copies! Can't wait for the other seasons.
0756697875|5.0|Very educational and stimulating for young kids.  I feel it gives positive perception and reinforcement of books for all kids.<br /><br />I would recommend this because it promotes reading to youngsters<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Drives your kids to ask for more and promotes a desire to collect all, lol.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|i expected much more from all the buzz i had heard about it. not much story, and kinda rediculious. seems like some teenagers fantasy.
0743277708|5.0|I had to read the book for english class, and i read it five times in a row before i had to give it back. Even now it does not get boring when i read it again and again.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|8 years old, and this is what he wanted and got for Christmas.  Works great, a little big to hold, but he makes it work.<br /><br />4 cartridges of bullets, but to have a gun with full rounds, you have to  buy more cartridges to make it complete. What was wrong with selling it completely full of the cartridges needed. Kinda like  buying a dozen eggs and only getting six, oh you have to buy six more to make it complete!!<br /><br />Great gun, loads of fun to play with, selling strategy sucks.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I got facebook for both my phone n computer.  But wen i get on it off my kindle it dont add my friends on acct. Unless im missin something this app is worthless. Plez fix

B00APUQH0W|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie, but had issues streaming issues with the Amazon site.  Movie was not clear and kept hanging up.  Went to Vudu and had no issues and movie was in true HD.
B009A9BF5G|4.0|It's come to a point where you can predict the responses to releases of this type from bands like Coldplay,Radiohead, REM (no more now), etc.  The concert film will have an overzealous director who doesn't believe in an attention span of more than 1 second, the sound quality will be compressed and crappy, the documentary pieces will be self aggrandizing and overstated, etc.  But when you cut through all of that, these questions remain: What about the music? What about the band? What do you feel when all is said and done? And the answer is, with all its flaws, the CD/DVD brings to the forefront the emotional power of this unique band.  The way they connect with audiences is amazing; bands like Rush come to mind.  The people who come to Coldplay concerts feel almost a religious transformation.  I know that all the tech heads, including myself, wish that audio/video decisions would be smarter, less gratuitous,and perhaps better chosen, but let's face it; this is obviously what the band felt comfortable releasing to their fans.  You just have to accept the \\"mistakes\\" and love the human aspect of the failings of the world's most perfect band!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never knew zombies could be sooooo interesting.  The story & characters are awesome...the writing is fantastic! I highly recommend this series.
B004AQR29C|3.0|This movie isn't going to win any major awards but this is a good Sunday nothing else is on v movie.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|If you have seen season 1 then you are going to love season 2!  Totally new story with many of the same great actors.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I just love this game. my 6 year old son and I play it all the time. the little pudding dudes are just too cute. you will be hooked!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this app! But i finally downloaded a data manager and found out that i was using 40 MB PER SESSION! We aren't talking sitting on it for 2 hours either...like...20 minutes. Being someone who only get 5GB a month, this is unacceptable, I hope that I can figure out a way to bring this down because I LOVE being able to see all of my news in one app, but I just can't stomach this much data use :(
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This is another great movie to own for blu-ray. I love seeing the quality difference between blu-ray and dvd especially with these animated movies. It is such a great difference. I also love the story line of this cute little robot!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I found this moving entertaining. Great movie to own for the price. Definitely worth buying to add to your blu-ray collection
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I bought this movie despite hearing that it was a bad movie from some of my friends. I'm glad I bought this movie, because I love this movie. I think it is a different approach to movies compared to what else was out at the time. This is a good movie to have in your DVD/blu-ray collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was a little unsure when I realized how young the characters were, but it had a mature subject and so many twists and turns that I could not stop reading.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After \\"50\\" I've been searching for something, anything to read that was even mildly close to being as all encompassing as that trilogy was for me. I found it with the crossfire novels. Love, love, love them!  My Only issue..... book three isn't released until May.  Must read, again and again.
B00006JIA4|5.0|you can not go wrong with a Queen CD, no matter what your age is, there music will always be timeless
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Nothing like the original which I wouldn't mind except this movie is soooo bad! The acting is horrible..the direction is lacking.....it is very boring a true waste of time
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watch several series including: Homeland, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead. A long time favorite of mine is Six Feet Under....I have to say, Downton Abbey is my # 1 favorite show! It's nothing like the others....the acting, storyline, script and direction are excellent! I didn't think I would like this show but watched it because it was rated so highly! At the end of the first episode, I was sold!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series! More than just zombies....great dynamics with surviving people and groups! Keeps you on your toes! My favorite series!
1451695195|5.0|Another one of those experiences.....a book that one cannot lay down, once starting to read it.....<br />have shared this book and purchased for other  relatives, and friends....just awesome....<br />seems to me that God is trying to tell us something.....because  there  are so many of these<br />OBE'S coming to the forefront.....the gist of it, just don't be afraid of dying.....<br />it is the most profound and beautiful experience we humans can have....ever.....and ever....
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Get this app. It does what it says. It gets rid of unnecessary items taking space. Freeing up more space.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|It was really great.  Good was good and bad was bad.  Can't get more realistic than that and.....it was fun for 10 year old grand daughter and grandmother to watch.  Some newer Disney movies send mixed messages, this one did not.
B0091REZMW|4.0|nice game. you need friends in the game to advance on certain quests. but I think it is worth it considering it is a free game.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a clever little game that is fast and addictive.Lots of fun with great little characters and very colorful.Pudding yum !!
0143038419|3.0|I have to say that I LOVED this book through the \\"Eat\\" and \\"Pray\\" sections.  But then it all fell apart for me in the \\"Love\\" section.<br /><br />Regarding \\"Eat\\": My husband comes from a NY Italian family, so I loved the humerous and loving descriptions of the locals.  Even though my husband never lived in Italy, the Italian attitude and outlook on life is very much alive and well in him and his family.  I was laughing out loud during much of this section.  We are also self-described \\"foodies\\" so I loved the yummy descriptions of the meals she ate.  They made my mouth water!<br /><br />Regarding \\"Pray\\":  I found it interesting that many of the other reviewers had so much hatred of this section.  I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. I've always been interested in learning meditation myself, and lean toward the Eastern approach to spirituality, so I found this section to be quite moving.  It has gotten me thinking about how to start a daily ritual myself to better handle the daily stresses of working full time to scrape by, while raising a child and running a CubScout Pack.  But where in the world would I find the time without constant interruptions?  hmmmmmm.........<br /><br />Which brings me to the 3rd Section: \\"Love\\".  So now she's living in a beautiful island resort amongst good friends and a sexy Brazilian lover and is still dissatisfied?  I could almost buy that, considering that everyone has their own journey and it's all relative.  I get that.  But then she goes on to describe a prior trip to Bali, in which she went to the remote Island of Gili Meno for 10 days, with the soul purpose of being in self-imposed silence so she could learn to \\"love\\" herself again. Wow....  2 weeks of self-imposed silence on a beautiful remote beach sounds like sheer heaven to me. But she spent the entire time in misery.  And that made me start to think back on the rest of the book.  I started to realize that she has no idea how lucky she is that she can afford to take an entire year to travel around the world eating fabulous food and meditating with holy men in India.  She takes that so much for granted.  I could never imagine being able to do that myself, due to children, jobs, mortgages, debts, etc.  And if I COULD manage it, I'd appreciate it so much more.  That little chapter on Gili Meno hit me like a ton of bricks and all of the good will I had toward the author fizzled out.<br /><br />While I sit in my cluttered house, with an old car (in which I just replaced the transmission), I find it hard to feel sorry for her at all.  And I can't help but think that many of her readers are busy working moms like myself.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone to read the 1st 2 sections and then PUT IT DOWN.  I would have liked the book better if I had done that myself.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|there is not a movie that can do justice to the book  Using kindle notes helps you keep track of the many characters.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a must read for all Lincoln fans . I bought this for my husband who has really enjoyed the book.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|My husband wanted this book so I purchased it as a gift. He said it was a very good read
B009JBZH54|1.0|I've seen other unboxings of this product that include 2 sheets of paper. One with ultra violet codes and the other for the ultimate set that's coming out later this year. As a huge Batman fan, I'd like to have them Amazon. Please?
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Like Flynn's other novels, the characters are very well developed, and the plot moves along quickly.  This novel is a bit more predictable than Gone Girl, but is still an enjoyable read.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I bounced from three stars to four stars as I tried to decide how to rate this book.  It deserves more than a three, but is it really as good as a four?  I finally decided on a three because about two weeks after I finished it, I couldn't remember how it ended.<br /><br />Federal agent Ethan Burke and a partner are sent to a small Idaho town to track down some missing agents.  After a car crash kills his partner and knocks Burke for a loop, things start to go downhill.  Burke see's a lot of strange things, but is it real or is he suffering a psychotic break?  A bizarre town-wide melee starts Burke's journey of discovery that will surprise and delight readers who crave something &#34;different&#34;.<br /><br />It is a good book.  Maybe I should have given it a four.
034580404X|5.0|this series was awesome!  Great price, speedy delivery I was totally satisfied. I have recommended this series to everyone I know and people i don't  know.
B004SBX112|5.0|It is one of the best to past the time with. I have had fun playing it and trying to beat my grandson.
B009VLXMJA|3.0|The price of this download was low. The songs are good but I think her previous albums were a little better.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Along with a good review of the events of the second world war it also looks at the effects of the war on the different nations: USA, Great Britain, USSR, Germany.  It adds that human element!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|While I absolutely love the music, and I love the performances for each song (especially \\"Suddenly,\\" a brilliant new addition), I was supremely disappointed that several songs were either shortened or cut out completely. While I can understand cutting, say, \\"Little People,\\" there is no excuse for not including \\"Can You Hear The People Sing?\\", one of the most iconic songs from the work, and the \\"Work Song\\" from the Prologue was cut to almost nothing, including just the first verse and Javert and Valjean's conversation. I would have preferred more songs, especially for the price.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|The Secret Keeper is a far better read than Kate Morton's previous offering. The main characters are realistic and their motivations are genuine. Morton's technique of going back in time and then forward to the present provides enough cliff hangers to make the book a &#34;good read&#34; without being annoying.
144472729X|4.0|Im a long time fan of king,,I read the book in three nites after waiting for some time,,the detail and direction  about the great historical incident of my life are wonderful,,I remember the day as if it were this morning,,can it be 50?I have to say the story of the romance etc left me a bit bored,,and I found the ending a bit empty after the build up,,plus I will never agree with the oswald did it alone group,,<br />  I now am a resident of N Dallas,I have to say I believe the hatreds,,extremism and other strange things about the area are true today as they were if not more so,,perhaps with a modern touch,,here in the north area the money and upscale life is very apparent but the feelings towards the president run strong,,<br />  again for the most part the novel is terrific
B00571F26Y|4.0|When you consider that the American diet is so wheat-based, this is a scary book! Dr. Davis makes such a strong case for the negative effects of wheat--he has done a great job with his documented research and his findings--bottom line: his patients get well and lose weight when they are off of wheat, but it is so hard to convince others unless you read the book that the wheat grown in this county is genetically modified and is clearly not good for us! I have been off wheat for a month and have lost 10 pounds--I have another 10 to go. My joints don't hurt, my sinus headaches have disappeared, but i must sadly admit, when I see a nice loaf of Italian bread, I do still long for a piece or two.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I hated this book--the characters, the plot, the senseless evil and violence. Amy was nuts and her husband was spineless--the ending was cobbled together to get it published. Not worth the time or money!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander does a really great job with this! I loved this book, loved how he presented the facts, his near death experience, the specifics of his experience, his grounded-in-science perspective, his family's reaction, his son's advice about writing first, then researching, etc., a great book! Before my mother died, she described what she saw, she was so grounded, so analytical and logical, and not a fantasy creator, I knew then that there is heaven...I just loved to get the info again from Dr. Alexander--also grounded and not a fantasy creator.<br /><br />The poem in the book touched me deeply and is one I will keep forever and share with my family. Thanks Dr. Alexander!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Awesome. it definitely met my expectations. Definitely made the perfect Christmas present and came just in time. I love it
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not fond of the ending, but loved how intense the rest of the book was. It kept me up a little too late every night.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|loved every page!!! i wanted to read on when it was over!!!!! they really need a sequal!!!!!!!! over all........... amazing book!!!!!!!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is definitely the best slender app for kindle/ipod ex. It has great graphics and is very similar to the original slender in all good ways. I find it very entertaining and medium difficulty. the only problem i found with this game is that on kindle fire hd the screen flips upside down so it is very difficult to play<br />  Overall this is a great app and 100% worth your money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read.I could not put the book down even though this was the second time I have read!!! I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008220C38|5.0|After watching the 2012 film remake of Leo Tolstoy's classic epic novel Anna Karenina, who can deny quoting within the lines and words of William Shakespeare, \\"all the world's a stage, and all the men and women are merely players:  they have exits and their entrances; and man in his time plays many parts.\\"  Indeed, that is certainly what may cross one's mind while watching the work of Director Joe Wright and Screenplay Writer Tom Stoppard as well as from the cinematography and choreography to the elegant costumes that comprise of the entire production of the film.  The film's theatrical touch is greatly emphasized within a theater stage backdrop that interchanges with different scenes from ballroom dances to a dramatic horse race to actual outside scenes of the constant train that appears in out of the film as a toy and a real-life locomotive; suggesting a sense of departure but not quite leaving the station.<br /><br />For viewers that are familiar with Tolstoy's classic tale of intrigue and the whirlwind of affairs that center upon the life of Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley), the film may not be much of a surprise.  However, what may be amazing to this version is the pure imagination of all aspects of the film from the actors to the dramatics may provide a great amount of artistry like a music box or a snow globe.  And the praises do not end there but continue with the cinematography and the costume department because the story and the actors that are displayed in the film look much like an impressionistic painting by Renoir or Seurat but within the geographic setting of late nineteenth century Russia and its recognizable cold barren wintry and pastoral landscape.  But of course, the story cannot be left unmentioned and is identifiable in the film and is twofold.  First, the major dilemmas that Anna experiences within her traditional marriage to Alexei Karenin (Jude Law) and son Serhoza (Oskar McNamara) that she constantly dotes on, and the love triangle that emerges between she and Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that causes her marriage and world to crumble. The cold and constricted elements are truly shown.  Second, pocketed within Knightley's most dramatic role, other major characters show a glimmer of light in Anna's dark world.  There exists within the story between Levin (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kitty (Alicia Vikander) that show that life is not at all abysmal and that through patience, time, and work, a happy ending may just come true.  And their story shows a display of freedom and less retrained qualities.  And also individuals in Anna's life that add a bit of comic relief within each situation, such as her brother Oblonsky (Matthew MacFadyen) and support Princess Myagkaya (Michelle Dockery) and Countess Lydia Ivanova (Emily Watson).<br /><br />Overall, Anna Karenina is an eye-opening film that may leave an impression on the viewer because of the theatrical display that is unforgettable.ges between she and Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that causes her marriage and world to crumble.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well done if you like romance along with kinky bondage. Then more romance and more kinkiness. Seems almost educational at times. Especially for those who never put on a pair of handcuffs.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The special effects in this movie were good and it was entertaining from that perspective, but the script was too far out for me.
1451613512|1.0|What can one say about a history book written by men who believe the actions of the USSR under Stalin and Lenin were morally equivalent to actions of the United States?  The murder of millions of Russians is tossed away like a statistic while actions of the United States, mostly unnamed, are viewed as equally heinous.  Where are the piles of bodies produced by the American system?  Is slavery, the internment of Japanese Americans for 4 years, or fire bombing the Germans and Japanese really the same thing as murdering millions of farmers who refused to be \\"socialist\\"?  Is it really the same as the cultural revolution in China that killed additional millions on top of those already murdered by Mao during his tenure?<br /><br />Drawing a moral equivalence between the history of the USA and the USSR, Red China and other brutal dictatorships is outrageous on its face.  To say \\"The US did bad things too\\" is certainly no answer.  The authors are no better than the liberals who visited the Soviet Union during Stalin's reign and came back praising the communist knowing full well that Stalin and Linen were murdering and enslave everyone in that country.  Anyone who thinks like this is simply a basher of America, its heritage, and its culture.<br /><br />Another problem is the outright misrepresentation of history.  Naturally, the authors love President Kennedy and praise him for handling the Cuban Missile Crisis.  They actually think the missile crisis was precipitated by a looming US invasion of Cuba.  That is an outright lie.  What started the Cuban crisis was Kennedy's super poor performance in a summit with Khrushchev.  The Soviet leader decided Kennedy was soft and would not confront the USSR if pushed.  The second reason for the Cuban crisis was the US had missiles in Turkey that Khrushchev wanted to match.  By putting missiles into Cuba he would have the same quick strike capability as the US.  This is why the crisis developed - not because the US was planning an invasion.<br /><br />Note also, the Russians clearly \\"won\\" the showdown.  Kennedy removed the missiles from Turkey and promised the US would never invade Cuba.  Khrushchev got everything he could have wished for.  The truth was hidden from the American people because it would have cost the Democrats the next election.  Why hide what really happened?  Because the President would have been viewed correctly as backing down to the Soviets instead of coming out the \\"hero\\" of the hour.  It was pure political twist that made the Cuban Missile Crisis into a Kennedy victory.  That an outright lie like this could continue to be perpetrated in any history book is beyond belief.<br /><br />One final comment about the \\"invasion\\" of Cuba which was never going to take place.  Do the authors really think their hero was going to order the invasion of Cuba?  No invasion could take place without the order of President Kennedy, which would be an act of war without Congressional authorization of any kind (not that Truman hadn't already done it), and that act of war was going to take place, according to the authors, before any missiles had been found on the island.  Would their hero really order such an act?  Nixon wouldn't have done that, much less Kennedy.  Was an invasion of Cuba being \\"planned.\\"  Of course.  The USA has plans to invade, or go to war with, nearly every nation on earth.  Cuba was no different.  The authors show absolutely no comprehension of military affairs.<br /><br />On Truman and his change of policy after the death of Roosevelt, the authors claim Truman's actions started a cold war that was avoidable if Roosevelt had lived, are also misplaced.  Stalin had broken every promise to the USA and all the other Western Allies, he wasn't paying back any of the loans, he allowed the Polish resistance to be slaughtered by the Nazis in Warsaw, he was hell bent on conquering all of Europe that was possible without starting another war with the west, and he was expanding east as quickly as feasible.  Soviet armies continued to advance into Manchuria, China, and Korea for weeks AFTER Japan had surrendered.  Soviet troops were refusing to leave Iran.  In other words, Truman's shift in policy was entirely justified and was supported by the Western Allies.<br /><br />Why is it that the internment of Japanese Americans was so horrible but the imprisonment of thousands of US citizens by Lincoln without a trial or even an arraignment during the Civil War was fine?  At least the actions of the US in holding the Japanese Americans was reviewed and ruled lawful by courts at the time (Yes, even the US Supreme Ct in an opinion written by the very liberal Justice Douglas said the internment was lawful).  The courts during the Civil War, including the US Supreme Court, held Lincoln's actions unlawful.  All Lincoln did was ignore them while arresting newspaper editors that criticized his war policies.  So why is Lincoln hailed and the American policies of 1942 trashed?<br /><br />Other historical comparisons abound.  Why was it bad to fire bomb and drop A-bombs on Japan, but OK to burn Georgia to the ground, including Atlanta, when Sherman marched to the sea?<br /><br />I could go on and on, but the bottom line is simple: this \\"history\\" is too slanted to be of use to anyone seeking any kind of balanced viewpoint.  Please don't get me wrong.  I know that historians include their viewpoint in what they write.  The mere choosing of a series of events as being more important than others requires a person to exercise their viewpoint.  And history is NOT science.  It is highly subjective.  Ok, I get that.  But a real historian must struggle to bring out a balanced viewpoint.  One way is to at least mention opposing views or include facts that might mitigate the viewpoint presented.  None of this is done in this book.  The authors might at least admit their point of view is ultra liberal, but that isn't done either.  If one is going to write a book exclusively from one point of view at least tell the readers what that is before they buy the book.  Make the slant plain.  These authors do not.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Super fun concept. I love it for organizing my shopping!  I don't put anything private in there with the crazy TOS,
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A terrible, terrible book that's also poorly edited. Why this has gotten such hype is beyond me. Fifty shades of stupid.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book had been recommended to me by a Christian brother whose advice I tend to follow.  However, I found the story to be predictable.  I know the purpose of the book, however, it vacillated between unfocused, hazy mystical speak and concrete Christian teachings.  I will definitely reread it in the near future because it strikes me as the type of book that  one can take away different lessons each time it is read.
0823004325|5.0|After reviewing many books relating to painting faces and facial expressions I found this book to be most valuable. Expressions are explained and drawn to show even subtle differences. I have been able to readily use in my portrait paintings.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Not that I wouldn't have bought it otherwise, but the price I paid for this set was worth it just for the restored documentary and behind the scenes footage. Amazing stuff. The films themselves look awesome as well.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This case was too stiff and uncomfortable to hold, so I returned it. I was able to find a leather (simulated) one<br />that I like much better.
B000ID37RM|5.0|One of the best movies - having it available to rent on the Kindle Fire is great since my daughter had to read it for school. Very convenient!!
B000FCKGPC|1.0|After not being able to put the first three books down, I'm having to FORCE myself to get through this one.  Way too much description and not enough story / action.  Doubt I'll purchase the 5th book after this crap.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Even if you already have this from back in the day, if you don't have the bonus edition you should get this one. Other tracks are nice and it's been remastered, which for me is the real reason this package is so cool.  I hear new instruments in the background that I'd not heard before in the past.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|I normally like historical fiction.  In this case the book was very slow moving for a murder mystery and not terribly well written either.  Reads like a very very long newspaper article.  I couldn't care about any of the characters including the main ones - the victim and her father.  Pick a different book.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I have this app on my iPod Touch and wanted it for my Kindle Fire as well. I greatly appreciate what this organizaton does in promoting and sharing intelligent discussions on a wide variety of topics valid for today and the future. The app itself is just as easy to search and navigate as the TED website. It will add to your knowledge and enhance your own conversations and ideas.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I know it seems strange wanting a calculator app. but this one is great. I like the fact you can do percentages and it has a memory key.
B0091THRCU|1.0|Too snug. Too inconvenient to use. Seems to be just too precisely engineered in terms of iPhone fit. Price was good, but if you cant get y our phone out quickly and easily, its not worth it to me.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The book is nothing more than pornography. Please do not read this book. It is not worth your time. It is trash.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. What a great story of strength,courage,and the power of spirit. All my friends will know about this book.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great book, keeps your interest through the entire book.  This is a great mystery in that you can't wait to get to the end!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|emotional reading talking about tings that could happen in a world t does not pay attention.  This author has a gift for witing easy to read.
B001BR7CZW|3.0|I think the producers realized that no one was really interested in seeing a full-length movie of the Akroyd & Belushi &#34;Blues Brothers&#34; characters.  This movie is really an excuse to cameo some of the best REAL blues & R&B performers.  If you watch this movie, watch it for that; don't expect much from the plot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I NEVER write a review, but I had to for this book. This book was amazing. You laugh(a lot), cry, & 1/2 way through, the things revealed are NOT expected but in a good way. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book! The only problem is that I couldn't put it down and stayed up till 5am just to finish.  I have two recommendations: 1. BUY it! 2. Read it on a day that you have nothing else to do because you will not be able to stop reading.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Very good! However some things are missing with in the plot!such as crucial sevens and I wish that the character of Jeff was more developed.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Great movie. Was wayyy better than i expected. I expect sequels to be not that great, but this one was great. Interesting and a must watch for sci fi fanatics. Suitable for the whole family.
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|It's on the level of a 90's Seagal/Van Damme film.  Roseamund Pike rivals Kristen Stewart in the inability to make more than one facial expression.  She's horrible.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book! I watched the movie first, I shouldn't have, though (-: I hope u will like it if you ever get it. It's free on kindle fire. This book took a long time to read. Be ready to sit and relax and read this book
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This CD was fabulous.  I love Rod Stewart's voice and listened to this over and over again!!  It sure helped me get in the holiday spirit this year!!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Not spellbinding but funny. If you've been married a length of time it's easy to relate more of a chick flick
B000XUBFE2|2.0|It was hard at times to know the right time frames referred to.I,m only about half way thru the book but will definitely finish it.<br />The Book Thief
B009CG8YDI|2.0|A waste of acting talent and Alaskan scenery as a pack of wolves with a ludicrous vendetta make the survivors of a plane crash fight to survive.
0061537969|5.0|When I look into the eyes of my pets, cats and dogs, I wonder what they are thinking.  My girlfriend suggested I read this novel that tells the story through the Dog.  Touching and loving.  I recommend this book to anyone who has or had a loyal dog because it makes you feel warm and grateful pets as a whole.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This DVD had a lot of extras that were just great. Watched every episode over again. Love reliving the whole season.
0345803485|1.0|This was interesting at first, but turned into into a novel that was not of my choice of literature.  I wonder how they are going to make the movie?  I did not choose to read the two sequels.  There are too many books out there that I need to read and not enough time to get to all of them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome Story!!!!! I could not put this book down! I did not want it to end!!!It's a must read!!!! Definitely recommended this book to all my friends & family!!!
1439130833|5.0|This book contains philosphies for living and maintaining a positive thought process . The power of attraction is worth trying.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|It is very difficult to change the location to obtain local weather information. The app allows you to add locations but does not allow you to save the new location as primary. I wanted a weather app for my home town and this app does not provide. I hate paying for something that I can not use.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end was disappointing. Wanted more than a few pages about after the revolt. All that fighting to just end happily ever after..?
1451695195|2.0|It is curious that the author bases his credibility on the fact that he's a scientist, implying that he's rigorous in developing a hypothesis, testing it, and extracting reliable and repeatable results. Given the title of the book, I thought someone with his training (which he often promotes) would use the scientific method where possible to discuss and analyze his experience. Instead, the book is mostly based on the author's recollections and those who observed him during his illness. The result is an anecdotal, somewhat rambling account of a coma experience.<br /><br />The account might have been more palatable if not for the cloying mannerisms of writing style: excessive use of italics, stand-alone paragraphs used to highlight his insights, excessive importance attributed to coincidence, and cliff-hanging chapter endings. Further, the author defines the word \\"consciousness\\" so many different ways that what he means is confusing if not essentially lost.<br /><br />The overall style suggests a wide-eyed breathlessness rather than mature reflection. I find it remarkable that someone who has authored and published medical literature could write something so embarrassingly inane. I don't question his experience, but the manner in which he has written about it and promotes it seems self-serving and immature.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for something interesting to read and saw a very inexpensive short story, so I bought Book 1 for my Kindle.  After I read it, I just decided to get the omnibus because I knew I would like the rest of the series.  Even though I'd already bought Book 1 the whole group together was cheaper than buying them one at a time.  And at about $6, it was a steal.
B0053O89KG|5.0|These two just keep getting better with age :) Nathan Fillion and Kata Stanic are the perfect pairing for brains and beauty as well as crime-solving chemistry. Love this show!
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I hadn't seen The Nightmare Before Christmas before renting this, but it was well worth it.  My kids watched it as many times as I would let them and they were singing the songs for a week after watching it.
0553801473|2.0|I think GRRM needs to speed up his writing,  as he seems to be meandering & losing what started as a great plot, even some of his strongest characters are beginning to lag ( those that he has not killed off that is ). If the message he is seeking is that you need to be a  liar, schemer, or self obsessed to survive and win and that all good and noble acts should be punished - he is doing a pretty good job so far.<br /><br />Not impressed with this last book at all or it's story line, nor the fact that the anticipated release date of book 6 is now out to 2014 or beyond
B0012QRPU4|5.0|The show was great, all the shows streamed without a problem, and the price per episode was well worth it. Looking at buying Season 2 as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am writing this review at 2:55 am. why you may ask? The answer is simple. I enjoyed this book so much that I could not stop reading it until I was done. I love the characters and the whole story line of this book. I am looking forward to reading more books by Colleen Hoover.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I haven't read Rowling before this point, but have enjoyed the mythical reality of the Potter series on the screen.  But this reality based &#34;adult&#34; storytelling is long in the tooth, tedious, and particularly taxing and pessimistic.  I pushed through to the bitter end, but the end was even worse for wear than the bulk of the volume, leading to a feeling of dissolution, despair, and failure.  So if that is the goal of the celebrated author in this foray into adult drama, then this is a success.  Otherwise, it is less than that and does not merit a great deal of attention, in my humble opinion.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was on the fence about reading this book because of all the negative remarks· I'm so happy I did it was great!!!! I finished the book in one day!! But now I'm disappointed I have to wait until May for the last book!!!! Defiantly a must read!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|So far I've owned this headset for around a month now and it's worked very well.  As with most surround sound headsets that I have owned the sound quality is good for games and movies but it's a little lacking for music.  Also, I'm not sure if it's my setup or the software itself, but a lot of times I pick up the headset after a day of not using them and it will randomly throw in one of the voice modifications.  I have to go into the software to select then deselect one of the voice modifications to make the microphone sound normal again.  The range of the headset in my house is around 25-30 feet.  It's good enough to walk into the kitchen to get a drink or head downstairs to the bathroom.  All in all it's a good headset and I got it for a great price here on amazon.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|No where near as good the original trilogy, but still, anything with \\"Bourne\\" in the title seems to be way better than anything else.
1400069289|3.0|The scientific theories, at least those covered in the early chapters of the book, looked very similar to classical Skinner's behaviorism: rewards enforced behavior, and did not go further than that.  The rest of books talked about \\"habits\\" at the organization and society levels, but most were supported by case studies instead of scientific studies.  For those who are looking for new development in the scientific studies around habit, you may not find what you want here.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my chair. An excellent read. Kept me guessing throughout. I would highly recommend this book.
1594484805|3.0|The book is more a self-help book than a general science book.  I was expecting the author to synthesize research studies on recent development in motivation theory.  On the contrary, the author cited classical results in the first part of the book, and used more case studies instead of research results in the second part of book.  This book will be interesting for those who have never heard of Deci's self-determination theory.  The core ideas can be quickly summarized in the following great video [...]
B007TK77QE|5.0|Great book - really interesting characters - sad in parts but overall a great read.<br />I was hesitant at first because I loved the Harry Potter books so much and couldn't imagine how it could get any better.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|love this game. lots of hints to help you along. really enjoy this game. It is interesting and challenging. I would definetely recommend.
0811879542|5.0|Even at 67 I gasped as I turned the first page and saw what happened when I \\"pushed the yellow dot\\"..totally original and totally fun concept of taking an action on one page and seeing the result on the next..not to mention all the great learning along the way..up, down, left right, shake, upside down and counting and naming shapes and colors.  This is great choice for grandmas and aunties to have on hand . A great choice as a gift to Head Start and to your local children's library. Also a very well made book..sturdy and very high quality and well designed pages.  Very nice.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put this book down! I think everyone talks about what would they change if they could go back in time and the subject of JFK is usually one of them. i loved all the details. I immediatly fell in love with Jake/George. I found myself rooting for him and Sadie. I loved everything about it, even the ending which i wasn't so sure of at first.
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|This book got great reviews and I was looking forward to a good read over Christmas. The book works on the premise of offering a silver bullet explanation as to why countries succeed or fail. The idea itself is ridiculous but the reviews convinced me to give it a go.  I was disappointed, the book has one good idea but it repeats itself again and again. The reviews on the book cover were ridiculous. I will be very wary of believing any of these reviews again. Does everyone have to slap each other's back ?
B001KQIRGW|5.0|What more can one say... excellent. You never fail to amaze. Those who haven't should check it out.  Miss you Peter.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Unlike the previous installments, this was too long in the making, and it was obvious..<br />Adderall or Dexidrine will help with finishing..<br /><br />On the plus side, Josh Brolin looked great! ;)
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|HAS MANY FUNNY MOMENTS. DRAGS IN SPOTS. ALL IN ALL, IT'S WORTH WATCHING. THE FILM IS DIRECTED TOWARD THE SOUTH PARK, TEAM AMERICA AUDIENCE, OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Dwnlded the demo, and 2 levels in bought the full game. I DON'T love the kindle fire hd but this game helps me regret that purchase a tad less...
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have read most of Nicholas Sparks novels.  I would not rate this as one of his best.  There are some compelling parts to the story, but I thought the end, where Jo came back as an abberation to Katie, was an odd and perhaps uncomfortable twist.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun game to play when I'm board and it makes you think. I thought it would be an easy game for elementary school kids but nope that's not the case here.
078322740X|4.0|I bought this DVD to replace the VCR that we always enjoyed.  We shared it with our neighbors who also liked it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I first started this book it seemed that it was going to be another form of twilight turning into a sappy teen romance series, but just as before the twists and turns are so unpredictable in this second book. You think you know what's going on you almost get comfortable and then just before a chapter ends, you get thrown by some crazy twist you couldn't have anticipated. I would definitely say don't stop at the first book and after reading this you will have to read the third.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is cute, fun for all ages.  The horse is the most dynamic character, who should star in his own feature length presentation.
0385360185|5.0|great book
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|This was a great box set but I wish I could have saved around $10 for having the set exclude crystal skull.
B004NS710C|4.0|An exciting ride for a film that only takes place on a train. Great performances from both Denzel and Captain Kirk!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Fantastic performances and totally enjoyed the fact it was a true story. I highly recommend this to fans of Tom Hardy!
B002O1TMI4|4.0|Another good album. I look forward to seeing them in Tusla early 2013! I admit that they are a bit artsy fartsy, but I hear their live show is spectacular.
B007TR1R22|4.0|This movie is slow moving, but totally delivers the feelings of the actors and the story. Great performances by Tom & Rachel
B006OITIQE|4.0|Not just a bunch of faces turning out albums that I must live through (Justin B.). They seem to know how to write a good hook in multiple songs. I actually listen to this group!
B008846CAC|3.0|There are no signifficant diferences between this and the 12th edition.  You could study from previous editions and complement with another book for the new section.  if you don't have a previous edition then it is ok.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I was very happy with this item.  I was also very happy with how fast I received this item.  Thank-you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im in love with this game!! Just wish the would update it on kindle fire hd as yhey do on other devices.. please update!!!!
B0089XH38M|5.0|Provides anti-virus protection at a great price, FREE.  I've been using AVG products for years and never a problem.  I use this on my smart phone and tablet.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Came in early, great condition. I watched it right away and am loving it!! No scratches. Cover is like brand new. Well it is brand new. It was awesome bc it's nearly impossible to find at the stores near me
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a disappointment. The Hunger Games was ok but catching fire was the best. Mockingjay, well I thought was going to be the best. WRONG. Suzanne should have stopped at Catching Fire.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Wonderful artwork, Broadway quality &#34;Hot Chocolate&#34; scene, poignant song with Billie and his new friend, the chase with the wolves and the eagle scene that is like a Disney ride, Tom Hanks remarkable portrayals of so many characters, and of course the &#34;I Believe&#34; theme make this a must have film to watch year round like we do.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Other reviewers have covered the details. I built this with my three oldest sons (5, 7, 9) over the course of a couple of weeks and we had a blast. Amazing details. If you think you might ever want it, grab one while you can. They discontinued the Millennium Falcon and now those sets sell for $3500!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|As one of  the top three on our list to purchase right after we recently bought our BlueRay player, we highly recommend it for delightful comedy.  Some many great characters and gags and lines with impeccable timing - doesn't get much better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow - this book was a wild ride and it kept me on the edge of my seat. In an effort to avoid spoilers, let me just say that the characters are fascinating and surprising. I enjoyed the multiple perspectives and found most of the story entirely plausible. The few plot holes that appeared are forgivable in exchange for the great ride. In summary, people can be freaky, but I like reading about those freaky people rather than meeting them.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game. lots puzzles going on. like the extra banishing of the gremlins . the rooms are very well put and objects are not too easy to find.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son actually downloaded this to my Kindle to play, but I must admit I am now addicted! We have spent a great deal of time competing to beat each others scores. This is a great game for killing time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Having read many of his books this is one of my favorites. It moved at a steady pace and kept my interest..
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Excellent price, excellent product.... It does just what's its intended to. It doesn't make the tablet bulky, stylish design.. I highly recommend this case.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I sitting here crying like a baby.  Absolutely beautiful, this was a great story and I can't wait too read the next one. Wow! I am at a lost for words and extremely emotional right now.<br /><br />Definitely a must read.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I've been looking for a stylus with a smaller pointer tip for fine work and this one works well. It has three different tip sizes. I love it! Works for everything. When this one wears out I'll be ordering another one. Thanks Amazon!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins has done an amazing job with these books. Loved the movie, but as an avid book reader the books are solo much better!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't lay it down. It went into much more detail than the movie and gave you a better idea about what's going through Katniss's mind. An excellent book that I would recommend to everyone!!
B000MAH5O2|4.0|Motivational for a young 21 year old American like me<br />Recommend this to all patriotic Americans who want to learn from an incredible human being in President Obama
B00114RKT8|5.0|Story is great, acting good, suspense, history, all we would need is for Doctor Who to show up and it would be perfect!
B00979CS50|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. Neil Young sometimes gets a little out there but this one hits the mark with it's classic style.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|This movie is a farce, a parody. It doesn't pretend to take itself seriously like Hunger Games. In someways that makes it a better film but it's a bit hard to watch as the violence is very B movie/horror flick like.  Some of the lines are hysterically funny in a teenager type of way. I felt kind of silly watching it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Not easy to play and the graphics leave something to be desired. I do no use this app on my tablet.
B0035FQ1UU|2.0|It's like watching the fever dream of someone who watches waaaaaaaay to much Fox News.  Incoherent plot.  I honestly didn't get attached to a single character in the movie.....I take that back.  Blu Mankuma and George Segal were the only two people in this movie that seemed to have a soul.  There was just too much going on and not enough substance.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|IMAGES ARE VERY SMALL MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PLAY ON MY TABLER COMPARED TO SOME OTHER MAHJONGS. OVERALL VERY FUN!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I am getting worn out with Kay Scarpetta's griping and constant<br />thinking she is just better than everyone. She is a snob of a character<br />and Cornwell has been spending too much time in Boston!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Much darker than I expected. Amazing character connections with really well drawn characters. Built around a deceptively simple plot that turns out to be about very complicated relationships.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really fun read. Had me guessing and was always one step behind.<br />Made the rainy Oregon days fly by!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I let all these years go by without reading this classic.  It was wonderful-John Steinbeck sure knew how to tell a great story.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very enjoyable reading. I've actually read it more than once. I truly recommend this book. I loved it. Liked book 2 the best
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I looked for a cover for my Kindle Fire and I chose Verso Artist cover for the color and design.  I also chose it for the protection it would give my kindle when I was carrying it around the house and traveling.  I feel it is just perfect for the kindle and what I had in mind for protection of my device. So far no regrets.
B0082Z1CVQ|1.0|This book was okay but boring it has no action it also did not change from a little girls voice to a big girl or women voice
0743270754|5.0|This was a gift for my husband , he was and is very pleased with it.after seeing the movie he wanted to read her book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, repetitive phrasing, terrible lead character, improper use of the word subconscious; your subconscious does not openly yell at you as you are not aware of it effecting your actions. Duh.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Quick mailing.  Works.  Thanks.  Not much else to say.  Good job.  As described.  Well described.  Thanks.  Again.  Good.  Bye.  See ya.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This was a very good read, however, it would be nice to have Pendergast working on a another strange case with the help of his friends from the previous books.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|John Corey will take you on a journey and keep you smiling throughout. This novel gets 5 stars from me. I couldn't put it down until the end. Can't wait to read my next DeMille novel.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|To have my own copy of this truly enjoyable series is great.  I can become absorbed in the set decoration,  costumes,  and the lives of the people living in that majestic house.  This is MY soap opera.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I did enjoy this. However, I'm not sure if that's because it reminded me a lot of 50 shades of grey or because it was genuinely. It has its own little moments that I liked. Over all a very good book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy the various puzzles,  don't think I have played the same one twice, yet.  Keeps me entertained for quite a while.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't put these books down! Once I finished the first one I have been glued to my kindle since.
B009L7MD44|5.0|i bought iusbport, coz some friend told me its better than seagate satellite.. well.. thats right, i can plug any HDD into iusbport, and work flawlessly.. great gadget..
1933492929|5.0|A great quality book of the repertoire of Terryl Whitlach.  Beautifully recreates this masters process and finished product of the real and imagined.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Nowhere does it say used. It also was obviously dropped with visible damage on two corners. Price was good but should be more clear with description.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|We are Bruce Willis fans, it could of used a little more plot but I would give it 3.5 stars,fun to download off of Amazon, still had some interruption in streaming
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks books!  I have read Safe Haven twice! His books draw you in and you don't want to put the book down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually saw the movie first...it follows very closely to the book. Of course the book is better because it has the details that acting cannot portray. I think the concept of the whole thing is pretty messed up but it's still a great book. Onto the next :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a great book. Very fast-paced and dramatic. You won't want to put it down once you've stated reading. It's one of those books that will keep you up all night and stay in your mind long after you've finished reading.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this product and I watch the show on Sunday and I can't get enough of it. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes fantasy and mystery.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I read this book when it first came out in hard bound.  I still have the book.  I love the book so much that I wanted it on kindle.  After reading some of these reviews, I am changing my mind.  There is no child porn in the original print version.  I think I will stick with my original hard bound print version.  Thanks for the heads up about the Kindle version of what I consider the best book by Stephen King.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this product because I watch the show on Thursday and I can't get enough of it. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes Vampire Diaries.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|This was a great book which was very deep but out of all the darkness there was some funny in this book. I would recommend this to a person that is okay with sad and see the happiness in everything.
B00846REIS|5.0|Read in one day. I could not put this down! It's sexy, funny and I fell in love with the characters instantly! Definitely a must read !
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a fun read worth your time. Not my favorite Grisham novel, but still enjoyable and full of plot twists that will keep you engaged.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good, slow in the middle. Interesting way to wrap up the book, i wish the narrator's story was told. .
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The thing I enjoyed most about _Looper_ was watching Gordon-Levitt imitate a young Bruce Willis (whereas Willis just acted like himself). The idea behind the movie was interesting. In particular, the movie does a decent job investigating the generational gap within a single person -- how someone can change and suddenly be at odds with a prior (or future) version of himself. Beyond that, the audience is told not to worry too much about the time-travel details, but time travel is the scaffold on which the movie is built. The end of the movie is predictable, but it is also terribly flawed as it uses time travel to conveniently erase some aspects of a time line while leaving others strangely unchanged. Consequently, it looks like the writers just took the easy exit rather than coming up with something consistent or scrapping the whole project completely.<br /><br />So the movie is at odds with itself. It is not a fast-paced popcorn-eating movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. It tries to be more thought provoking, bringing up issues surrounding how people and their priorities change over time, and how life experiences shape people. Time travel is supposed to merely be a background context to be forgotten as these larger issues are asserted, but the flaws in this background are so noticeable that it is hard to forget them.<br /><br />So I was disappointed by the slow, predictable, flawed movie, but I enjoyed the acting of Gordon-Levitt.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You want to read the next book. I couldn't put the book down and I hope the next one is as good. On to the next...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|In some ways, _Elementary_ is just another spin on the formula for the detective show with the eccentric gifted central character who enters as a consultant. Compare it to _Lie to Me_ or _The Mentalist_ or even _Castle_, or the many others. This formula has evolved from older detective show formulas, and so _Elementary_ will look familiar to many shows that came before it and compete with it.<br /><br />What _Elementary_ adds, building off an idea experimented with in _House_, is that the audience comes equipped with a backstory of the two characters and some idea about their future, and so it's exciting to see how that backstory gets weaved into the standard detective drama.<br /><br />On top of that, Sherlock's character is fun and playful. Holmes is played perfectly cool with a hint of excitement about being around Sherlock. The chemistry around the two is great - no sexual tension, which would distract from the backstory, while still acknowledging sexual difference.<br /><br />I worry about what happens when Sherlock's nemesis is added. I'm afraid that will get old in this format. However, these villains have been add to other shows and succeeded. After all, it's the detective-show formula that will likely be the end of _Elementary_ and not its memorable characters.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|An epic third book of the Heroes Of Olympus series. Rick Riordan has done it again! Read this and you won't be sorry.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My five year old loves the game from know it by the show. She pays the game all the time.
B0030MM68O|5.0|A totally different kind of war film, told close up, illustrating the conflict these men faced every day in Iraq. The directors Oscar was well deserved. Jeremy Renner was superb as was the rest of the cast. A truly great film.
1400067820|5.0|I picked up \\"Antifragile\\" at Logan Airport in Boston on my way to Greece for a little R & R. I work as a Hospitalist in Gloucester, MA and my 12-hour days don't give much time for outside reading, so I use these getaways to juice what I call my \\"Airport Education\\".<br /><br />I first must warn the reader that this book is not an easy read. Some criticize Taleb for his lack of editing. I had no problems with the editing but the ideas presented sometimes approached the limits of my intelligence, which I consider a good thing.<br /><br />As a practicing physician I am not really qualified to criticize or endorse his economic concepts although they seem to make sense. I view him more as a modern philosopher and I find his ideas very attractive and thought provoking. I think he is one of the more profound thinkers of our time.<br /><br />When it comes to his views on medicine, I am very qualified to comment after spending almost 40 years in the medical trenches. What I find surprising is that despite coming from totally different directions, we seem to have ended up in the same place. His view that you should stay away from physicians unless you are seriously ill reflects my experience. Interventional treatments for people who are not seriously ill often do more harm than good. That's one reason I left primary care to work in an acute care setting. Most people who are a little sick simply do not benefit much from additive treatments like medications or many elective surgeries. Over the long run, such treatments often increase a person's fragility.<br /><br />Subtractive treatments such as lifestyle changes or removing toxic elements from your diet tend to be much more effective at improving your health, leaving you much more antifragile in the long run.<br /><br />To summarize Taleb's beliefs when it comes to health:<br /><br />1. Intermittent fasting and starvation are good stressors that improve health and prolong life.<br /><br />2. Additive therapies such as medications should only be used when a person is seriously ill. If you are only a little ill, subtractive therapies such as removing sugar, HFCS and grains from your diet makes more much more sense because this approach respects our evolutionary history.<br /><br />3. The only beverages he drinks are water, coffee and red wine. This mimics my preferences. I also sometimes slip in a few shots of ouzo, especially when in Greece.<br /><br />4. He believes that aerobic exercise is for fools. He does extreme weight lifting, interval training and long, slow walks. In my view this reflects the most research on exercise.<br /><br />5. He follows the Greek Orthodox calendar to guide his eating and to provide variety in composition, timing and quantity of food. Our ancient ancestors did the same but not out of choice--they had to eat whatever was available to them and this was certainly not on a set schedule. I am also Greek Orthodox and do the same.<br /><br />6. The only fruits he eats are those he recognized from when he was growing up in Lebanon. They tend to be small and sour rather than large and sweet like our modern fruits.<br /><br />7. He rarely eats breakfast.<br /><br />8. He believes that excess fructose is a chronic toxin.<br /><br />In a nutshell, after years of medical training and 40 years of clinical practice, this is basically what I advise my patients to do because this approach seems to be much more effective than the interventionist approach championed by mainstream medicine. I've had the advantage of time to see how various approaches play out over the long run.<br /><br />To be honest with you, I think Taleb could put on a white coat, throw a stethoscope around his neck and outperform most physicians when it comes to improving patient's health and quality of life, excluding of course trauma and acute serious illnesses. Yes, this is a compliment to Taleb but it is also a condemnation of our current state of affairs in medicine.<br /><br />Primary care physicians are paid zippo for preventing diabetes but insurance companies do pay for \\"managing\\" diabetes once you get the disease. According to this logic, primary care physicians should have donuts in their waiting rooms! His views on exercise also mirror the latest research showing that the benefits of exercise follow a convex curve--those who don't exercise and those who do a lot of intense aerobic exercise are likely shortening their lives. Those who do moderate exercise--say slow, random walking tend to extend their lifespan.<br /><br />I know that the focus of his book is economics, yet I believe that his views on health are likely to have a much greater impact on people's lives. After all, if you lose your health, all the money in the world isn't really worth that much.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge their brain and improve their health.s are paid zippo for preventing diabetes but insurance companies do pay for \\"managing\\" diabetes once you get the disease.

B007V65R54|4.0|Nate Silver, best known for predicting all 2012 federal elections, has written an interesting glimpse into how statistics can be used and abused in daily life. He emphasizes the role of probability and discusses how ego, vested interest, greed, and wishful thinking can impact predictions in a negative way. He discusses some of the highly successful applications, such as baseball, and those that are still left wanting, like earthquakes.  The book is a very quick read and I appreciated the opportunity to buy the narration cheaply and move between the written and spoken work seamlessly with Whispersync Voice. There were times I found myself wanting more technical detail and I hope Silver writes some deeper books on the subject in the future. This books provides a palatable introduction to the subject of probability for even those not mathematically-inclined. I recommend the narration, in particular. Silver has an easy-going style that is well conveyed verbally by the writer.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I love criminal minds. I can't wait to watch the rest of the season. Low cost if you miss it on tv.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This book was rec'd by a friend.  I enjoyed the strong female lead and the way she managed her life and friends.  Light fantasy reading.  I read book 3 before book 2 and am glad I did.  For me it all fits together better this way.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading slammed and point of retreat... and loving them... I had extremely high hopes for this  Book! And I must say I am not disappointed! The characters in this story are amazing. When you think they finally have it all figured out..... surprise twist that makes you want to cry and shout at your kindle. A must read book!
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Tried to watch this but didn't get far. Seeing \\"stars\\" lip-synching to non-original recordings of 80s hits: not my idea of entertainment. Plus, if you are going to make a movie set in 1987, try a little harder to make it authentic! Julianne Hough's hair in the opening scene looks more like a cross between Farrah Fawcett and a modern-day style than remotely like anything I saw in 1987. In 1987 it was all about bad perms and big, fried, curled bangs. Not even CLOSE to what is in  this movie. Secondly, I distinctly heard \\"I Remember You\\" by Skid Row in the record-store scene. DID NOT COME OUT UNTIL 1989. Lazy, lazy, lazy. How this movie received the rave reviews it did is beyond me. Weak!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Original and creative story with well developed characters confronting universal dilemmas in an unusual setting. I look forward to reading more of Howey's books.
B001NFU5WE|5.0|i bought this just to display as i have the dark knight allready but not this special edition, huge batman fan and the dark knight is one of the greatest movies in the last 30 years period, you have it all, awesome action scenes, very realistic characters that just pull all the emotion out of you, its got everything!
0765365278|5.0|I've read Sanderson's work before (specifically Elantris and Warbreaker) and I've been very happy with how he completed the Wheel of Time series thus far and I eagerly await the last book of that series.<br /><br />However running into this series has given me a new work to look forward to. The Stormlight Archive promises to be an entertaining and action packed series which I can sink my teeth into!<br /><br />This first book in the series establishes the main characters (so far) and sets up the back story for a few of them. From what Sanderson has said the series will detail the backstory of a character in each book, and upon speculation it seems that the next book will concentrate on Shallan, and after that Dalinar.<br /><br />But moving on to the book itself. The Way of Kings revolves around Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar, three important characters who drive the plot. They each have stories of loss, hope, and conquest which are fantastic to read. The magic system (as always with Sanderson) is meticulously detailed and has plenty of mysteries for us to discover now. From Soulcasting to Lashings he has given us a vast and amazing system of magic which has yet to be fully explored. I'm always amazed at the systems of magic he can create and I'm loving what he's done with the world thus far.<br /><br />The world of Roshar itself is very alien and unique. The wild life is very aquatic in nature with giant crabs and coral like trees and grass. Battered by weekly hurricane like gales called highstorms the worlds wildlife has adapted to it's unique situation. The imagining and establishment of this world is very cool and well thought out! The way people have adapted to the storms and using their unique magic to adapt to it is likewise well thought out and impressive. It's hard to say whether this is fantasy or science fiction at times! Truly though it is an amazing world!<br /><br />The story is one which is engaging at a personal level and although at points it is slowthere is no skimping on characterization and drama. I don't want to say much as the cover really speaks for itself when describing it.<br /><br />Needless to say I love the story and I can't wait to see more.
B00AE5R2NO|4.0|Very sturdy toy, but the clear plastic cover does pop off from time to time.  Excellent for tub time! Wish it were available in the states.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I watched Season 1 and Season 2 on Netflix. This review is for both seasons and is posted on both. As a TV series, other than Friday Night Lights, I've never been so drawn into a world.<br /><br />The main characters have distinct personalities.<br /><br />The men:<br /><br />Rick Grimes - The moral leader.<br />Glenn Rhee - Smart, stealthy, supporter of the team. He's accused of being weak at times but is the opposite.<br />Daryl Dixon - Loner. He's rough around the edges but inside has a good heart. They're in the south, so they needed a hard core redneck.<br />Shane Walsh - Bad ass cop, he's the one who you're never quite sure about. Friend, or foe?<br />Dale Horvath - The group's elder. His words of wisdom are often lost on the younger generation. Isn't that how it usually works?<br />Hershel Greene - Opinionated, but somewhat delusional, he thinks they're dealing with a virus for which a cure will soon be found.<br /><br />The women:<br /><br />Andrea - The strongest, yet at times, weakest, of the women. She contemplates suicide more than once but learns to protect herself.<br />Carol Peletier - The weakest of the women, she lets men abuse her, and seems clingy.<br />Lori Grimes - The unofficial \\"First Lady\\" of the group. She's at times mother, at other times confidant to the women, at other times supporter of the men.<br />Maggie Greene - Farm girl who falls for Glenn. She lives in Hershel's dream world until reality jolts her.<br /><br />I've read a number of the 2-star reviews (as I never read the 1-star ones) and most of them focus on how \\"we've seen this all before\\" or the plot is \\"contrived\\" or \\"people just don't act that way.\\" I'll address each of these cons for folks out there who might be interested but have been turned off by the negativity.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />The beginning. A cop named Rick is shot. He's in a hospital. When he wakes up the world has fallen to chaos. It feels too familiar to 28 Days Later. But that's where the similarity ends. Rick comes across a father and son, who save him and tell him it's safe in Atlanta. That they will soon make their way there. So Rick decides if his wife and son are alive that's probably where they'd be. Atlanta, of course, is overrun. He hides in a tank where apparently the operators were also taken by the virus. Rick is saved by Glenn who watched him crawl in the tank. The group who Glenn is with outside the city happens to be the group whom Rick's wife is with; and she isn't alone. She's been getting down with his best friend Shane, who left him to die in the hospital.<br /><br />Contrived? I'd say, yes, there are some coincidences that seem a bit far out, Rick's reunion with his wife the most egregious. It will depend on your point of view. I think when you start watching, you expect him to find his wife. If you think it shouldn't have happened, you'll think it was contrived, no matter what. Because in that situation it really has to be \\"contrived.\\" This reunion is what drives the rest of Season 1, so if you can't suspend disbelief with regard to it, you will hate this series.<br /><br />Why do they kill themselves out of nowhere? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what to say to this. Wouldn't you think about it in their situation? This is very real to human nature, in my opinion, and I didn't think characters \\"did it out of nowhere.\\" They were probably all thinking about it at one time or another, only some were actually willing to do it.<br /><br />Guns? Why didn't they have more guns? After all, why wouldn't that have been their first priority? With all the guns in the South surely their would be guns EVERYWHERE, falling from the sky, the naysayers pout. I say in a time of panic, humans shift to the most basic parts of the pyramid for survival. Food, Water, Clothing, Shelter. Guns would certainly be on the list, and these folks admitted they needed more guns, but I could understand how, in a time of panic, that might not have been as much a priority. Also, in the beginning, they didn't necessarily know their would be \\"herds\\" roaming. They were away from their town and far from the city, so they had a false sense of security.<br /><br />Why do the characters keep doing dumb things? Admittedly, these excursions lead to chaos more often than not, but isn't that why we watch? Don't we watch or read these zombie dramas to see the group attacked? To see how they react to adversity? To watch the breakdown of humanity as we revert to our basic instincts? Rick has a good heart, and he DID grab guns from the station. When he was ambushed he left them in Atlanta. So naturally, his inclination is to retrieve the guns, while doing something good: saving a man he handcuffed to a bar. That is in-line with him as a character: analytical, pragmatic, but not always totally logical. This is in contrast to Shane, who at all the twists and turns believes they should be ruthless. The contrast is clear throughout, never so much as the end of Season 2.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />The bottom line: if you enjoy the zombie genre, great acting, interesting characters, wacky situations, and heart-thumping tension, (and if you have Netflix or AMC on demand), I'd highly recommend throwing on the pilot. This is the type of series where the hook is obvious and if you aren't into it by then, you won't be. If you are like me, you're in for a very, very fun ride, and you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.<br /><br />-Raeden Zeny.

0307593525|5.0|Bought for my daughter-in-law so she too could enjoy these classics. They taught me how to cook in the 70s through the clear instructions that guide every step of the way.
B000L53D4O|5.0|I gave this to my Grand Nephew for his first Birthday.  He isn't real steady yet, but the walker and activity set are a big hit, and helpful as well as entertaining
B000OCXIDK|5.0|As an artist I really enjoyed reading this book. The details were acurate as to the techniques the artist used and I enjoyed the story.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is great, BUT I really, REALLY wish they would update the Kindle Fire version before I buy it.  The free one is fun, but I'm missing out on a TON of cool features that I can get on my phone.  I'm also getting sick of drawing the same words over and over again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app but it some times it goes black and I have to stop playing for a while but still a good game.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Seems like a good concept, but it's the same as the rest.  Also, the block is difficult to control, even on a larger screen, like my Kindle Fire.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Like many other parents I search for educational apps for the Kindle that are rated well. So, I searched for \\"educational apps for kids\\" in the Kindle store that were 4 stars and up, and free. This was offered up as a choice. Description listed it as a puzzle game. As my 5yo played and played and played and played with this, I realized it's it's a GAME game. Not a bad thing in itself, but it didn't jive with my search criteria. Here's an interesting link if you want to followup: [...]    I suppose it's educational if you ever wake up to discover you are a blob of pudding and must merge with other blobs of pudding to preserve your mutated gelatinous species. You'll be ready my friend.    Now that THAT's out of the way, it looks like an adorably fun game. The sounds and colors are deliciously addicting. I felt compelled to test it out for one round....  but oops.  As a recovering Tetris junkie, I had to stop.  Proud to tell everyone that I am still on the wagon, in control, responding to boring emails and not referring to Pudding Monster as \\"my precious.\\"    And all's well. My 5yo enjoys it reasonably. Perhaps you will too.
B004UID2LC|2.0|An actual YouTube app would be much better.  This thing is really...just, lame.  I wish I had a better way of putting it.  Like, you have to long press to get a popup window asking how you want to watch the video, which is so unnecessary,

B005VPRET4|5.0|She was so excited to have her own legos! She is a little younger and does need some assistance in assembling but overall a grat purchase for her (she is 5). Her brother has his legos so great idea to have these female oriented legos!
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Benicio del Toro is one of my favorite actors, and I have been a fan of Oliver Stone since I was a wee boy, but I did not feel the grit or savagery that I was expecting.  The plot could have been scripted by a second year theater student, and a lot of the acting is based on &#34;cold&#34; stares and long pauses.  That works for truly dramatic work, and from dramatic actors, which this film was short on.  There are some decent action sequences, and the cinematography and art are all well done.  Overall, it is the poorly developed characters, plot holes, and ineffective acting that make this a boring movie.  I feel like Stone tries to save the film by throwing in the &#34;twist&#34; at the end, but it seems more like they had a overly scripted movie that could have one of two boring endings, and so instead of just picking one they decided to shoot two, hoping that would somehow rescue the movie. Unfortunately, that doesn't work and you're left saying &#34;what a twist&#34; with absolute sarcasm.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The graphics could be a little larger for my old eyes. But over all it's a really fun and great game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm NOT a romance reader, and only got this book hesitatingly on a friend's recommendation. I've now read through it twice in three days. A fairytale romance between people with dark, real-life issues, it's a good mix of drama, suspense, and romance. I want more books like this, although the descriptions of her other books make me suspect that they are not of the same quality. Any recommendations?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great fun<br />loved it loved the hidden objects would like to play more like this. great graphics and theme andpictures

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game to spend a little bit of time on. You won't be entertained for hours on end, but if you need something to kill half an hour, this will do just fine.
0767836324|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Great cast, great humor, and a wonderful continuation of the Peter Pan story.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game is OK, and a good way to spend ten minutes. This is a good start but needs more development and depth.

B004C4IKCU|5.0|Upon his return from the army in 1960, many were left wondering whether or not Elvis Presley would be able to reclaim his title as the King of Rock 'n' Roll; his first album after being released, simply titled \\"Elvis is Back,\\" answered the question with a resounding yes.<br /><br />\\"Elvis is Back\\" is a significant release in The King's catalogue for many reasons. Not only was it his first record in nearly three years, it also signaled a shift in his artistic direction; the raw, wild sound that defined so many of his 1950s' records had been more streamlined into a more refined, mature sound that helped expand Elvis's fan base and repertoire, allowing him to tackle blues, jazz, R&B and other genres the same way he attacked pure rock and roll in 1956-58. The backing musicians on the album were the tightest unit Elvis had ever played with to date and perhaps ever, and helped to induct these diverse new sounds into his artistry.<br /><br />Classic recordings like the breezy \\"The Girl of My Best Friend,\\" the sexy \\"Dirty, Dirty Feeling,\\" the raunchy \\"Such a Night,\\" and the smoldering take on \\"Reconsider Baby\\" (with amazing sax by Boots Randolph) are some of the finest of his career. The sound on the record has been improved tremendously, and has been augmented with seven huge hit singles recorded during the same period but not included on the original release, including four # 1 classics (\\"Stuck on You,\\" \\"It's Now or Never,\\" \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight,\\" and \\"It's Now or Never\\").<br /><br />\\"Elvis is Back\\" is also now coupled with its follow-up, 1961's \\"Something for Everybody.\\" Its title refers to its attempt to offer two sides of Elvis, his softer, ballad centric side and his rocker persona. Of the two, the former is the stronger side, with such towering recordings as \\"There's Always Me\\" and the haunting \\"Gently.\\" The rockin' side, however, is pretty forgettable. The record is improved greatly by the bonus tracks, another five hit singles that are better pretty much everything on the album.<br /><br />\\"Elvis is Back\\" in its legacy edition is an absolutely essential purchase.hing on the album.<br /><br />\\"Elvis is Back\\" in its legacy edition is an absolutely essential purchase.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I think the writers are either getting lazy or running out of ideas for this story line.<br />The action was okay, but the plot seemed weak.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Had read this about a year ago, decided to get it when I got the sequel so that my wife could read the series as well.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|If you haven't seen the other two you won't get some of the references in this one, but for fans of this series they should be okay. Some of the same old tired ideas keep popping up. If you like knowing what going to know how things are going to come out without many twists then this ones for you.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|the game is cute but like all the others like this. they are fun but too costly. if they made them cheaper more people would play longer
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I absolutely loved the first installment of the Iron Druid Chronicles! This was a truly original book with outstanding character development and world-building. I jumped straight from the first into the second and bought the remaining books in the series. I can't recommend it highly enough to fans of fantasy and magic.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I'm kind of watch snob... So when I set out looking for a nice everyday watch I never thought I'd end up with a seiko. From its initial presentation in the box.. Right down to its accuracy this is a great watch. Don't hesitate !!
B003F1WM2K|3.0|It's a beautiful story of a friendship, though a bit self-indulgent at times.  I found their story inspiring.  The near continuous name drop was a bit distracting.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Purchased full version. No problem with down load. I create a work schedule for our office and brought in from computer my excel formatted one only to find out my formulas where useless because the formats do not include month date year. They have all EXCEPT that format which the whole sheet is made up on. Very disappointing. Please fix also no print option. I am using on kindle fire hd
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book but also hated it.  You would have to read it to understand.  They say there's nothing new under the sun but this comes kind of close.
B003GFIWGK|5.0|I love Sherlock Holmes and reading all his books is always a favorite past-time of mine. I just wish there were more...
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns! Great details, I couldn't put it down! So much better than the typical ways most books end. I highly recommend this book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Big Duck has made a creative game that involves thinking.  my teachers said we should get this app and everyone loves it!  6th grade hit!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|She love it!.. She really have not given me anymore information on the CD, Except that she liked it very much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wish I could rate this 6 stars! I was up till 2am reading this! I would definitely recommend this to everyone!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. Lovely graphics,  cute animations. Good logistics game ... all about balance. I reccommend this game highly.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|II teach Art history as well as 20th century literature and history.  found the fantasy trip that Woody Allen has wrought most fascinating.  Woody really did his homework on this one.  it was historically accurate but mot dry a bit.  The casting was genius and, while there was a 'Woody Allen&#34; character in it, Woody wisely did not play it himself.  Totally entertaining  film!
B00APUQJLO|1.0|This is the first movie that I've rented from Amazon where I've wanted my money back. Do yourself a favor and skip watching this one. David Cronenberg, director and screenplay, needs some self-help.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|After reading nothing but dark violent mysteries and classic Russian novels these past months this was a pleasant  lighthearted experience.
B005FISC52|5.0|I get it as gift to someone who is a HUGE fan of One Tree Hill.  From what I was told, it was great DVDs and is great for the collection and watch over and over when they wants to.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This has to be one of the sweetest movies ever.<br />We rented it at the REDBOX and thought it would be just \\"okay\\"<br />It was so \\"okay\\" that I wanted my own copy.<br />Watch it anytime, not just Chrstmas time if you want a lift.<br />Truth be told, some scenes made me laugh till I cried.<br />Will Ferrell, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Zooey Deschanel, and Bob Newhart, and keep your eyes peeled for<br />Peter Billingsley (Ralphie in A Christmas Story) as an elf.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Not as good as old TV Shows years ago, but still say it is good movie and i enjoy it so much.  It started in Lab and they fights for freedom and they earned it.  That is what movie is all about.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. I use it on a daily basis. One of the best calc apps I have found.
B004UID2LC|5.0|It is excellent for Kindle Fire, Good size, and easier to read the comments.  I use it often till I get a new TV which have YouTube so I only watch on Kindle Fire when I am outside or travel.  But it is really great to add it to Kindle Fire.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Though it may not have been the best season, it more than satisfied on TV. Plus it's a solid DVD release sold at an agreeable price.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|It is excellent movie and true story about Secretariat horse.  I remember when I was young, I watched that race and Secretariat did an amazing job.  Which never ever happen since then.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really liked this one.  it has great story and graphics.  the map makes sense and doesn't take you back and forth overly much.  good mix of ho and mini games of different tpyes.  did not get bored and will play again. paid for the full version. worth the three bucks.
B008602KQI|4.0|I am collecting movies with Jennifer in it.  But this movie itself is good, if not excellent or as I hope for. But this movie is when Jennifer get off to a best start or get more known to everyone.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is amazing!!! I have found out that it works best on the Kindle Dire HD....but there is so much u can do! Make friends and help each other through quest or whatever. It's a lot more fun than I expected! U should try it out yourself now!!!!
B005LAIH9A|4.0|It is so funny as usual but not as great as first 2 or 3 movies.  But still funny and crazy.
B008E374PO|1.0|I've been a fan of owl city for quite some time, before fireflies was on the radio.<br />This album was disappointing. I had to google Check to make sure this was for sure Adam young. The album just feels like a huge cop out sell out. I was hoping \\"good time\\" was just a fluke on the album. Not that it isn't catchy, but it isn't the owl city I listen to. The engineering of each track has changed from the delicate hand made tracks into filters used in every Katy perry, ke$ha, pit bull, etc track heard on the radio.<br />Every song in my opinion sounds about the same. And the lyrics have gone from imagination to a fixation upon someone, a girl.<br />If you listen to the old owl city, there wasn't much sappy music about girls.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It is a great movie, mainly about family who struggling with their life and keep in faith to make them stronger and doing the right things when they either doing something wrong or courage to do something right.  That is what movie is all about.  For example, if your boss tell you to do something illegal, and you refuse to,  you got the job!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandson wanted me to download an &#34;Angry Birds &#34; game on my Kindle Fire. I decided to try this one. He has not seen it yet but I have had a really good time playing it. I am not very good at some of the games my grandkids like but I really have enjoyed this one. I will be excited to see what my grandson thinks of it. I may have to get a more complicated version. Thanks for offering this one amazon.com
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I don't know why they tell me to post review here since amazon.com discontinued to sell that set of DVDs.  But anyway,  it is excellent shows and I bought it only because I can catch up with missed shows and share with my family and relatives who also missed those shows.  It is always nice to share and catch up.
1594489505|5.0|The Middle East has been at the forefront for several years. This book gave me insight into the cultural thinking and understand  some of the reasons why it seems so foreign to us in the West.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is easy to read and understand it well.  I read it before watched the movie.  It is a good and interesting book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this is a great beautifully written book. from the first page to the last it consums you. the characters in this book are real and the story is real. i would recommend this book to anyone.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It is good size and easier to use on Kindle Fire, but I do have problem loading it time to time.  Not sure why or what happen, but size is excellent to use you like to play Dictionary games.  It is same as Dictionary and always fun to play with friends.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|Tons of music in a chick flick, you'll know for sure what would happen. It is a movie that you should pick if there's nothing else to see.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Just collect all the movies.  Can't say it is one of my favorite but I don't mind watch something strange and curious.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I've been playing this for a week against the computer (haven't loaded the program to play others).  I was frustrated and stopped playing as much I didn't think you could 'flip' a piece.  Discovered this morning by accident, if you put a piece on the board and then keep your finger on it, it flips it.  Now that I know that I'll consider loading the multi-user program.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I read it everyday and have no problem with it at all.  But haven't read any for awhile due to lack of time but will resume it soon.  But it is really great to have it on Kindle Fire and easier than iPhone which is much smaller and sometimes hard to read.  So it is very helpful to me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I just can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy
B004LROMSO|5.0|It is so sad that they last only a season.  I understand about the rate, but in my opinion, it is a great shows, and I loves history and natures.  It is really wonderful to watch those things.
0547260695|5.0|The Little Prince Pop-up book edition is very nice gift for all person, kind or adult, I think. if you are from your &#34;enfance&#34; that book  is just for you ! We are very happy to receve &#34;Little Prince &#34; in our familly,<br />Thank you,<br />maguli khurtsia
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Just for collection and enjoy the movies.  It is great for fans of Harry Potter, but not my well, big fan of, but just enjoy to watch movies full of actions.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Super fun, but could be slightly longer. I am in no way an avid gamer so games take longer for me to complete. My son and I had this one beat in a little more than four hours. If the developer is promising new levels, then this would be five stars, but for $1.99 I expect just a little more than four hours. That being said, I would have no problem spending $0.99 on this app because it is a ton of fun to play and for some reason $0.99 is a good &quot;throw away&quot; price in my head. Just keep in mind that this app is fun, but that fun will only last a few hours. Then, you'll forget you ever bought it. Look at it as a donation rather than a purchase.<br /><br />By the way, no problems on my old Archos 80 G9 running ICS. You WILL have fun playing this app.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy it so much,  It is one of my favorite game to play.  But I really don't like this game to much, just not same as I usually seen before.  Still looking for better one.  But it is still very good, not say it is horrible or anything like that.  It is really good, just not what I am looking for.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera bag was purchased with a Canon Rebel T3i camera that I purchased for my wife for Christmas. Once the camera bag got here it reminded me of the Lowe Pro Mini Trekker that I purchased several years ago. The bag has a similar look and has some of the same features with several zip pockets on the interior and a couple of zip pockets on the exterior. Of course it's not the Lowe Pro but would be a great bag for the beginner photographer who needs a bag to throw on the shoulder for small trips or around town. The bag also has enough space to carry another camera lense and possibly another camera body. Overall it is a great bag!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game to kill time with.  earn coins very easily to unlock other levels.  fun for the entire family.  would recommend
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I am a huge mark Wahlberg fan, so I watched it.  But it was pretty much family guy on the big screen.  I love crude humor, but I also like comedians that change it up a but, also.  McFarland makes me laugh the first 15minutes of the movie, and the rest of the movie was mildly interesting at best.  I would have not watched all of it if I was not able to watch mila kunis.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very nice app!  Recently I was having problems with my Kindle Fire's battery.  This app helped me give specific numbers enabling Amazon to understand the problem. Clear, easy to read interface. Definitely a great tool.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|My husband went crazy when opening this for Christmas !! He is true fan of the series and cant wait to recieve season two !! Thank you for your prompt services, greatly appreciated !!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|A very fun game. The puzzles are not too easy nor too difficult. I love these types of point and click games.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|Come on Otterbox! Put a little effort into this! Your case for the Gen. IV ipod touch is perfect. Why didn't this beautiful Samsung get some love when it came time to measure and make the molds for this phone?
B001M4YZ90|5.0|If you like modern mobster/crime style movies, this is a great film. It has a<br />large cast of interesting character's having humorous, tangled and otherwise<br />interesting conflicts. If you like this move, also be sure to check out Snatch.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Pretty fun. Better than some I've played before. King cool down times are bad though. I like the war play.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|nothing new or interesting about it. Studio was obviously just trying to cash in on the resident evil line with out regard for the story. If you have never seen any of the movies before maybe you would enjoy it.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|works as advertised. It works flawlessly on windows 8.<br />I bought this item primarily for multi-player gaming and<br />so far so good!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|the beginning was very good/  at about 52% it started to get unrealistic and not believable.  i am reading the rest only to see how it ends.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|The very hard songs are extreme. I haven't even thought to attempt some of them. For the most part this is a really good app. Wish there were updates with added songs, though. Or maybe one with &quot; easy songs&quot; or something. Getting bored hearing and playing the same songs over and over
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I had to choose this rating because it FAR exceeded my expectations. Now I am able to move , rotate and twist my monitor to suit my viewing needs. I have my monitor finally at eye level which if you've never experienced that you're in for a treat. I was supplied with all the tools and fasteners I needed to make it work. I HIGHLY recommend this unit to anyone who is tired oe eye strain, neck pain and frustration with having to look DOWN at your monitor. It was money well spent and I'd do it all over again.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|It was amazing i loved the movie! Also the quality of the movie was amazing there were no scratches on the dvd.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but it disappointed.  The beginning started out as very intriguing and of course the special effects were great, then it fell into the old alien/monster gore fest that I was hoping it would avoid.  I was looking for a more weightier an thoughtful movie.  Oh well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Strangely addictive for a free game. I find myself coming back for more.  Really reminds me of the arcade game! Great for a quick break.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I love this classic.  Very witty and a great James Stewart movie.  The dialogue can be fast paced and feels rushed at times, but I love the subtle humor through out.  You have to be paying close attention to catch all the witty innuendo.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|First off, let me say that I am a huge sceptic when it comes to movies and TV, and it takes a lot for me to like something. I try to only keep up with one or two shows at a time so I don't get overwhelmed, and when this show first began, I was already addicted to Chuck (great show if you've never checked it out). Finally some of my friends made me watch the first episode and I became interested. After buying and watching season one (in one day!) I had to immediately go to the rental store and get season two. I would recommend this to anyone, because even though I myself am not much of a zombie fan, anyone who likes a good story can get into this. The cliffhangers are too compelling to stop watching and the acting is amazing (Norman Reedus in particular). My only suggestion to anyone buying is to go ahead and order season two with it, because you won't be able to stop!
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|We purchased the Calley's Rescue Set and this was a great addition to the set for our both of our children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I figured out the ending, almost.  I can not imagine having to participate or watch in real life. I hope society remains civil.  Is there a book two?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great solitary game. I love how it gives you different dealing options. I play this game almost every night before bed.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wow is all I can say.... I loved it... <3 there is no doubt I wouldn't want to read it again..... I couldn't help but smile laugh and tense up at most points of this wonderful book. I would recommend the book to all my friends.... :)
B005UD1D62|4.0|Although it is not LA Candy..it definitely helps to have read the books in order because it gave me a lot of insight to the repeating characters. I like the new drama that has surfaced thus far. All I hope is....book 2 sustains the same passion and easy to follow story line. On to the next book....
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved every word of this book! Just when I thought it didn't have anywhere else to go, I was surprised with more ideas and imagination than I remember reading in a very long time. Well done Mr. Riggs!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written, unrealistic, strange, and yet...an oddly captivating storyline. Won't waste my time actually reading the next two books, but will be finding a spoiler review so that I know what happens!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great app. very challenging and its great for making time fly by. there's many levels which makes it like an endless game. love it.
B007FH22VQ|5.0|superbly crafted songs. vocals that almost make you want to turn your speakers down all the way, but for some reason you can't ....because the sound is just too addictive. this album is groundbreaking! buy it!!!
B00A6X9Z8E|5.0|I will be turning 70 this year and watched Kelly Clarkson win American Idol.  This album has songs that have been my favorites over the years as I bought Kelly's albums. Unfortunately  my albums either were broken in moves or are no longer usable with my players.  I received a Kindle Fire HD7 for Christmas and I was thrilled to be able to get this album.
B0052FYPJK|5.0|Ordered for the holidays<br />quick delivery excellent condition<br />very happy with service will probabaly order this company from again<br />thanks!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is fun lots of interaction. Challenging yet not so much that the game is too hard to play. Controls are easy to use.
B003O86FMW|1.0|It felt like I was reading the first book all over again. I lost interest. I didn't like the way the story played out.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A tragic life story. A beautiful love story.An amazing story of life, humor, resilience, love and wisdom in a very young couple.  I fell in love with both of them and the supporting cast. Wonderful story telling.  Totally engrossing.
B002ZBT84G|1.0|When Me and The Devil came up on my Pandora playlist, I immediately purchased the album it was attached too. Unfortunately, I paid $10 for an album with only two songs. The other song is New York is Killing Me, which I didn't care for, and the rest are mostly monologues. I know Amazon can't scrutinize everything that goes up for sale, so hopefully this review saves some of you from making the same mistake I did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! I loved it. Very fun read that makes a real statement about society and our relationship with the media.
0525457585|5.0|THis book was nice and big and in perfect condition! I wasnt expecting it to be that nice! thanks so much
B00498XRPE|3.0|The movie is still a classic, but dated. I was wondering the whole movie why they didn't turn some damn lights on since they were hunting for a crazy homicidal alien. Oh also, the audio was slightly out of sync like most Amazon videos I stream from my ps3 to my TV.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I never buy apps I got this one for my son and it shuts downs as soon as he opens it
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was really good I rated it 4 stars I loved everything about. Would recommend every kid and or teen read this book.  :-D
1882723007|5.0|I have read most of Betty's books so purchased this particular one for a friend who is fascinated with stories of folks who have returned from near death, or death.
B002P73UQW|5.0|The cast works exceedingly well with each other and their stories do not get stale or endlessly repeat.  You will enjoy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I rely on Evermore for SO many things. It's never let me down. I love this app. It comes with security, ease &amp; satisfaction :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it was the best game ever I loved it I think it was so awesome coolest game ever I loved how it also helped you get points for playing it on different games too it's just the best game ever I just loved it
B000000993|5.0|One of Tool's best albums and solid throughout. This was the album that got me hooked on Tool with the hit song Sober.
1574214276|5.0|I was looking for more great ideas from Suzanne and found them here.  Excellent source of inspiration, ideas and creative spark
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a hard-hitting look at deception, trust, shame and despair. It provokes strong feelings of hope in, and distaste for, that which makes us human- our violent nature and our endless striving to overcome it.
1574216988|5.0|Provides tons of great ideas, some history, and inspiration for creating my own new tangles.  This book will stay handy at my drawing station in the studio.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book! Makes you look at the world in a different way and wonder what's real and what your mind is making real. Definitely read this it was absolutely worth it!
B000O599WG|5.0|great print and extras discgreat print and extras discgreat print and extras discgreat print and extras discgreat print and extras disc.great print and extras disc
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great throwback CD. All the old sounds of Christmas sang the way they should be. A classic to have on your collection.
1780540655|5.0|I bought this calendar for the striking photographs of Michael Jackson and was not disappointed!.  This format is not well suited for use as an appointment calendar, but that is not how I am going to use it. I use another(non MJ) calendar for any notations.  This one is to just enjoy the photos and I may keep it up past the end of the year!
B009VB97EY|5.0|Best feel good movie ever. A movie every girl will love! About time girls get a male stripper movie. Yeah!
0525953590|5.0|I have not tried to read this, figuring I would not be able to understand it, but it is for my husband who is reading everything he can find on these subjects. He loves it!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|it worked for what i needed. I like the product it was the same as the one I needed to replaace
B0018S6YO4|2.0|Rihanna has a few really good songs on here but most of them...I wasn't that crazy for...Shut up and drive is always fun.
0439023521|5.0|My wife was the one who read these, she loved them, few book series cause her to stay up reading all night, this was one, Game of Thrones being the other. I kind of want to read this now that I've seen the movie.
B002LII6B4|3.0|I love this movie and have seen it several times.  I was very disappointed to find out a lot of parts were cut out of this DVD.  If I could I would return it.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I really enjoyed this. It took me awhlie to get my wife to get me to watch it, She read the books, but the last time she did this to me, I was stuck complaining through Twilight. But this was a great movie. I really enjoyed it. Very well done, and I actually can't wait for the next one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is fun, fun, fun. Story line keeps you wondering what's next. Very exciting and beautiful graphics. I would recommend this game if you love a mystery and some hidden objects, this is the game for you!!
