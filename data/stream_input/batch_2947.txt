B00BWBHIUG|1.0|This game is very disappointing. I have spent hours on this game trying to build up my level so I can go on quests with my granddaughters and I have spent my money buying pearls and now the game is frozen and it cheated us out of awards. It takes away things you have grown, it's supposed to refund your pearls (cash) if it \\"goes away\\" but does not.  This last quest I planted almost two dozen different types of rare plants and just before it decided to freeze again it said I only grew 7 out of 8.  How convenient.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|than being able to watch the episodes, one right after the other, and free through amazon prime...i'm loving it! Excellent.

B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I read the book as part of a community reading project and was not able to attend the screening so I watched it at home.  Somehow I missed it when it originally came out.  I had forgotten how fabulous the actors in this movie were in 1974, especially Robert Redford!  I am considering purchasing my own DVD because I would like to enjoy it a few more times!
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I expected more from Brad Pitt. I wasted my money. The movie went from bad to worse. My one star rating goes to the visual effects team -- that was good good.

0143121316|5.0|Great introduction to the mind set and internal workings of modern China. Gave me a whole new perspective on interplay between the history/culture/politics of China and how we in the West are not best served by short term thinking. Dr. Kissinger is uniquely qualified to provide us with the inside story.<br /><br />Excellent read...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is such a great game because it makes you think. It can be a little bit of a challenge (I have used hints to help) but it's definitely worth a download.
B000003C5C|4.0|Lets face facts. Death's early career was primitive and raw early death metal. Not as raw as other bands from the 80s as production on this album and \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\" are decent (especially for a debut and sophomore effort). The lyrics range from topics of death (imagine that haha), sickness, violence. But what sets this album apart from its older brother is the intensity of the drumming, more intricate guitar work, and a better drum effort.<br /><br />Leprosy is a great album by this legendary band. In fact, to some, this is the best the band ever did. Personally, I say check Spiritual Healing and Human. But I do find myself giving Leprosy a spin in my truck as I go to work as a form of audible coffee. If you like death metal, or are a fan of brutal thrash, Leprosy is calling your name.

B001IZGKCS|2.0|I might not be the audience this show is aimed at, but I'm writing this review because it seemed from the premise that I would be.<br /><br />I enjoy sci-fi and complex plot lines. However, this show has more in line with horror than anything else. The episodes I watched (1st, 2nd, and 6th, I skipped after reading reviews that it got better later in), were full of screaming, gore, cruel experiments, and other horror-movie staples. Sometimes I enjoy an intense plot, but this show threw in the axe murderers way before I had a chance to actual care about the characters. Even after 3 episodes, or 3 hours of screen time, they were still such poorly-written, flat stereotypes that I gave up. We've got the Too Serious Girl with Daddy Issues, Funny Guy who Actually Cares, and Nutty Professor with a Dark Past. Don't get me wrong, these can be done well, but there was no effort put into these, they played their roles too narrowly, making them more like paper dolls than beloved characters. The show coves up their poor character-development with blood and hints of a complex Lost-style plot (except Lost spent the first season making us fall in love with every character.)<br /><br />If you want to watch the three characters above in well-done sci-fi environment without the gore, I'd watch Warehouse 13.
B000IDEORY|4.0|Still a good purchase but don't be fooled there is no digital copy just a limited one time rental for Amazon Video On Demand.

B00E8JZILA|5.0|First time player and I would have to say this is a great deal for this game because it's a great game. I also read a couple of reviews before purchasing and they were all good.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I used to have the free app, and was happy to see this one on faod. the game itself is simple to play, focusing on great ui rather than fancy graphics. Level of play ranges from easy to medium, if you are professional backgammon player it will probably be too easy for you. It is, however, a good range for most.<br />In terms of permissions, this is another great app by ai factory, which means no spyware and no intrusive permissions. I have purchased several of their apps before and this is no bait and switch, their apps stay permission free

B00127RAJY|5.0|Ill get down to the important stuff first. Just starting to say i had my second baby 10months ago and i needed some sort of weight loss boost!<br />I didnt weigh myself, because i feel like when i do, i just tend to concentrate on a number.so i dont exactly know how much i lost. I did measure myself though and i lost:<br /> 5inches around my hips<br /> 2inches from my waist<br /> just over 1inch around my arms.<br />1inch around my thighs (although they look a lot smaller so im wondering if i measured wrong initially) , i also lost around my calves and upper body but i did not measure these.<br /><br />I've done jillian michaels work outs before, but ive never been able to stick to them, because ive felt so spent afterwards (not the good endorphin rush if that makes sense). So i was intrigued by the 30day aspect, and the- fact that it was a 20min workout -30 if you count warm up and cool down.<br />I found Level 1 was already on youtube for free. So i decided to give it a go.<br /><br />My goal was to do the 30 days without a rest day. For extra motivation throughout the process, i kept looking for positive reviews online and on youtube (they really did help!).<br />During the shred, i did end up catching a cold and get the usual aches and pains, but some days i did just push through and do the work out anyway. I think i stuck the rule of if you're ill from the neck up, its fine, but neck down, take a rest. In all i had about 6 rest days (not all at once, but here and tehre).<br /><br />I have to say, i really enjoyed the whole process. It spurred me on when i started seeing the results! I would say I could see a visual difference on the third day, but started seeing a measurement difference on about day 9 i think, although it could've been sooner.<br /><br />Eating wise, i did eat healthy, but i didnt deprive myself. So if i was in the mood for something sweet, id have a hot chocolate, or sometimes when i was in the mood id have a pastry! If i was out and my family were having fast food, id just have a medium fries instead of a whole meal, or i just would give it a miss!<br />I did swaps too, so for me, instead of eating chocolate i found that medjool dates hit that sweet craving for me.(my major weakness and a personal choice to cut it out completely. Ive never found eating chocolate to make me gain weight. But I found that if i didnt eat it, i would get a headache, so i wanted that gone.)<br />I still do swaps and im trying to make lifestyle changes, so i dont do \\"cheat days\\". I have a little bit of what i want when i want. But i dont exaggerate! This seems to be working for me, so im pleased!<br />There is an eating plan to go with this, but i didnt find out about it till the last level of the shred, so i juts did my own eating plan. The eating plan is free online. I think it says ripped in 30, but it still applies to the 30day shred. It looks like a good eating plan too.<br /><br />I loved the first level, i found jillian to be supportive and encouraging, but in the second and thrid, i found her to be really irritating and cocky! lol. BUt that is just me. I saw a lot of reviewers say that the thrid level is killer, i actually found it to be more enjoyable than the second. I did not like level 2, but i think that is because im not keen on upper body moves.<br /><br />I've decided im going to start over doing the shred again, because i enjoyed the process so much! I'm very pleased with the results.<br /><br />I will add that around day 10 my knees did start to hurt, so instead of stopping, i just adjusted certain parts of the workout to accommodate, and then my the end of the second level, the pain had gone away. My thinking was that the joints are hurting because of lack of work out (for me anyway), so tehy're getting used to movement. I'm glad i persevered. I just tried to listen to my body and not push or punish my body.<br />I always followed the beginner workouts and sometimes i would try and do the advanced.<br /><br/>Now ive started doing a work out that is a bit different. It's called Ballet Beautiful, wich aims to give you longer, lean , toned look...which is what im aiming for. I'm doing the ballet beautiful 5days a week and doing the 30shred every other day.<br />I'm so glad i did the 30day shred, it's kick started my weight loss and even though i still have a way to go, im so pleased with the results it gives for just 20mins a day.<br />If you ever find yourself not wanting to do it, just tell yourself 20MINS A DAY! The only work outs you regret doing are the ones you dont do! Give yourself reasons to just do it, instead of excuses as to not!<br /><br />Level 1 i did on youtube for free and bought the other two levels on amazon! :)/>Now ive started doing a work out that is a bit different.

B007WULJ5G|3.0|After hearing so much about this movie and how horribly repulsive it is, I expected it to be some low budget underground piece of crap.  I was impressed at the quality and the fact that it is actually a legitimate movie.  And yes it is pretty twisted, but again not as bad as I was expecting.  The set up was nice.  During the middle of the movie it got a little slow and a little boring, but then it picked up towards the end.  It's the opposite of a feel-good story; I guess you can call it feel-bad!  Many people are saying it's not a horror movie, but I'd disagree.  I would say that's exactly what it is.  And it's much more of a legitimate movie than [[ASIN:B0082A3HFK The Bunny Game]] for example which is no more than seeing someone tortured.  A Serbian Film is dark, depraved and showcases the lesser side of humanity.  Worth a watch if youre willing to delve into this unpleasant world.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Been playing this awhile without having to pay extra. Its a decent game but it does get a little frustrating that you constantly have to wait for your energy to be restored.
030758836X|3.0|Reading GONE GIRL by Gillian Flynn was a bit like trying to eat an entire Hickory Farms summer sausage by yourself  You know the one; unidentified chunks of greasy meat and fat encased in a slimy skin that leave a lardy coating and garlicky tang in your mouth.  As you prepare to cut into it, you almost want to blow grits.  But then a small piece, followed by another, and then another and before you know it the obnoxious tube is gone, and it didn't taste half bad.  So it was for me with this sausage of a book.<br /><br />I didn't particularly like it but it grew on me the more I read.  Trying to make sense of my ambiguity has posed a real problem as I try to critique it.  The writing is good.  In fact, it's very good.  I didn't have trouble following the story.  The dialogue is crisp and vivid.  The characters are well developed and, for the most part, I understand the storyline.  But here's the problem.  The premise is so far out there that I don't believe a word of it.  The main characters, Nick and Amy Dunne, are such dimwits with so much self-absorption that they wouldn't be able to mentally function in any world that I know of.<br /><br />The story revolves around Nick and Amy's hatred so much that neither would be capable of performing the acts attributed to them by the author.  The acts themselves are so convoluted and malicious that a reasonable person would scoff at their very premise.  A pair of panties here, a bloody puppet leg there, a purse in the street, playthings with a sleeping man's fingerprints planted on them, a false pregnancy test with another woman's urine, a partially burned diary, and on and on.  No one, especially a psychopath, would ever be able to assemble all the elements Flynn has stuffed into her book into a believable chain of events..<br /><br />The early part of the book was especially difficult to digest; something like the first slices of the sausage.  Amy's diary entries were particularly troubling.  Who writes a diary like that?Page after page of literary musing and specific detail that covers many years is not credible.  Short scribbled entries with large time gaps are more normal.  Of course, as the story progresses, the need for such a detailed diary is revealed.<br /><br />I must confess that my curiosity as to how it all ends, how the vitriol is expunged, who will emerge victorious, who will become scum, and how all the shenanigans will be played out kept me in the book until the end (an ending that was as preposterous as the rest of the story).<br /><br />I recommend this book to those with tolerance for graphic language, the urge to punish someone, admiration for characters with mean spirits, and those who like sausage.<br /><br />Schuyler T Wallace<br />Author of TIN LIZARD TALES

YES the Cd Version Is A Manufactured On Demand. BUT it Does Look Like An Actual Madonna Cd. NOT SOME TYPED STICKER. IT is cool To Hear The Audience Screaming...And Hearing Madonna Sing. SHE's not The Best..But She is The Most Entertaining Pop Act Out There. And as She Said It. 30 Years Is A Long Time To Have A Job. AND I sEE The Queen Of Pop Seeing Her 40th Anniversary In Music In 2022. SHE IS SIMPLY THE MOST INFLUENTIAL aRTISTOF OUR GENERATION AND TODAY's Music Artists From Britney Spears To Miley Cyrus All Cite Madonna As A Main Influence.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I see a lot of people complain about JJ Abrams but I thought this movie was well done. The special effects were good, the acting was good (Benedict Cumberbatch does a fantastic job as the villain - frankly I think he stole the show). Watching it in 3D makes it that much better but I really enjoyed everything about this movie- the plot was well done, the casting was well done, the sets and the special effects were great. If you like Star Trek, you'll love this movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|From the moment you begin reading, you are drawn into a vividly painted world. The colors are dark, but very expressive. Suzanne Collins has gone above and beyond with this book, and she has accurately portrayed the horror of a hopeless situation. She has even demonstrated a detailed understanding of what it's like to give up on one's life. This book is not for those who cry easily, as the tears will flow freely as is. It is a masterpiece.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I'm not a Brad Pitt fan or a Zombie aficionado but the previews for this movie made me want to watch it anyway and it didn't disappoint. It provides a plausible reason for how the Zombie outbreak occurred and how to stop it. It was intensely violent and gory but more in a video game sort of way, not in a horror movie sort of way. The 3D added an element of immersion to it, there were a few scenes where the Zombies jumped out and the 3D made it more shocking. I enjoyed that.
B004I744AS|5.0|So far I have had this app for 5 minutes, and it has already allowed me to fly through my work. It is a dictionary, thesaurus, and translator all in one! Truly a fantastic application.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|With the mixed reviews on Amazon, I took a chance and watched this film. First of all, this is not a family film, and this is not a movie that should be watched around individuals who are prone to idiotic adaptations of films into real life situations. Although this is true, this movie was good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The relationship between the two main characters was admirable. I enjoyed the fact that the male and female characters were not coupled. In most movies, you expect a sex scene or a kiss, and I am glad that this was not enforced.<br />The characters are gritty, and tough both male and female.<br /><br />Great action<br /><br />Nothing was overly emotionalized.<br /><br />The visual aspects were fairly well made and managed.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The sound ranged from high to low really fast, and I found myself adjusting it to hear more in certain parts, and hear less in others.<br /><br />The scenes were pretty intense, and no gore was left to the imagination. (could also be a pro)
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Easy to use but it has the more scientific operators on the right side of the screen. Best of all, it's free.

B001DHXT6G|1.0|I am VERY disappointed that the studio couldn't resist tinkering with the original shows.  They are so proud of their &#34;enhancements&#34; which do nothing but crap up the original production.  Garish &#34;color enhancements&#34;, horrible &#34;updated special effects&#34; with laughably cartoonish computer-generated Enterprise for exteriors, replacement of original view screen images with, again, cartoonish garbage digital effects, certain scenes where they kept the narration of Captain Kirk's log but replaced the video completely with, again, cartoonish garbage, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  What were they thinking?  They even replaced close-up shots of Sulu's console with a computer-generated digital chronometer because they apparently weren't happy with the original film of a chronometer that used rotating drums with the digits on them like some old alarm clocks used in the 60's and 70's.  Yes, I was there when the show aired on NBC originally.  And I have seen the originals many times in syndicated reruns.  And yes, I can spot every crappy &#34;enhancement&#34; they did.  They even redid the theme music.  Although they at least tried to recreate the original orchestration, it still isn't quite the same, but I guess they just had to have a surround sound track instead of the original monaural recording.  Why, oh why, couldn't they just clean up the film and leave things alone!?!?!?  This is horrible.  I feel like burning the DVD's and mourning the death of the original series of Star Trek.  How about a set of DVD's that are JUST THE ORIGINAL?  That's all we ever wanted.

0544002318|4.0|Just finished reading \\"Eat and Run\\" by Scott Jurek. It is an interesting autobiography with a nice sampling of running advice and vegan recipes mixed in. I don't plan on becoming a plant powered runner but the Kalamata Hummus Trail Wraps and Smoky Chipotle Refried Beans both sound like something I could add to my regular lunch rotation.<br /><br />I have seen several friends crash and burn or succede and suffer at the 100 mile distance so it is not something I am planning to try but as someone who likes running trails it is still fascinating to read about his preparations for races like Hardrock 100 and Western States. I still need to work on my nose breathing, I tried it today and I felt like I was hyperventilating. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about athletes, their desires, drives, and how they train.
0345525558|5.0|Interesting look into the foster care program and how children are affected.  It's hard to hate Victoria for the cruelty she bestows upon others...the author does a great job distinguishing between the child's character and her behavior.  We are rooting for her to grow into a mature woman.  And what a great introduction into &#34;floralspeak.&#34;  Through Victoria, the author taught us to think about selecting flowers more carefully.

The author weaves a historic accounting of the development of nuclear weapons around the Damascus \\"incident\\" at an Arkansas Titan missile silo.<br />The storyline describes the attitudes and fears of the populace, the greed of the military industrial complex, the hubris of politicians, and ambition and paranoia of the military.<br />What we end up with is a cold shock of awareness that the movie \\"Failsafe\\" was largely propaganda and that a more accurate portrayal of our nuclear deterrent could be found in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\".<br />I cannot recommend this book too highly!!<br />[[ASIN:1594202273 Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety]]

1401230423|4.0|Under the weight of the decisions of who hell belongs to after a series of events places it in the hands of our Morpheus, we are transported once again into Gaiman's unparalleled world of dreams and magnificent prose.<br /><br />This volume maximized a world in space, lines, and a variety of striking imagery to build the worlds of heaven and hell, and to give a face to some incredibly important mythological creatures.  In terms of the scope and postmodern angles that the previous volumes explored with such imaginative and cutting edge technique, this one was approached a great deal more subtly and relied more on the storytelling and the realism of the artwork.<br /><br />To me, the writing is what made this collection and the series as a whole an instant classic. While this particular volume did not meet the explosive awe that I had in the other volumes in terms of the artistic approaches that I have never seen before in my life, Gaiman remained the magician of the mind in these pieces.  He is simply one of the few artists in this world who can use the English word in such a way that he can build a universe up, and as irrational and ridiculous that the peoples and the laws of this universe are, manages to make it believable and make his audience care about even the most absurd environments.  In this vein, in volume 4 of the Sandman collection, he remains a master and takes you on a thrilling journey into hell and back... and you aren't sure you want to return.

In my opinion jimi stands alone as the Everest of electric guitarists.  There are many greats. I have a special affinity for garcia, and rory gallagher.<br />However, jimi is hands down the most innovative player to come down the pipe.  As for too many hear my trains.... Get real. The song burns. Anyway this is a great album. Buy it.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|A brilliant ensemble of flashy glitz and glamour of the roaring 20's just before the Great Depression coupled with modern R & B make this a smooth and tantalizing twist. You can almost feel the angst and energy the cast put into this masterpiece.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|I wanted it to be hands free when reading and the fact that this cover lets me fold into a triangle shape was my reason for this purchase.  It has kept my Kindle Fire protected as promised. It folds easily and holds its shape.<br />My only complaint is that when reading the Kindle in the upright position the bulk to get hands around is uncomfortable at best.<br />Except for this one problem I recommend this product to anyone looking for good protection.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game.  Only reason for four stars is I wish there was hints.  I love strategy games.  Every item in the room is a clue.
B007V9YF5E|5.0|Actually it ended up being a really good movie. The acting was very good and the fighting sequences were excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoyed this app a lot i can play it for hours and hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love fezzez and make sure that you are invited to a cook and make sure that you are invited to a cook for the princesses and easily accessible to the dog and make it
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show. I should have been watching it since it first aired. Will be keeping up with it now.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think this is the best game from Back flip Studios! And I do not see any flaws except the habitats take to long to build:(
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have had this watch for 17 days so far and I am very, very happy with my purchase to date. I sync'd it up with my radio clock that updates daily. In seventeen days I have picked up about 15 seconds. No I am not complaining, to tell the truth I am pretty impressed.<br /><br />About the only time I take it off is when I shower.<br /><br />Some may complain about the band and the fact that it is not smooth and hurts their girly wrists. I thought about replacing it with a nice stainless band but thought otherwise. I do HVAC and refrigeration work and this watch is a work watch so I didn't feel the need to dress it up.<br /><br />The watch has a nice glo to it that is viable throughout the night. It will be very faint around 4 or five in morning but you can still make out the time.<br /><br />If something dramatic happens that changes my mind about this product I will update.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great &#34;build your city&#34; game. You control islands and raise dragons. Breed them together to get different breeds and enter them in contests to win money experience and gems. Play the mini game race to win food, gems, or money. Great game.
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My son is 8 months old and we bought him the Ballcano a few weeks ago when he was just starting to pull to stand. He plays with this toy every day--he loves pulling up on it, picking up each ball and tossing it. He also likes spinning the two small movable pieces.<br /><br />I took one star off because sometimes the toy will start to tip when he pulls up--I'm always with him anyway, so it's not a big deal to keep a hand on it, but it would be nice if it were a bit more stable.<br /><br />We're not into beeping/flashing toys, so we never put batteries in. It's still lots of fun for him without them.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Promises promises... But still only Netflix as a real content provider. YouTube is for kids. Very disappointing overall. I already had my Mac hooked up by Ethernet but as an early adapter I thought more was coming. Apparently not.
0316056863|5.0|I love Tina's sense of humor and everything she has ever done. When I found out about her book, Bossypants, I knew I had to get it right away. I read the book in a day and laughed the whole way through. I just love this woman!
1608955702|4.0|Enjoyed learning from this book.  Given a choice of only one, get his on camera flash book.  Of course, getting both is better.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.  My wife and I are both addicted to The Walking Dead, can't wait until Season 4 is released.  This is one of the best series (along with Game of Thrones) on television today.  You can keep your BS reality TV, your silly sitcoms, your cop/detective shows and your !@$?!# singing contests, we'll take The Walking Dead thankyouverymuch.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The great sets, costumes, and great acting continue from the first season to the second.  Although, we know the plot from history, watching it unfold before us in this lavish production kept us glued to the screen for all of the 10 episodes.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better. My wife and I are both addicted to The Walking Dead, can't wait until Season 4 is released.

B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I like this game very much. The scenes are great and the story line is interesting. not  too hard but not to<br />easy.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This movie is my favorite of Jim Carrey's. Carrey is a funny actor, but in many of his comedy roles he is required to &#34;over act&#34;. This movie showcases his talent by putting him in a very serious role. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even someone who doesn't typically like Jim Carrey. It is a side of him that is very rarely seen.<br /><br />The case for this DVD was the flimsy cardboard kind, but the DVD was fine and it will do.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie because I am a trekkie from way back. You almost have to be to understand what is going on. I watched with my girlfriend, who is not a trekkie and I was answering questions all the way. As an after-thought watch with another trekkie.<br />It was predictable in some spots, but it had enough twists to make you go hmm. I thought Kirk and Scott's characters were a little over the top, but I guess they mellowed out by the time period of the series:)<br />All in all it was entertaining, but longgg. It is a 2 hour plus movie.
B007WDPPK8|3.0|I've heard great things about this book. I impulsively purchased it for my ipad. It just seems so lack luster. Usually, there is so much thought that goes into how a book is set up. All the great elements here have been removed.  Maybe I'll buy a &#34;real&#34; version someday.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Old Man's War is NOT Starship Trooper. It actually is the opposite. This is not a come to age story but the end of life with a second chance on life.
B009GED3HS|5.0|So exciting! I can't wait for the next season now that we know who &#34;mom&#34; is. Every episode had its fun quirks. The only downside is I think robin kind of became a side character for most episodes this season, which is unfortunate because she's great.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|This is not his best book but still great entertainment. We are given more insight into Jack Reacher's family, namely his brother. You can't help but love him!
0385751532|1.0|An adult should not read this book because this is a really boring book, and if it wasn't require for my reading class I would never finish this. A boring and predictable story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I went searching for games because I just received a Kindle Fire HD. Lovely first game to enjoy on here. The game sucks you in and gets you involved. I love the puzzle story telling of the game.
0071771263|5.0|I bought this book to get ready for TOEFL exam, and this book really helped me. The tests are very similar to those we can see in TOEFL, specially for speaking and writing part, and it is unique because other books are far away from the actual questions we can see in TOEFL.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|The only way I can account for the popularity of GoT is by assuming that HBO hired some bloggers to build up a fake hype. There is no other way this tedious show with a murky plot to boot with far too many characters to keep up with could ever be so popular. Sure, it has its moments but most of the time I can't wait for the wooden dialogue to be over. In the end it's just yet another show about some douchebags aspiring to the throne as if this is something desirable when you consider that sooner or later you will be offed by another douchebag. This plot premise has been done millions of times before. Not feeling GoT.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is one of the most well written and best acted shows on television!!  Sutter is one smart guy.  Love, love, love it!!!
B0081KZ20E|5.0|This was the first book that totally caught up my imagination. It left me willing to read anything written by Mr Forsyth. Have not regretted it once.....
0743496736|5.0|The books came on time.  I ordered them for a teacher to use in her class room.  They worked for her
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you are in need of a page turner you can't put down, this is it.  I plan to read all of Gillian Flynn's books.
B0035HKWLW|3.0|It is a really silly movie, for sure!  If you don't like impossibly silly movies then you won't like it.  I would have given more stars if I wasn't turned off by the sensuality.  The dog was the best part of the movie, very cute!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this to all horse lover's and a way to train yourself to see what you'll be doing in a stable
B004JY0KP8|3.0|my only squawk is that it has minimal illumination at night...it looks good...is accurate and stop watch function is great
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|Delivery & packaging were good - the video itself... just isn't the classic, but is an interesting movie... My husband wasn't too impressed, but I enjoyed it!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|One of the best games i've ever played. Great for passing the time and makes you think a little bit too.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Reminds me of playing Diablo 2 as a kid would recommend playing if you are a big fan of dungeon crawlers
1423140605|5.0|I have been reading the books since the release and Rick Riordan has never disappointed me each book makes me want the next book more I loved the Percy Jackson series, but this one tops that series that constant change of characters each one one very well developed and you can relate to each one without a problem this book just took it to the next level I cannot wait for the House of Hades
B00ALGW286|5.0|I've had an interest lately in reading books with historical elements involved, so I when I saw this book as a `customers also bought' on the amazon page of a book I had just finished, I thought I would take a look. I am happy to say that the five star reviews this book has already accumulated are thoroughly deserved, and have decided to award it another from myself.<br />Set in Moscow, we follow Marina, a young and determined girl who knows what she wants and is on her way to making her dreams become a reality.  There would be hard work involved, but she was committed to following her dreams. Then things change.<br />Tanks roll through the city and crowds of people protest, marking the end of an era, and suddenly Marina's world has changed. She needs to adapt, and this is what makes this brilliantly descriptive narrative the coming-of-age story that it becomes.<br />This book isn't just about the politics and social change of Moscow at that particular time; it focuses on the perspective of these changes of Marina, a strong and likeable character who I never tired of following. This is a highly recommended read.
B00APAENUI|5.0|Honor Harrington is a person thrust into a political arena she never chose. Even though she was completely blameless, she was charged with an atrocity that parallels the vicious attack on the world trade center on 9/11. Religious fanatics who terrorize in God's name and commit murder as the hand of God might learn something from this book written in 1994. Again, I was so mesmerized by this,I  am buying the next book.
B00CD4RPWM|4.0|I think there is nothing like being able to imagine characters you read about in books.  Exile was a fun respite from the long novels.  The depiction of the characters for Jamie and Claire were not what I had imagined so I kept my images when I read it.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|best movie for its time....although it was too short, to provide enough details. It could have gone on longer....great pastime.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|My son said that I would LOVE this movie; he was right.  And I don't do Zombies.  This movie was very believable.  It could happen to all of us.  So, get the popcorn ready and prepare to sit on the edge of your seat a Brad Pitt helps our top leaders figure out this huge deadly puzzle.  Great Story line.
B000V8MQZI|5.0|If you love the cd, you will love it even more on vinyl! What a great album by the foo fighters. Great price on amazon as well!
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I Am Pilgrim is a well written thriller which keeps you turning the pages until the very end. The story is set within real events to give it credibility and make it believable and terrifyingly real. This is one of the best thrillers I have read.
B000WAEK0E|4.0|It's all here for the Van Morrison fans, new and old. People of many backgrounds and cultures can appreciate these great songs.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Item got to me super fast, in perfect condition in brand new package, its always nice to get the product as its described.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I found the book to be simply written and direct, without trendy and overblown spiritualism.  I think the book will resonate with students of the original teachings of the Buddha; not the religion that carries the name, but the core teachings themselves with the intuitions and understandings they lead to.  One may quibble about some of the terms and descriptions Anita uses here and there, especially if they don't  match some worldview and belief system one holds dear.  However, she is describing something that has no words and does not fit into our usual conceptual mold, so I think the words she uses are not so important- what they point to is, and I think she does a wonderful job in that regard.  This book ought to have a ring of familiarity to those students of the true core of any spiritual system.  Highly recommended.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun game<br />great entertainment. Can play for hours. Be the General and build your forces and base. Build ally s and wage war.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|To be honest, I didn't really like this book. Thor is one of those naive, self-centred brats who thinks that the whole world is against him and that he has the worst life on earth. All of the characters seem to be distributed on both ends of the extremity - they are either absolutely pure and righteous or downright evil. At times, I felt like the author didn't even bother to make the story believable. Then again, this book has its moments.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|great graphics and gameplay. the variety of the characters makes the game all the more appealing. HD version also makes a huge difference.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I love this it's totally worth 99&cent; I love It I share my pics I make on my Twitter and fb it just amazing
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app and all the cool stuff I've discovered on Pinterest. So many new ideas. Decorating fashion tattoos weddings and family fun..
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I think this book was amazing i recommend this book to everyone. Rebbeca Stead wrote many books and this one is my favorite.
B008469DGY|4.0|Make it so that courses can be played -not just shooting at a pin for accuracy.  But, in that respect it is like the other &quot;Flick&quot; games so it is as advertised.<br />The only complaint is that the difficulty increases too rapidly.
B00AEFXTKO|5.0|The acting is superb.  The soundtrack is one that I will cherish for the rest of my life.  It also depicts real life experiences.  The clothes and choreography where fantastic.  I love every moment of this movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys drama and musicals.
B0015F1VY8|1.0|I just looked at the star rating for this film on a whim, and was shocked... shocked, I tell you... to see it rated at four stars overall. The original Elizabeth deserved at least five stars. This extremely lame sequel does not even deserve one star.
B002UJIY70|5.0|I would suggest watching this movie with out reading up on what its about.  Go in blind and your in for a nice thrill ride...
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I liked it. It keep me occupied to the point of not wanting to put it down. Could have finished it in a day though. Kept me entertained. I hope there is a sequel.
B00B8XC2O0|5.0|great collection of a Truly Great Artist. Nice to re-visit an old friend & hear some things I'd never heard before.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I wasn't expecting this to be a great hit . I really loved the product and easy to set it up and sound quality is amazing
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed this novel. The perspective was interesting and never completely clear until the end. Would have liked more insight on some of the other major characters thoughts etc... but I guess the reader only had what the narrator knew.  Thought provoking subject.
B0026WNGBA|3.0|Didnt connect with this book even though i am very interested to improve my running pose. will give it another try later on
B00CL151G4|5.0|Can't for the life of me not understand how Jonny Lee Miller was not even nominated for an Emmy. He is superb in the role and the supporting cast is first class.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I'm watching this to catch up with the current and I watched this season in a weekend!  Not much sleep but worth it.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Very inspirational.  This movie is not too graffic during the actual shark attack which was my greatest fear when we watched it.  It is so much less about the shark attack but more about triumph and never giving up.  A life lesson we all need to be reminded of once in awhile.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I started to watch to see if I like Charlie Hunnam as Christian Grey.  Oh yeah i so can't wait.
1476734941|5.0|This is an easy and interesting read. I'm not sure I believe all the scientific information but the diet works if you can do it.<br />I was able to follow it for 8 weeks and lost 7 pounds. Fasting is difficult but rewarding. There is the mental reward of being able to fast along with an indescribable pleasant sensation.  It does help you realize you can work through hunger.  My advise is follow the diet carefully - 500 cal/day twice a week. You need to get into the fasting state for it to be effective.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I chose this book because of the reviews. I found myself putting it down and picking it up again when I had nothing better to do. Somewhat boring with characters I wanted to strangle on occasion for being so dumb and/or self-absorbed. The worst part was that I figured out the secret before it was revealed. Give it a pass.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|Reading this aloud one chapter at a time with my eleven year old. (Yes! We still try to do this when we can and enjoy it greatly!) Would not recommend for anyone younger. Might even wait for most to turn 13. It is well written and interesting. Yet, not in an uplifting sort of way.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first time I read this series I, like most only saw the sex of the book.  However, after the second time reading it I started seeing the love story.  Now being my 3rd time reading it I am totally in love with the fifty shades of f****ed up as much as I am in love with the love story between christian and ana....totally worth reading more than once, you will find things that you totally didn't get the first go round!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|You know all of those cliched film reviews that claim a film is &#34;a triumph of the human spirit&#34;? This one actually fits that overused line. Sugarman will have you rooting for the underdog. It will make you feel good about humanity and its inter-connectedness. And best of all, it will introduce you to the music of a man who should have been treated to tremendous stardom in his time, but was essentially forgotten. This film rights that wrong by bringing a very worthy artist into the spotlight at last. Buy this film, you won't regret it.
8866135909|5.0|I constantly use google calendar and yet it doesn't quite have the features I need.  With a planner like this you get the high quality of Moleskine products and the utility of both a notebook and schedule.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not really into sexual romance books, but this series really caught my attention. I can't wait for it to become a movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow - I loved the structure of this book. I'm sure all the readers have a feeling that the diary entries aren't exactly accurate. But the extent of it is amazing.<br /><br />Is this a page-turner? Absolutely.<br />Does it have interesting characters? You Betcha<br />Does it have unlikeable characters that feel real? Oh yea<br /><br />My one gripe with the book and it isn't really a grip just me being me. Lie Detector test. Yes, sometimes these aren't admissible. But they are a tool law enforcement uses and the lack of it in the book seemed strange.<br /><br />I enjoyed this author so much I've already started reading another of her books.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is wonderful and should be read by all. However it's short length (it seems so) and unsure ending are absolutely maddening!
B009CV5GX4|1.0|Now, I haven't read any other book by Malcolm Gladwell, but I've heard good things about him.<br /><br />I had to buy this book for my college-level English class and it was a bit interesting at first, but got a bit repetitive after the introduction. And it only got more and more repetitive as I went on. Reading this book became a complete chore for me.<br /><br />The concepts that Gladwell mentioned were not enlightening to me at all, either. I think anyone with common sense would feel the same.<br /><br />My boyfriend and I talked about it for a while, and we both agree that it almost seems like this book was written just so Gladwell could make more money.
0486266885|5.0|Unlike the story inside, the purchase of this book holds no evil! It is very inexpensive and a good read.  It's perfect for college students looking to avoid the costly bookstore, or anyone looking for an exciting, quick novel.
B008GWP2GG|5.0|This is one of the best movie I have seen about aliens. What really got my attention is the fact that this is a true story. One word of caution,It gets pretty scary.My wife had to leave the room at times.Compare to the movie, the fourth kind, I like fire in the sky better,Because sound was great I did not have to be messing with the volume.Great movie that is why I gave it five stars.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This second novel about Ender Wiggin is definitely worth your time. It has drama, adventure, sorrow and joy all wrapped up in an epic story you won't want to put down!
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|It's rare in pop music that you find an album that flows, and works almost as a concept album in which nearly every single song is catchy with a great hook. That's the case with Natalia Kills' sophomore effort, \\"Trouble.\\"<br /><br />For those who remember, she is the singer who had a hit back in 2011 called \\"Mirrors,\\" a song which people confused her sound with that of Lady Gaga. On this album, she has developed a sound that is more of her own, and the best part is, SHE wrote or co-wrote the songs. Natalia Kills is a powerhouse vocalist, too, who showcases her inner Cyndi Lauper on \\"Outta Time,\\" and the smoldering \\"Devils Don't Fly\\" is as sonically layered as anything Lana Del Ray has ever recorded. The Lead single \\"Problem\\" is an obvious hit, and on \\"Controversy,\\" Kills raps in a low whisper and sings over a thumping bass line about real life issues facing young people today, without the self-importance or hypocrisy of Pink. As tough as Pink tries to be, Natalia Kills would eat her lunch. The masterpiece \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is every bit as good or even better than any Katy Perry single, without the annoying yelp and excessive auto tune. It's so refreshing to see a pop album without the likes of Max Martin, Red One, the Matrix, Tricky Stewart, Dr. Luke, Fernando Garibay, and all the other professional cooks behind the success of many of the cookie cutter pop stars our conformity based media is trotting out today.<br /><br />In a world full of carbon copies, this one is somewhat original. Natalia Kills has delivered a pop album on par with the best of the past decade, as the album develops its own identity with each passing track. So refreshing to not have to hear a guest rapper on every track while the female artist tries to slip innuendo into the lyrics. Natalia Kills just lays it out there, and it shows in her performances. This album deserves to be a huge hit.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a touching heartfelt book! It was one of the best books I have ever read! I even cried!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This boom was so good I couldn't put it down! Lots is twists and turns!! I can't wait for the next one!!!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|I love horror movies and this movie had the right elements to make it a really good horror.  I rated it a 4 because there are other movies that I feel are better than this one but this movie was still very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was so much fun to play this game it's like having your own horse. This game did take a while load but other wise every thing worked perfect I would definitely get this game!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was really not that convinced going into this book, but oh what a pleasant surprize.<br />Well written, well put together with lots of development of characters and storyline.<br />If you want to nitpick then it could have been through a more thorough spell check, but thats about it.<br /><br />I am so happy that i followed the sheep here-do your mind a favor and feed it some &#34;Wool&#34;.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon and Kindle for bringing the whole sci-fi genre back into the wonderful state that it has become by bringing it to kindle publiishing.
B00CAUK7IS|4.0|I have no complaints with the movie. I wasn't sure what to expect going in, due to some very snotty reviews going around about no character developement, boring characters, bad storyline. But honestly, I think many people giving nasty reviews just want to complain. I thought it was a fun, well done, entertaining, and had plenty of story to it.<br /><br />my one complaint is the copy I received my dvd player tells me is not region 1. luckily it worked in my laptop if I changed the region.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This completes my collection of core AI Factory games.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is simply the best Backgammon game available for the Android OS in existence.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Clean UI<br />* No IAP<br />* Fair (you can even use your own dice rolls)<br />* Die roll statistics (so you can see it doesn't favor the AI)<br />* Complete with \\"How to Play\\" for those new to this great game<br />* Ample options (set up game play how you want, INCLUDING REVERSING THE BOARD*)<br />* Intuitive<br />* Once license is verified, you CAN play offline<br /><br />Cons:<br />N/A<br /><br />Whether you know or like Backgammon, I highly suggest you add this game to your collection, you may find you play it more than any other, even if it's later.  You'll not regret owning the license.<br /><br />* To reverse the board, after you select \\"Single Player,\\" choose the dark piece (checker, pip, etc) in the \\"Match Settings\\" \\"Play as:\\" option.  To switch to white, in regular options, choose \\"Invert Piece Colours.\\" This depends on who go first.
B001AKPEKA|5.0|I bought my copy of it used. have no complaints! Wonderful movie. Tells you a bit more how things started with the X-men! Very happy with the purchase
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|For Star Wars fans and angry bird addicts, you will not be disappointed. This one is by far the best.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Some of this movie is hokey as hell, but it was not as bad as I expected listening to others. I enjoyed the movie
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I love this app for playing with my nieces and nephew. The only problem is that Tom doesn't always hear you. I assume it is because of the mic or the location of it, directly above the camera lens. I still love using it.
B00C8RD5KU|5.0|This movie if fun for kids and adults alike. The characters are fun and creative, the story is good, and it isn't boring. The movie is full of hope, wonder, joy, fun, and makes you remember some of those things about being a kid.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So far so good. Right now l seem happy  with this app. I will tell my friends about it. Thanks
B008S83IPA|4.0|I wanted to see it, but honestly, I expected it to end up tragic.<br />I was happily surprised when it wasn't! Funny, some romance, and some good ol action! I would recommend the movie
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This movie was beautifully made.. with touching performance by Clooney, Woodley, and the rest of the cast.  The Hawaiian scenery was icing on the cake.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I love it. I listen to it every day as I drive 30 minutes to my college. Long live Kesha.
B000053VAF|3.0|This movie is supposed to be a ridiculous comedy.  A presentation so ridiculous that everyone knows it can't be anything except funny.  People get into the different theological concepts parodied in the movie as if the movie is supposed to be some sarcastic assault on religious beliefs.<br /><br />Forget about theology.  This movie rates right up there with Harold and Kumar, The Three Stooges, Hangover and other parody movies that make me laugh.<br /><br />I like the DVD and I enjoy the movie.
0385751532|5.0|I was interested in the movie based on this novel that was released several years back, but I never did see the film.  When I stumbled upon the book recently at a used book sale, it seemed to make sense to read the original source material.<br /><br />The main character of THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is actually not the title character but Bruno, a nine year old German boy living in Berlin.  Bruno is dismayed to be told one day that the entire family is leaving their beautiful, five-story home--with the sliding bannister from top to bottom--to go to a desolate, isolated house where he has no other boys with whom he can play.  Bruno mourns the loss of his old life, blames his father (whose job precipitated the move to the strange place called \\"Out-With\\"), and tries to avoid his dreaded older sister.<br /><br />One day (not until about halfway through this short, 215-page novel), Bruno finally decides to explore the grounds surrounding his new home, including the area along the fence he can see from his bedroom window and the mysterious people in pajamas he observes beyond it.  At the fence he meets another boy, Schmuel, who is exactly his age.  To Bruno's surprise, Schmuel was also cruelly forced to leave his home and to be relocated to this desolate new place, although Bruno can hardly believe the details of Schmuel's stories, such as being forced to live in a single room with eleven people.  Still, Bruno's growing friendship with Schmuel helps him to forget his own unhappiness.<br /><br />Author John Boyne writes this book mainly as the tale of a young boy's loss and discovery of new friendship.  His larger commentaries are subtle, and that's all that they need to be, because of course we--the reader--know the truer, fuller story.  As a result, the writing is very effective, completely engrossing, and highly moving.  This simple story may take you by surprise; I highly recommend it.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Other tracks leave you wishing that NIN stayed asleep. Some tracks are good... others are not. What more can I say?
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was well written and a twist and turn or two which I love. The story of people and how their lives change was plus for me. All of us in this world have secrets....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very sharp picture and clarity. Love watching with no commercials as well.  Great to get these on Amazon and be able to watch them when we have time.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Crashes on my Nexus 7, works on my older devices. Works OK on my S3, still crashes though. Needs update!!
0670026638|3.0|I thought A \\"Tale for the Time Being\\" was a wonderful novel until the concept of quantum mechanics interrupted the story in such a way that I thought of it as the author's conceit.  I  felt as if she needed either to inject a meditation on the connection between Buddhism and quantum mechanics somehow, or she needed some way to influence the characters.  It seemed out of place and rather clumsy in an otherwise great read.<br /><br />I would have awarded this novel five stars, but for the injection of quantum mechanics. All other references to science and nature appeared to be natural inclusions that enhanced description and narrative.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a captivating story, one that I've never heard before. It switches back and forth between two character's perspectives. I tore through it and found it not only be a great story, but an example of fantastic writing. I highly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|50 Shades of Grey is the number one book requested by the detainees of guantanamo Bay Cuba. The unedited English version. A dubious distinction I'd say.<br /><br />Curious, I went to my library and checked it out to see what our enemies found so interesting. I did not make it past page 40.<br /><br />I always give an author at least five - ten chapters to win me over because it is their work, it is their heart and soul. However, I just don't see what people see in this book. The main female, Ana, is so weak kneed it's pathetic. Her initial introduction has her seem she couldn't choose paper or plastic in the check out line. All because of Christian Grey, a Warren Buffet at the ripe old age of 27 years old. I would have loved to know what this man did to earn his empire. Is he a Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs genius combined? I would have found that plausible, far fetched, but at least we would have a reason for his great wealth. If that information is revealed on page 200, , sorry that's not acceptable to those of us who like details and histories of their characters.<br /><br />The writing is freshman or sophomore high school level at best. During the \\"interview\\" Ana was giving Grey, she asks him how does he \\"chill\\" out. Such a professional and mature word to use from a college senior. When she walks into his office building you are reminded he surrounds himself with steel and glass at least twice on four to six pages. Everything is grey, while you're going to reading about Gray.<br /><br />Whatever draws readers to this book is beyond me. Perhaps the ease of reading, the sex scenes that are supposed to proliferate the pages, or both. I'm so glad I checked it out instead of throwing my money away.<br /><br />For those of you who sing its glorious pages congratulations, you share something in common with the terrorists. Happy reading.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. I always find helpful recipes in a pinch! I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Hope this helped
0062278096|5.0|I absolutely adore the series.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are both perfect for their roles. That being said, the show wouldn't nearly be as good without the witty, razor-sharp, lightning-fast, Doyle-pop-culture peppered dialogue and social interplay. The writers really outdid themselves in the show, and thankfully, their brilliance has carried over into the book.  I have gone through nearly half of it already in two days, and in all that time, I could not stop snorting and snickering.  The bickering of Sherlock and John through the post-its scattered all throughout Watson's &#34;pre-pubescent girl's scrapbook&#34; is priceless. Truly a work that lives up to its claim of being an &#34;Official Companion&#34; to the hit television series.  If you are any kind of fan at all, Buy it now!!
B00C5R8364|4.0|Enjoyed and appreciated the &#34; inside&#34; info.<br />Always a great effort by Forysth.<br />A real pro at spy stuff.<br />Read at one go!
0525425772|4.0|I pre-read all books before letting my 10 year old son read them. He loves this series and I love that it expands his vocabulary and interests. This particular one was a little slow for the first few chapters but once it got good neither of us could put it down. Worthwhile read.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had a hard time keeping up with all the different people involved in the story.  It didn't seem to flow.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|This was a complete waste of $3. I intended to use this for my school readings, but most of the PDFs assigned are direct scans of a book. This app doesn't recognize them as text so literally none of the annotation tools worked on any if the articles. Furthermore, this was when I could even GET a PDF  to open. Half of the time it would either be stuck on the loading page or it would just crash and the app would immediately x out when I clicked the document.<br />Completely and utterly useless on every front I tried to use it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Highly recommend this app!!  SO easy to download and use right away!  I love that the buttons are so big that I don't have to use my readers to see and I can't possibly &#34;fat finger&#34; another number and make mistakes!

B00B22IJXK|2.0|This app gives you a small variety of what you want to do with your photo. I recommend getting another app if you want to add lots of special effects. The picture of a girl with butterfly hair and a girl with a red dress are not using effects you will find in this app. Overall it is ok but offers very little variety.
0375413405|3.0|I had to buy this after coming back from Paris.  It helped, but it's too much like regular home cooking and not really like anything I ate in Paris.  So it's a good start and the dessert section is delightful but it's so-so.  The biggest problem with trying to cook like a European is that they have much better tasting produce and many better cheeses.  All their meat is the same as ours but you can't recreate the taste of high quality produce in America.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Always enjoy Lee Child's Jack Reacher books as they keep you enthralled and guessing with all the different twists and turns along the way. Find it very hard to put the book down - I get so engrossed.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This movie was awesome! Ten minutes into the movie and the action/thriller parts have you on the edge of your seat and it continues that way til the end of the movie. It's a great movie and I recommend it.
030758836X|4.0|great book.  Gillian Flynn is a master storyteller.  Exciting, suspense and I couldn't put it down. I plan to read all of her novels
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has enabled us to be more closely drawn to Lincoln by his depth of character and warmth of personality. This is a Lincoln not seen in the past, and in the end you mourn his passing even more strongly, even as we near the 150th anniversary of his death.

B00E7SID9G|5.0|I never thought that the truth about Jesus of Nazareth, one of the most loved and hated persons of history would be so captivating. Reza tells it in a way that will make you fall in love with this revolutionary man. The best non-fiction I have ever read.

B00B22ASUM|5.0|What a great heartwarming story!  It was a very easy read and the story was incredible!  It was destiny for these two characters to unite!
B00BMEF97W|5.0|This is honestly one of my favorite albums ever.  Before listening to this album i hadn't really heard of Bring Me the Horizon.  After hearing it, I have bought every album they've put out.  Get this album.  It will change your life.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This season made me a fan the characters are well fitted together,  they each compliment each other they make the script what it is, excellent!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I hit the wrong thing I want the  Blu-Ray but that's all right have a good day thank you !
B00F35BV64|4.0|I loved it!  I am going to have to purchase it so I can watch it again.  I like the actors for kirk and spock.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only reason this book sells is for the sex.  The writing is so poor that it makes it difficult to focus on the story.  Screwed up dominant man, girl who bites lip every other sentence (and turns him on) and earth shattering sex over and over and over again.  Thats 90% of the book.
B00CKH9WOQ|4.0|Another beautiful Monster High doll.  Gave this a four star because the arms are not as flexible as the others are and worry they might break if my 7 year old changes her clothes or just through normal play.  Box that the doll was in arrived in was in bad shape (tears and bends).  Since we are not collectors and it got thrown away, not a big deal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After enduring a summer mindlessly glossing over 17 Stephanie Plum Series books, I was dying to read something that was actually captivating and well written. I found this book by filtering my search by rating and was surprised (and dubious) to see that this book, written by someone I'd never heard of, had hundreds of five-star reviews. I figured since it was inexpensive, why not give it a glance. I'm SO glad I did. I couldn't put it down--in fact, I just finished the Wool series after starting it last night--neglecting my house and sleep so I could see what happened next.<br />I am not a fan of science fiction, but this book's premise is easy to follow and the writing is magnificent. I was sucked into the dynamic plot immediately and found myself, for the first time in ages, in suspense. The writing is detailed enough to make me feel like part of the story, though not overly detailed that I start skimming just to move on. I read every word and look forward to reading more, and I'll certainly recommend this book to others.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This was the best of Michael's on screen showings I have ever seen. I miss him so much. I was so happy it previewed on my 40th birthday. A group of 12 of us got together & went to the preview that first night. It was a night I'll forever remember. Best gift ever. Even people who weren't his fan's walked out saying what an excellent movie it was. Now that is a real compliment. (Especially if you knew these people.)He brought so much love, joy, happiness, wonder, beauty & true caring to this world. so much of what we lack now & have for so very long. this movie shows how much of himself he really put into his work & how important it was to impress his viewers & make them happy & get his messages across to the whole world. we should all continue to carry on Michael's message's. Even though we will never have another beautiful genius like him in our lifetime, we owe it to his memory to pass on his words & his loving messages to our friends and family. teach our children to love one another no matter what. it's the best way we can say thank you Michael for giving your life for your fans. God Bless you all & May Michael Rest In Peace. God Rest His Beautiful Soul. We love & miss you Michael. Thank you for a lifetime of wonder & gifts. Til we meet someday in Heaven. Lord be with you and your family & protect you all.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app works on my husband's phone. But for some reason has never worked on mine, though after I installed it, I did have problems with my kindle Fire updating once I bought books. So...not so awesome.
030758836X|3.0|Not to \\"beat a dead horse,\\" but the ending was horrible. I enjoyed reading the book, great page turner that kept me interested.  However, the ending was horrible, I was waiting for a huge \\"gotcha momemt\\" that never came.
B00F91H666|3.0|I wanted to see this in 3D in the theater, but didn't get the chance. Actually happy I didn't pay all that money and ended up renting it on Amazon. I don't think this movie would have stood as good a chance if it wasn't for the name of Brad Pitt. He's such a good actor, but the story line felt very scattered. As soon as a character is introduced, they're offed. It felt like lots of pieces of other movies (the specialist looking for a cure, was dead before I knew it; the military guys at a zombie hot spot, and just not enough screen time to be of any signification, I already don't remember most of their dialogue for their 5 minutes on screen; then there is the specialists where Brad comes across a solution, not for the Zombies, but what people can do in order to fight these hysterical, rabies like zombies who run, leap, and hurl themselves, and go from human to zombie in under 12 seconds.  I know this was a movie with different time constraints, but it did make me appreciate the Walking Dead's story telling. If you are more of an action than story telling person, this movie &#34;runs&#34; with very little sit down time.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Perfect condition. Brand new just like described. Fast service. Love the show and we will be buying the rest after we finish this season.
B0000714BP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I'm glad I finally ordered my own copy.  It's nice to be able to see it whenever I want.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book, I will recommend to everyone I know.  An Easy read I finished it in 3 days, great characters
B003G4W49C|5.0|First read this ages ago and picked it back up after reading my paperback so many times I wore it out lol.<br /><br />Recommended for any age. Now to go re-read the rest
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|Got this app today for free on kindle, its brilliant has everything you need and more from checking flights to organising your holiday renting a car checking in and all your flight details to hand WoW there is too much give it a go :-)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Would buy again and again. Easy to use and very efficient and surprisingly fast so quiet to, definitely worth every penny.
0385345054|5.0|I just got this book and WOW,,, it is beautiful.<br />I am pretty crafty and especially love to craft with paper, so I am looking forward to trying out the ideas in the book.<br />But, even if I wasn't craft motivated it's a really nice book to flip through and enjoy the photos and color inspirations.<br />I highly recommend it.  I don't buy too many craft books, because I use the internet a lot for ideas and tutorial.  But I am glad I splurged on this one.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Avenged Sevenfold album to date.  I have been following the band for years and have songs from each of their earlier releases.  This is the first album, where i can honestly say, that i like each song on the album.  Personal favorites:  Shepherd of Fire, Heretic and Coming Home.  I have had the album for nearly a month and still listen to it regularly.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved reading this book so much that I read the trilogy in just 2 days. I was glued from the first few pages. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who isn't open minded. It is very raunchy and descriptive.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book I am 14 and I love this book it is awesome Rick does a great job with this book I can't wait for the next
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I fell in love with the main characters from the very start. This book is amazing. It is well written and very descriptive. It definitely opens your mind to a few things and makes you want a man exactly like the main character Christian. I have fallen in love with this trilogy!
B001MSMULG|5.0|Just when you think the plot has become predictable, Silva twists the plot again -- yet in a realistic, believable fashion. Excellent presentation and illumination of the Palestinian point of view.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is definitely not for anyone who isn't open minded. The detail and descriptions alone will get you hot and bothered. I almost chose this as a book for my mom and I to read together and I am SO happy I didn't. Its so easy to fall in love with Christian Grey and Ana. Definitely read this!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Down to earth strategy for more healthy way of eating.  Not having to count cals all day, every day is great.  Even on fast days, cal counting is minimal if you stick to salad stuff.  Looking forward to a slimmer me and he,
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I owned a Logitech Revue for almost two years and barely used it. I liked the idea, but the device just never met the initial promise. The Chromecast works great. Open Youtube or Netflix or Play Music and it effortlessly starts playing on the television. I've gotten more use out of this $35 device in a couple of months than I did out of the $100 Revue in almost two years. It's already pretty great and it can only get better.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is so funny and when you unlock the song it's hilarious i love this app soooooooo much I wish dumb ways to live was this good!!!!
B00080ZG10|5.0|I'm sorry, but The Aviator was completely robbed at the Academy Awards when it failed to win for Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director. This is an astounding and unforgettable motion picture - it couldn't be better.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very unique, well written book. Not a typical love story, but moving nonetheless. I cannot wait to read another  book by this author.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|In my opinion, Lonesome Dove is the best western ever made along with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Silverado. Lonesome Dove stands apart because it's so long and in-depth, has a rich and involving story line, and a large cast who are all stupendous. It's a story you never want to end and performances you'll never forget. A masterpiece laced with humour, wit, intellect, judgement, bravery, honor, devotion, respect, and adventure.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I like  it cause it's awesome!<br />And I can change the background and its to awesome!<br />55343434343534353536&amp;(#(_ !7 thighs polo pool awesome look is awesome xxx awesome

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this cute game...is very entertaining and will keep you playing for hours...not a lot of games like this one.
B00354Y9ZU|1.0|This book was a lot of self-marketing bull might as well watch an infomercial. I found it really boring and was not the hassle to figure out a method to transfer it to my nexus 7.
B007ZYJT1U|3.0|The acting is very good, the story seems to be very original, the end is not quite definitive even though you kind of guess the outcome.<br />overall I enjoyed it
B000JMKTLO|3.0|i like Gillian Flynn....she's got a messed up, creative mind and she's got a strong talent when it comes to writing female characters.....I hope she continues to write and not give up too easily and get bored with the story....this could have been a great book had she seen it through....solid effort...she's definetely on my radar now!
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I thought this was a pretty good book.  It's not a complicated mystery, but pretty good.  Not a lot of complicated words or anything very challenging, but still good.  It is the first &#34;Heat&#34; book I've read.  I definitely think the TV series is well written.  It was quick & enjoyable.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|This is one of those great ones for ladies night in...My daughter who's 14 enjoyed watching it with me. Great movie!

B00C1CO0XS|5.0|What a wonderful tribute to Nat....George has replicated Nat's sound, and<br />then added wonderful guitar playing with great orchestration as well!<br />We saw Nat King Cole at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas...many years ago...<br />This music makes a picture in my mind of both of them singing these<br />wonderful songs, side by side!  Just picture Nat at the Piano, and<br />George playing guitar with him!  Oh, wouldn't that have been fantastic?!<br />Two very classy entertainers!!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|finally available for androids.  my kids love this app.  very silly and funny. love the song too. so glad you added it to appstore. especially after all the rip off apps for this game.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|The idea of rabid humans/zombies on a homicidal raid through the streets of major metropolitan cities captured my interest, and I thought the movie did a pretty good job of conveying the horror that would ensue.  By all accounts I should have loved the film, but I just had a hard time keeping interest as Brad Pitt jetted around the world looking for answers.  Maybe the film makers tried to put too much story in too little time.  I wish I had saved a few bucks and waited for it to hit the rental list.  I'm just glad I didn't fork out the 50 bucks or so it costs these days to see it in the theaters.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this is a great new addition to angry bird games.  love the 2 sides to play.  new features and moves with the swords and stuff. best one yet!!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this movie when I rented it but Tom Cruise can really do no wrong. He's very good. Entertaining plot.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great for my family. I have a 4 and 6 year old. Clean humor. Funny for me and my wife too.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I was really looking forward to watching this, everyone said it was so good. The characters are too crazy - it's a little uncomfortable.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Another fantastic Novel from James Dashner. Action packed and exciting. The best things about this book are the fact there are a lot of unseen twists and a lot of answers by the end, although the ending did leave the story open enough that if Dashner was to come back he could probably get a whole other book out of this series.<br /><br />All in all it was great, but i am still going with the Maze Runner being my favorite in the series. Would still recommend to everyone though.

1451695195|5.0|From one who is a scientific spiritualist, this book is full of information to share with others who are sincerely seeking truth. Dr. Alexander wrote in layman's terms yet so beautifully illustrated his experience. Thank you Eben Alexander for taking the time and compassion to write and share your story. I bought this book for myself and am now reading it to my elderly (now blind and bedfast) mother living in a nursing home. Although she has some dementia, she appears completely lucid while I read to her. I also bought this book as birthday presents for my adult son and daughter who are both practicing Dr.'s I also bought a copy of this book as a gift to my only surviving sibling, my precious sister. We both lost our brother, our sister and father in a very short time period not long ago.  This book is very comforting for those who have loved ones on the other side.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book covers each ingredient of fat, sugar and salt individually, but also discusses how they are all intertwined to make the processed &#34;food&#34; that we all &#34;crave&#34;.  The studies and research utilizing the most intelligent people that money can buy are put to work on ways to make us buy their products in greater and greater amounts. Our society that is pushed more and more to work harder and faster, has very little time to cook meals utilizing fresh and healthy ingredients. The quick and tasty food already prepared for us seems to be the savior, but it is far from what we need. Making increasing amounts of money to satisfy Wall Street, and to beat their competitors, is all they care about. Many of us think all those brands are individual companies, but in truth, they are owned by just a handful of conglomerates that are worth billions of dollars.<br />I have been saying that it is not our fault that we are all obese and sick. The responsibility lies in the hands of these companies, and the government that refuses to stop them, all for the mighty buck.
B00COCY67A|5.0|this is an excellent CD. I like this CD so very much. and Elvis sounds at the top of his game
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is from start to finish, their finest work.  At 60-something, that is great.  Production is great .  I listen from start to finish and do not skip a song.  It gets better every time you listen to it.  Get the Deluxe Edition - all three songs are great.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|After seeing all my friend's getting their figure for Sailor Moon when it was first released, I got a bit antsy! I was perfectly okay with waiting for it though, I knew it'd get here eventually. When it did my heart stopped! But when I opened the box I was left disappointing. Usually Amazon is SO good about packaging items but this one left a lot to be desired. The box the figure was in was a bit damaged and almost looked warped like it had been left out in the moisture too long. Shame on you, amazon! There are many others selling this exact Sailor Moon figure for comparable prices. Amazon let me down and I will not be ordering the other figures from them.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Pretty brutal story, but interesting.  Good acting and in the end the good guys win.  Not unhappy that I rented it.
0960191046|4.0|This book is a little bit of dry read, but it does not fail on delivering it's promise of offering a great system for structuring your business writing. Minto's pyramid principle is great for anyone who has to write memos or sum up information to superiors. I now use a pyramid before writing just about anything to ensure my thoughts and key points are clear.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app. I need a quick way to check current and predicted weather locally and for travel plans. I am never disappointed with the quality of information I receive from The Weather Channel.
B008N9AASC|5.0|Awesome content that flows together from one scene to the next.  I gave Samsara as a gift to my grandson, his last name like mine means \\"I see the world\\".  On his golden birthday, his 17th, I gave him his first view of the larger world in all it's beauty, grief and ecstasy.<br /><br />Thank you for prompt delivery in good pristine condition.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I feel as though I've grown up with John Mayer.  His lyrics and his musical brilliance shine on Paradise Valley, I think he is a legend in the making and I hope he just keeps doing what he does.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|The Rides are awesome and this album validates that Stephen Stills is a national treasure!!!  We of the sixties generation were blessed to live in a time when so much great music was being made.  This recording is one of SS best in many years that highlights his talents as a blues man.  I love CSN, but it is so cool to have Stills just let loose with Kenny Wayne Shepard and Barry Goldberg.  Please purchase this album and you will not be disappointed.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I don't usually read books that are recommended to me by my fellow readers, because I have so many choices of my own on my Kindle, but I took a chance on this book.  At first, I thought it was a bit slow, but soon after did not want it to ever end.  I am now on my second Kate Morton novel.  I also like that her novels are not sequels that you have to read in order.  All their own new stories.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|Pretty good game, but items get stuck under tab. Trying to retrieve a piece of the record and it is stuck. Cannot continue game. Will give better review if this gets fixed.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I checked this out randomly and was presently surprised, I will defnitely come back to it when i have some free time
B000B5XOY8|4.0|I have always liked this movie... I think that the acting was very good in all roles. The 2 disc special edition has a whole disc of special features that were, to me, interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome<br /><br />It is awesome<br />I want to play every day<br />It's good for the kids that like horses<br />Play it every day<br />Have fun every body
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So much drama it's so lovely hard to put down more is a story line some things come to life or death ex subs Mrs.Robison confession s of the past all so dramatically suspenseful
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|honestly shocked how much I actually did enjoy. I ended up playing for hrs and I wasn't planning.on playing for even a second.
142311339X|4.0|Thanks so much for the the book! When I got it, it was hard to unwrap and the wrapping was kinda bad but when I opened it the book just had a small dent on the corners of the book. I think you guys should wrap things a little better. Anyways the book is fine. Thank you for the book. Fast shipping too! ;)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|There are better knife sharpeners out there. But then again you're probably not carrying a stone into the woods if you're looking at this product. I am more of a fan of the pen-style sharpeners, since they give you a flat plane on which to grind, and this one doesn't. They aro aslo easy to carry. But this one does the job, and is small. (And might help with those people who have trouble getting the angles right)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is wonderful. I couldn't possibly look for anything better, and it does everything I need. This is what you want!
0739352989|2.0|I bought this for my wife for a trip across the country.  She loves the books but rarely has time to read so thought this would be a good way for her to get through the books.  Her response was that the reading went too slow and the women's voice worked fine for the female character but that when the women did the man's voice that it creeped her out.  She made it part way through the first book before giving up.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|I love puzzles and this is a type that I haven't tried before.  One type is very similar to minesweeper, another game I enjoy.  I recommend it to all people who enjoy logic or analytical type puzzles.
B007X3DQGM|5.0|I purchased this book after reading a blog that the blog owner had created a beautiful afghan using one of the patterns from this book. The images are great as well as the instructions.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this concert.  I played the Blu ray disk version on a Panasonic Viera Plasma.  The music and imagery are absolutely astonishing.  I rarely have the patience to watch a 2 hour plus of any video, but this one was so exceptional that I remained glued to the concert.  I highly recommend this video to any music lover.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Great shipping to us. The product was exactly as promised. My family loves this series so we were happy to get this as soon as possible.
B001NHNG64|1.0|This book is hoky, totally contrived. There is not a single character in it who is believable. The plot, if you can call it that, is overblown and at best nonsensical. This was the author's second book. He must have seriously considered finding new work when he re-read it. Let's hope he finds his direction in future books.
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|Comes with over 10 minutes of extended scenes, the acting is awesome and a fun movie to watch during Halloween!
B00E8B1358|5.0|Besides all the action, it's great to see The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) playing a lead part.  Bruce Willis has a good part also.  See what you think of the way he stocks his kitchen. :)
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I bought this CD for the one song, but the whole CD is a good one. It is an artist that I didn't know a lot about, but I like this artist.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The Dexter Series Is By Far One Of My Favorite By Far.<br />Just When You Thought You Would Never Be Rooting On a cold Hearted Murderer! Here Comes DEX!
B008220BP2|4.0|I thought this was such a cute movie I had to have it I knew I would watch more than once.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|At first I made fun of people who watched this show until \\"Graduation\\".  That evening my Facebook feed blew up with a quote: \\"Tyler may be your first love, I intend to be your last.\\"  I thought wow...that was kinda hot. What was this about?  I YouTubed/Googled the quote and found out it was from Vampire Diaries.  Walmart happened to have a sale on the first three seasons of this series so I bought the first and after two episodes, I went and bought the other two seasons.<br /><br />I also bought the books which after attempting to read two of them...I donated the books because I thought they sucked.  The TV show is awesome!  The writers are brilliant in how they make sure everything is rooted in either science or \\"common knowledge\\" which makes everything supernatural actually sound plausible and logical.  Klaus is a hybrid therefore his blood can heal werewolf bites -- ah.  Klaus is half werewolf and can mate with another werewolf...hahahaha that does makes sense. Being a vampire/werewolf/witch is not always fun and everyone has their limits.  Who wants to break their bones every full moon?<br /><br />The other magical awesomeness of this show is that everyone in the show is not just an extra.  Yeah, we might not know their name but they each have a back story that will crop up either episodes or a season later.  Don't get attached to the girl sitting next to Elena or the cheerleader that helps out Matt...no one is ever completely safe and everyone matters in this series!
140006922X|5.0|I would recommend this fascinating book to anyone who wants to learn some history of the Christian faith. Reza Aslan has cleared up some mysteries about Jesus and the Bible that have puzzled me for years.  I have been so surprised by what I'm learning that I bought two other copies to give to my ministers.
B00BMEF97W|5.0|I feel as though BMTH is continuing to improve their sound and emotion put into each track. I really enjoyed this album and I cannot wait for more!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory is an amazing writer.  You become part of her story.  This series is awesome.  Anyone who likes England history would love this series.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|A probable mismatch with actors’ public perception and the character’s role.  Still entertaining and and worth to watch ion the TV
B00A285OOW|5.0|Always love her books.  Love her detail because it makes you feel like part of the story.<br /> I would recommend this series to anyone who loves to read about English history.
B004XANKVO|5.0|The large middle pocket could use a nicer way to be organized, items just tend to be loose when packed in there, but overall I love this bag. I put a toolbox in the space between the front pocket and it works like a charm. I would have liked some hooks at the front for my D rings, I put them on the blue straps now, but I think those will eventually break. Great bag. Solid build. I feel the money was well spent. Amazaon Prime is almost always great.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|This movie was much better than I thought it would be. I was turned off by the name &#34;Croods&#34; because as a mom, the term crude is simply a negative association. This movie actually had some good messages about thinking outside of the box and thinking as an individual. There was some crude humor, but nothing I thought was a deal-breaker. The kids loved it (ages 6 & 8), and so did I!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|If you haven't bought this CD you better get it.  What a fantastic tribute to Merle and Buck!  Our family just attended a Vince concert two weeks ago and we were thrilled that Vince and Paul did many songs from this album.  It's great!!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I bought the movie Polar Express and the hardback book.  They loved it as a gift and really enjoyed both.
B002XUL6RG|5.0|Great movie with beautiful visuals, sometimes slow but always honest and brutal. Just buy this movie already common ya schmuck
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I liked everything about this book,, short chapters and to the point and easy practice lessons ! The importance of this book is,,,, if you don,t experience's the exercises you will only intellectize  the knowledge,, but when you DO the lessons,,, then the knowledge is yours,, and not some theory !
B00B2YH7BS|4.0|If you love rock music and are interested in the history of recording...especially some of the most historic rock records of the 70s and 80s, this is a must see!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I like it. I've been a backgammon player since my youth playing on real boards and, eventually, the internet. (Anybody else remember using telnet to connect to FIBS?)<br />Well this certainly looks a lot better than the old telnet days. :-)  The board and dice are very nicely designed, both the classic and modern skins. I played a couple games on the different difficulty levels, and I'd say there's enough range that anyone short of a world-class player is going to find a level that is challenging and rewarding.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Looks great.<br />2. Free App of the Day<br />3. 5 difficulty levels to choose from. Should be sufficient for anyone from the beginner to the serious player.<br />4. Well worth the 99 cents...but...FREE today!<br />5. Almost no permissions. Other than writing to storage, this thing doesn't try to do anything. I have my WiFi off when testing games, and the Single Player works without a hitch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I can't think of any.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Get it while it's the FAOTD if you can, but if you like backgammon, it's worth the 99 cents if you miss out on the freebie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it!! My 11 year old son and I have a blast finding our way out! I would highly recommend it!
0345803485|5.0|I got it very quickly, didn't take long, book was in perfect condition, no marking or anything. Looking at the price I paid it was an excellent buy, will definitely use them again.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Easy to carry, very compact.<br />Does what I need it to do.<br />The flat surface on bottom allowing it to stand on it's own is one of the reasons I bought it.<br />Recommended!
0375869026|5.0|A must read for Middle Schoolers (5-9). My students just love it. It is fun, but also full of rich themes.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|One of my favorite Jane Austen movies.  This version is fabulous.  Highly recommended.  Caryn Hinds at his best.  I can't get enough of it.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|The movie got off to a fast and exciting start.  We loved that it was scary without being a gorefest.  Very glad we rented it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini reminded us of how life can be so hard and unfair. Emotions run in every page and we can't but feel sad. When we were children, we were happy... Why? Because we can't understand the game of life.<br /><br />The novel is great, but it has too many characters which made it sometimes hard to follow.
B009QNWUNW|5.0|Early Elton John at his best!!  When you put Bernie Taupin and Elton John together, you have pure gold, as they did over and over again!!
0887431453|4.0|The parents don't have to wait till the pre-k brings assignments at home. They have it all in this book. It is a forward-looking tool to allow the kid to advance.
159463176X|3.0|The book was really good for the first half.  Unfortunately it lost momentum from that point until the very disappointing end.  This was like reading 2 separate books crammed into one.  Too many characters with some leaving you wondering why they are in there in the first place.  He is a wonderful storyteller and beautiful writer but by the end you are left feeling unfulfilled.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I absolutely adore this app! it works consistently everyday without fail! if I could give it 100 stars I would! perfect clock!
0060989157|5.0|This is an awesome book!  You don't need to be a Crüe fan(your loss)to be blown away by the stories of these incredibly talented and somewhat damaged rock stars.  They tell you EVERYTHING.  Nikki Sixx is such a talented writer and brutally honest about all his experiences.  This is the closest you will ever get to knowing what it's like to be young, talented, gorgeous and members of one of the greatest bands of all time!
B00C7JFIRC|2.0|Dumb and boring, and drawn out way to much. Original was SO much better. I would not had bought it if I knew it was this bad.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|Dexter Season 8 should serve as a lesson in not rushing a season out less than a year after a previous one has ended. Especially if it's supposed to be the end of a much loved series. How can you even write/film/produce a good season in that time? I think Showtime is as much to blame as the writers for putting them on such a hectic schedule knowing it was meant to be the end. Season 8 was cliche, lame, ridiculous and horrible all at once. A sharp decline from Season 7, which started bringing back the intensity of earlier seasons. An even sharper decline from the unique amazing show 'Dexter' began life as in Season 1. Season 8 was generic TV writing filler for fans of other generic American shows. So no doubt the people that loved it, got into this show when it became cool to like this show, so they never appreciated how refreshing it was from all the other crap on TV back when it was starting out. Dexter used to have it's own vibe and it's own unique quirks and great story lines, with lots of attention to detail. Season 8 was tacky and sloppy beyond belief, there was zero attention to detail...Just a total screw you to fans that have supported this show for so many years.
B008EAVWAA|1.0|I find few redeeming qualities in the characters in this book and I do not like their manner of communicating.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Just exactly like playing the actual game - I only got it yesterday and I am already addicted.  Have always loved this game and now can play anytime and any where.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It's a story of 2women in similar circumstances only 70 years apart in time. There is real insight into the orphan trains that came out of NY.  You will enjoy it
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Damn Good Knife, and the price is not bad ether. So good I had to buy one more, but I  am sure it will last a long time.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Good series, super fun to watch if you would love to watch something that is entertaining yet mindless. Good buy!~
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|The story line has an interesting concept sort of a mixture of Harry Potter meets Twilight. It wasn't quite what I expected and maybe that is a good thing, as I think it will grow on me. I will be trying the others in the series.

B008RKGF1I|4.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and I liked it then. When I was going through all of the movies that are available in my Prime account I came across it and it is still a good movie.

B00632HWOG|4.0|This application is very easy to use. I use it on my Kindle and one click and you have all the functionality as on a regular laptop.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I'll begin by stating that I enjoyed the book's plot and characters, but I most especially admired the way Gillian Flynn created a thoroughly creepy mood.<br /><br />The characters are unique, damaged and clever and multidimensional. The setting is fully fleshed out, realistic, gritty, and creepy as hell.  All in all, a very entertaining book.  The only exception would be the pacing of the plot.  It was consistent throughout the beginning and middle of the book, but once the main plot twist was revealed, everything else was rushed and written as if it were an afterthought.<br /><br />~~~Since not everyone purchasing a book whose cover consists of a razor blade on a black background might know, I warn you of a spoiler alert.  If you don't want to know, don't read what's inside the parentheses.  (The book deals with self-harm.  In fact, the book deals with all sorts of harm, and is jam-packed with triggers for anyone recovering from issues of self-harm or abuse.)~~~
B0000042GM|5.0|This set is not just complete, but first class performances with a classic interpretation and style.  Well recorded, good sound quality.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I'm not one of those readers who has to like the characters as people in order to find them, or a story, interesting and worthwhile.  It's true that the main characters are difficult to like on a superficial level.  They are damaged and edgy and prickly.  They also ring true.  Our heroine, Libby, does not need the horror of her childhood as a \\"reason\\" or \\"excuse\\" for her asocial behavior, and there's no reason she should have transcended it.  She is who she is.<br /><br />The plot isn't the most believable, but Gillian Flynn writes it as if it were.  Suspending disbelief during the reading is easy.  It's afterward, when you're thinking about the plausibility, that it slips a little.  Many of the mysteries she plots for us are cleared up, but not everything is tied into a nice, neat bow.  I suppose I like a book that's just a bit messy.<br /><br />All in all, it's an entertaining read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My doctor recommended this book to me, and I read it, and everything changed.  Just like that.  Yes, it's a bit dry and &#34;sciencey&#34; in places...but I've been looking the other way for too long, and this book just brought it all together into a &#34;lightbulb moment&#34; for me.  It made sense to me, and 3 months later, my diet and eating behaviors have totally changed for the better, and I feel GOOD.  There are several books on this topic, all of which are informative.  This is the only one I've made it all the way through.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I can't believe the original fans of the series had to wait 5 years between book 3 and 4.  I love both the books and the HBO series, and I particularly enjoyed reading the books after watching the show.  I really enjoyed the differences between the two versions.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|A great continuation of the Stargate series.  Wonderfully written and fully capable of standing on its own regardless of the viewers' familiarity (or lack thereof) with SG-1 or Stargate Atlantis.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was totally surprised at what the secret was.  A great story that keeps you wanting to know more about the characters.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I really didn't like this book. It is a tragedy. There are no characters that you can identify with or hope thy do well.  There are just people who are flawed that you can't care about.  To tell the truth, I did't read the middle of the book because I read the end after I didn't care about the beginning, and realized that it didn't get any better.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I was expecting a low budget mediocre film and was pleasantly surprised by how wrong I was.  It was a great story, nice plot, wholesome, entertaining, and all around great movie.  I would recommend to any family.

B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very good product.  Intuitive interface that develops all aspects (writing, hearing, and reading) at once, as well as going both from English-German and German-English.  The only downside I've found (so far), is that it assumes at least a very basic knowledge of the language.  Pronouns, verb conjugations (regular and irregular), and noun declensions are never formally introduced, but just added in to the mix.  I am using the program to relearn a language (German) that I used to speak fluently, so it's not a problem for me, but I imagine it would be difficult if I were to try to learn a completely new language.  Still, overall, a very strong program so far.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Don't waste your money.  I could not even finish the book.  I was so disapppointed in this book.  I am not a fan of the &#34;F&#34; word and this book tries to see how many times you can use this word.  Very, very disappointed in this book.
0062059963|5.0|Published on wwww.hopefulhappiness.net<br /><br />Why did I read The Elite?<br />I was lucky enough to get my hands on the previous book The Selection as an ARC early last year and I absolutely LOVED it! This serious combines aspects of so many of my favorite things; dating shows, dystopian societies, and royalty just to name a few. There was no question in my mind that I would be reading The Elite as soon as I possibly could. I just wish I hadn't waited quite so long!<br /><br />Was this a good followup to The Selection?<br />I'll be honest, it took me a little while to get back into the story. I found the beginning to be a tad dull, but that's okay because the rest of the novel was all over the place, in a good way. All of the familiar characters are back and their stories progress. The only issue is that I had hoped that by the end of this novel both America and myself would feel closer to choosing between Aspen and Maxon. Unfortunately I think we are both more confused than ever. There is just so much more to consider!<br /><br />How do I feel about Aspen and Maxon now?<br />I'm completely confused. There were moments throughout the book where I thought I would want America to be with Aspen because something was revealed about Maxon or Maxon would do something idiotic and the choice seemed clear. Then there were moments where I realized how important it would be for someone like America to have the throne and what a difference she could potentially make. I realize that is not so romantic but it has to be mentioned as a reason to choose Maxon.<br /><br />There were also times where Maxon said something or did something that would make me feel like my heart was melting and I found myself wishing that Aspen would just gracefully bow out and vice versa. I'm telling you this triangle is almost as confusing as the Felicity, Ben, Noel triangle.<br /><br />Did I enjoy all of the twists and turns?<br />So many twists and turns! I really feel that the events that happened and the information that was revealed helped me to really invest more of myself in the storyline and the outcome. There was one moment were Aspen and America kiss in secret that I actually found myself feeling guilty. I know that sounds so silly but  I was worried about how Maxon was going to feel and what could potentially happen to Aspen if someone had seen the lip lock. I think when you get yourself confused with the main character that is always a good thing. It indicates to me that the author is doing something right and I'm truly invested in the story.<br /><br />Am I going to read the next book?<br />You bet I am! I can hardly wait! I just hope I can handle how it ends.and the information that was revealed helped me to really invest more of myself in the storyline and the outcome.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|If you're not a fan of graphic violence, and I'm usually not, you might wince at times, but don't let that stop you. This movie is what comic book adaptations should be: true to the inspiration from start to finish. Well done to all involved.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Odd film, but one of those big-production ventures you want to judge for yourself. Doesn't really do the book justice, but cinematography is eye-catching... Something to rent, when nothing else looks that good. Was glad I waited to watch at home instead of the theater.

B00BTYP6QE|3.0|It was an ok download and somewhat fun game for a freebie. I didn't really get very excited over it though.
B00AW57L96|5.0|This was a really gripping story that had the stories of a number of women intertwined.  I enjoyed the various twists and turns that it took.  It was set on the north shore in Sydney (Australia), generally around families at a Catholic Parish school and the story seemed to reflect the values of that area. I would certainly recommend it.
B004YD1KTO|4.0|This is the second Rosamund Lupton novel I have read and was somewhat different to the first, the other one being Sister, which I also enjoyed.  This book had elements of a thriller - who dunnit and why? - but was told from a unique perspective, that is, the victims of the misadventure.  I found it to be an imaginative approach.  The characters were well developed and the plot had strong story lines.  It was quite sad but made for good reading.
B009C7JS14|3.0|This does very well for the day's weather.  But you can't get a 5 day forecast when planning ahead for a trip.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Awesome flick! Zombies, tense action-packed movie. Plenty of biting, blood &  on the edge of your seat thriller/ scary tense zombie film. Brad Pitt-Ill watch him fight the wards of the undead all day!!!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I do believe that this is one of the best functional applications I have ever installed from the  Amazon Appstore.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I really enjoyed this Liane Moriarty book.  I've read a few of hers and this would be one of my favourite.  She managed to make the characters and their issues very real, and is able to draw the reader into their lives.  There is an element of mystery involved, concerning a secret the husband has been keeping and which is discovered by his wife early on in the book.  This story talks of the way the wife copes with knowing her husband's secret.
0060589280|5.0|Everyone should read this book, its amazing! From the begining to the very end,it was exceptional. Pablo Coehlo is outstanding!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was very well written, it has a very interesting setting and I really liked how all the characters and their relationships develop.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I loved this game. I only played the demo but that was enough to get me hooked. I recommend this to anyone who loves card games, especially to people who have already played Magic: The Gathering.
0937381888|5.0|Look no further. Everyone suggests this book for a reason. It's the best book to read if you're really trying to get into this and understand what you're doing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The puzzles range from 5x5 boards to over 11x11 with easy to very tricky boards.  Sometimes the solution can look simple until you find the dot that was surrounded totally by accident.  I've had boards finished in seconds and boards that took over 5 minutes.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Very action packed. It is very different from the movie, the book is much better. If you read the first book you get hooked so you have to read the rest
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I could not put  it down!  Dan Brown does it again.  Love all the word origins  it explains from our past.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Mesmerizing!  You are in the attic of your house going through some storage items.  Inadvertedly, you topple one of the shoeboxes containing old tax information.  Yes, you swear because shoeboxes are your husband's preferred method of filing old tax forms.  As you are placing the items back in the shoebox you find a letter addressed to you in your husband's writing...to be opened in the event of his death.  What do you do?  Do you open it?  Do you respect his privacy and try to ignore it?  Do you confront your husband?<br />This amazing book is like watching individual pieces of a puzzle that seemingly do not belong together, slowly and surely define themselves as they move into position to create the final picture.  Unrelated events eerily become significant and help draw out the final picture as you the reader can visualize what the outcome will be.  You watch in horror as you realize where the plot is going and unable to stop the horror that is about to happen.<br />Lives are changed forever.  Some for the better, some are purged of the old guilt to be saddled with new remorse.<br />I would recommend this outstanding work of literary fiction to anyone who enjoys a good suspense story.
B007JNWJMI|5.0|I love  this app. It is almost worth every penny. One thing ok it I  not the app it is the price. It should be $1.99 but it is still a great app. One of the best picture playing apps ever. If you are willing to pay $4 then I encourage you to get this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is awesome. I love playing and seeing the amount of enjoyment my minion has when he is flying on Fluffy. My only complaints are that a lot of the time, I lag badly into losing, or the game will freeze and close altogether. I don't know if it is just my device or not, but if you could, try and fix it if you can, please.
B000W9EOEC|4.0|It's not much more that could've been done with this, but i only can give it 4 stars because if the missing track that seems to me to be the best track on the whole experience, But other than that it's truely amazing.
0385743564|3.0|I am a Brandon Sanderson fan.  I really liked the [[ASIN:076536543X Mistborn Trilogy]].  I loved the [[ASIN:0765368544 The Alloy of Law]] (the standalone book that takes place 300 years after Mistborn).  I was excited to see that he was throwing his hat into the YA ring.  I had to read it.  Now I wonder what makes YA, YA.  For Mistborn fans, I was concerned that his Epics would just be the Steel Inquisitors repackaged for a new generation of readers.  They weren't that at all.  They were incredible and I loved how they were conceptualized.  I love Mr. Sanderson's creativity...but the execution here fell a little flat.  The Epics were engaging and I would love to read more about them.  This book is about a young man, David, who has spent his life obsessed with revenge against the Epic who killed his father.  That Epic happens to be the most powerful of them all.<br /><br />David is an 18-year-old orphan who has compulsively studied every weapon, every Epic and the only organization that opposes them.  This book was Young Adult because David is 18 and two out of every three thoughts he has through the book are how awkward he is and how much of a crush he has another character in the book.  I really feel that this story would have been more compelling had he written it for adults.  And it probably doesn't help that I read this book at the same time I was reading the Rising Stars series by J. Michael Straczynski ([[ASIN:1582401721 book1]], [[ASIN:1582402264 book 2]], [[ASIN:1582404917 book 3]]), which is a very similar concept, but a story that I enjoyed much more.<br /><br />Now, with that criticism, this is book 1 of 3.  I am committed to reading book 2.  I have faith in this author.  I am curious to see where this thing goes.
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|You can only get to play like 7-8 levels before you are forced to buy the full game in order to play more, Which really sucks because it came off as a free game and not on you are suppose to pay for. That being said, It's a solid game overall but it would not be one worth buying.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I am really enjoying &#34;Night Visions&#34;!!!  Most groups &#34;sound the same&#34; on just about every song, but not on this album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best thing ever for school if you can go on your electronic you can us it US it
B00F91SCXC|4.0|This movie changed my life. This is by far the best zombie movie starring Brad Pitt and named World War Z ever. This movie makes me want to be a zombie. The only thing that could have made this movie better was if the zombies could also dance. And they would have been krumping to all the latest songs. That would have been tight, yo.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|The most important part...my two sons LOVE IT!!  I can't wait to give this to them for Christmas. I showed my 3 1/2 yr old and my 18month old the trailer the night before and they were glued to the TV. I took my 3 1/2 year old to see it the next day. It was only his second movie theater experience--the first was the most recent Ice Age movie and we left because he could care less about Ice Age. But he knows the Cars movies by heart, and he can relate to them. He sat through the entire movie, quietly, enthralled in it! I didn't take the little one because I was afraid he wouldn't be able to sit through it-- I wish I would have. Now they both love anything related to Planes. Lil one asks EVERY DAY to watch the trailer on my phone--over, and over, and over! I love to hear him try to say \\"Chupacabra\\"! Oldest got to actually build Chupacabra at Lowe's Build and Grow clinic. \\"Chupe\\" has flown many miles since! AWESOME kids movie! I just wish I could get it today!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Anthony Ryan tells a fine tale.  I found myself enjoying  the world he created. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good solid read.
B00FA5MU58|5.0|Through the Never is a rare album that is both a live performance and the soundtrack to a movie.  Unlike many live recordings, this one has excellent sound quality.  It spans the Metallica catalog (with the exception of Load and St. Anger), and I like the songs that they selected.  James Hetfield is dead on with his vocals and as MC.  He has a modest amount of crowd banter for a live album, and this avoids the common mistake of lead singer rants/monologues between songs.  They also manage to keep the crowd sing-alongs to an amount that doesn't distract.  Both of these aspects act as seasonings rather than main ingredients - nicely done!<br /><br />The foursome delivers great performances for the most part.  Rob and Lars lay the foundation on some of the most forceful renditions of classics \\"And Justice For All\\", \\"Master Of Puppets\\", and \\"Battery\\" that have been heard in a long time.  James vocals throughout are as good as they've ever been.  I can only offer the smallest of criticisms.  Kirk seems to get off to a bit of a slow start.  His final solo on \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" seems to end abruptly, and his opening solo for \\"Creeping Death\\" is off in the effect/tone.  He also seemed to be hanging on trying to keep it together until the transition.  However, he delivers with a vengeance over the remainder of the album.<br /><br />There are no new songs or covers on Through The Never, and it begs the question, \\"Why should you buy an album of songs that you've heard a million times and already own other copies of?\\"  That's a fair question, but one you shouldn't concern yourself with.  The production on \\"One\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\" really enhance the performance.  James has great presence that stands up after the fact, and the overall performance is sharp and tight.  There isn't a lot of experimentation to be found, which I think most fans will appreciate.  The closest things I can offer is that they play \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" at a slightly faster pace that gives it more of an urgent delivery.<br /><br />Here's what it comes down to.  If you are a Metallica fan interested in a well-done live album that spans the history of the band, you need this album.  It's a 16-song journey that you will enjoy.  Listen to this, and get ready for the movie!<br /><br />Download this:  \\"Master Of Puppets\\"of an urgent delivery.<br /><br />Here's what it comes down to.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great start to a really interesting series. Once you read this book you have to read the rest in the series because you just want to know what is going to happen.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The headset is easy to use, just plug the usb and its gonna work, the battery last for at least 7 hours and I use for heavy gaming and music os thats pretty good. Theres no interference on a 15 ft distance. The software i downloaded and its light and easy to use. Tue quality its outstanding. Best Headset I ve ever had im my life. highly recommended!
B005DJRD80|3.0|My GOD.  I think this show is funny, sexy, and interesting.  But the producers are forcing adult content onto the high school scene.  If kids are really acting so mature, what's left of being a kid?  This show portrays the relationships and freedom befitting college students, not high school students. I wouldn't let my kids watch this without a healthy lecture on responsibility.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|The new Dream Theater is a different release on several fronts.  The music is extremely surprising and creative; catchy choruses, great production, a perfect blend of guitars and keyboards.  Mike Mangini is terrific and adds depth and complexity on the kit.  Some of it shreds, some of it is very melodic.  Petrucci proves that he stands among the world's best guitar players.  At the end of the day, the album is a masterpiece!  Best album of 2013!<br /><br />[...]
B007MDB71O|5.0|If you are looking for a great adventure movie that is family friendly, full of amazing visuals, and glorious action sequences - look no further. It is such a shame Disney dropped the marketing ball on this movie... it would make for a trilogy that would be ranked among the best. Here's hoping Disney realizes the true value of this series...<br /><br />If you haven't watched this movie, what are you waiting for... oh right the popcorn!
0763660531|5.0|A delightful update to Harold and The Purple Crayon.  A great choice for a lesson on metacognition  -thinking about thinking.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Trekkers are certainly taking themselves too seriously with their reviews of this movie. People need to get over the &#34;lens flare&#34; critique. It was a great movie to watch and the 3D is very well done without being distracting. The actors are spot on for their roles. Bones can be a little obnoxious with the &#34;Dammit man...&#34; lines but that's more a script thing than Carl Urban. There are some twists which give a new take on the Star Trek mythos and create a fresh take on an old story.
140006922X|5.0|An excellent book on who the man Jesus of Nazareth was and how he evolved into being understood as the divine Christ. This is a history book not a theology book and as such Aslan is the perfect author as he has no personal view of Christian theology to defend. His understanding of the history and politics of 1st century Jerusalem, as well as the early Jewish diaspora, is impressive (he has a Master's of Divinity degree from Harvard). His writing style is very readable (he also has a Master's degree in Creative Writing from Iowa University). Be sure to read the extensive chapter notes which cite his sources, they are as readable and informative as the main chapters themselves. This book provides important insights into the Christian faith with more maturity and authenticity  than those who simply recycle shallow and cliched Orthodoxy.
B003LQ3YXU|1.0|way too many sexual overtures for my school age children I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good scifi show to watch with children 14 and younger guess we'll have to go back to Star Trek
B00006J3WH|5.0|How does Once More, with Feeling transition into a soundtrack album? It works exceptionally well and has only increased my love for the classic Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode. I love that I can listen to the music in my car to and from school. It is interesting to hear the variety of music from a West Side Story entire cast tune to a Billy Idol sounding rocker. Recommended to anyone with a love for the television show or music in general.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is a nice fun game to play. I think it is a good buy for entertainment. Go buy it

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game. It provides a break in my reading &amp; gives my brain a rest. Thanks for this free game. Even my 6 year old loves the matching. It's a good family game.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|This book contains many interesting ideas to help you live a happier and more content life.  Letting go of anger is a form of freedom.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|A fun, well-constructed game. My only con is that it is very hard to proceed without in-app purchases and the game could get pretty expensive.
1452115567|5.0|I loved this book and I bought two more for xmas presents. Makes me want to go on a road trip with my dogs.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Captain America is in some ways a very old-fashioned movie -- in the best possible sense(s) of the word. Humility, endurance, self-sacrifice, focusing on doing what is right rather than being comfortable, a rejection of image-management in favor of real character. There's even an ongoing discussion on waiting until you find &#34;the right partner.&#34; The film is extremely violent, as one would expect from a war movie, though not bloody (most bodies vaporize). My main &#34;beef&#34;: if the scriptwriters had cut even half of the massive list of profanities from Tommy Lee Jones's script, the movie would have been so much better. TLJ is an exceptional actor, but in this movie in particular I really just wanted a magic &#34;bleep&#34; button to use almost every time he spoke. All in all, though, this movie has a great heart and left us feeling great despite the sad/hard ending.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Mark Harmon as Gibbs along with the rest of the crew. How can it be bad?<br />I now own 10 seasons and will own the rest when they come out.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Really great movie. Visually stunning and had an awesome story line. Was cast quite well, i wasn't so sure about James Franco since the wizard was an old man. Wanted more references to the original, or more similar characters. Still good though, and worth it.
B005SAP45I|4.0|It is very entertaining and a great new story for this title. You can never go wrong movies made by this guys
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was moving and unexpectedly disturbing, funny, and believable. I am definitely buying this on dvd for sure. :)
B00F91H666|3.0|just because it has brad pitt in it doesn't make it a great movie. wait for it to come out on cable and watch it for free.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|So glad we rented this!! We watched it three times in the allotted 48 hour rental time. We went and bought the dvd and watch it frequently. Unexpected story line, worth a watch!
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|this was not just another remake. the film makers put a darker spin on it. actors did a decent job, I though it was good.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat, not in suspense, but in surprise at what happens next!  Not your usual action flick; not your usual &#34;old people&#34; doing crazy things.  Clever writing, characterization, and plot.  A new cult series!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I have read this book about three times now. In never fails to inspire me and intrigue me at the same time. Many of the thoughts expressed by characters are little pearls of wisdom. They are like taking a bite of a delicious chocolate and then letting it melt in your mouth as you experience the flavours an textures. So too with this book. Each morsel is so damned thought provoking and gives you a cognitive high as you mull its implications on your life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic acting and character development in this television series.  Enjoyed the first season immensely and am excited to see all of seasons 2 and 3 now.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It took me a few chapters to get into it but once I did I couldn't put it down. Loved it!
B003FXXNH6|5.0|Brand new and worked great. The fight scenes in this movie are very good and it carries on from the sequal. You don't need the first film, just the last two. Arrived very quickly. Thanks!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Very moving story. Couldn't put it down once I started reading.  These children endured hardships and survived to be such wonderful role models. I think it should be required reading in high school today and I also think it will be enjoyed by all!,
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Brand new and worked great. I loved the film and it was a big hit with the wife. Arrived very quickly. Thanks!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really like this keyboard especially the prediction aspect of it.  Really easy to use and can make it custom to your preferences. The only downside is that it &quot;loses&quot;  the language packs and I have to uninstall &amp;  reinstall to get it to work. That happens about twice a month. Overall a really great keyboard &amp;  would recommend!
B00E0SX118|5.0|My girls love this movie. My younger one will watch it over & over! LOVE how strong the family bond it! The funniest part for my husband & I, is when when the Eva & the boy fall is love, our youngest always says EWWW, what's wrong with them!! HAHA
159463176X|5.0|Great characters and an engaging story. I enjoy learning new things and this book kept teaching me as well as entertaining me.
0385720920|5.0|A delightful and thought provoking read. The poor grammar actually enhances the story. Quite sexual in case you worry or are enticed by such things.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|This is a very good record and the best thing I like about Drake as an artist is he's not trying to be something he's not. Very authentic artistry and the kid really has talent. I knew from his first album the kid was exceptional, wasn't too keen on his second album but I think this third album finds a good balance with surprising maturity.<br /><br />One thing I find today is that people don't enjoy music like they used to, too caught up in an artist personal life or jealousy over an artist lifestyle.<br /><br />In closing, this album is a great background soundtrack during a long office working session (need to get that report or proposal done?) this album will help keep your mind relaxed to get work done (well for me it does).
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Dl love this game.  yes you can buy gems, etc to advance in the game but it isn't necessary.  love the variety of puzzles as well as the storyline.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I absolutely loved this book read it in a day omg I have never read a series so fast thanks Keira class bring on the books
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|I LOVE this album! It may be to early to say it's a classic but I'm going to jump ahead and say that it is just that. The intro to this album has 3 different beat break downs and it's absolutely INSAIN!!! The track with Jay Z is CRAZY! those two songs alone make this album CRAZY GREAT!!! Although he is rapping about the same topics of women, love and stuff like that, He still shows growth on this album. To the people who complain about his subject matter, I ask what exactly would you have him rap about? Guns, Drugs, Pimps and ho's? Well he chose to keep things real in his songs and none of that stuff is real to him. I do Like the hard core rap but when I want that I don't go to Drake to give me that. GREAT GREAT GREAT ALBUM!!!!!
B005K17RU0|2.0|Constantly freezes when in the radar mode.  Can't dom in or out without freezing. Very dissappointed!  Would not recommend.  Wish Amazon would supper Tootle Play so Kindle users could get better apps.
B008QYT7DI|1.0|This is NOT a Kindle edition as advertised. It is only available in the Kindle Cloud. It should not show [Kindle Edition] as a format for purchase. It doesn't download to the Kindle, the PC, the tablet, or the phone.

B00EPG591K|3.0|...when the clock reaches midnight, the numbers display the hour as \\"00\\" instead of \\"12\\".  Other than that, it is the best display clock I've been able to find for my Kindle Fire.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|So I finally had the chance to check out this movie and it was great! It definitely captured the true emotions that could run through us all if we were to be in that situation. It inspires to not give up, to find solutions to anything that may be trapping you even if you relate youself to the movie with a different situation. The best part for me was when he was realizing this moment was ment to happen to help make him a better person and to appreciate more out of life with family and others. There's a true message in this movie that I think we can all relate to and movies like that are always great to me beacuse it goes deep if you catch on to it. Overall, it was a movie I really enjoyed!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Quick track-by-track rundown:<br /><br />1. False Awakening Suite - short \\"intro\\" instrumental designed to pump you up for the rest of the album (or concert).<br />2. The Enemy Inside - fast-paced radio-friendly metal track. It's heavy, but has a catchy melody in the chorus. Lyrical content: I think it's about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br />3. The Looking Glass - Rush-inspired progressive rock. Sports odd time-signatures that change measure to measure, but you can still tap your foot along with the music. This is the song I keep coming back to when I don't have 20 minutes to spare for Illumination Theory or 1 hour+ for the whole album. Lyrical content: over-obsessing about fame.<br />4. Enigma Machine - proggy instrumental straight out of a action-packed spy movie. Starts pretty dark and heavy but lightens up about a minute in with a fun guitar riff. Each musician gets a moment to shine in this one.<br />5. The Bigger Picture - the ballad, i.e., the singer's shining moment. Lyrical content: mumbo jumbo. I really have no idea. But I'm ok with that.<br />6. Behind the Veil - arena rock. The verses are pretty dark musically, but it makes sense. Super-awesome synth and guitar solos about five minutes in. Lyrical content: kidnapping. Sad.<br />7. Surrender to Reason - classic prog rock. Nice 12-string guitar intro. Fun instrumental part has the bass soloing while the guitar is kinda all over the place. Lyrical content: love and grace should guide our thinking or something like that. \\"Let love show the way<br />Let grace lead the way<br />Surrender to reason\\"<br />8. Along for the Ride - radio-friendly rock anthem. This song will make you want to sway a cigarette lighter up in the air. There's a wonderful Emerson, Lake, and Palmer-inspired square wave synth solo before the last chorus. Lyrical content: bad stuff happens, but the earth is still turning--we're all just \\"along for the ride\\".<br />9. Illumination Theory - the coup de grâce. A 20-minute prog epic. If you only pick one track to listen to, make it this one. It has one of the most beautiful string orchestra pieces I've ever heard buried in the middle. Lyrical content: all the really important stuff in life. The stuff people live, die, and sometimes kill for. Your kids. Freedom. Faith. Your country.
0618680004|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to any open minded religious person. This book  is very polite to the religious reader while it still very clearly gets its point across.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britneys best album is Femme Fatale but this one is every fan's favorite! Blackout is an entirely urban-oriented fun album with sick quality beats. Its currently certified as ALBUM OF THE DECADE.
B002ZG9774|5.0|The movie was great.  Funny entertaining, great singing, dancing and story line. Cher & Christine were great and Stanley Tucci had a real good part with his sarcasm. Some parts were funny, serious and dramatic.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream theaters self titled album is one hell of a record just to start out with, this is the follow up to a dramatic turn of events and mike is now actually writing with the band, so we get to see a full array of his talent. The record opens with the first of two intrumental songs on the album, \\"false awakening suite\\" starts off the album by saying, hello were dream theater and prepare yourself for one hell of a ride. The album isnt all heavy and ass kicking all the way through, it has a lot of variation in it with songs like the bigger picture and along for the ride. The last song on this release illumination theory, good lord i cant even descrube it, spectacular doesnt even come close, the nearly 23 minute closure to the album is one you need to sit down and listen to for yourself. 5 out of 5 stars

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Impressed with how easy this product is to setup and use. Not a lot of features compared to some more expensive devices, but it allows me to flawlessly stream HD content from my laptop/phone/tablet to my TV. Exactly what I wanted!
B002ZG976U|4.0|Great buy and in good condition!  Loved the movie and singing and dancing so after my granddaughter watched it, bought another one for her!  Arrived fast and in good condition.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good for my weak memory. Not crazy that I have to stop to rate the game every so many levels in order to keep playing but I guess that's the trade off for it being free. I hope I get more levels to play.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Even though it was English subtitled, it did not take away from the sly and witty humor that make this film so enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
B003K15IF8|3.0|This is a classic novel that I only recently discovered, oddly enough in my local public library's \\"new\\" section. Well, it was new to me even though it was written in 1965 and takes place in the early part of the 20th Century.<br /><br />I find Stoner a difficult book to review, because I can't truly say I enjoyed most of it - yet I can't deny that it has admirable qualities. Perhaps the highest compliment I can pay it is that John Williams gives one of the purest description of the stoic philosophy ever conceived in a novel. The protagonist, William Stoner, has a life that starts out difficult and mostly proceeds from one disappointment to the next.<br /><br />He has an unhappy marriage and encounters constant obstacles at his job as a professor. Yet through it all, he maintains a quiet dignity that could be considered heroic. Yet I have very mixed feelings about this. Stoner's passivity and stoicism can just as easily be considered weakness. Why, for example, does he remain married to a woman who only makes his life miserable?<br /><br />Speaking of his wife, Edith, I found her character to be less than fully developed. She is close to being a caricature of a female character from a Victorian novel with her moodiness, constant minor illnesses and a complete inability to communicate in a normal manner. Her motives are unclear, starting with why she marries Stoner in the first place. It's obviously not for his status or wealth as she comes from a banking family and he is a newly hired instructor at a rural college.<br /><br />The other strange related to Edith is that the point of view switches to her character briefly a couple of times for no apparent reason. This, however, does little to make the reader understand what makes her tick. As I read some of these scenes, i wondered if Williams didn't create Edith as a composite of several women who caused him grief. William at least develops a happier relationship with his daughter Grace, but even this ends up causing him heartache as Edith plots to keep the two apart. I found the latter to be one of the book's most inexplicable points. First we see that Edith has no interest at all in her daughter. Then, apparently out of pure spite, she starts spending more time with her just to prevent William from enjoying her company. Edith seems to exist only to make William unhappy.<br /><br />When it comes to William Stoner's love affair, this is presented as a hopeless romance (again, typical in Victorian and turn-of-the-century English novels) where the couple is thwarted by society's conventions. As we see both Stoner and his lover accept their fate we can either sympathize with their fatalism or wish they had more spirit. At the same time, Williams  describes this affair in lyrical and (for once) uplifting prose and convinces us that it is the highlight of Stoner's life.<br /><br />Of course, we have to read Stoner with an understanding that it was written almost 50 years ago and takes place almost a century ago. Most people in that age didn't have the sense of personal freedom than many people have today. Still, some of the characters in the novel seem like little more than stereotypes. William Stoner's parents, for example, are so taciturn and non-expressive that they barely speak.<br /><br />What I liked best about Stoner was the way it portrayed university life, including the petty politics and personal conflicts that are an inevitable part of such institutions. Whereas I found Edith's hostility towards William a little baffling, I found his conflict with his academic rival Lomax interesting and believable. Fragile egos and jealousy are common features of universities, as the author no doubt knew from personal experience.<br /><br />Even Stoner's more mundane teaching experiences are described in an interesting manner. We get a sense of the challenge it must be for even the most dedicated teacher to convey his knowledge and enthusiasm to often disinterested students.<br /><br />All in all, I had mixed feelings about Stoner. It's certainly a well written and often compelling novel. I found some of the characters and situations a little cliched, but that may partly be due to a modern bias. The largely depressing mood of the book also made it a little hard to enjoy, but it wasn't meant to be a lighthearted novel. Ultimately, I think your reaction to Stoner will depend on how much you admire the quality of stoicism.l in all, I had mixed feelings about Stoner.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really enjoyed the 2009 Star Trek when it first came out in theaters but repeated viewings have not improved my feelings. Visually it is stunning and I have no issues with the casting or acting but the plot is a mess and Chris Pine's interpretation of Captain Kirk is way off the mark. I don't blame Pine because that's the way he's written. Into Darkness corrects a lot of the things that bothered me about the first movie and the plot is tighter. Another problem I had with the 2009 movie was that it had absolutely no message and really didn't honor Gene Roddenberry's legacy. Into Darkness does have a message and it's a good one but the film doesn't bludgeon the viewer with the message.<br /><br />My top three favorite Star Trek movies are Wrath of Khan, Search for Spock and Undiscovered Country. Into Darkness doesn't break into my top three but it is one of the better Star Trek film despite the feelings of many Star Trek fans. I prefer the more intimate early films but for those who prefer a huge budget action packed thrill ride Into Darkness delivers. Let me give a special nod to the design of the U.S.S. Vengeance which, if you haven't seen it yet, is perhaps the most awesome ship Star Trek has ever produced and that includes the Romulan Narada from the previous film that blew may away in 2009.<br /><br />Into Darkness actually reminds me a lot of Skyfall if you can believe it. From a technical standpoint both films may be at the pinnacle of their respective series. The casting, the special effects, the set designs and the big moments are thrilling. When the Enterprise rises from an alien ocean it is positively awe inspiring. And then my inner Star Trek nerd pinches me and says, `wait, why was the Enterprise underwater?' Just like with Skyfall it's much better if you don't think too hard about the plot. The plot is much better than the complete nonsense of the previous film but a coherent plot never seems to be the goal of J.J. Abrams so fans can either accept it or do as some Star Trek fans did and declare Into Darkness the works Star Trek film ever.  The new series is just a whole new animal from the previous films.  Comparing Wrath of Khan to Into Darkness is like comparing Skyfall to Goldfinger. They are so different as to be incomparable. You can either accept the changes or cling to the classics but I think that to say this film is terrible on its own merits is just wrong.<br /><br />One of the biggest complaints was near the end when Into Darkness essentially remade one of the most famous scenes from one of the earliest movies and I won't deny that it made me cringe. I would call the whole scene ill advised rather than a ruination of the movie as some online reviews have suggested. I'm also not thrilled with the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch. Not that he isn't an astounding revelation as an actor and a great addition to Star Trek but the character he plays just doesn't fit.  I can sympathize with many of the criticisms of the film but in the end, like Skyfall, the enjoyment of the experience outweighed the demerits of my own personal criticisms and a repeated viewing only reinforced my appreciation of the movie.r do as some Star Trek fans did and declare Into Darkness the works Star Trek film ever.

B00CF34B2I|1.0|I don't usually write reviews but after this level of frustration I decided to add my 2 cents. I purchased Magic 2014 before reading all of.the reviews... after all, the overall reviews were positive al I didn't think there would be a problem.  I was very wrong.  The app repeatedly tried to download only to tell me that my internal storage was full.  I had plenty of room before this nightmare started.  Now I'm completely out of space and I cant rid myself of the app or install files because it never actually installed.  I've looked for the temp files for this bugged game but I cant seem to get rid of the memory jogging files it is clogging my kindle with.  What a pain.  If you own a regular Kindle fire, run from this app.
B0095P31L6|2.0|I tried to watch Rango on Amazon Instant Video several times. My setup is a 2013 Panasonic Smart Viera E60 LCD with a hard wired 1.5Mb DSL connection. Each time it analyzed my bandwidth and said it was too low. It then asked if I wanted to continue in HD. I said no and it continued downloading/buffering what I presume was a SD version of Rango. Then the audio plays, but NO video. No video. Tried 2-3 times to play HD and 2-3 times in downgraded SD. Neither worked. I fired up Rango via friend's Netflix account on the exact same setup and it played smoothly. Amazon better fix their HD to SD handoff, compression problems or Amazon Prime is being cancelled.<br /><br />Regarding the movie Rango itself, a little dystopian. Didn't find the animation or animal characters very compelling until archvillain/enforcer Snake comes into the movie. Maybe I was in a bad mood since Amazon Instant Video was not working.
0061906220|5.0|Great book, catchy song. My nephew loves it when you play the song online with it. The only thing I wish is that maybe they included it CD form or made the song downloadable on Itunes... maybe they did but I haven't located it! Overall very happy with my purchase and want to buy all the Pete books!
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|LOVE this album. I didn't know ask of the songs on it when I bought it, but those are some of the best ones.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Every episode is great!  They did an awesome job at keeping the plot unpredictable.  Keeps you guessing and wanting more.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game. It is highly addictive. Annoying because you have to keep waiting for energy to replenish and you can't play it in the meantime. If you could purchase a full version where this didn't happen the game would be 5 star.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I was actually surprised that I enjoyed this movie so much because, well... McConaughey is typically a terrible actor. He is one dimensional, and this film didn't need him to be anything else, so it worked. Story was good enough and the two kid actors did well.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Boring, repetitive.  I hope to never see the word CLAMBER again.  Will not finish the trilogy.  Don't know what all the buzz was about,
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Cartoon characters, plot like a colander, plenty of explosions.  Unfortunately Chris Pine, who is called upon to carry the picture, isn't up to the Zachary Quinto/Zoe Saldana/Simon Pegg level.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Movie was very entertaining. All of the actors did great jobs with their characters. My problem like a lot of people is with making Khan the villain. It would have been better if &#34;John Harrison&#34; was either a all new character or maybe another of the Botany Bay crew like Khan's number two Jachim which would have made more sense in my opinion than using Khan again and using a actor that didn't even resemble the original actor.<br /><br /> Other than that and the transporter being able to beam people across the galaxy I really liked the movie and I hope for the new movie we get a all new story instead of recycling classic trek stories.

B000ZM7VVO|1.0|They sound way too much like the POGUES.And they are not punk so stop saying that..When the punk scene was in its heyday Dave was found in a bad Heavy Metal band called Fastway  and was not playing the Olympic or any cool punk gigs but the safe confines of GAzzaris etc..And the Metal Heads in the day were giving the punks the most stuff etc...They are so un original its pathetic..Running the Irish themes into the ground.Save your money and invest in the real deal like The Pogues..

B004DM1ZQY|2.0|The fact that the game even has an option for manual dice entry should have been a clue .<br />After about 2 dozen games and looking at the the statistics ... there was only one match where I got more doubles and it was still a close match. The tremainder of those matches... the AI easily got 3-5 times as many doubles. While statically possible, I find improbable.<br /><br />Uninstalled....

B007FTZDN8|4.0|On the test drive,I am able to flip my Kindle and view videos in any direction. On the app, it can only be seen in portrait for browsing, and one landscape for viewing. This is one of those incredible inconveniences of many Kindle Fire HD apps.... the charging port is on the &quot;right side&quot; aka bottom, when in landscape mode. this makes it impossible to prop up to view talks and charge your device at the same time. I also dislike that it goes back to portrait mode when the talk is over.<br />Please consider making one mode universal to the device orientation, whether it is propped up &quot;upright&quot; or &quot;upside down&quot;
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie, being it PG13 in all.  I thought a PG13 zombie movie wouldn't be any good but alas, I was wrong.  This movie is fantastic!<br />It terrified me to death when things started unraveling on screen the way it did.  Not only that; but it shocked me as well.  Those zombies are freaky! Buy it and watch it, zombie fans.  You won't be sorry!

B00EDPFJA4|3.0|None of Drake's albums are actually perfect in my eyes -- however that doesn't mean I don't like him. When he first came out it didn't take me too long to catch the vibe of his music -- eclectically-produced rap music with doses of singing. I think his 2011 work is probably his best album. His first official album was decent and songs like \\"Find Your Love\\" and \\"Over\\" had a catchiness to them (especially the former). \\"Up All Night\\" is still my jam! As far as this new album goes, \\"Started From The Bottom\\" is great. It's exactly what I expect from Drake. It also helps that you can vibe to it. My favorite track on the album. \\"Wu-Tang Forever\\" is decent. \\"Too Much\\" is pretty much fire. It's mostly the beat and Drake's flow that carries it however; not completely sold on the feature vocal but it doesn't deter me much from liking it. The song Drake did with Jay is real good too. I also like \\"Come Thru\\".<br /><br />I honestly like half the album. Some of the other songs aren't bad but they would be 100% more tolerable had they had good beats. The production on this album is too \\"out there\\" overall. It lacks a certain catchiness. He brought some of his usual club bangers but there is more here that's less interesting to listen to. I was actually gonna purchase this album cause I was pumped about the lead single. Unsurprisingly, that's the best song on the record because nowadays so many artists are so stuck on doing what they want to do instead of pleasing the audience they have. Ultimately, I'm pretty mixed about the record but it's not without good songs. I do think the album will have great first week sales and that the album will go platinum at least once over. However, it's not his best work as a whole. It will no doubt sell pretty good because of Drake's name only. In a perfect world there would be at least 6 or 7 songs on the album that have a club type beat to them and then Drake can do his own thing on a few other songs. Although it was a moodier album than 2010's \\"Thank Me Later\\", \\"Take Care\\" had a great balance of rapping and singing from Drake and for the first time Drake seemed extra comfortable and confident in his style. He would rap for a few bars and then slide into a croon which was so seamless. This album is moody like his last but without as many hot beats.<br /><br />3.5 stars.Thank Me Later\\", \\"Take Care\\" had a great balance of rapping and singing from Drake and for the first time Drake seemed extra comfortable and confident in his style.

B00AHHODH2|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Waling Club was definitely full of mystery and suspense. I love how the book introduces each character and what their lives are like day to day. It gives you a glimpse into their lives, which I enjoyed knowing who was who and how they lived.<br /><br />The book will take you to Gordonston Park where all of the neighbors in this upscale neighborhood in Savannah Georgia gathered to walk their dogs, jog and of course, the women of the dog-walking club are having their cocktail hour at the picnic table as they did every day at the same time in this historic wrought iron surrounded park.<br /><br />I love how this book took me to this park and how I pictured every detail of the very exclusive park, and how the old-fashioned Georgia homes looked. This book does start out a bit slow but it definitely picks up, and then you are hooked. I recommend this debut novel by Whitehead to everyone who likes a book where you can take yourself there, and the suspense of which done it, and then you are shocked when you learn who was actually involved.<br /><br />I would like to thank Rebecca at The Cadence Group for giving me the opportunity to read and review Duncan's debut novel.

Of course, the quality is more like regular TV- not high definition.<br /><br />This show is interesting because of the even handed treatment of religion and for the excellent acting of Avery Brooks.  Characterization and interaction is excellent.

B003H4I4JU|4.0|Not quite as much action as the first book but develops the main character as an adult. A pretty good read.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Seriously Coppola! What were you thinking? The characters were boring and 2 dimensional. Some scenes were just plain awkward. What could've been an interesting story was just an exercise in patience. I'm sorry I wasted an hour and a half on my life watching this.
B00E6F155E|4.0|This 1987 performance is a few years before Secret Garden but has some of the same songs.  The most euphoric is his version of In Your Eyes.  The version of Don't Give Up is lacking the female vocalist.  My wife observed that within one song some performers changed outfits, so this must be a splice of multiple performances.  Still I love the early PG and honestly not the recent stuff.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I saw this book deal come through my email from Amazon so I thought I would add a review. I had actually just read the book over the weekend. I had gotten the book for free through the library and read it in epub format (though I definitely prefer the Kindle format).  It has been awhile since I have read a book that I devoured in 2 days. Granted it was a short book, but I didnt want to stop reading it.  The story line was unique and not something I had read about before.  I did not know that an Orphan Train really existed.  After reading this book it has definitely enticed me to find more books to read on the subject.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Wonderfully action packed, beautiful cinematography, dynamic actors and ties in well with 'The revenge of Khan'.  Absolutely loved it.  Of course like many star trek fans I do not like the addition of little star wars details (rtd2 makes a very brief appearance that you only notice if your looking) but I could overlook that.  Excellent movie!!!!<br /><br />I love it that a franchise that started out in the 60's is still gaining traction.  Long live the Federation!
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Not entertaining at all. We tried to get into it, but out of the 4 of us trying to watch it, nobody wanted to continue.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Superb follow up. Part of the best fantasy series I've ever read. Incredibly detailed characters and a nicely snaking plot line.  Hard to put down.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This is one you really need to pay attention to. It grabs you right away. We should have watched it again because I'm sure there is a lot we missed.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great tool that gets employed on a daily basis. I love it. No problems figuring out the various features. Easy decision to make when it costs so little and keeps me on track.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product does what it says it does -- with the following qualifications.  On my Nexus 7, Netflix will not stream.  Not sure if this is a Nexus 7, android Netflix app, or Chromecast thing.  All works fine on my first generation iPad.  Have not tested on my phone.  Recommended.
B0026772N8|5.0|I read and reread this book over thirty years ago. I recently downloaded it to my Kindle to tie up some loose ends I had with it's premises. Good read. I went to the last third of the book where the conclusions are drawn. Wow! Thirty years ago I agreed with him but now I don't. I'm not going to tell you why because it'll ruin your own experience. This book, while being complete unto itself, is a beautiful introduction to ultimate reality as seen through the lens of many great thinkers. Take it as far as you want. IMHO this book is a classic. Truly original (if anything is)approachable and provocative. I sincerely recommend it.
1439153663|3.0|Though I did stick it out, I wasn't sure I was going to see it all the way through-it didn't read like a novel so much as a comprehensive pitch for a historical soap opera. Way too many minor characters to keep track of - or not - predictable plot twists, heavy on the melodrama. The author interview at the conclusion of the e-book did elevate my opinion somewhat, if not of the work itself, of the process she went through and the author's good intentions.<br /><br />The narrative of the Irish indentured servant was the only original voice, whether it was at all authentic I couldn't say but it did bring a fairly unique perspective to the story. It is certainly worth acknowledging that not only Africans and their descendants were bought and sold like livestock in our country's shameful past.<br /><br />Might make a decent book club choice though, not only because of the historical setting and subject matter but also because there seems to be some strong feelings - pro and con- among the reviews, and our group has found that books that polarize readers often make for the best discussions.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My three year old grandson,Cosmo,LOVES this movie and anything in the universe related to it! Take it from the expert (kids)it's a five star.
B005DJREJS|5.0|My daughter introduced me to this show and I was hooked.  It was &#34;AWKWARD&#34; and it got all the drama and moments of high school with great writing and funny characters.  I stayed up way too late watching and now I tell all my parent friends with high schoolers to watch this show.  Good entertainment.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Fairly clear directions but I'll admit that I've not put a book into Kindle yet. However, if I took the time I believe I could, and I'm not an IT person.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Enjoyed didn't want it to stop.  Wish there was more substance to it before the ending.  Wouldn't mind seeing an adult version.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Cecelia's story drugged on too much in the beginning but I did eventually become captivated by the characters and the storyline. I feel a bit depressed after finishing the novel but it does run parallel to real human life and relationships. I wish the epilogue would have given more incite to Tess's husbands thoughts and would he really rather secretly be with Felicity. I recommend this book....a different read with complex storylines.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed it a ton, can't wait for the house of hades!I bet it'll be great!!!<br />Also looking forward for the next Kane chronicles book,
B008200LHW|5.0|Used with Streets and Trips 2013.  In a two day trip in New England, it never lost track.  I was surprised when there was no report of of losing track even in a tunnel, probably because of map software design.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Very suspenseful action movie right from the start. I didn't think it was scary but it's a good pick for a movie night.
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I heard many good thing about this new singer and they were right this singer has a beautiful voice and a different one. I liked all her songs.
B00AHSLU2C|4.0|Great movie for kids and adults. All who viewed enjoyed.<br />An easy experience to rent and view.<br />Will use Amazon again to rent a movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am only on level 4 right now but so far I love it! I'm not very bright so I'm sure I'll get stuck soon!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just an outstanding book, one of those \\"very best\\" books that you come across once a year, or so.  Like the Kite Runner, this one is absolutely terrific.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I heard a lot of reviews about this movie being a bomb, including the ones here on Amazon. However, I am the type of person that likes to judge for myself. So, with an all star African-American cast of Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Zoe Kravitz and Black British actress Sophie Okonedo, a new genre of sci-fi has been released. Like most movies, in particular sci-fi, there is a slow introduction to the plot but once this movie takes off, it certainly keeps you engaged.<br /><br />To begin, this movie is about a family, specifically a father and son relationship that is greatly affected by the loss of a daughter (Zoe Kravitz) by an alien, who killed her while protecting her little brother. This takes a toll on the whole family but especially Will Smith a general and Zoe Kravitz's brother Jaden Smith a wannabe ranger/soldier.<br /><br />After a return from a mission, Will thinks about retiring but his wife suggests he take their son on a training mission to bond. However, the bonding doesn't quite go as plan when their spaceship crashes on old Earth, leaving Will Smith temporarily disabled, a dead crew, a creature loose, leaving a son as the heroine to save his father and himself by locating a the ship's rescue beacon to get help.<br /><br />However,this beacon is not nearby but in the ships wreakage across the planet. This means, Jaden will have to face his fears and set aside all blame from his sister's death and find the beacon despite the dangers. It's definitely a good watch, just like any other sci-fi and probably can be considered more like the Family Robinson in outer space.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I am pretty much obsessed with this, as I've been listening to it on repeat many times since I purchased it. I was disheartened when I heard the first single, &#34;This doesn't sound like Fall Out Boy.&#34; They proved you don't have to use the same formula over and over to be successful. Now I realize this does sound like Fall Out Boy, and Fall Out Boy is a can do-no-wrong Rock and Roll chameleon.<br /><br />Can't get enough.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Chaplin's life was very admirable and the movie was built in such a fascinating way that it really transported me to the space and time intended. Love the shorts from his movies too.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Very captive reading. Lisa Gardner at her usual best, keeping the reader guessing constantly. She paints characters with a broad spectrum and then intensifies them when it counts the most.  She is an excellent fiction writer and this is one of her best novels yet.<br /><br />Joel Lewis
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great album Love how Drake balanced R&B and Hip Hop in this album definetly a must buy. I been listening to the album none stop the tracks are really good and smooth put you in a zone
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Its a slow start but definitely a good read.  the book is much better than the movie and explains more.
B0041O40EI|5.0|This is a really great educational puzzle that I enjoyed myself too (41). However, it is a little boring for 12 years old, but I am taking it from the positive site as it helps developing patience. It helps particularly if you are planning to travel to London, providing you are not a Londoner :)
B001NLL93W|4.0|Initially when I first began this series I heard that there were more than three books...I was hesitant to start another book series again but this was a fast read.  Although there are more books to read in the series I feel that this book gives you the ending you need and take a little break
B00915G6WQ|2.0|I hate Showtime choice to have episodes of their own shows as special feature. Ok they want us to watch and buy the other.<br />But if they want us to buy DVD or Bluray, it's a minimum to produce making of, bloopers, etc... !<br />For exemple The Tudors DVDs have a lot of additional content. That's worth the price. Here.. nothing....<br /><br />Regarding the season, it's ten times better than season 5, 6 and 8, but not as good as the first one !
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I loved this book and the whole series.  Yes it was young adult but there were some twists which I never expected.  You were always rooting for the hero and heroine.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|With the Two, Antec has taken one of the best mid tower cases on the market and made it even better. Added rear exhaust and PSU fan filter make for way cooler temps and use of ALL 120mm fans. Which are the only ones you can get to not make a ton of noise imo.  This case is amazing. Fits GTX460 or 660 and also fits Cooler Master 212 but push/pull might be too crowded for the corner where the two antec fans sit. Giant dust cover in front keeps the cat hair out. Have to order one yourself for the side intake for gpu's, which is the only downside and NOT enough to lose a start, or even a point on the star. GET THIS CASE AND LOVE IT.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|Very good movie that makes you think. Also keeps you on the edge of your seat. Definately a must see syfy. Love the filming technique. Acting was very good and convincing.
B007XNTDPA|5.0|Engaging, likeable character in Theo. Dialogue and story flow well, making for an easy,light and fun read.<br />Look forward to more in the series, though hopefully will less repetition.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Well produced and very good cinematography on board makes this film very good. The story has a good lead but a very prodictable ending. Part two will be a must see adventure, if for no other reason, the stars make the film.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am not disappointed I read this book, but the story line did become unbelievable.  The ending did seem to just drop off as well
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Very good syfy and fantastic graphics. Nothing mediocre about this film. Definately left the door open for a second film.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Like the title says. You bored and want to have fun killing time? Get this app. You'll kill that time so fast you won't believe it.
B003R0LBVW|3.0|Not the best I've read, a bit depressing and slow at times.  Still finished it, but could have put it down at any point.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|I admit that I had never heard of Murakami until I began to see ads and reviews for 1Q84. I decided to start with an earlier work. I got about 25% of the way through Kafka on the Shore, trying to decide if I liked it or not. Then it didn't matter, because I couldn't stop reading. I'm a big fan of Vonnegut, Brautigan and Bukowski, but I had never read anything like this. After about two more chapters, he made my all time fave list. This guy can WRITE. The dreamlike quality and skillful storytelling lure you into a false sense of sparkly fun, but this guy is dead serious about fiction.<br />I can only wonder,,, if it is this good in translation, how sublime must it be in his original Japanese.<br />Now I have to buy Rosetta Stone software...
B007HUD6OS|5.0|So nice to have a page turner that has no sex acts to bore the reader. Thanks to friend Carolyn F. for suggesting that I read it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I have dialysis three times a week, and tons of Dr. appointments, so I need an alarm clock that works well for this heavy sleeper. My alarm clock is the best. I like that I have such a wide variety of sounds to choose from, as well as the ability to use my own songs. I love the sleep timer. I love the ability to have unlimited alarms. Nice and loud, just like I need it to be. And I adore the choices of clock faces. I just wish there were more choices for the fun of it. The weather addition is a nice touch, too. In all, I'm very impressed with this alarm!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Yes, this really is the worst Star Trek movie of all time.  It felt like a Star Wars or a comic book superhero movie.  It did not feel like Star Trek, either Classic, Next Gen, movies, or anything.<br />Yeah, it made money but it's not Star Trek.<br /><br />There are plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.  It is all slam bang action.  No time is taken to develop any drama.  Some references to the alternate timeline work, others including a meant-to-be-touching scene are lame recycling of earlier movies.  One could see the ending trick coming 20 minutes in advance which destroyed all drama and suspense.<br /><br />I liked the first JJ Abrams movie and went along with the juvenile, messed-up Kirk and the alternate timeline.  They could have grown the juvenile Kirk into his real character. It is simply unbelievable that this character would be in command of a starship. And, the crying?  Come on!<br /><br />The movie is utterly lacking in originality.  The actors are fine (except for the Scotty character). Let's have a re-boot with another director and writers who can write in the next movie.  Maybe even do what classic Star Trek did: get a real science-fiction writer involved rather than Hollywood writers.  With their major production budget, they should be able to do something new.<br /><br />I've re-watched every Star Trek movie, even ST:TMP and Insurrection.  This one is going on the shelf.  If you are buying because you simply have to, wait for the price to drop.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed so much this story. All the characters, the story behind them, the discovery of a new world hidden just in front of you is amazing. I just bought City of Ashes and I begin to reading right now!
B002WN35DC|3.0|Un cuento cl&aacute;sico f&aacute;cil de leer y creativo. Le hacen mucha falta las ilustraciones para comprender los escenarios en los que se encuentra el principito.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|For me this was the best of the three movies! Great laughs, good entertainment, great special effects, had me on the edge of my seat....not sure what the people are asking/looking for that gave this movie a 1 star but obviously they either didn't watch it or don't like Iron Man at all because I thought it was a great movie! A Must see if you like these types of movies...IF you don't, then don't watch it. (My review is based solely on the movie itself, I do not own the DVD/Blu-ray yet)
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|I took advantage of listening to this album for free, even though Cher is coming across as a bitter, once reveled entertainer.... Criticizing everyone from Miley to Madonna.... Anyway, about the album.... Just plain boring!!! She sounds awful, and the music is blah, nothing memorable.... Not even worth 99 cents.... Save your money!!!!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Start with season 1 and don't miss an episode.  Can't wait toe the new season to start. This is a great show
B001P7HUF0|4.0|The quality of the video was lack luster. Maybe 360p quality, but the movies plot and characters is its saving grace. Great movie!
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|I just saw Gregory Porter at Yoshi's in Oakland, Ca. Sept 22, 2013. A truly fabulous singer with fabulous musicians as well.  He charged the audience with his unique vocal qualities for 2 shows. Tomorrow night I will see him at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles for this CD release Party.<br />My favorites: No Love Dying....unbelievable lyrics and melody.<br />  Free.....He does this with such feeling.<br />I just can't give  enough praise for this talented Singer and his band.  Thank you so much Gregory, Chip, Aaron, Emanuel, and Yosuke!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down. Read it in a day and a half and was mad when it ended! I'm starting book 2 immediately! Can't wait for the movie but sure it want do the book justice.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I enjoyed this book and immeadiatly read the sequals. I was hoping to see the heroine from the clockwork series in this but so far she has not shown up.  I would have liked to more explaination on the decendents history that also links them to the clockwork series.<br /><br />I would rate this in my top ten of series.
0744014956|5.0|It's a hardcover stragtegy guide. It's gives you insight on how to perform the mission inside of the game and it shows you all of the secert hiding spots for weapons, letters, etc. Plus its gives you a little extra artwork of the characters in the back.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This series is so different from anything I have read.  I really appreciated something new.  Some of the characters I thought could have been developed more.  But I did thoughly enjoy it.
0316066524|5.0|This book is amazing. Hard to get through at times, but by the time you're at the end you are granted some ineffable understanding of life and human existence that you can neither describe to yourself nor to others. Wallace's prose, diction and voice are unreal; it seems every word written is perfect for communicating precisely what is meant. I cannot stress enough the pure genius and intricate complexity of this work; strange, beautiful, powerful, and poignant, but what's best is how meaningful and completely baffling it is at the same time.You understand it but don't know how or why. Simply Brilliant. This Book replaced Brothers Karamazov as my favorite book of all time.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the app I've been looking for. It tracks my Google Calendar and my Google Tasks and combines them into one calendar view. So I can create tasks and see them combined on the main calendar, whether it be displayed on the daily weekly or monthly calendar view. My favorite view is Agenda. The current day on Agenda view is highlighted in yellow so it is easy to spot. I loved this program so much that it now on my iPhone and iPad as well as my Nexus 7. Highly recommended!
0671024256|4.0|I needed this book for my Freshmen English class. I bought it used, and while it does have a little bit of wear on the outer cover, and a bunch of &#34;USED&#34; stickers, it is still in good condition. There are about 4 markings actually inside the book, but that's no big deal since I can still see all of the words. I peeled off some of the annoying &#34;USED&#34; stickers. Still looks great!
B0092G1O8A|1.0|Used DVD skipped what I think may have been major parts of movie. I wouldn't return it cuz I didn't want it to get re-sold
B003TML0VO|5.0|I understand that many of these reviewers are complaining about Santana selling out, and just making this for money, and trying to just give what the people want, but why does that even matter? This album is phenomenally good, with tons of great songs covered by truly talented vocalists, and Santana providing his trademark guitar to make it all the better. Was this designed to make money? Sure, why not. That's what business is. It doesn't take away from the fact that this is still a fantastic album in every way.
030789701X|5.0|This book comes highly recommended to any TRUE Elder Scrolls fans out there. It covers EVERYTHING you need to know about Skyrim. Detailed maps, in depth coverage of ALL possible missions/side quests, A must have for those who have played the game with all of the added content & add-ons.<br /><br />For those of you that have disagreed with the price of the book itself or have complained about how the book reads... You either can't afford the book (worth EVERY penny of the $50.00 retail value) or have no perception of how these games are suppose to be played. You choose how you adventure throughout the game. It is NOT a step-by-step walkthrough on how to babysit those while playing it. So if you have an issue then get yourself a tissue and BUY the book!  Cheers!  :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally buy this minion lover's!!Your in for a great surprise!!What ever you do do not waist all of your tokens because you won't be able to buy as many thing's!!!
B00E6895M6|5.0|I was introduced to Chvrches by Sirius XMU's heavy play of the album's first track \\"The Mother We Share\\" in 2012. While I really liked the song, I only started clamoring for their debut album after hearing \\"Recover\\" and seeing them play in May of this year. All of the songs they played live were catchy and poppy, but in a distinctive, eighties-tinged fashion, and I was eager to hear the studio versions of everything they played.<br /><br />Now that the album has finally been released, I have to say I am incredibly impressed. Every track on the album is likable on first listen, from the sweet \\"We Sink\\" to the grittier \\"Lies\\". Lauren's voice is beautiful and delicate while coming through strong on every song she sings. Having seen them again just a couple days before the album's release, I would note that they are even better live than the album might indicate, as they are all energetic and excited to be up on stage.<br /><br />Although you could describe Chvrches as a more mainstream friendly version of The Knife, they have a sound and style all their own. I would highly recommend this album to fans of electronic pop music, the eighties, Scottish singers, and lovers of fun.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This 4 disc collector's edition of Blade Runner is fantastic. The first disc contains the most recent update version of Blade Runner from 2007. Disc 2 contains the behind the scenes of the Production of Blade Runner. The third disc contains the original theatrical release of the film, including the international theatrical release and the director's cut version of the film (without Deckard's voice over). Finally, the fourth disc is slightly similar to the second disc, but it explores Blade Runner as a whole as well as discussing about Phillip K. Dick. Overall, I found this 4 disc collector's edition to be awesome, especially for those who are fans of the film.
0142413828|5.0|My favorite part of this book was when Mr. H first started to trade the tortoises. I think any kid would like this book! It is one of my favorite books. Roald Dahl is one of my favorite authors.

B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Really great show, couples human drama and sci fi well. Would recommend it to all who enjoy sci fi which does not rely on special effects to cover for the lack of storyline
076790592X|5.0|After my great grandmother had yet another stroke, I decided to repurchase this book for myself and the same book in spanish for her; we now have our own exclusive book club.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazingly realistic!!!! You can care for the horses.  You can enter your horse(s) in competitions. I would totally recommend this app to my friends!!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|well done, interesting plot, kept me guessing and off balance.  I truly enjoyed the series, and surprises it offered in the plots.
1452101426|5.0|Merida had an awesome adventure in the movie and in this book you will know all the foundations around the story, starting from the Idea and progressing through the concepts. Hard cover and great quality like other artbooks from the company.
B000HZGBLA|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies - lots of action, subtle humor, no nudity, sex scenes, or graphic violence.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The writing was excellent, the acting great. You could rely on the fact. There were no curse words. It was not based on<br />People jumping into bed with some other than their mate. Although there was that. Awful scene with the homosexuals.<br />But in the main it was so well done you could forgive Mr Fellows for this one flaw.
0307474259|5.0|This book makes some very radical claims; that pretty much all \\"common wisdom\\" about eating is completely wrong. But it is easy enough to run your own experiment to see who is right and who is wrong. I lost an easy 25 pounds so far by simply reversing my attitudes about carbs versus fats. It simply works. QED.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is fun and it is very enjoyable, there is nothing against it except that it has a lot of advertisements.
1932907009|2.0|Rehash of other people's rehash.  Has nothing of value to add.  if you want an intelligent screenwriting book go to STORY by Robert McKee.
0226039331|5.0|this lexicon is full of years of scholarly work with the increased knowledge in biblical Greek in which studious labor has paid off for those privileged to use this book
0060264306|5.0|The book arrived in good condition and the price was right.  The delivery was quick.  This is a good way to obtain the classics for the future generations to read.
0937381888|4.0|A good book, especially if you plan to bottle your result.  However, the book does not adequately cover the details of putting the result in a keg.  Not a major defect, but this detail may be a factor for some readers.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I can't stop playing this game!! It is so worth the money. I have been playing it for over a month and I still have a lot to play. I recommend this game to everyone.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|I love this book - it made me laugh out loud every time I picked it up! Absolutely wonderful! Recommend 100%
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King's commercial success resulted in his work splitting into many streams: short stories, novels, movies, comics, television shows, children's books, off-beat collaborations, endless series and a variety of self-referential experiments. While I appreciate the energy and risk-taking behind Stephen Kingopolis, most of it doesn't work for me. I enjoy King's ability to tell stories and to inspire other creative people. I like the fiendish cleverness and economy of the [[ASIN:0451168615 classic short stories]] and the luxurious pace of the canonical novels. I appreciate how some of the stories underlie wonderful creative works by some of the best film and television directors. But like folk art, King's writing works for its simple virtues and, in my opinion anyway, fails when it tries to support sophisticated, big budget projects.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep will remind fans from the 1970s of the simple pleasures of unvarnished King. Of course that's literally true in the references to [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]] (1977) but also traces of classics like [[ASIN:0345805879 Carrie]], [[ASIN:0307743675 'Salem's Lot]] and [[ASIN:0307947300 The Stand]] (there's also some stuff that feels lifted from [[ASIN:038076363X Lawrence Block]] of the same era). The book has a beginning that doesn't feel like it was written last, one that sets up the story and gets reader and author on the same page. It has an ending too, not just a kill pretty much everyone and leave the rest directionless because the publisher ran out of paper. In between is a plot (admittedly somewhat thin, but strong enough to carry the characters and action, and fair to the reader). In short, we have here a traditional story, done exceptionally well. It will appeal to old school Stephen King fans like when an overexposed, commercialized rock band throws away the bars, the cars and the wars, unplugs their instruments and plays small clubs.<br /><br />I don't know whether it will please the broader fan base who thinks the novels are too long and the movies are better than the books and the television shows are best of all. So if you're not an old fan, don't start with this book. I also don't know if Dr. Sleep ranks with the best of King's novels. On one hand, it has a slightly derivative feel, like King got the idea of the sequel and then tried to figure out how to write it. Some things that were fresh in 1977 are tired today, and some of the new stuff included to jazz things up don't mesh. On the other hand, there's a depth and maturity to replace the iconoclastic brashness that has been lost. To an English professor, this could be King's best novel, at least to the kind of professor who thinks [[ASIN:1461035937 The Tempest]] is Shakespeare's best play.<br /><br />Definitely get this if you are a classic King fan. If you don't know whether you are a classic King fan, get one of his first six novels and find out. If you're a non-classic King fan, or don't like King, this is not the book for you.hinks the novels are too long and the movies are better than the books and the television shows are best of all.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|I cannot preach enough about this show... I want it to last another 10 seasons, its just THAT good.  The writing, the actors, the producers, the directors, all are top-notch and in rare form on this show. Nathan Fillion leads the cast in an unique, funny but serious way that just keeps you completely engaged and shouting for more! I count down the days 'til every premier, and then every week --- DON'T MESS WITH MY CASTLE HOUR! :)<br /><br />There is no other show I look forward to as much!!!<br /><br />Thanks cast and crew for the amazing work,<br /><br />~ Mariza
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Entertaining read. Good science fiction, drama and pacing. It will make an interesting film. I was happy to take a walk after reading.
B001VU1NJ0|1.0|Another example of using violence for entertainment. Unoriginal story line filled in with the violence, anger, and cruelty.  Waste of time and money.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is a replacement for the original charger that came with the Kindle. I did forget to purchase a wall-adapter, so this has to charge from a USB port.

B000N5F6OW|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  It has action, adventure, humor, romance and keeps your attention.  The added bonus is that it is wholesome.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This story was not bad, it could have been much better. How can absolutely tell this was done by a fan of twilight,..BECAUSE IT THE SAME STORY!! I mean it starts to get ridiculous after a while! But I read it anyway, and twice for that matter. If you do read this, please read twilight, the similarities are insane.
B000IZAHB4|4.0|Fun, scary movie that leads you down one path and quickly tumbles down another! Not just a shock-fest. Loved it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The more you read it the more ana and Christian look like Edward and bella! Im sure if your thinking about buying this its because you've already read the first, so who are we kidding you know your buying it! I love the character of Christian, as I did Edward. I would really enjoy a book about a girl not o controlled by a man...

B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Purchased this for my parents as a gift.  It was sent directly to them and received within only a few days of my order.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I thought this book started a little slow compared to Towers of Midnight, but the second half was great.  I thought it was a really good ending to the series.  I'd prefer to have the kindle version released at the same time as the hardback, but I've waited 20 years to finish the series, so another 3 months didn't kill me.  I'm hooked on ebooks and refuse to by a physical book.
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This is an excellent read. Brilliantly enlightening whether you consider yourself frugal or not. It is compelling to motivate you to change the way you think.

B00E89VXQY|4.0|Are there any people left who don't have at least one live Metallica album?  \\"Through the Never\\" is, I believe, somewhere around their four-hundred fiftieth official live release, so if you're looking for tunes you don't already have live...well, keep looking.  This is a Metallica greatest hits collection, it just happens to be one that was done live for their forthcoming movie venture.  While the movie looks like it has the potential to serve up some teen cheese with the \\"storyline\\" that runs simultaneously with the concert, the CD at least has nothing but music.  The band sounds about the same as usual.  James seems to be trying to stick a little closer to the sound of the studio versions with the vocals, perhaps so the casual moviegoer won't be turned away by the voice-cracking yodels he's been throwing in throughout most of their modern era.  Thankfully, \\"Battery\\" doesn't sound as neutered as usual since James is actually singing with some aggression.  It almost...not quite, but almost...sounds like one of their older performances from, say, the early 90's.  The guitar tone likewise sounds closer to old Metallica; songs like \\"...And Justice for All\\" sound more like they used to instead of having that crunchy, hard rock tone of modern \\"Tallica\\".  Even though the album doesn't have anything obviously unique about it other than the movie soundtrack novelty, it's decent.  The only dud for me is \\"Cyanide\\", which is nowhere close to the best song to represent \\"Death Magnetic\\".  Besides that, you're going to hear songs you've heard many, many times before, with the very slight differences any live performance is bound to have.  Obviously, with a movie release, this couldn't be a collection of obscure deep cuts, but the playing and production are about as good as you can expect with today's Metallica.  Pretty easy to give it four stars.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|These are so well done.  I can't even begin to tell you how much my husband and I liked watching these.  Now our daughters are watching them too.  They are young people and like them as much as us!  That is rather a strange phenomenon in this day and time!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Great documentary on food and organic stuff, tells you in detail the things done behind closed doors in the food industry.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|This is a good mindless love story that if you like the movie Juno you will enjoy this one. One additional word
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a unique way of explaining that which, upon reflection, should be common sense. His no-nonsense approach to explaining his observations and views on what constitutes success are presented in a non-pretentious and matter-of-fact manner, but the result leaves the reader reviewing and considering what he's just read. Thoroughly enjoyable and thought provoking.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read a lot and have never taken the time to actually write a review on Amazon. I have read this book three times since I bought it and I will never be able to quite put into words how much I love it and what it means to me. I will start off by saying, I am not a young adult and don't usually read YA novels, but I kept hearing about this book and since I love to read, I figured it was worth a shot. Let me just say, I was absolutely blown away. The depth of the characters and the story are just incredible. John Green has a way of putting things into words that I could have never imagined - everything is just so beautifully written and just makes you feel so much. I could not stop talking about this book after I read it and still cannot. I laughed, I cried, it just always sits with me in the back of my mind. Please read it - I promise you will not regret it.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Good value based movie. &#34;yes I can is the motive&#34;<br />Recommend for even those like me who do not like to watch animation movies to watch this one.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun to play - simple game. Great way to pass the time waiting for appointments or play during air travel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great little game. It is challenging, addictive, and continues to engage the user at every turn. The characters are great and the app itself was obviously developed with a rich sense of humor. I am not a gamer at all an it had me from the very start.

B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I originally hear him singing his titletrack on the Letterman Show and I immediately went online to listen to more. I couldn't get enough so I bought it! I honestly love the mellow yet spunky lyrics and music. It's quickly become my fav playlist of the Summer. I would recommend buying it to anyone of any age.<br />It has a mixed blend of slightly country, somewhat folk music with a hint of ballad all rolled together and melded into sweet serenades, wistful thinking and knee slapping, toe tapping tunes sure to lift the spirit. It's just my go-to 'ja-maka-me-happy' CD.<br />Hopefully if you get it a listen you'll love it as much as I did and but it too....=))

B000SEGTI0|5.0|I heard somewhere in the past that Blade Runner was taken from this book. I usually avoid reading a book after seeing the movie. Glad I did this time. There is very little similarity between the book and movie. I enjoyed Blade Runner but this book was way beyond the movie. I'm sorry I waited so long to read it. I've since added some other PKD to my Kindle collection. Pretty good reads.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but alas I feel that it fell short of my expectations. I expected more given the actors, large budget and length of time it took to shoot.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small compact design and it works well.  Sharpens all my knives and other gadgets that need sharpening.  Good deal !
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|Great to have a new album by Cher. I knew WOMAN'S WORLD from seeing Cher perform it on TV months ago. It's a good song with hooks galore. The first 6 tracks are all loaded with dance music. Cher going EDM is nothing new, and some of these songs will become anthems, just by the titles alone indicate. TAKE IT LIKE A MAN is another catchy track. DRESSED TO KILL is going to be the name of her new tour. Mark Taylor , the writer of BELIEVE produced and wrote half of the songs on this album and loaded it up with dance tunes, but also contributed a couple of surprises that veer away from the dance floor. I wish that the Auto-Tune effect was not used on some of these songs. It has become old hat now, and Cher can sing and belt out a song. She does not need a novelty effect like this on another album. After 6 songs that are pounding dance tracks with programming overload, and quite wordy as well, I am glad to hear another side of Cher on the next 5 songs. Thinking of it as an album, Side 1 is dance/EDM, and Side 2 is pop and rock. I WALK ALONE is a splendid tune that starts with banjitar [ that's what the credit lists it as ] and sounds like an influence of of I Walk Alone with Turn Turn Turn lyrically with some marvelous footstompin' effects. SIRENS is a beautiful atmospheric song with Cher giving one of her greatest vocal performances. SIRENS is the strongest song on this album, with Cher's powerful vocals, a guitar solo and a haunting ambience that surrounds this song. For fans that like Cher's rock side, the mesmerizing SIRENS is up there as one of her best songs ever. FAVORITE SCARS, I HOPE YOU FIND IT and LIE TO ME all complete the rock ballad side. Cher has said she's not a big fan of her music, but the last 5 songs are more traditional Cher pre-Believe.  In her long career of nearly 50 years, Cher has sang a wide variety of styles and genres. Everyone has their favorite sides of Cher, songs, and albums or films. I like this one, though it's not her high water mark. She's done it all, and everybody loves some Cher.

B000ZMVAXO|4.0|The amp circuitry itself is awesome!  It works exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small package.  Though I might like it better if it had some sort of mode selection so you could get more than one sound out of it, it's honestly a great little amp.<br /><br />The problem is with the construction.  There is no sort of strain relief whatsoever on the headphone jack, so after only a few days of use the jack's solder pads came off of the PCB.  I was only getting sound on the right channel and the sound quality was quite poor.  Opening the device up, resoldering the connection, and then adding some hot glue to hold everything together solved this problem nicely.  Not everyone has a soldering iron with them though, so I'd caution you to be careful when plugging/unplugging the headphones, be gentle, and if it breaks take it to someone with electronics experience - it's probably a 10 minute fix.<br /><br />Still, I'm quite satisfied, so 4 stars.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This new album may not be as 'angry' or 'dark' as most fans are used to with Reznor, but his music, like himself, has clearly grown into something different and amazing. I think on a musicianship level, Hesitation Marks is just as good as his earlier works. What's different this time around is that the music isn't full of pounding industrial metal, but isn't soft and eerie either. It's somewhere in the middle. This is paraphrasing Trent's own thoughts on his album. I have to admit, I didn't think it would be THIS good! It's great. Buy it!!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|For all who are interested in knowing about that phenomenon (and true phenomenons never die) called Steve Jobs, this is the book. Extremely well-researched and well-written. Tells the story to the fullest extent possible in a very engaging way.

1476727651|5.0|UPDATE: The following paragraph is an update to my original review.<br /><br />My review has received a lot of votes for being unhelpful. I would like to clarify that when comparing Doctor Sleep to The Shining on a scare-by-scare basis, Doctor Sleep has more of them. When reading Doctor Sleep, you may not feel the same way you did when reading The Shining. Don't expect that--that was over thirty years ago. If you take this book at face value, there's plenty to creep you out and appreciate. If you are a fan of American Horror Story or the original book of The Shining, then by all means read this book; you'll enjoy it. If there's still something about this review that doesn't help you, then please let me know; it's the only way I can improve. And as always: thanks for reading!<br /><br />********Original Review Below*******************<br /><br />More than a scary story, I find Doctor Sleep seeping with autobiographical allegory. Over thirty years ago, we met our protagonist as he was struggling with his unique and special ability. Under the sole accompaniment of his mother, he had to leave the area where he witnessed great tragedy. Three decades later we meet him again, now living in New England. Our protagonist spent that time seeking further understanding of his supernatural gift, often turning to the dependency on the bottle. And here I leave you to wonder, whether I am referring Danny, the book's protagonist, or King the author thereof. Whether by accident or purpose, I am unsure, but the allegorical beauty remains the same.<br /><br />King has always been a great writer, gifted if you will. His has panache for telling a story, even from the beginning of his career. However, I've noticed a difference since his accident. Maybe it's my imagination or maybe it's a new meaning on life that King found, but his writing seems more clear and agile. At times it does get over-wordy (I'm talking to you Under the Dome), but it's not nearly as ambiguous as some of his earlier works. I find Doctor Sleep to be the culmination of everything King has been trying to become and his own triumphant statement over addiction and pain.<br /><br />The scares are definitely here. Hell, King starts right out with a return of that damn purple lady from the Overlook. But King has a lot to overcome in this story, mostly in conquering the faded memories of his fans. Remember those twin girls calling out for Danny to play with them? Yeah, they weren't in the book--they were from the movie. King rekindles the elements of The Shining (he does so from the very first sentence when he refers to the fire--book, not the movie) and adding elements that are sure to scare the modern reader. I liken many of these new scary moments to what you would find in the television show American Horror Story: creepy and surreal.<br /><br />Besides Danny, aka Doctor Sleep (remember him being called Doc in the original book?) we have a kick-ass girl hero named Abra (like abracadabra) and a group of country-travelling old people acting as the villains. Trust me on this one, they are creepy. On the outside they are your grandmas in the check-out line counting coupons and asking for the senior citizen discounts, or your grandpas wearing funny shirts embarrassing you on vacation, but this is their disguise to do their haunted bidding.<br /><br />By the end of the book, you'll really like Danny, but you'll really, really like Abra. There are plenty of scary scenes, such as the book's trailer indicates--spoons on ceilings; a boy being tortured far away--but the true magic, for lack of better term, happens in the battles of the astral plane. Whether it is Abra upon her dreamesque horse or Danny inside her mind, you'll be turning pages quickly to the end. Yeah, it's a little weird, but isn't that what you've been asking for?<br /><br />Speaking of the ending, many have complained of King's sudden and unexplained endings of his prior works. As another testament to his improvement, Doctorworks.

As another testament to his improvement, DoctorSleep wraps up in a complete and even a bit predictable manner.<br /><br />Overall, there's plenty to be scared of in Doctor Sleep: prior ghosts still haunting from the Overlook, the new antagonists of elderly True Knot, and even the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. But what resounds true to me is King's ability to write the truth of life, the importance of family, and what matters most in the end.<br /><br />EDIT: Thanks to Randall for correcting me. I misspelled The Shining as The Shinning; I've corrected that with this edit.

B009K72G8I|3.0|I wrote this review without including anything that I would consider to be spoilers.<br /><br />- Start out with Maul and Opress.  That part was good.<br />- Move on to the Jedi initiates.  That was a nice little set of episodes also.<br />- Segue to the droids - great for kids, but a bit shallow otherwise.  Seems like a little story arc that they just tossed in.  The clone commando was the best part, but it was pretty lightweight.<br />- Finally, the Jedi saboteur sequence.  Very disappointing.  The authors needed to have read the novels containing the characters they modified.  One particular character in-particular can't be reconciled between the animated series and a set of books containing her character.  They could easily have simply created another character to use, but instead, they messed up a pre-existing character.<br /><br />They left space for additional seasons, but they killed the show instead.  Oh well.  It seems that the producers may have switched writers or something, because the 5th season didn't live up to the previous seasons.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Good, until the end. No justice!  Very anticlimatic. Portrays the worse in people. No redemption.<br /> I will never bother on one of her books again

B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting could have retired 10 years ago and been remembered as one of rock's greatest icons.  But \\"The Last Ship\\" -- a project that Sting has clearly and carefully labored through for many years -- may be the most spectacular achievement of his legendary career.  The songs and the story they tell are not only unique, original, and personal; they are also deeply moving.  Rather than review each song on its own, it is instructive to listen to this album, which will soon become a Broadway show, in full.<br /><br />In a recent VH1 special, Sting said that he hopes to have one more hit record \\"against the odds,\\" meaning that he preserves his artistic integrity while also appealing to the masses.  With \\"The Last Ship,\\" he may have done it.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|This made for TV show best illustrates the Gladiator days and the immorality that was so pervasive.  It is well done at every level but not for children to include young adults.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I purchased this game already on my HTC INSPIRE phone from Google. It's well done, fair, altho the AI does seem to cheat sometimes. But that just makes it more challenging. And it is winnable. And sometimes in real life, the dice just doesn't go your way. If you enjoy backgammon, definitely worth the purchase. Downloaded here for my Kindle Fire HD. This company does do quality games, for sure, as I also have chess and checkers.

B00F4KGJRO|5.0|He has always been my fav, and this cd is great! Alan is good in country and bluegrass! Glad to some stay true to their roots
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really enjoyed the story line. It takes you into a fantasy world some of them dark but some of them you can picture the beauty in your mind how the characters are seeing them.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|I'm tore between a 3 and a 4, so we'll say 3.5 and round up (according to my Breaking Bad chemistry teacher) to 4.<br /><br />The good:  For the age of this the surround isn't bad.  Of course play it on DTS not Dolby Digital.  It's pretty dang good for the age, but I'll give them some slack since it's a 25 freaking year old recording.  Saw the tour this last summer where they basically performed this concert. Blew my mind.<br /><br />The not so good:  OK, I'm not an idiot.  I understand that in '88 they didn't know we'd all have 16:9 TVs.  The latest Dio release on Blu-ray is in 16:9 from '86 and is very nice in the video department.  But DON'T JUST STRETCH THE PICTURE OUT to fit our new TVs. I'd rather have normal looking people and have black bars on the edge than see freaking looking stretched out crap. I have the capability to stretch out the video myself if I don't like the black bars. I don't think it's my blu-ray automatically stretching it, but I could be wrong.<br /><br />\\"Even in my wildest dreams\\"... God I love that song.  Sorry got distracted.<br /><br />For a historical piece, it rocks.  But don't expect it to compare to recent concert or even to other bands from the period.  Just be glad they recorded it and get your head out your you know what and rock out!  Up the Irons!<br /><br />\\"I'd like to think when I die I get another chance\\".  Man that song (and album), has to be one of Maiden's best.
B00701897I|5.0|As good as I hoped.  The movie was great, and the 3D was great.  It looked they planned a follow-up... I hope so.  Great vendor.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|As merely incidental matters -- some of the most beautiful drawing ever made by human hands, some of the most delicate characterisation ever made by human hands.<br /><br />A profund post-modern artwork that grows in stature with every passing year ---<br /><br />you could say, an as-yet largely undiscovered masterpiece on the nature of life and living.  If you're looking for the idiocy of \\"plot\\" as in the 19th century novel, and seen in eg. TV soap operas today, look elsewhere. If you want to see the very future of narrative expression, look here.<br /><br />The ultimate praise: a deeper exploration of human life than _Whispers of the heart_.<br /><br />An amazing - sculpture - showing the human form. I am so grateful to live in the same universe as this film and the artists who made it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I will start by saying I am a huge Brandon Sanderson fan. This book meets all the great criteria set by his past work in that it is well paced, very unique, and leads you wanting him to write the next book in the series. If you are looking for an entertaining and easy to read book, look no further than this book. Well done sir!
B0031RSA24|4.0|This book affirmed many of my views on the topic of religion, and I found myself parting company with the author on very, very, few things. I have been an atheist (though not an Atheist) for some time now. I learned long ago not to mention this in polite company (only speaking of your sexual proclivities or preferences is south of saying you don't think there is a gracious old man peering down from the clouds at you all the time, it seems). I also learnt long ago not to debate religion with believers because quite frankly, I fear that shortly after I've &#34;proven&#34; their belief to be a false reality I will find myself running away from pitchforks and torches, moving house (possibly country) and adopting a secret identity. All this I really cannot afford. Yet.<br /><br />Somehow it is more comforting to all concerned if I declare yourself an Agnostic. Each camp is then secure in the knowledge I am not calling them out, and mutter under their breath that sooner or later I will see the light and be saved/ enlightened. Well. This book struck me as far braver than I have been until now, professing to atheism in safe, secure salons with friends, and pretending to agnosticism in the public square. So much for that!<br /><br />The caricature of the 'rabid Atheist' is often applied to Professor Dawkins, and as far as I am concerned it is unjust. Reading this book reveals that his is a much more nuanced world-view. He does not (for example) discount the literary value of scripture, given how references to its phrases, allegories, philosophical dialogue, and parables inform all human literature. However, he echoes a private thought of my own when he affirms that this does not elevate the Bible or the Quran or the Gita above, say, Tolkein, or Erikson, or the Marvel and DC Multi-verses.<br /><br />The book was a challenging read for me because many of the early chapters were relatively 'dry' and convoluted, as he goes into each major argument for the existence of god and, having proactively anticipated every possible supporting assertion, proceeds to argue strenuously against each one. This makes for a tortuous read. He also has a highly irritating tendency to drop references to his other works (no mate, I haven't read all your preceding works nor have the time to) as well as to several other books and authors helpfully listed in the back of the book for reading at leisure. In an example of the pot calling the kettle black, let me also assert that he constructs some really complex sentences that are painful to read.<br /><br />That said, once he gets past the early chapters he hits an almost Sagan like stride, and the prose flows. He's at his strident best when critiquing scripture or when calling spades, spades.<br /><br />If religion has four 'uses' as he suggests - explanation (of the origin, purpose, and eventual end of the universe), exhortation (of morality), consolation (to those in need of succor), and inspiration, he spends far too much time on the first two. Yes, clearly those two are the focus of most organized religion, and it is the religion apologists that resort to the latter two. As far as I'm concerned though, anyone (yes, I'll say it) stupid enough to think the Earth is 6000 years old, or that there was once a monkey god who devoured the Sun, or that women must never reveal more than their hands and eyes is beyond help. This is the ignorant person that scares me with violence, and the less I have to do with him the better. The more 'enlightened' believers (oxymoron, much?) are the ones that deserve convincing and persuasion, and they go to the latter two. For them religion may not be 'truth' but it is 'valuable'. That, to my mind should've been the target audience for this book. Still, I can understand going for the low hanging fruit that is the absurdity of religions cosmogony and eschatology.<br /><br />I would heartily recommend this book to believers and non-believers alike, as a must read. Ultimately (and cynically) though, I don't think it will make a whit of difference. Those that live with faith will find reasons to not trust science, or find intrinsic value in religion, and stick to their faith; those that are without will do just fine as well.<br /><br />This said, I'm glad I read this book for the anecdotes, for the reasoning, and for the references to many other useful books and scientific literature. I promise this review is as far as I'll go in professing my own lack of belief as well, for my own comfort and for that of others. This is me, going back into my unbelieving shell now. Thanks for listening...lly) though, I don't think it will make a whit of difference.

B001TODCII|5.0|When I watched this movie, I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat! SUSPENSE FILLED!! Have watched it several times since because it is really that good!!

B004X75RK4|4.0|From the busy streets of New York City to the surreal scenery of Sitka, Alaska, The Proposal is a must see laugh-out-loud romantic comedy.  At the beginning, the movie may seem like your typical cliché storyline of two people starting out hating each other and by the end they are madly in love with one another.  Director Anne Fletcher however, does a phenomenal job of making your typical love story a must see movie, from the moving character development to the witty humor between characters; it comes together to be a worthwhile movie.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock playing Margaret is a successful book editor from Canada.  When her career is put in jeopardy because of an expired visa she turns to her assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) to keep her from being deported back to Canada.  Risking legal actions, Margaret blackmails Andrew into a fake engagement in exchange for a promotion.  The two of them then fly out to small town Sitka, Alaska where Andrew's family lives to announce their engagement and in hopes of convincing the immigration agent that they are actually indeed in love.<br /><br />Right away you can see that Bullock is portraying a strong and independent woman.  She is a powerful and successful workingwoman and is feared by many; her colleagues call her the \\"Office Witch\\".  At the same time though, she has this spunky personality that is seen when she is caught dancing in the woods with Gammy (Betty White) to the song \\"Get Low\\".  She knows how to play her role just right and doesn't overdo her character.  She does this by putting just the right amount of emotion into her scenes.  The moment when Bullock begins to see how many people will be affected by the fake engagement is when you really start to warm up to her and get to see her \\"sensitive side.\\"  Yes, this \\"Office Witch\\" drops a few tears.  From her spunky and sensitive side to her stern side she is an all around likable actress.<br /><br />The forced romance between Bullock and Reynolds turns out to be an entertaining comedy.  The chemical energy that emerges throughout the movie makes it fresh and irresistible.  They play the \\"opposites attract\\" very well; as Bullock is more stern and stuck up and Reynolds is more easy going.  Their opposite personalities create a humorous tension between them.  As the two of them begin to learn more about each other they begin to fall for one another.  This pushes them to play the \\"I like you so I'm going to pretend I hate you, attitude.\\"  Bullock and Reynolds have a one of a kind duo going between them that makes the movie entertaining from the beginning until the end.<br /><br />The Proposal may resemble a plot much like many other romantic comedies, but this one draws you in.  The interactions between Bullock and Reynolds keeps you attuned and has you loving them and the movie by the end.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Ok, so I am a sucker for Robert Redford.  But Leo did a pretty good job is this art-deco version of &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;.  I am glad I did not plop $10 in the theater to catch this flick (probably would end up being $20 after snacks and such).  It did make for a great evening in.  It was very well re-scripted, redesigned and the music carried it well.  I would definitely recommend this as a rental.
B00F8L2VO4|2.0|I'm not sure if its just my kindle fire or not but this app won't advance after completing a section. I finished the mann and frau section for German but there is no way for me to move on to the next part. The only button that works at that point is the quit button.  The &quot;continue&quot; button turns grey and the screen is unresponsive when I try to click anything else, then I am forced to start the same completed section over because it wont advance me to the next. ITD BE GREAT IF IT WORKED PROPERLY :/
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The songs were so beautiful and the music was so calming and relaxing. Andrea Bocelli's soothing voice was heavenly. Some of the best music I have ever heard.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|All of Jeff Kinney's books are very fine indeed. I think his books might give kids the wrong perspective of how to treat other people. Other than than that all of his books are very funny and make people laugh.<br /><br />  -Haydn Payne
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We don't have cable and were looking for a way to find more things to watch streamed to our TV. Chromecast is easy to set up and super easy to use! Loving it!
1416955070|5.0|It is very well written. It was exciting. Makes you eager to read the next one. It is similar to a very good book I read by Brandy Isaacs at Amazon, called, The Devil Inside. You should read it.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I pre ordered this product but when I received it I had two disc ones in the three disc set. Amazon was great about replacing the product and now I can enjoy my favorite show ! I have ordered all the other seasons of The Big Bang Theory and I have never had any other problems so nothing to worry about :)
B001ILFUD2|5.0|this movie was loved by my daughter when she was little & now my grandson (her son) is enjoying it! would recommend this seller as a quick shipper with a great product!
B00F35B8F8|1.0|Streaming delivery on my SONY BLU RAY was so bad I could not watch it.  Jerk and reload the entire time.  I got my money back.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Why they named it after the book i have no clue. There are not even zombies in this movie. It seemed choppy and thrown together. I watched 40 minutes of it in the theater and walked out. I gave it another chance when it came out on DVD..a waste of my life.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book! I read it all in a day and was so sad when it was over. It is a great book and I am going to read it again.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I did not know what a &#34;Cloud drive&#34; really was and so did not care much either way. Now that I realize how easy it is to upload and access my photos etc I am blown away. I love it!
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game is fun, annoying, and can be frustrating but for some reason I can't put it down. Yet i don't regret downloading it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My favorite tv show is great to watch. I wish it could show more shows on the tv! Excellent movie
B009YU6FJM|4.0|Surprisingly good. A couple listens and the songs begin to settle in like nicely worn shoes. Good and evenly produced as well.
B005QYKD4I|3.0|The movie and story is okay.  But the supporting actors not as good as the 1st Transformers.  CGI was incredible.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If, you want a greater understanding about the world he writes about, then his writings are must. He uses his characters to tell a story of love, and what it means to love deeply enough to give up  that which is loved for the betterment for all of the characters in this book.  This is not without joy and happy beginnings and endings.<br /><br />I would also recommend his KITE RUNNER which is quite different but just as well written. If you like pictures in words he is one of the best.  Katherine Mcleod
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Easy read, lots of encouraging stories. Easy plan to follow two days a week what a breeze. Thank you. Ok
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and I have no doubt that Dr Alexander experienced everything he claims. However I wish he had expanded more on his actual experiences in Heaven. I feel that he dwelled on the scientific aspect of HOW he shouldn't have been able to have any recollection of anything and of the workings (of nonworkings) of his brain.<br /><br />He didn't paint a vivid picture for me and I felt like he told the story of his departure from his body without really telling us what happened while he was in Heaven. I'm somewhat disappointed and don't get the hype.<br /><br />Scientifically speaking it's amazing that he had that experience, but I'm left wondering what exactly that experience was.
B00E6895M6|3.0|Glasgow electronic pop trio Chvrches have been steadily gaining attention over the past year thanks to a slew of catchy singles and their Recover EP earlier this March, and the anticipation has reached a fever pitch thanks to the release of their debut album, The Bones of What You Believe. They've captured hearts and minds so far by presenting exuberant and addicting synth pop, and their full length offers very little deviations from the sound hinted at by their early singles.<br /><br />They aren't dark and suffocating like Crystal Castles; they make no effort to be highly experimental like The Knife, and they certainly aren't downright crazy like Grimes. They utilize an extreme back to basics approach, presenting their sound as simply and as straightforward as possible. For this reason, Chvrches will likely come across as very basic and elementary to anyone who's been listening to this style of music for awhile. However, the thrust of their success so far has not been so much due to ideology as it has been to the execution itself.<br /><br />This album is filled with very cute, happy and uplifting music carried by the always spirited and adorable voice of Lauren Mayberry. With her high pitched, sweet and sugary voice, she's naturally going to draw comparisons to Megan James of Purity Ring. Yet Chrvches sound is much simpler, as they make an effort to put everything right on the surface. In many ways, it sounds like an album geared toward teenagers or high school age kids with its twinkling rave backgrounds and its themes focusing on interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />Yet the passion and the level of earnestness with which they present the material make it accessible to a wide variety of age ranges.Some lyrics have a definite bite to them. On \\"Gun,\\" Mayberry declares herself to be a gun, and it's you she'll be coming for. Some low pitched gurgling electronica running under the verses adds to the song's confrontational style, while still keeping with the album's by maintaining a general upbeat nature.<br /><br />\\"Tether,\\" meanwhile, is a slow gushing ballad that sounds like a breakup anthem, complete with some spacey guitar strums that washes over the listener like waves in the sea. Most songs begin simply enough, and then add layer upon layer, building as it goes until it ends with a nice finale. It's predicable song structuring, but still remains effective. Although the sound is heavily keyboard based, every now and then you can hear a little bit of guitar which brings in some very minor new wave/post punk influence. \\"Night Sky\\" is bolstered by an 80s inspired surf guitar sound, while \\"Lies\\" sounds something like U2 doing New Wave.<br /><br />To be sure, this is not a particularly deep record, nor does it bring much new to the table. As Iain Cook said to Pitchfork's Rob Cohen, the band aims for their melody to be \\"up front and immediate.\\" This draws the listener in easily on the first few playthrough, but leaves little to discover on repeat listens. Therefore, The Bones of What You Believe is best consumed by those in need of a soundtrack for a party or club type setting, or just anyone who wants to have a good time and not take their music too seriously.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|Stargate SG1 is a brilliant series.  Television has not seen its like before or after.  Just the right combination of action, humor, heroism, character depth and interplay, along with imagination that is out the kazoo.  Richard Dean Anderson MAKES the series so when he takes a hiatus starting some in Season 7 and 8, and definitely in Seasons 9 and 10, it makes you long for the earlier years of the series - including Season 6.  (RDA wanted to work less so he could be with his young daughter).  But the first 8 seasons are all terrific.  Season 9 and 10 need Anderson.<br /><br />Season 6 includes one of the best episodes of the entire 8 year series, Abyss.  It is about Jack O'Neill captured by the evil Ba'al who torments him and kills him and revives him over and over in the sarcophagus.  But what makes it special is Daniel Jackson, played by Michael Shanks, who returns in a \\"snippet\\" role trying to help Col. O'Neill get through the harsh time in which he finds himself.  Daniel Jackson is \\"ascended\\" so he has \\"rules\\" as to how much or how little he can help anyone.<br /><br />Let's just say it's a great episode.  Others in this season are also well done:  Descent, Frozen, the Other Guys, Smoke and Mirrors, Paradise Lost, Full Circle - just to name a few of the really good episodes in Season 6.<br /><br />Stargate SG1 never gets old.  Wish it could have been followed up with a movie.  RDA and his cast needed to continue to be on screen.  Maybe one day.......
B005HED08I|5.0|The Court Martial episode I watched on Amazon Prime is one of the defining Kirk stories.  His main character traits comes through for the first time in a big way.  Highly reccomend it.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Terrible soundtrack, irritating acting, and many more better choices of true events to spread. This movie<br />stinks.....dont waste your money! Just read the media story
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|i really enjoy playing this game. it shows how much you really know and makes you feel silly for things you should know.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Cool concept, poorly executed. If you like things to all make sense in the end, don't watch this. The French detective that argues against rationality is particularly annoying.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Good game, but only if you have Internet access! Constantly have issues when reconnecting at home and says I don't even own the program, which I've had since 2011. Has to do with ads and is extremely irritating. Tried to update it, but gives me internal error and again says I don't own it, even though Amazon shows I do own it. Very frustrating!
B00F91H666|2.0|Underwritten, over-acted.<br /><br />Perfect for mass audience acceptance. Flashy, predictable, good monsters unintelligent story. If you are looking to waste your time, look at Brad and have some tense moments then you have come to the right place. Otherwise, spend your time with quality films.
B001974DG0|5.0|There  has never been a greater Dean Koontz book!  I have read it at least 5 times. I used to have it in paperback ( until it wore out). Got it on my Kindle just to have it available when I want to pick it up.  My advice - buy it , read it,  you are in for a wonderful story.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|I love this movie. It's a must see. I watch it using the Amazon feature and it works oh so well. I can see it ANYWHERE!
B0091LRZX4|5.0|It was absolutely wonderful ! I plan on getting more vinyls and collecting more. Thank you so much. Really it's a pleasure
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Lots of fun to watch and great action through most of the movie. I liked seeing a new action movie based in the past.
B00AEFXLBQ|1.0|Unfortunately I am unable to play this DVD due to the Region lock. I'm really disappointed and wondered if you could suggest anything.
B00969PR18|2.0|I got the app for my Kindle Fire HD, and it opens fine. I purchased a country map (France)for offline use. It downloaded and installed, but how do I access it? It shows that France is installed, but when I try to press on it.....  nothing. What do I have to do?
B005WUHAX8|1.0|the case was useless ....she pulled the phone out of her backpack and the front and back were cracked.....the case did not protect her phune in the least. We had to get a new phone and A DIFFERENT CASE TO PROTECT IT.  NOW I HAVE A USELESS CASE!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This short book by Don Miguel Ruiz offers the reader a foundation in a spiritual philosophy formulated by the ancient Toltec peoples, and has somehow survided the cultural purges of the Europeans.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Now i can use my tv as a smart tv and even on my monitor is it as a tv and with the 3 months of Netflix the cost was more than cheap,I gave it 5 stars and my recommendation
B004XZR63M|5.0|A copy of this classic by Robert Kiyosaki should be given to each and every high school kid, or they should at least be encouraged to get a copy, and read it. This book by its self won't make a person a financial genius, but will give them insights into how such things as money and wealth accumulation work.
0762445262|1.0|I didn't expect it to be like it was at all it wasn't worth the little money I paid for them. such a disappointment for my grandsons room that we r doing all in batman
B00DJ735KI|5.0|'The Biology of Belief' by Dr. Bruce Lipton gives the lay reader a solid foundation in the science of mind - body interaction, breaking scientific the status quo by demonstrating how the mind is in charge of the cart, and how the cart isn't just out there wandering around, doing stuff of its own accord.
020530902X|5.0|It is brand new! This is what I expected and it is in excellent conditions to read and take new notes on it!
0553384775|1.0|I was unable to get past page 125. The writing is at an 8th grade level and I am being generous. The author obviously thinks he is the smartest, most clever person who ever existed, however he shows absolutely no substance. In just 125 pages he insults just about every ethnic group with bad stereotypes that shows a lack of intelligence that makes you wonder how the author was successful at anything. Lucky for me I checked this out from the library and didn't pay a dime for this lame book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Beat game ever. I play it all the time. No wonder it is so very popular. I play it on my kindle fire HD.
B00EU7PX7Y|5.0|It's rarely that i fall in love with a score on first listen, and this is the case with this meticulously crafted score by Steven Price. There are several themes spun across different tracks, which sink in after couple of listens. Last 3 track sum all themes together gracefully.<br /><br />'Dont let go' is my favorite track....Sinister percussions complement action on screen perfectly, ending with a warm lush theme which is heartbreaking in its own beauty.<br /><br />I found it quite interesting that number of movie review took note of Price's score, because score is usually celebrated by niche audience. But this one stands out pretty well I guess.<br /><br />If you are fan of orchestral music then you might find this somewhat disappointing since most of the music is quite synthesized, but rightfully so.<br /><br />Anyways, a great listen all in all.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Finally a high school movie that is not about mean girls or boys. Nor is it about pointless sex.<br />The characters are all three-dimensional, with full, complex personalities. The story has a couple of 'spikes' but is largely a semi-normal year of high school (senior for most, sophomore for the main character). I watched it with my 17 year daughter. She liked it.
B00DJZR4A2|4.0|The exclusive poster is not an actual photograph. It's not even from the Troubadour. The actual photo is the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Had a different story line than the original. Better special effects, descent storyline, and acting was what you expect for a good B movie.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Awesome movie! Action, adventure, dialogue. Clean and good for families. Good representation of the comic book heroes. I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Seamless streaming of YouTube and Netflix.  Initially worked great in streaming HBO GO, but a few weeks in the video started to get choppy (on a 25 mbps connection).  Google still has some work to do on this but for $35 it's an easy buy, no regrets.
B0060D10I2|5.0|This version of Alice is very true to Lewis Carroll's writing. It's fun to watch and will carry you away to an imaginary world!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow. I'm sorry I don't have more of this story to read. Loved the first person voice well done. Can't wait for the next book.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this download,  doesnt skip and my 6 year old (1st grader) plays this.  Good for boys and girls both.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is a awesome zombie movie!!! It has been done in a different way than all the others. Well worth the money spent!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Still have this game on my kindle, no issues with it skipping or anything.  Would recommend for a kid between 5-8 years old.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|&#34;Dust Bowl&#34; is another sensational masterpiece from Joe Bonamassa! This supremely rockin' Blues album is a treasured addition to the Blues archives. Joe's unique style and meticulous execution perfectly accommodate the subtle yet dynamic articulations that saturate all of his compositions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you have started watching Downton Abbey since Season 1, you will know that you simply must watch this season as well. You will not be disappointed. All our favorite characters plus some new faces. Lots of drama, love, mystery - all the things I love in a story.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This album is absolutely fantastic. The epic masterpiece &#34;Blues Deluxe&#34; is a must have album for every Blues enthusiast. Joe's exceptional technique, unique style and dynamic articulation ability are wonderfully revealed in the tracks: &#34;You Upset Me Baby,&#34; &#34;Burning Hell,&#34; &#34;Blues Deluxe&#34; and &#34;Woke Up Dreaming.&#34; Sell your beds and buy this album!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great episode, loved it so much I had to watch it again and again, can't wait to own this season!!!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Great app! I use it all the time. I haven't had any issues with crashing or anything of sorts. Definitely a must have.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Hooked from the first episode. Kinda confusing but I guess that's part of what keeps me coming back for the next episode!
B001GXYBY6|4.0|I've never understood why this movie was poorly reviewed. It's just a fun movie! I loved all the throwback stuff to the old cartoon while making it more modern. The cartoony style of animation AND acting in this movie was great. You just have to accept that it's a cheesy 60s cartoon come to life, and then you seriously love it!
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|This set is mostly great, with some minor quibbles.<br /><br />The box is lush and well put together, perfect for collectors, and the set is a fun, breezy build, complete with amazing mini figures of Doc and Marty.  My one real gripe? It's very difficult to sit one, let alone both, figures within the DeLorean once built.  But you'll probably display them outside of the vehicle anyway.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Plot kept evolving and holding our interest the entire time. Characters were well developed.  Better story than we anticipated as we had not heard much about this movie!
1608871827|5.0|This is a fantastic package of art and information from what I felt was the best movie of the summer.  Lots of great goodies abound in this package, including stickers and blueprints. If you're a fan of Pacific Rim, you'll truly enjoy seeing the designs of every Jaeger and Kaiju, being able to take in the details you couldn't while they were beating each other up on the big screen.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first as I don not typically buy full albums anymore.... BUT I purchased this album and have not been disappointed. Every song fits with each other but is pretty distinctively different. If you like the radio hits, you will find yourself enjoying the whole album. It is a very well written, produced and performed piece of art. Which is rare these days. Support the artist and purchase the music.
B003VANOFY|5.0|After my Megalodons started to cut out every so often after less than a year, I started planning on purchasing a new headset.  I got these on sale for $90 (my Megalodons were $150).  The sound is great quality, possibly less than the Megalodons, but the headset is noise-cancelling which easily makes up any difference there might be.  The earmuffs contour to the head, which gives an amazing fit regardless of head shape.  Also, wireless!  Easily chargable with micro-USB that comes with it (can plug into the wall as well).  The charge doesn't last forever (I think I went through it in 5 hours), but is easily manageable, and, once again, can just be plugged in whenever they die.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|It's been a long time coming for this album; but now it's finally here and listeners want to know if it's a \\"strong\\" album or not. The answer for most people would probably be 'yes'. Most likely Cher's strongest yet. In fact, there are so many solid tracks on this album, that it would be hard to decide which to choose as possible 'singles' & how many could be. Which songs would help promote the album the best is always something to consider. Having so many choices is always better than having too few. There are strong 'dance' tunes like, \\"TAKE IT LIKE A MAN\\", \\"DRESSED TO KILL\\",(which by the way is also the name of her new tour), & \\"LOVERS FOREVER\\" where Cher's voice really soars! Actually, her voice is really strong throughout. She's one of a very few singers whose voice has actually gotten \\"better\\" with age. The only other singer that I can think right now that too has gotten so much better with time is former founding member of the \\"SUPREMES\\", \\"MARY WILSON\\"; who also by the way will have her own album coming out soon: \\"LIFE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME\\". Do yourself a favor & check out her 2 singles here on Amazon; the single version of \\"LIFE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME\\" and the beautiful ballad: \\"DARLING MOTHER(JOHNNY MAE).<br /><br />  Cher also has some great ballads on \\"CL0SER TO THE TRUTH\\" too. \\"MY LOVE\\" seems to be an early favorite for many. Then there's \\"I HOPE YOU FIND IT\\" which is suppose to be the 2nd single. \\"SIRENS\\" is noteworthy in Cher's delivery on this one in that to fit the mood of the song she reigns in her strong voice, she restrains it throughout the duration of the tune, giving kind of a different dimension to the track. As the song closes you get a U2 type vibe to it.  Another dance track is \\"RED\\". I couldn't help but feel like thinking that this is a song I could clearly hear 'KATY PERRY' having a big hit with. Let's see if radio will give Cher the same chance she might get with this song. Sadly, & very wrongfully, 'RADIO' has not always been fair with those acts that have \\"dared\\" to get a little older!! Get with the program 'RADIO'!!!<br /><br />This CD comes in 3 different versions. STANDARD CD 11 TRACKS. - DELUXE CD 14 TRACKS. - TARGET DELUXE CD 17 TRACKS.<br /><br />There is one Album in Cher's back Catalog that I believe is one of her finest moments if not \\"The\\" Finest, that has never been re-released or \\"Remastered\\" in the U.S. and very much deserves to be. That album:  \\"S T A R S\\"<br />A beautiful album lushly produced by 'JIMMY WEBB' in 1975. Even the album cover is beautiful showing a close-up of Cher with colored lights in her hair. I would love to see a 'REMASTERED' \\"DELUXE\\" VERSION with Bonus songs Released of \\"S T A R S\\"<br />sometime in the near future. From what I've read there are many others too that would like to see this happen. Here's hoping that Cher will allow this to finally be released!
0679805273|5.0|These books came in a timely manner and were just what I was looking for. I have started a book of memories for my kids and am going to have each teacher sign these from K-grade 12 and give them to them when they graduate from high school. :)
B002A9VJ40|5.0|I have spent my life trying to be as cool as the guys on this movie. If you have never seen it, you owe it to your self to watch it as many times as it takes to memorize the majority of the dialogue. Live by it, and get ready for a better life.<br />Your welcome ;)
B00EM764ZC|1.0|See above.<br /><br />I had to uninstall it: it caused problems on the Fire; and, it doesn't do - - or, do correctly - - what it says it does.<br /><br />Even if it were free, rather than a whopping $.99, it would still duck.
B004SNC5QM|4.0|Nice simple, comfortable running shoe that easy to pack for travel.  Would definitely recommend to any pone looking for a simple shoe
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|But as far as watching it in non 3d it wasn't as good as the first one, but it's one of the best movies out there for 3d
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is what it was advertised as.  Functionality and ease of use make it great for beginners.  I don't see a need to look any further for a similar app.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|A collection of short stories disguised as a book.  Truly some great ideas.  Lacked depth in each story. Just as your interest would rise - bam! end of story.  I would have loved to see more of each.  As it was - painful to finish.  I would have stopped many times but I kept hoping it would come together. I gave myself the one star just for completing it.<br /><br />P.S. Movie not close to this. Both are disappointment to the genre
B0064Z7RXS|3.0|Rock out!  Reminds me of my youth, before it fell apart for the Pumpkins.  Nice blend of catchy tunes and less accessible non-hits
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I loved it more than I thought I would but it was a tad too long. It's amazing to see the actors playing so many different roles, different genders, different races.
B005MVLI8A|4.0|This blew my mind when I first heard the first single, Smells like Teen Spirit.  Little did I know at the time these guys would be rock icons of the Nineties.  They definitely define the decade, which I consider to be the best decade in rock and rap music
B00CATSONE|4.0|Having known very little about Tesla I found this an interesting read. I feel curious now and will look for more stories about his life and inventions.  I will also use this book for my kids to encourage them to do the same.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|We absolutely love this movie. So glad you got it to us so quickly. Already looking forward to the next one.
1623360277|5.0|I have lost 18 lbs on this diet. My blood pressure has dropped by 10%. It is now typically 110/70. I feel more fit, still fish 70+ miles offshore (and I am 71), I walk at 4 mph for 3 hrs per week, and definitely enjoy life much more than when I was eating beef steaks off the grill, lots of cheese, cow's milk on my cereal, etc. I also wish to add many thanks to my wife Sally for putting me onto this book and way of eating.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I like the series, but I'm glad the Squire decided to move to London, because they were beating the Dorcas/Squire relationship to death.  It's a nice, clean show and I'm glad to see it on TV.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|TIME CONSUMING....ADDICTIVE...LOVE IT!!  However....I wish the scenes would change every so many levels! It gets kind of monotonous.  Also...I would suggest that each character had a strength list.  Just my thoughts.  This is a game for the entire family!!!

I've given out 8 copies throughout my lifetime.<br /><br />To those who are willing to be open and want a new and different perspective of life, this is it.<br /><br />I've studied many religions, but this book pretty much sums up all theologies into a nice package.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before... This movie is awesome, and being a blue ray it made it even better. I had this on VHS then DVD and now blue-ray. Didn't think it could get any better but the picture quality did it.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I was scrolling through prime and saw this movie was available.  It only showed two stars.  After watching it, I'm very surprised at the low rating.  Perhaps there are just too many Zombie shows and movies out right now, but this was a fresh take.  The visualizations were impressive, the concept of the human ladder was innovative, and the family-back-home aspects nicely grounded elements of humanity to underpin the glorified global societal devastation by the un-dead.  Kudos to the writer that came up with the word \\"Zeeks\\" too.  Hadn't heard that before, and it wasn't overused.  This was just as entertaining as The Day After Tomorrow.
B0006J28BO|5.0|It came in on time and no problems at all.<br /><br />The case was intact and the disk wasn't ruined in any way.<br /><br />was perfect for a birthday present :3
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It brings together lots of different yet similar teachings in an easy to read and fun way. Definitely worth every penny!
1885167776|2.0|I respect Gary Keller for his career and accomplishments, but this book seriously lacks substance. This book should have been an 8 page article for basic inspiration on the concept of \\"dont sweat the small stuff\\". Instead, this book beats to death the concept of concentrating most of your effort into one main goal..... ok, thats it?... somewhat good advice I guess, but did he have to waste 200 or so pages restating this simple statement over and over. My advice is this \\"One thing\\", save your money and buy a different book. I dont see how this book will make anyone better at business. Sorry Gary Keller, this book  is disappointing. You're better at running a company than writing self help books. I found this book to be a complete waste of my time, however I DO think his earlier book, \\"Millionaire Real estate agent\\" is worth reading.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I can't believe it's been 17 years since the last release, but Mazzy Star still comes through strong!  While the tracks are fresh, they are in the same familiar genre we've come to love, just more matured.  Priced well, and with Amazon AutoRip, I'm already playing my copy this morning!  If you loved the prior albums you will love this one too.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I've read many books on this topic. Pam Grout's style of writing makes it easy to understand and apply her methods. My life changed within 10 hours, and I was asleep for 8 of them.
B000000SDB|5.0|As pleasing a rendition of Beethoven symphonies as I've heard.  Very clean and precise sound quality.  Beethoven could do no wrong so what can I say.
0393338827|5.0|Face paced, dramatically told explanation of mortgage crisis in terms that most will understand.  Lewis is a master of turning difficult concepts into easily understood ideas.  I think this is the best of the three or four of his books that I have read.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|This review just pertains to ASP. I am a casual Bob fan and like most of his discography. ASP is a nice addition to his legacy. He sounds good here. There's a fair amount of counterpoint to a lot of the songs which I like. I always thought Bob sounded better when there were some other folks in the mix. Virtuosos like Bromberg seem buried in the mix. My guess is this is the fault of the original sessions as they may have been blown away, cowed, or hanging back playing with Dylan so it just isn't there to begin with, but what is there sounds first rate and they did a good job with the remix, remaster, etc. I would have liked to have heard them going at it more to match Bob at the same high level. The Mose Allison inspired 'Working on a Guru' is a nice example of what I mean where George Harrison tears it up on guitar, then 'Country Pie' and 'I'll be your baby'. But for Dylan/Bromberg collaboration this is probably some of the best. I don't always like D's  harmonica, and there's a few cuts here where it seems to detract from the song, (though I do like a good blues harp and Charlie M.); otherwise a nice sounding country rock, folk, and ballad collection, lost to time americana package with Dylan and pals in good form, and an excellent addition to anybody's Dylan collection especially if you like SP. I like SP a lot...except for the bizarre orchestral choral Tired Horses opener. It's also here in a lesser guise. The Isle Concert is very interesting as well. There's a wildness to it. Just got a copy of it. Wish 'Another' plus Isle, or Isle alone came as a cd. I think you can get it via itunes.
B00AW57L96|5.0|loved three wishes, and this one was different but good, really really really really enjoyed it, that is all I can say

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a very good game, though it is a bit grim. You get a great deal on this game. One way to unlock everything would just be to play it and unlock t things one at a time. Or you could buy all of the things.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|As many have noted, \\"Say You Will\\" sounds like a Lindsey Buckingham solo album stitched together with a Stevie Nicks solo album and released as a Fleetwood Mac album.  Not to fret: Fleetwood Mac was never much of a collaborative effort to begin with - even the venerable \\"Tusk\\" was once described by Mick Fleetwood as sounding like three solo albums stitched together. (Alas, that's just not possible any longer since the departure of Christine McVie.)  Once more, not to fret: McVie's absence doesn't move the needle here - there's more than enough (18 songs!) material here and the songwriting is strong throughout.<br /><br />In particular, this is a stunning batch of tunes from Lindsey Buckingham.  These are quirky, guitar powered gems that remind the listener that no one can touch Buckingham when he's as on top of his game as he is here.  (It's fair to note that his game has gotten decidedly odder over the years - those intent on hearing him re-hash Go Your Own Way need not spend any time with this set.)  For those willing to take the trip on LB's terms, however, it's quite a ride.  From one of his most beautiful songs (Bleed To Love Her) to one of his ugliest (Come), Buckingham covers astonishing ground here and his playing (both electric and acoustic) is riveting throughout.  \\"Miranda\\" features a fabulous little electric solo and Red Rover demonstrates just what Buckingham can do with an acoustic guitar in hand. As a special bonus, for those interested in rock music as the direct expression of the intersection of male ego and male sexuality, Come is probably the ne plus ultra.  These lyrics lay bare Buckingham's gargantuan ego; once he's bedded a lady, no other man will ever satisfy her.  (And I thought that was just me!) Offensive in precisely the way rock music ought to be offensive, the song also features an incredible, extended electric solo from Buckingham.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks fares a bit less well, despite a pretty strong batch of songs.  In particular, I'dargue that Thrown Down ranks right up there  with her best work and that the title track is one of those instant hits that she whips off from time to time.  The issue with her half of the album lies more in the fussy production that buries some of her better melodies under the weight of drum loops and needlessly thick arrangements.  Some, like Smile At You and Destiny Rules, are largely spared the heavy hand, others, like Illume, get a rougher ride.  Maybe they're not always tracked at their highest potential, but, if you can \\"listen thru\\" the hash, this group of songs represents a strong effort from Stevie Nicks.<br /><br />At the end of the day, \\"Say You Will\\" surprises and delights.  It's absolutely a must have for Buckingham die-hards, and a worthwhile addition to the collection of any Fleetwood Mac fan.  As more of a Buckingham kind of guy, it's in near constant rotation and I have a strange feeling that this one might well end up my favorite FM album.  Like all of FM's best work, it challenges the listener to reconcile that which has been hopelessly torn asunder.  Go ahead and enjoy Stevie Nicks' mystical romanticism snugged up to Lindsey Buckingham's brutal cynicism.  The music is at once comfortably mainstream and restlessly experimental.  It's less coherent than Rumours, and less gloriously incoherent than Tusk.  Nevertheless, \\"Say You Will\\" proudly walks a magical middle ground that may eventually prove even more satisfying than either of those FM classics.

B00DJZR46G|4.0|As a longtime Elton John fan, I have been satisfied with most of his albums beginning with Songs from the West Coast, Peachtree Road, The Captain and the Kid, The Union (with Leon Russell), and now The Diving Board.<br /><br />This was a big risk for Elton to take but one he had to. It was a performance at Radio City Music Hall that launched him into the American limelight but he never did an album with just bass, drums and piano until now.<br /><br />The songs very good overall and while some grabbed my attention right away ( Oceans Away, Town Called Jubilee, Oscar Wilde Gets Out, and The Ballad of Blind Tom), others required me to take the time to listen beyond immediate gratification (My Quicksand, The Diving Board, New Fever Waltz). The Dream songs which are short instrumentals are a nice flavor and remind me abit of The Fox and Blue Moves.<br /><br />Elton is relaxed, having fun and not trying to prove anything. He is just making good music. I didn't give this 5 stars because I felt that there could have been a rocker or two on the album and that the production, while good, could have been abit better so that the bass and drums were separated abit more.<br /><br />There are alot of topics covered on this album and Eltons piano playing are superb. If he continues to put out these types of albums, he will solidify himself as a true artist that should be taken seriously once again. By that I mean Elton will no longer be worried about whether people are listening to his music, or more interested in what he is wearing. Those days are gone and it's taken Elton awhile to get to this point (where he is again being taken seriously).<br /><br />Working with T Boon Burnett and Leon Russell has also helped Elton to change his musical direction for the better because this was the type of music that grabbed peoples attention back in the early 1970's.<br /><br />This was the type of album I've been wanting for along time and I plan on savoring every note.<br /><br />Thank YouElton!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers<br /><br />What happens when the world's greatest superheroes team up to fight a super villain bent on ruling the world?  The Avengers assemble. The visually thrilling \\"Avengers\\" brings a new depth to the characters through a well written script.<br /><br />It is advised that viewers see Iron Man one and two, Thor, and Captain America before seeing \\"the Avengers\\". These movies provide character origins and motivations that enhance the viewing experience.<br /><br />For viewers who haven't seen those movies, director and writer, Joss Whedon cleverly reintroduces characters through the use of flashbacks and dialogue. Whedon's script shows many layers to main characters. One of the best examples of multi-layered characters would be the portrayal of Loki, Thor's brother and the villain of the film. Thor reminisces with Loki about their childhood, but all Loki remembers is being in Thor's shadow. Because of this, he sets his sights on ruling others. The script would not have been carried out so well without the cast. Each actor and actress were their characters. Robert Downy Jr. mixes confidence and sarcasm to become the \\"genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist\\" that is Tony Stark (Iron Man). Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of the tortured Bruce Banner puts a depth to the Hulk that no other actor in that role has been able to match, and Chris Evans brings a maturity to Captain America that emphasizes the soldier side of his character. Chris Hemsworth plays the future king of Asgard, Thor. Hemsworth is good at being a leader who understands that all people are equal, and he greatly juxtaposes Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston.<br /><br />The visuals in the \\"Avengers\\" distinguish the movie from other superhero movies. The costumes greatly enhance the cohesion of the characters and heroes. Updating Captain America's costume was a great idea that enriched his gradual assimilation to more current times while Thor's costume emphasizes the fact that he is not from thisEarth. The Hulk's face was modeled after Mark Ruffalo, which greatly made the Hulk more human and Bruce Banner more monstrous. Even greater than the Hulk was Iron Man's suit; it looks amazing. His suit has a multitude of guns and explosives, and it really showcases the ability of the visual effects team. The fight choreography is able to build tension and end on high notes that is make fights very memorable. The camera also does a great job of showing the destruction done, during the close quarter and large scale fights, to New York City.<br /><br />The \\"Avengers\\" is a great addition to the modern comic book movies. With the depth and abilities of this first movie, the possibilities of future films is inevitable. The \\"Avengers\\", shows that superheroes are more than just made up characters that run around in costumes to fight evil. The characters have the personalities of everyday people. Also, the \\"Avengers\\", shows that evil is not so cut and clear. The morality between good and evil is a slippery slope that can be greatly explored by superheroes and by viewers in general.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show! My daughter suggested I watch it.  I couldn't stop once I started!!  I had a marathon weekend of Downton Abbey.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My six year old really likes playing and growing the shark.  It's a little edgy with the blood and body parts, but it's reality when sharks attack.  I enjoy playing too because it's somewhat challenging to keep the shark fed and not get stabbed by a diver or zapped by a jelly.  I keep trying to catch that parasailor in the air, and my kids has done it, but it's not easy....
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Kids grew up on this movie on VHS! It  is a fun thought provoking not scary, movie wonderful for our grand kids!!  Nothing like a tilt-a-whirl space ship to spark the imagination!!

This Harry book has got all the right ingredients, although I have to say he needs to get a stronger woman in his life. His latest fling is too weak.... Some one ballsy like him. I am sure there are many women out there ready to give him a go.... Shame he's just a book character. You will love this one, the are many twists and turns and just when you think it is the end of Harry as we know him, he finds a way to get back into the action. Another win for the good guys!

I read it carefully, having a fairly strong background in Biblical and literary studies, and I was impressed by the amount of research.

0756688701|5.0|It is a great way to introduce your little ones in to reading.<br />Has great descriptions of all the cars and the kid loved it, he devours the book and return to see the movies. Great for kids under 6 years old.<br />If they like the movies, they´ll love this books. Promote reading!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love this game, it is the best Angry Birds so far. The. Game play is fantastic. Love that you can play as the rebellion or the pork side. Just one dear back, that it only has the two levels plus the rewards levels. Don't like that we have to wait for more levels. Other than that the game is worth the money.
1401324649|2.0|This is not a short book, but it's also not a long read.  Of course, if you're not really into it, and I wasn't, it seems like a very long read.  I enjoy humor as much as the next person, but this is more of a farce, and, at the risk of sounding like a heretic, I think farces work better as theatre, or even movies.  Think Shakespeare or Molière, or perhaps Forrest Gump, to whom our 100-year-old man, Allan Karlsson, has been compared by other reviewers.  Certainly the book was better than the movie in that case as well.  Here we have Allan, a Swede who escapes from the old folks' home and has a series of ridiculous adventures in which someone usually gets killed in some absurd manner, such as being squashed by an elephant.  Of course, the victims are usually baddies, but then Allan has stolen a suitcase, so he's not exactly blameless.  Before long, Allan and his merry band of hangers-on, who are not necessarily good citizens either, are on the lam.  Their moral turpitude makes them a target for inept law enforcement officials, who suspect foul play but have no real evidence of criminal activity. Allan and his entourage are equally inept, or they wouldn't be leaving corpses in their wake.  His present-day escapades are interleaved with past experiences, which usually involve a famous historical figure or event.  Does that sound familiar?  This book is not for everybody and certainly not for me.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the most beautiful young adult novels I've ever had the chance to read. I can't wait to share this book with others.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|***SPOILER ALERT: Read at your own risk!****<br /><br />Finished with the second masterpiece by George R.R.Martin and I LOVED it.<br /><br />I am shocked that I enjoy Martin's fantasy world as much as I do and take it as seriously as I do, but to me, there is a realness behind the horror, the atrocity, the sadness, the desperation, the hopelessness and yet the hope in that hopelessness, the characters - oh my, the characters - and I want so badly to be a part of this world.<br /><br />My hope is for Arya Stark to become the ultimate dark beast .... I envision her as a little mouse on the outside and a monster of a wolf on the inside who goes on to take revenge after revenge on the Stark family's \\"misfortunes\\".<br /><br />Clash of Kings continues the brilliant story we left behind in A Game of Thrones and it has to be read as part of the series - I know that's obvious but my cousin just said she watched Season 2 of the show without having watched Season 1 and I nearly chocked on my food. Some stuff you just don't do.<br /><br />The similarity to the show is not as close as it was with Season 1 but this is the original work and I appreciate the differences. The role of Robb Stark is incredibly minor and always through other characters. I felt he might have a bigger role and be a part story teller but no such hope. My ultimate favorite characters remain Arya, Jon Snow, Tyrion, in that order. I suppose I should feel sorry for Sansa but I haven't forgotten her stupid choice to run to the queen in Season 1 and essentially get her father beheaded by her selfish desires and by being utterly stupid about the ways of the court and the world.<br /><br />And I can't decide whom I hate more: Joffrey Baratheon or Theon Greyjoy. It's really a toss-up, but at least we get to enjoy some Theon torturing in Season 3. That reminds me, I am off to reading A Storm of Swords.

B00A2H9OZS|3.0|The Riddick trilogy is the best of Vin Diesel's starring roles. Vin doesn't have the chops to pull off something on par with the Terminator or even Predator, but his role as escaped convict Richard B. Riddick is some serious entertainment nonetheless. Bloody, ultra-violent, and campy as all hell, this flick is a solid conclusion the trilogy. Like Pitch Black, 2013's Riddick is low-budget trash sci-fi that is marketed toward the lowest common denominator. Acne-infested preteen boys with cracking voices and comic books stacked to the ceiling featuring topless space cadet chicks vaporizing each other with laser canons is what comes to mind. If you think you can fit in, you will like this movie. This entry's Riddick is goofier than its predecessors, but the carnage and gore are turned way up since the character's last outing. The one striking problem is the movie's lack of kickass factor. Riddick doesn't fight much, instead he is lethargic, lollygags with his pet CGI dog, and ends up in shackles for much of the second half. The ending was awful, but at least it leaves room for a fourth sequel.
0446572985|5.0|Very descriptive writing! You don't have to wonder what is happening. David Baldacci can really build up a dramatic spin.
B00BEIYOMC|2.0|Insidious took audiences by surprise in 2010, with its stylish plot elements and unique ending. Insidious broke no new ground, but everything in it worked. Now James Wan dumps the sequel in theaters to a lackluster reaction from critics (no surprise), and right on the heels of The Conjuring. I wasn't expecting much. A few laughs and intriguing suspense would have satisfied my expectations. Instead, the editing in this movie is possibly the SLOPPIEST job I have seen on film in recent memory. One scene jumps to another with little lead-in or explanation, all kinds of lame plot elements are thrown in, and the demon fails to make an appearance. That last part, being the demon's absence, is what made the first installment such a kickass flick. The cast is the same, but rather than borrowing elements from Poltergeist, the entire movie takes a turn into The Shining territory, with hints of latter-day Elm Street lameness. I was yawning by the end. BORRRRRRRIIIIIIING!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's creative and entertaining. The heroine doesn't make me want to stab my eyes out which is a nice change from a lot of young adult books I've read. I liked the story enough to buy the second book so that is a good sign :)

B001NLKZUA|3.0|As is often the case with the second in a series, this one is darker and more violent than the first. I certain element of the story line is a bit tiresome since it's so obvious but I've really enjoyed the development of some of the other characters. It's more violent though, so sensitive readers should know that. I'll continue the series at some point but after reading the first 2 back to back I'm happy to take a break after this one.

B00D6DVSAE|5.0|It has been ten long years since the gifted singer-songwriter Sting has released a CD with new material and I am glad to report he is in superb form.  \\"The Last Ship\\" consists of songs written for a new musical set to debut on Broadway in 2014.  In recent years there have been several attempts by contemporary artists to crossover to Broadway. These efforts proved disastrous for U2 with the notorious \\"Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark\\" and for Paul Simon with \\" The Capeman\\" (though I still love the score). But Sting's work is the finest crossover effort I have heard since Duncan Sheik's \\"Spring Awakening\\" score which won him a well-deserved Tony Award.  Inspired by Sting's previous album Soul Cages, these songs illuminate the world of a dying British shipyard in the 1980's and this is clearly a labor of love for Sting who grew up in the shadows of the Newcastle shipyards.<br />One of Sting's gifts as an artist has always been his ability  to seamlessly meld disparate musical elements into a rich unified musical tapestry. This piece draws from Celtic folk music, traditional shanties, world music and jazz.If you are open to hearing Sting bring his unique musical sensibilities to a more theatrical presentation I highly recommend this CD.  Here is my take on each song:<br />1)The Last Ship: This haunting waltz with its poetically evocative lyric is a powerful opener, an ominous song marking the death knell of the British shipbuilding industry. Sting's singing on this piece is especially heartfelt and effectively dramatic.<br />2)Dead Man's Boots: What begins as a tender lullaby sung by a father to his son transforms into a rock ballad sung by the rebellious son, rejecting the traditions his father had hoped to leave him as a legacy. Builds to a powerful finish.<br />3)And Yet: A seductive bossa nova feel perfectly captures the ambivalence of the son being pulled back to his childhood seaside home. Sting is singing with tremendous vigor. A favorite cut.<br />4)August Winds: Accompanied by accordion and acoustic guitar this lushly lyrical song conveys the power the sea holds over the town's inhabitants. A gorgeous vocal by Sting.<br />5)Language of Birds:A hybrid of traditional Celtic music with propulsive world beat music that beautifully captures the difficult nature of life as a shipbuilder. Another great lyric.<br />6)Practical Arrangement: My favorite cut hands down. This jazz inflected ballad is harmonically reminiscent of the music of musical theater genius Stephen Sondheim. The conversational lyric is quite poignant.<br />7)The Night the Pugilist Learned How To Dance: This waltz is very simple musically. It is more of a character piece with a man establishing how he won over the woman who became his wife. However the lyric is very clever. A more overtly theatrical piece.<br />8)Ballad of the Great Eastern: A traditional Celtic ballad that begins as a celebration of the construction of a great ship then turns elegiac as it turns into a tragic tale of lives lost.<br />9)What Have We Got: My least favorite cut. An up-tempo choral number sung by the ship-builders that may work wonderfully on stage but not as successfully on disc. Features Jimmy Nail.<br />10)I Love Her: This piece is a sequel to Practical Arrangement. Another haunting ballad bolstered by a heartrending lyric.<br />11)So To Speak: A medium tempo ode to eternal love that does a beautiful job of incorporating the metaphor of a ship that has sailed. One of Sting's best lyrics. Duet with Becky Uthank.<br />12)The Last Ship-Reprise: An ironic, sardonic commentary on how British society has changed in the past few decades.<br />Kudos for Sting for creating this ambitious heartfelt work!companied by accordion and acoustic guitar this lushly lyrical song conveys the power the sea holds over the town's inhabitants.

B0034G4P4O|3.0|First, I had never heard of Tintin before this movie came out.  Second, I fell in love with the score and had to buy it before I even considered watching the movie.  Third, when I finally got around to watching this movie my expectations got in the way of what I saw, a gang of thugs out to murder a boy and his dog for a scrap of paper.  Ideal subject matter for a children's movie.<br /><br />Why employ a photorealistic style of animation when you could just as easily achieve the same results with live action?  It felt more than a little redundant, ultimately just a nifty gimmick that worked well only part of the time.  As for the story, it's a treasure hunt/quest and an endless chase sequence.  Poor Tintin and Snowy (my favorite character) were continuously undermined, outsmarted, plagued by misfortune/misadventure, thwarted by an unbeatable enemy until the very last second when he's abruptly vanquished and summarily dismissed from the rest of the tale.  \\"Great snakes!\\"  There is such a thing as too much plot, of things being too frantic, and not a little repetitious.  I liked parts of it but not as a whole.  There was just something off-putting about the process: real and yet not real.  But I do love the score, I thought they picked the perfect actor to voice Tintin (Jamie Bell), the dog was great, Thomson and Tompson were perfect, and Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) was fun.  So not a total loss.  I just didn't enjoy it quite as much as I had hoped to.  Maybe if I watch it again I might feel differently.  I will say that I wasn't excited to hear there are plans for a series of Tintin movies years from now.

B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Being a Cher fan for over 25 year (and I'm just 35 years old) I was hungry for a new material. As I grew up in the late 80's/early 90', of course I hoped the album would be more rocky or remake of 60' songs but it isn't. At first I was not happy at all, even planning not to buy the album however... I listened to the album for last 3 days and I have to admit, it is the best of her albums. Ok, the dance songs perhaps don't have the 'Believe' quality but at least they are not as over-produced as the 'Living Proof' album which I hardly ever played. Some are really good like 'My Love' or 'Red' - having a bit of passion. Unexpectedly one of my favourite tracks is Lovers Forever which remind me of Love & Understanding with the violin climax at the end. 'I walk alone' another track sounding like taken from Not.com.mercial album and of course the ballads at the end where Cher uses her voice like never before - very fragile. Did I hope for let's say country album with songs like 'Silver Wings' (check YouTube) or 'I'm just your yesterday'? Yes, I did but after listening to the album I must admit it fully deserves 5 stars.

B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Disclaimer: This review is biased; I think that Dream Theater is one of the greatest bands to ever record music.<br /><br />Dream Theater's self-titled album is the second since Mike Mangini joined the band as drummer, and the first on which he fully contributed creatively.  His influence is certainly felt, but it does not define the album.  In fact, the self-title is entirely appropriate, as Dream Theater have seemed to reached back through their career and pulled the feel of past albums together for this one.  The Metallica influence is felt more than once, and the Rush influence is quite strong.<br /><br />The album begins with one of two instrumentals; \\"False Awakening Suite\\" is a short thrill ride intended to be a concert opener.  \\"Enigma Machine\\" is a proper instrumental, the likes of which we haven't seen from Dream Theater since \\"Train of Thought\\".  \\"The Enemy Inside\\" is a killer, and what would a Dream Theater album be without a 20+ minute epic (\\"Illumination Theory\\").  The remaining songs are all fabulous, but these are the ones that stand out to me so far.<br /><br />In all, this is an incredibly strong showing for Dream Theater.  I was rather disappointed with \\"Black Clouds\\", and \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" seemed to have marked a solid rebound.  Now we see Dream Theater returning to full form.
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|Unfortunately, Sting - once again - has crossed over the line between brilliance and pretentiousness. A few songs of the former, but mostly the latter, especially extra songs on not-so super deluxe edition...

B005OT2YVA|5.0|Transformers: Dark of the moon has a lot to live up to with the past two Transformer movies that have proceeded it, setting the baseline. This Transformer movie was by far the best of the three. Transformers: Dark of the Moon was a movie filled with Beautiful cars, eye-popping explosions, and twists and turns, coming from the amazing visions of Michael Bay.<br /> Michael Bay was the mastermind to the previous two movies of this trilogy and has done it again here. Michael Bay has been nominated for countless awards winning handfuls of them. He has found a way to make grown men smile in excitement, and children wide-eyed in amazement seeing the transforming toy vehicles from their childhoods, become their real-life Decepticon killers and earth protectors.<br />In this third part of the trilogy, Optimus has become aware that there is a ship from his fellow Prime, Centinal, on the Earth's moon that landed years ago. As the reason for the human expedition to the moon reveals its true motivations and findings, the Decepticons appear with a full arsenal ready to take over the city of Chicago. It is up to the humans to work together with the Autobots to save the city they love and not become the slaves of the Decepticons.<br />Michael Bay is working with a very historic name, Transformers, and made sure that he didn't stretch the story and ability of these steel robots to far to ruin the image. Michael Bay finds a way to keep these 32 foot tall robots realistic, which is not a small fete. He keeps the characters in this third edition of this trilogy exactly how they would be in the comics. That's what makes this movie so great. Mr. Bay doesn't try to make the movie something it isn't, he doesn't try to expand the Transformer's comic line to fit him, he fits the Transformers.<br />A lot of action packed movies go too far with their special effects that it leaves the viewers laughing because of the unrealistic explosions that some directors add to their movies but, not here.Bay has always been known to use just enough to get the idea across and to make sure he doesn't get his audience saying \\"that's so fake.\\"  Compared to others, Michael Bay films all his own explosion and stunts; nothing is computerized. This is what makes his special effects so perfect. They are all real.<br />Transformers: Dark of the Moon is well worth the time; there will not be one ounce of the viewer that even thinks about regretting this movie choice. Haven't seen the two previous movies? Don't worry, jump right into this third movie and not even miss a beat. Enjoy the Beautiful cars, eye-popping explosion, and twists and turns that Michael Bay has in store.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|An absolutely killer sequel to the very cool 2009 reboot of Star Trek.  I've already watched this 4 times in two weeks. I won't give away the plot, but it builds on the previous movie nicely and has more character depth and development.  It also shares the same level of action and humor from it's predecessor, though a little on the darker side.  All of the actors were great and I look forward to the next one.<br /><br />The Blu Ray quality looks and sounds fantastic.  My only complaint was that there is no director's commentary, and the extras are kind of skimpy.  I also missed the blooper reel from the previous movie.  This movie also has 3 logos before the film even starts -- seriously guys, knock it off.  I was also glad to see NO previews or other crap on the blu ray disc -- you get the Paramount logo and then the movie menu, though the regular DVD did have them.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|I don't know if you're familiar with the belief that some aboriginal tribes hold. It's the concept that reviewing a movie you don't understand might steal a part of your soul. What are your thoughts on that as someone misunderstands movies for a living?<br /><br />Well I guess I would have to answer your question with another question. How many abo-diginals do you see reviewing movies?<br /><br />I think most of the people who hated this movie knew it was a joke; they just didn't get it right away.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|This would be a great show, but all the characters seem very flat.  Except the dwarf and one or two others.  But most are just flat and make no lasting impression and seem very fill in the blank.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|First off, the book and movie were nothing alike. Second, I was not a fan of the book to begin with so the movie started out to be promising. The movie didn't waste a lot of time trying to explain how it all started, but it didn't explain much of anything that followed either. I felt the movie relied mostly on Pitt's star power but he really didn't do much acting, just a lot of running. left in the dark from the beginning and there really was no ending either. Take a pass on this movie and just so you don't over think things, the book was an even bigger disappointment.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Universal's \\"Frankenstein\\" (1931) has become the most iconic and powerful vision of the Frankenstein story in modern culture. Some of that is well deserved from an historical film perspective, but it comes at a cost.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that anyone today who is over the age of 20 does not know this film from its many showings on TV. It's a standard of Turner Classics, and in times past, was often brought out on \\"Creature Feature\\" Saturday matinee TV shows and their ilk. The film was shown in the late 1950's on TV, and it has been on TV many times since.<br /><br />It comes at a cost because it is completely unfaithful to the famous novel by Mary Shelly, and it lacks the nuance and pathos that are hallmarks of the novel. So to watch this film and believe you are getting the story as it was intended by the author is an exercise in frustration.<br /><br />As an historical film, however, it was, and is groundbreaking. By looking at the history, we can understand it.<br /><br />Universal had a smash hit in 1931 with \\"Dracula\\", starring Bela Lugosi. They wanted to continue their success in the horror genre and Frankenstein, probably the most iconic monster story of the 19th century next to Dracula, was an obvious choice.<br /><br />At the time, \\"talkies\\" were a very new technology, and even movies were a new medium. Film had yet to truly come into its own, so it had to borrow from other venues, and the closest one was of course, the stage.<br /><br />Dracula, the movie, was based on an extremely popular stage play (in which Lugosi portrayed the main character). He was perfect for the part on stage, being tall, suave and sophisticated... the perfect image of a Romanian count of ancient heritage. He was hit on stage, and carried it over very successfully to the film.<br /><br />Universal wanted him to play the Frankenstein monster, but he refused because it wasn't a speaking part, and the script would have limited him far too much. If he had been the monster, the movie might have failed, because he would have been coming at it from the success of Dracula and it would have been a step down for him. That would have come across in the movie.<br /><br />It was fortune (or fate) that landed Karloff, a relative unknown, in the part, and against all odds, he pulled off a \\"save\\" for the movie (he is the most beloved and well remembered character from the movie). In spite of the incredible makeup by Jack Pierce (which took about 5 hours to apply), the stiff costume (he had to wear three pairs of heavy pants so he would not be 'flexible'), and the short scenes (he doesn't appear all that often actually) and lack of dialog, Karloff made the character his own and set a record of sorts. From then on, the image and character of Frankenstein's monster was entirely based on his performance, and his career in film, especially horror films was assured. Ironically, as horrible as Franklenstin's monster was in the movie, Karloff himself was a very handsome man, and by all reports a 'class act', being kind and gentle, with a beautiful speaking voice. Many reviewers have attributed the strange attraction audiences have for this version of Frankenstein due to Karloff's own personality shining through the makeup and awkward unyielding script.<br /><br />In my opinion, the success of the film rides on Karloff's shoulders. I cannot imagine it working as well with any other actor.<br /><br />The script to this movie has some enormous illogical holes in it by today's, or any other standards. When the monster appears, he walks backwards through a door. This is illogical, of course, but a great way to build suspense until he turns around for the 'grand reveal' and half the movie audience screams in terror and shock. Remember in the 1930's no one had seen anything like this makeup. Even Lon Chaney might not have come up with it. It was groundbreaking (and later, heavily copyrighted).<br /><br />The screenplay was based on a stage play that was based onShelly's novel. I don't remember if the play actually was performed anywhere, but if it had been, it would have joined a long line of stage plays based on the novel, all of which changed the story to meet the needs of the stage. Shelly herself had attended some of the plays and it is reported that she found them 'amusing'.<br /><br />The novel, Frankenstein, is very complex and psychological, perfectly suited to reading, but very difficult to dramatize on stage or screen. It doesn't have a lot of action, and relies more on the relationship of the characters and their dialog to move the reader.<br /><br />So it must be kept in mind that when Universal made this film, they were following the \\"best practices\\" of the time, using the stage as their role model. It wasn't for many years that film screenplays took true advantage of the power of film in its own right and brought it to the high level of an art form that we enjoy today.<br /><br />Another thing to consider is that this was an early \\"talkie\\". This explains the tendency to over-act (especially Colin Clive's portrayal of Henry Frankenstein). The silent film actors used grandiose gestures and expressions to display emotion and motivation. Clive and the others of the cast came from this tradition, so it is natural that they would bring it into this film. No one at the time fully understood the importance that sound was bringing to film because it was so new. Note that there is no musical score even, except at the beginning and the end. Consider how since the time of this movie, music has been used to cue the audience in on what is going on. It was even used in the silent movies when the theater organ was used to provide a musical accompaniment to the action. Somehow, Universal didn't bring this to either Dracula or Frankenstein, although we do get the thunder and rain effects.<br /><br />Much has been said in praise of James Whale's direction of the film, so I won't address that here, other than to say much of it was innovative, as were the elaborate laboratory sets (none of which was in the novel).<br /><br />This film should not be viewed in comparison to modern movies, nor in comparison to the book. It just doesn't work that way. Instead, it should be viewed in comparison to what came before. In such a light, you can see what advancements it made in the world of cinema.<br /><br />And, if you must, compare it to the earlier Dracula. Admittedly, the character of Dracula is much nicer to look at that Frankenstein's monster, but Frankenstein's monster beat him out over time, for the image from this film is indelibly imprinted on the popular culture. In spite of Universal's very strict copyright protections - the monster makeup has been imitated over and over again, and the character created by Karloff still has that eerie appeal almost a century later.<br /><br />Could it have been a better film? Judging by what we can do today, of course. But judging by what they could do back then, their budget, and what was being done back then, probably not.<br /><br />So enjoy the film for what it is, the way it is. It certainly has stood the test of time.Shelly's novel.

B005K17RU0|1.0|uses too many of my available resources and ties up my phone. Not a good product, trys to do too much with a phone. Looks like a pc package.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|I Gave it 5 stars because because it is the complete show and I love the extra stuff to, It Rocks!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It works well, but sucks up too much battery life unless you can turn of backround syncing. Sucks most of my available resources when the phone is on.
B00E7SXPVW|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I love Nirvana and there music. I like this item because it has all the songs re -mastered and the sounding is excellent.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Does a grat job for a &#34;Fat finger person&#34;. Learns many of your own words and allows you a lot of options.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|Love my case!  Classy and professional.  I like the material.  So far it is easy to clean and is sturdy.  I wish it propped up in portrait style as well since the phone is mostly in the portrait position.  I highly recommend this product.
B00CKURWTK|4.0|Underwater dogs!  My kids and I love Seth Casteel's photos.  Put dogs in water and they just look ridiculous... and so cute.<br /><br />We gravitated, of course, to the Jack Russells, since we have  Jackie mix.  But really, all the dogs are pretty hysterical.  I don't know why except for the fact that they seem so ecstatically happy.<br /><br />UNDERWATER DOGS has color from edge to edge and there's a nice mix of close-ups and a shots from a little further back.  And one of the things I liked was that the text that accompanies the images rhymes.<br /><br />Life's simple things<br />are what dogs<br />enjoy.<br /><br />There's nothing<br />better than fetching<br />your toy.<br /><br />My older kids --Tween and new Teen-- grabbed this book as soon as it arrived.  [Book rec'vd as a review copy in exchange for an honest review.] But I think this could be a very nice book to share with younger children who like dogs.  The photos are very kid-friendly, and the rhymes make a nice read-aloud.<br /><br />And the topics are different from the normal ones that come up when I read other books to youngsters.  UNDERWATER DOGS gave me a chance to talk about slow and fast, relax and race, joy/happiness and uh-oh/sadness.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Starting easy, this puzzler has you match two orbs in a line to eliminate them from the field.  Eliminating all orbs from the field completes the level.  Later levels have you matching 3-4 orbs and stars (count as 2 orbs) to clear them.  The graphics are good and the sound is decent.  Oddly enough, the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels.  The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|A lot of action and suspense...very good overall. Would highly recommend and would probably watch again. It wasn't gory but good
B00519YPUQ|4.0|Classic movie about the beauty of a child's innocence. Tom Hanks pulls off the mannerisms of a 13 year old so well. Great cast.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I have played this game since it came out and loved it until the most recent update crashed the game and deleted my level 45 park and everything I had. until this is fixed it gets one star and my personal thumbs down
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|As a Superman fan, this was the reboot I've been waiting for. This movie helped erase all memories of the lackluster Superman Returns and paved the way for a take on the 75 year old character that feels both fresh and energized.<br /><br />The Good: First and foremost, this is a Sci-Fi story at its core and I loved that most about this movie. It was great to see a look of Krypton that did away with the crystalline structure of the Donner films. This movie feels much closer to some of the more recent comics including elements of John Bryne's Man of Steel and Superman Birthright (where we see Clark traveling around the world and taking up various odd jobs). I really enjoyed the non-linear style of story-telling, it was very reminiscent of Batman Begins. Jumping between an older and younger Clark Kent helped us get to know him, without spending too much time treading on old ground.<br /><br />Performances: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying the Man of Steel. We see a Superman that's lonely, conflicted and struggling to find his place in the world. One of the character traits I, personally have found very relatable. Amy Adams, what can I say, shes awesome. A much better actress and way more attractive than Margot Kidder or to a lesser-extent Kate Bosworth. Michael Shannon nearly stole the show as General Zod, compared to the campy (but still great) performance of Terrance Stamp, we get a Zod that is both ruthless and menacing. Finally, Russell Crowe as Jor-El. One of my favorite characters from the Superman mythos and Crowe absolutely blew me away. He provides the explanations for why Krypton becomes ultimately doomed, why he sends his only son to earth and why Kal-El must use his gifts to help others. Another one of my favorite aspects of the movie was that we got plenty of screen-time with him (both on and off Krypton). I was entertained ;)<br /><br />Special Effects: The CGI was some of the best I've seen yet! The scenes with Henry flying around are absolutely spectacular and almost realistic looking. Compare that to the final scene in SR where Brandon Routh looks like a poorly modeled PS3 character.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good: Feels a little rushed in a few areas,Maybe a little too much action for the first movie and not enough time spent developing some of the characters. I'm sure we'll get some more of those in the sequel, but the main focus of this movie is Superman.<br /><br />Overall: 9.5/10
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I tried it yesterday and it is addicting, I accidently forgot to start supper I was so intrigued with this game
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this sharpener to keep a good edge on my pocket knives. This works very well and is easy to keep wherever you need it. It is very easy to use.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I am not sure what the object of this game is  and it is very confusing knowing what to do
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|I love the Clifton Chronicle. I have seldom read such a good book or rather series of books. If you looking for a great read this is it. Jeffrey Archer is absolutely at his best here and there is no doubt that he's one of the greatest storytellers of our time.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like that it is different then the mahjong on my computer it also has different games. unfortunately my kindle battery connection doesn't stay  powered long enough
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show so much! Season 2 was awesome and I can not wait to see more Suits episodes!!
B00915G6MG|5.0|This was one of the best years NCIS has had yet, so good that they will have a hard time living up to this standard.  I didn't like some of the tragedies that happened in this season, but the writing and acting were wonderful.  It left me very anxious to see the beginning of the new season.
B000FC1192|4.0|I've seen the movie about 100 times, the creepiest part of the movie for me was the doll. At first I kept expecting the doll to show up in the book. Then I was a bit disappointed that the doll wasn't there. Eventually, I realized that, without the doll, the story was all about Coraline. This story allows you to paint the picture yourself, you don't need what Hollywood adds. If you liked this story, read the Graveyard Book next.
B002U1F32M|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies. The Expectations/Reality scene is one of my favorites in any film, and who doesn't love a good musical number?

B000I9U9A4|4.0|This is a good story.  I love the sound track! It's better if you have a huge TV. Great acting!
B00F5FFKK0|5.0|Description says the Mercury 2013 remix, but description next to songs say this is the 2000 remaster. This doesn't seem like the Deluxe version with all of the bonus materials.
0671015206|5.0|It was a great buy..........<br /><br />The book came in good condition just like it said.<br /><br />Everything worked out great.<br /><br />Thank you
B007DIQC90|5.0|I haven't stopped listening to this cd, since i bought it a month ago very happy with my purchase .
B008K5T5AI|4.0|This is arguably the pinnacle of Banks' Culture stories for me, in that his 'Mind' ships are really taking the lead for all of the Culture and their action set pieces were spectacular though sometimes a little too far apart. Always a risk when so much attention is focused on secondary characters.<br /><br />Anyhow, a great read...shame it was to be the last Culture story, but a strong entry to the canon nonetheless.

B00D8HNR2K|1.0|Nothing special about it, the couple seconds during a couple songs got my hopes up that it might get good, and it never does.<br /><br />I don't need to get into all this detail others have in this review, I have been listening to Trent since day 1 WHEN IT CAME OUT!!,  And this falls short of anything he is about. Boooo.<br />Just boo.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Lot of action this season and sadness for some of the characters. So glad that Ducky made it through. Abby keeps them on their toes.
B008B8AOQI|4.0|The lead singer has a very unique voice, but after a while you get used to it and it actually becomes quite catchy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I read comments before I purchased this and I gotta say, it's incredible so far. I love how the chat conversations look, I've not had any problem with not getting many stories on the page. So far, I'm very pleased.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I enjoyed this book as I am a student of WWII. Just be prepared to be depressed throughout as this is one of the darkest books I have read in quite some time.
B002RUA524|5.0|WARNING: this review has spoilers<br /><br />...<br /><br />I was in the middle of Lolita and Rebecca, dark, intense books both, when I came down with a fever, probably caused by those two depressing narrators. So I set about hunting for something lighter and zeroed in on My Family and Other Animals, and proceeded to spend most of my illness surrounded by cushions, drinking tea and alternately grinning and laughing.<br /><br />At first I thought My Family and Other Animals was a simple book, full of \\"swifties\\" and indifferent expressions, not written to enlighten or even impress. Everyone says something \\"unguardedly\\" or \\"suspiciously\\" or something-else-ly. It has the freshness of a hand-written letter, as if the author did not bother to edit or improve anything once it was written down. I could not have found something more unlike Lolita, which incidentally I believe is a grand work of art that has to be studied, annotated and preserved with reverence.<br /><br />Ostensibly, My Family and Other Animals is the story of the narrator's exploits with the animals on the Greek island of Corfu. In truth, it is a book without a plot, consisting of various things that happened to cross the author's lively, extraordinary head. If I came across a description such as that one, I'd immediately blacklist the book, but luckily for me I did not read the reviews.<br /><br />Various Greek characters come and go throughout the story, in appearance and character as distinct and colorful as the countless animals that inhabit the island. Theodore, a well-known botanist, goes wandering across the island with Gerry the twelve year old narrator, subjecting the spiders and the beetles to a thoughtful, absent-minded scrutiny that masks an obsession. Trapdoor spiders lie waiting beneath tiny, devious trapdoors for their prey. The rose-beetle man sings funny songs and sells various pets - over-friendly tortoises and musical parrots - to Gerry after long haggling over the prices. Oil-beetle larvae hitchhike on a special bee's fur, disembark surreptitiously on the bee's cell (which contains the egg), eat the poor bee's egg and grow into adulthood inside the cell.<br /><br />The titular family of five, who according to the author \\"having got themselves on paper, then proceeded to establish themselves and invite various friends to share the chapters,\\" is led by a somewhat hapless Mother with whom I instantly fell in love. She is no match for the guile of even her youngest son, Gerry, and is led on a series of hilarious misadventures by her eccentric children and the overprotective and very British family dog, Roger. Roger shares every one of Gerry's zoological trips, inspecting and compiling the lavish fauna of the island with a zeal matched only by his youthful owner. There is also a boat, very dignified and rotund, but carrying the unfortunate name of Bootle-Bumtrinket.<br /><br />Over the years, it has become increasingly harder for me to find a book that leaves an impression -- a book that provokes thought or laughter, shines a blazing light on an unspeakable horror, conjures wonderful ideas, metaphors and landscapes, or incites a bout of feverish soul-searching. My Family and Other Animals is an exquisite exception that fills you with the same irrepressible joy and curiosity that seems to rule Gerry. It forces one to suspend not one's disbelief, but one's skepticism, a much rarer gift to a reader. Only a few pages in, I was already half-convinced that nothing destructive existed anywhere in the universe. All of earth suddenly seemed to be laid out like a buffet, promising unsuspected delights and mysteries, awaiting one's endless examination, just as the island of Corfu had laid waiting for Gerry Durell to poke and prod anything that showed an inclination to move when he wasn't lifting barks to peer underneath in case a precious dung-beetle had gotten left out.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|Did not expect this movie to be as good as it turned out to be!  A story that kept you guessing, on the edge of your seat at times, well acted with interesting character development.  Not your typical sci-fi, I highly recommend it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! One of the few books that I did not want to put down and read everywhere I went. I even took it on vacation with me and spent a good amount of time reading, I enjoyed every minute though!

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This reminded me of Independence Day, the Jetsons, and at some points the music reminded me of the game Final Fantasy. Great effects, good acting, good plot, good climax, and it left out the emphasis on the more sobering parts with Morgan Freemon-I'm grateful for that since it would have taken the movie into a more Mad Maxx/Book of Eli direction. I thought there could have been more chemistry between a certain husband and wife but maybe that's just my perception. I liked the movie overall and think that it is one of my new favorite sci fi movies.

B000QRIGJY|4.0|I'm a fan of the Harry Bosch mysteries, so this is a little biased. Still, I liked the book. Some scenes were familiar, but then they took place near where Harry lives. We've been there before, which accounts for the familiarity. The plot itself is not a repeat, with sufficient twists and turns to keep my interest all the way through.<br /><br />I enjoy Michael Connelly's writing and the Bosch characters.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I loved being at the edge of my seat- the plot was good- and thankfully, not too much zombie gore!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was astonished when I saw the picture quality. Its easy to set-up, though I needed the included power supply( I guess my LCD Samsung and its HDMI input is older than I thought). The IPad has a Google chrome app which facilitates the setup process and appears in the Netflix app to allow you to stream your content to the TV or keep it on the IPad.. As others have mentioned there is no drain on the IPad battery.
6304696515|5.0|I have loved this film a long time (like others here) too. Being one who believes that the very best films begin with a truly good morality tale (i.e., telling the truth about human nature and relationships), how much more delightful when THIS GREAT AND TIMELESS ONE was told via an unsurpassedly high level of production - its staging/costuming, scripting, filming and acting!  (No matter how many times I view this film, I'm particularly amazed at the brilliance of Malkovich's performance.) But I'm only repeating what others have said...<br />I took the time to write this (after buying a Blu-Ray copy today), because I wanted others to also check out the 2003 South Korean version (set in 19th century Korea) by E J-Yong entitled \\"Untold Scandal.\\"  Its US release garnered high praise with which I concur. Yes, it's subtitled but that doesn't stop true film lovers. Enjoy!
B006ZZAN60|5.0|If you like Celtic and/or music with a tinge of Middle Eastern flair, this is a must have.<br />Loreena McKennitt is amazing and her accompanying musicians are the icing on the cake.<br />I listen to the cds that came with it regularly, and watch the DVD about once a month.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is another one of Hosseini's great stories!  I have read both the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and And the Mountains Echoed is just as wonderful.  Read and enjoy!!!

B001EBYMB2|5.0|Not really accurate but good flick!<br />Had to have been there to appreciate the real boot camp and war experience
B00F88H5K2|4.0|Acting in this is great. Liberace couldn't have been more Liberace himself...And the time setting was amazingly well established, so much so that it seemed like it could have been filmed in the early eighties.

B00C81AVNU|5.0|Just saw this show last week on Broadway, and it was so much fun!  Billy Porter was amazing as Lola/Simon - and his voice was by turns exhilarating and heartbreaking.  Annaleigh Ashford channelled Cyndi Lauper on her solo \\"The History of Wrong Guys.\\"  You won't see this one at your local community theater any time soon, but you won't regret this cast recording!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A well put together movie with magic all through ... are was it?  A great plot, great acting and leaves you wondering .... How did they do that!!!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|J.J. Abrams did it again and the new crew delivered again. Great new adaptation of an old theme, although Khan, as an Eaton School lookalike with no recognizable Sikh qualities disturbed me at first; as did the new facial morphing of the Klingons - how many mutations can one species produce within 50 years? The film was fast paced and enjoyable. 3-D added to the character of HD and I am looking forward to the next installment hopefully again being available in 3D.<br />J.J. Abrams will have his work cut out for himself in the next film; he's done Nero, he's done Khan, there had better be something else besides another universal renegade bad guy out to destroy the Federation. How about war with the Klingons, or Romulans, or a re-match with the Gorn alliance.

B00DJZR46G|2.0|Ever since THE BIG PICTURE--which Elton and Bernie both admit wasn't very good--Elton has said he doesn't care about album sales, he wants to \\"return to his roots.\\"<br /><br />So he records SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST, PEACHTREE, THE CAPTAIN AND ME, THE UNION and now this.<br /><br />And each time a CD comes out, he says, \\"THIS is my return to form! My new TUMBLEWEED or MADMAN!\\" And the critics say, \\"THIS is Elton's return to form...\\"<br /><br />However, PEACHTREE didn't sell so Elton re-released it with some bonus tracks and it still didn't sell much. The he decided to do a sequel to CAPT. FANTASTIC and had a very public fit and meltdown when THE CAPTAIN & ME didn't sell and begged to be released from his contract.<br /><br />And then (yawn) THE UNION and now THE DIVING BOARD. My complaint is that most of the songs on all these CDs lack strong melodies, which he used to knock off in minutes. And for the most part, they are s-l-o-w ballades that meander about and lack really strong choruses.<br /><br />So now we have THE DIVING BOARD and there are ads everywhere and critics are saying, \\"A RETURN TO FORM!\\" and you sit down...and the flat opening cut OCEANS AWAY begins. Remember when the first cut was supposed to be strong to get and keep you attention? Not here.<br /><br />So I settled down and hoped he'd write some strong songs and some more upbeat music. He often says he writes songs for a sixty year old man, but it's more like 80. I mean Mick and the Stones are in their 70s and Rush are in their 60s and they can STILL rock.<br /><br />\\"My Quicksand\\"  \\"Voyeur\\"  \\"Oceans Away\\" \\"The New Fever Waltz\\" \\"The Diving Board\\" and \\"Candlelit Bedroom\\" are just mundane filler and the all sound the same, same plodding temple. The 3 \\"Dream\\" songs are simply little piano ditties that add nothing to the CD.<br /><br />So we're left with:<br /><br />\\"Oscar Wilde Gets Out\\"<br />\\"A Town Called Jubilee\\"<br />\\"The Ballad of Blind Tom\\"<br />\\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\"<br />\\"Home Again\\"<br />\\"Take This Dirty Water\\"<br />\\"Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)\\"<br /><br />That's 7 songs and those are the only ones I liked after repeated listenings. They have a LITTLE energy to them and some melody but we all know, we'll never hear them in concert a couple years from now.<br /><br />And that's the problem with Elton--he may be writing what he wants, but we all know he'd like some more monster hits because when he tours, he never plays anything from BIG PICTURE, et al--he goes back to his greatest hits, His last really well written/produced album was THE ONE with a great variety of songs.<br /><br />If he records another CD, I would love the record contract to state that he MUST write 5 upbeat, pop-rock songs. He can fill the album with all the boring and depressing and plodding ballades he wants, but we need some LIFE, Elton, some energy!<br /><br />You do it in concert, why don't you do it anymore in your CDs?

1476727651|2.0|Imagine Shirley Jackson writing a sequel to THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE without the house, or Richard Matheson's HELL HOUSE sequel sans the Belasco mansion?<br /><br />That's one of the many, many, many things that are wrong with Stephen King's sequel to THE SHINING--the Overlook hotel never makes an appearance since it was destroyed by fire (in the book, not the movie.) The whole premise of THE SHINING was a haunted hotel and a boy with a special gift.<br /><br />What we have in DOCTOR SLEEP (really dull title, BTW) is the further adventures of Danny Torrance. Problem is, if you read the novel, Danny was never a very interesting character--his father was and the hotel was. But in this sequel, we are stuck with Danny.<br /><br />And Danny drinks--a lot.<br /><br />And goes to a LOT of AA meetings; and we go with him.<br /><br />To. Every. Single. One.<br /><br />I'm talking dozens of pages of AA meetings that add zero to the book. King struggled with alcoholism during the early years of his career and one reason he so disliked Kubrick's film was because that aspect of Jack Torrance was significantly excised from the film. So King wrote it back in when he did his 1997 TV miniseries. So alcoholism played--and plays--a big role in the characters of THE SHINING and DOCTOR SLEEP.<br /><br />But it doesn't result in very interesting characters. In fact, this is the first book of King's (I've read more than 40 of them) where his skill with characters is absent. There are no characters in this book, just names on a page--and pages you will be frantically skimming by the time you reach page 200 because you will be desperately look for a plot to grab you and suck you into the story.<br /><br />Like everyone else reading this review, I was SO EXCITED to read DOCTOR SLEEP. (I was given a galley.)<br /><br />This sequel to one of my favorite King novels came with great expectations, and he even said it would be a return to real horror. (\\"Basically, the idea of the story was to try and scare the s--t out of people!\\" he said)<br /><br />But here's the bad news: IT'S NOT SCARY. At all.<br /><br />The supernatural evil force Danny deals with is someone called \\"Nan the Hat.\\" Seriously. I'm not making it up. And Nan and her minions aren't even really supernatural--they can be destroyed by measles. And shotguns. Yes, seriously.<br /><br />By page 400 of the more than 600 page galley, I knew it was a real disaster. Of course, \\"everyone\\" will buy it but I can't honestly imagine many will give it a good review. There is no Overlook Hotel. There are no scares. There are no classic King characters.<br /><br />In fact, the last 200 pages read like a young adult adventure novel. If it wasn't pitched as a sequel, it would still be a bad book, and it borrows heavily from IT and THE DEAD ZONE.<br /><br />This was a huge disappointment for me. If anyone likes/loves it, I look forward to reading your reviews and comments.<br /><br />And please provide some examples of what you found so scary or compelling about the story.<br /><br />It's well known that King postponed publication of DOCTOR SLEEP from January 2013 to fall 2013 since he admitted it needed some serious editing.<br /><br />If only he had postponed it again or better yet, shelved an idea that clearly doesn't work.

031623480X|5.0|I was ecstatic to hear that my husband won a free Advance Reading Copy of Grain Brain through GoodReads.  The author, David Perlmutter, primarily focuses on the neurological affects grain--especially wheat--can have on the body. Many studies have shown that the #1 cause of dementia is from a gluten-filled, high carb diet. Perlmutter goes above and beyond in his book by also debunking several food myths: 1) That fat is bad for you, 2) High cholesterol is dangerous and must be avoided, and 3) People should consume high amounts of grains and carbohydrates each day. Perlmutter explains how these myths only contribute to neurological disorders, while studies have shown that elderly people who consumed high amounts of fat, fewer carbohydrates, and had a higher cholesterol level were overall healthier than those who followed the opposite kind of diet.<br /><br />When you think about it, there has to be a reason why diabetes, dementia, obesity, and various cardiovascular and neurological problems have been on the rise in the past 30 years, and I believe--as mentioned in Grain Brain- that a lot of these issues are contributed to our diet changes.<br /><br />I had made the decision to give up grain and most carbohydrates in February of 2012. I experienced a radical change just as many of Perlmutter's patients had experienced. Since then, I have incorporated some foods back into my diet, so long as they did not contain gluten or corn. Reading Perlmutter's Grain Brain has made me rethink my consumption of grains and certain carbs for the sake of my neurological health, and I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who desires to see change in their health. You will never be the same. If this review was helpful, then please click “yes” below. Thank you in advance!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a neat device.  I have netflix on my 360 and use that primarily before, but after getting this I find I enjoy using chromecast from my phone.  Also I watch a lot more youtube videos with this, Since there is no easy interface for youtube on my other devices I use this a lot.  Really good quality.<br /><br />The only things I have against it are that you have to go to each app to access the apps.  I find there should be a more unified interface that you can access on the phone that mirrors a chromecast interface, similar to (I know I just have to say it) apple tv.  If and when they come out iwth more apps for it, I don't want to have to download a bunch of different apps to access content.<br /><br />Also it could be speedier.  I have a nice home internet connection but sometimes there is drastic delay between my phone and the tv.<br /><br />Other than that is is a device that has a wonderful price, and a lot of potential.

B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|I was excited when I discovered that there was a game called \\"The Room\\".  I thought to myself, \\"Finally, someone else who realizes the brilliance of Tommy Wiseau's \\"The Room\\" has based an app on the movie!\\"  I imagined how the gameplay would go; would this be RPG based, like \\"Final Fantasy\\"?  Maybe this would be a fighting game along the lines of \\"Mortal Kombat\\", where you could choose to be Johnny and fight Mark and various other cast members from the movie.<br /><br />Let me tell you right now that this app has nothing to do with the movie.<br /><br />\\"The Room\\" is basically a bunch of puzzles that you have to solve to get a combination to open a safe.  And that's it.  No Mark, no Claudette, and definitely nothing involving saving Lisa!<br /><br />Mr. Wiseau, if you're reading this...I guess you'll have to wait longer to get an app that's dedicated to and recognizes the masterpiece that is your movie.  App makers...shame on you for trying to capitalize on a genius's work by naming an app after a movie that changed a whole generation for the better.

B001PSGF3C|3.0|We're entering that time of year where scary movies are a must.  Ok, so maybe I'm a little early.  But oh well.  Gothika, with its creepy cover seemed to fit the bill.<br /><br />Miranda Grey is a psychologist.  She works at a Penitentiary in the psych ward.  After driving home and having an odd occurrence though, she wakes up only to find herself a patient in the same Penitentiary.  Worst thing is, everyone seems to believe she has committed murder, and something unnatural is stalking her.  But since she is now \\"crazy\\" she has no one to turn to for help.<br /><br />Characters<br />Halle Berry: Miranda Drey<br />Robert Downey Jr: Pete Graham<br />Charles Dutton: Douglas Grey<br />John Carroll Lynch: Sheriff Ryan<br />Penelope Cruz: Chloe Sava<br />Bernard Hill: Phil Parsons<br /><br />For as many famous actors that are in this movie, they are definitely under-utilized.  Berry gets the most screen time, and given that's she's supposed to be crazy for the larger part of the movie, that's definitely interesting.  But I think she does more screaming than talking.  Cruz probably has the next biggest role, and since she's an inmate too, again, there's not much meaningful dialogue going on.  Although she plays a convincing patient.  Downey Jr. barely has any time at all and I honestly didn't see the point in his part.  He doesn't add much to the movie at all or really develop any breakthroughs.  The Sheriff plays a more important role than him.  It's just weird that more time wasn't spent developing all these characters if they were going to have big names play them.<br /><br />And the plot.  Well, let's just say you have to suspend disbelief for a lot of it.  And I'm not talking about the paranormal aspect of it.  To believe that Grey can go from being a doctor to a patient in the same place, within three days, just doesn't make sense.  It seems more logical that she would be in a hospital or other short-term facility rather than the penitentiary.  I liked the overall theme of being part crazy and part truthful and having noone believe you because you're in a psych ward though.  To me, that's more terrifying than the ghosts.  So much could happen to you and noone would believe you because you're in the facility.  You just have to hope the wardens aren't corrupt or sadistic.<br /><br />The overall scene was dark and shadowy.  It made me wonder why the facility didn't do something about their electric.  Especially when dealing with people with fragile psyches.  I know it was just the movie trying to be scary, but it was another unbelievable thing.  But it did set the tone for this being a horror film.  As did the special effects.  They were pretty well done and realistic and it seemed as if Grey was not in control of her own body when the paranormal was attacking her.  To cap it all off, we have \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" as the song that plays at the end of the film (not much music otherwise) and to me that's always been a depressing song so it fits.<br /><br />Not a great film but it's somewhat spooky.  If you like big name actors and decent special effects you'll tolerate it.  But if you're expecting spectacular writing and dialogue, this just isn't the movie for it.<br /><br />Review by M.

B00000J7SS|4.0|This album was hard to listen to at first.  After the third listen, I started to like it.  After the fifth, I loved it and now everything else seems tame and boring.  There's a lot going on.  I seem to find something different every time I listen to it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The writing is wonderful.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the attention to small details.  Over all this is a well-produced series.  I look forward to the fourth season.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher does it again!<br /><br />While this album starts off as seemingly dance oriented project (i.e. \\"Woman's World\\" and \\"Take It Like A Man\\"), halfway through it converges into power ballads (see \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Red\\") and slower numbers (\\"I Hope You Find It\\" and \\"You Haven't Seen The Last of Me\\").<br /><br />While the album will no doubt appeal to younger audiences, there are plenty of songs to be enjoyed by Cher's longtime followers. It may not have another \\"Believe\\" on it, but she undoubtedly provides the listener with an enjoyable, foot-tapping experience that only she can provide.
