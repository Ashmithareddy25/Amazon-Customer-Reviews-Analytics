B0094BB4TW|5.0|gtg.downloaded it and just trying to learn how to use. really just trying to see if this check Mark will disappear after I write a review on it.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|It took some time to convince my wife that movies in blu-ray is worth the money.  I bought this movie for her and she loved it.  Now she wants all her favorite movies in blu-ray.  I think I created a blu-ray DVD monster.
1451629192|5.0|Arrived quickly and I was very impressed with this book. It was almost hard to read at first, so hard to think that anyone would have to go through anything like this in their lifetime. I could hardly put this book down.<br /> Very pleased with this purchase
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is fun and addicting. it is an improved temple run with lanes and moving obstacles. love it! it is really a good  deal.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this book!  Great, easy read as usual. Grisham tells a great story and keeps you guessing at every chapter.<br />Please make this book a movie! Denzel Washington is my pick for the lead man!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas present for some of our grand kids and they loved it.  It was in good condition.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|probably should have started with the beginning of the series.  I saw the TV series catching up was not hard.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|The charger works as expected. However, the lights to show fully charged are a bit of a challange. The lights remain blue and blink in  series one for low charge, two for partial charge and three blinks for full charge. It is a bit difficult to figure out when the process is done. Eventually the lights go out all together and the unit at that time seems to be completely charged.<br /><br />The cade does serve a major service in making the bluetooth device easy to keep untangled and protected from damage. I think it is a necessary item and should have been included with the origional product as part of the package rather than being offered for an additional $30. A bit of a rip off by the manafacturer in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down once I started! Saw the movie first and am blown away by how much better the book is!
B007NU54H4|5.0|We bought this product used for four of our grand daughters.  They are all young enough to enjoy this movie.  They were excited to receive it and loved this movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|My sister kept talking about this book, so I got it on my Kindle two nights ago. What a truly fantastic book for any dog lover!  Extremely clever and well written....what a great dog's perspective. I'm giving it to my wife to my wife to read now.
0547391005|5.0|It is a joy to read Curious George to my son. This book is a ton of fun and brings back all kinds of great memories.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am not a GMO-hating kook, but this book scared the daylights out of me.  If you read this book and continue eating wheat, either you didn't believe a word of it, or you have a death wish.
B001O03NCW|5.0|A great collection of bluegrass music! You won't regret getting this album. If you haven't seen the movie do it now!
0756666937|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old grandson.  I am happy that it came on time and in great shape.  Thank you so much.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Our family goes to the local stage production of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; every year.  This year I realized that I had not previously read the actual book.  This was solid edition, worked very well, and the story...  well, if you don't know about this one you should read it now!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|This sweeper is the older model.  They have improved it so you dont have to touch the dirt compartment.  Also, the newer model has a bending handle for getting under short cabinets, etc.<br /> Although it is cheaper, I love the newer model Swivel Sweeper much better.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My daughter loves this box.  It is sturdy for the price I paid, it holds a lot of her stuff and she has fun playing with it as a house as well.
B00993FEUK|4.0|After reading many good reviews on Amazon and after a personal recommend, I went ahead and picked this movie up on a whim to put in my wife's Christmas stocking, despite neither of us having seen it before.  One kind of movie my wife and I can both agree on watching together is a good animated movie, and I felt that perhaps my wife would like this movie.  A guy I talked to on the day I bought this told asked me if we liked movies like Frankenweenie, Coraline, Corpse Bride, and Nightmare Before Christmas and I told him that we did.  He said that then that we would probably rather like this movie, and sure enough we did.<br /><br />It really did have that kind of Tim Burton/Henry Sellick kind of feel to it, although it was created and directed by different people, some who actually worked with Henry Sellick on Coraline.  We both like that kind of animation as well as like Dreamworks, Disney, and Pixar type stuff.  ParaNorman was fun, whitty, and entertainingly scary in a few parts...just all around entertaining my wife and I thought.<br /><br />The one thing I will say is that if your child is real young, I'd say under the age of 7, this film may not exactly be suitable for them.  There is some parts in this movie that would probably scare them, plus there is a small amount of mild language.  There is one reference a male character makes late in the movie about having a boyfriend, but decide on that however you will.  I'd say it's okay for kids 7 and up though.  Use your best judgment.  Beyond that though, I think the movie is really enjoyable, I recommend it!
0061537969|5.0|What a great book!  It made me laugh and cry at the same time. I had a dog like Enzo. Andy was with me for 15 years and I know he knew what I was thinking always.<br />Erin Hemenway
B004XZR63M|5.0|I've been to seminars, read others books but none put it as easily as this one. This is hands down the best one yet. I'm looking forward to reading more of his books and figuring out my first plan of attack.
B008K8U13K|1.0|How do you learn to play a game like this? I've played Sonic the hedgehog since it was on the genesis and I've never had a more worse control scheme for a sonic title ever. I've played Sonic 3D blast which had the isometric view and you really couldn't spin dash without running into something off screen. This is still worse.<br /><br />The camera is also a little too close but ya know. if there is a periphral that exchanges it's controls for something else. Anything other than touch screen I would take this review all back. Once I get to use it of course.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have a special needs son (10 yrs. old) who loves angry birds, so he was ecstatic to play it on a larger platform than mom's I phone, he loves it, and if he's happy, were happy, (can't beat the price either!) Merry X-mas and happy new year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It isn't the best quality of writing, but it is so addicting and suspenseful!! Can't wait to finish this trilogy!
0316227706|5.0|This book is a very fresh look at how entertaining and lovable dogs really are. Their facial expressions while retrieving tennis balls underwater in  a pool are priceless. This book when placed on your coffee table is sure to be a conversation starter.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This is probably one of the most popluar games I've ever played. And to be honest. The first time I played it I thought nothing of it.<br /><br />Just a game where you fling a thing at a thing. Sounds extremely dismissive and cynical but there it is.<br /><br />I sort of grew up playing these games when they were new. No I have not played crash the castle as far as my memory goes but I remember playing games just like this on Newgrounds, Armor games, and a dozen other shady websites that no longer exist because your browser would pick up that it's harboring tons of malicious software on it.<br />Whats there to like about this game? I have no idea. No I really don't. Is it cute? Is that why people like it? It's popular to hate this game I know but for me I play it and just fill with apathy. It's so underwhelming. The designs of the pig structures are just so basic. The mechanics of the birds are really basic.<br /><br />I could literally design Angry Birds in little big planet two in all its entirety. That's what really does this game in. I could make this game within the mechanics of a much larger game. That's how cheap this game design is and how it fails to excite, interest, or entertain.<br /><br />I'd hate to put people who like this on the spot but if you enjoy this game you either don't know better or just don't care. And if that's the case don't feel intimdated by what I said. Just remember it several years later when something new rolls along and you ask yourself why other people like it despite you hating it for it's extremely obvious flaws.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I like the story and good graphics.  The hints are strong so you will not give up too soon.  Really liked the price....Free!!
B00A80SHFM|2.0|I loved the movie and loved the music for the most part.  But this review has nothing to do with the music itself or the movie.  Whoever decided to put this soundtrack together without \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" and \\"Who Am I,\\" among others, has no idea what they're doing.  This is thoroughly disappointing.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|I love watching Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2.  Have watched both several times and I'm never disappointed.  I especially enjoy the Crazy 88s fight scenes.  Uma, Uma, Uma!
B0081SPK0I|1.0|I installed on the original Kindle Fire and I couldn't see the car. it also froze regularly. uninstalling. glad ot was a free app of the day
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's good to have this App when you need a quick check of the weather.  I am really pleased to have weather reports at my finger tips.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This country was built on the backs of true American Hero's like Adam Brown. Peace be with you in Heaven and your family here on earth. Thank you.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|I've seen this movie several times but hadn't seen it in years.  No matter how many times I watch Kill Bill & Kill Bill 2 I'm never disappointed.
B009Y2KGSQ|4.0|Hey, I'm an Aerosmith fan from back when they were still wet behind the ears (it was probably bourbon, but....), and I'm digging this latest progression, man! This is the boys doing their thing and it's good. Whoever expects Aerosmith to sound just like they did on Get Your Wings needs to stop vicariously reliving their youth through a bunch of 60 something year olds and just dig on the craft. Don't waste your time because you aren't a fan and you can't be cool. This is awesome stuff and y'all outta get with it. Dig on \\"Out Go the Lights,\\" listen to \\"What Could Have Been Love\\" and wonder what happened to her, if you gotta have your \\"Toys In the Attic\\" fix 2012-style, straddle \\"Street Jesus.\\" This is it, man. Get it.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We have purcased every season and it gets better every year. It has good mistery with laughter. Keeps it interesting.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It was a funny book about a kid named Greg heffly who has some very interesting/funny moments in middle school and around town.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Desert island top five. You can never be unhappy listening to reggae (or blues or zydeco). This collection is one of the essentials.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Amazing movie!!!! I loved all the extras. All the differdnt versions, 3d, blueray, dvd,7 hours of extras, choice oc different beginning and ending, AMAZING!!!!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I should have known better with Seth McFarlane, but Ted looked so innocent and fun in the trailers I couldn't resist.  The animation was awesome, but the story dragged along at times like Ted's sorry plush derriere and the human acting was mediocre at best.  By the end I was pooped (that's in the movie too) and not uplifted or refreshed after any big laughs, because there weren't any.  If you like unending obscenities and scatalogical humor this movie is for you.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|One of the best seasons yet love it, cant,wait for season 5. Keeps you on the edge of your seat dont miss season 4
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can''t stop playing this game. Good brain food! Not just for kids, great for all ages, young and old.
B003EY9UZU|5.0|This is a very well made movie with amazing graphics. The HD makes the picture absolutely incredible. For the extra buck I would definitely go for it! Pop some popcorn and prepare for a great action packed movie!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Its very funny and the way he repeats everything is has me rolling. Very fun and cool game. hope they make a part2.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|I bought it for the kids but wanted something clean.  We listen to it in the car and everyone loves it.
B006H5120E|5.0|Efforts and money worth spend! It is a movie which can be watched umpteen times and the 3D effects make the viewing a pleasure!
B009738XXM|3.0|My 10 year old really liked it. I thought it was appropriate for a child.I would recomend this album. My 10 year old turns it on and cleans her bedroom without problems.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter says that she is not a big fan of Angry Birds but as her father I am going to override her and say that it is a great game. I mean, its Angry Birds, what can you say. This game has everyone playing it and if your not playing it you have played it. Great Job to the developers and creators for making such a fun challenging game that will keep you playing for hours. Great job!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Bought it for the girls because they love Taylor Swift.  They have been singing right along!  Perfect for the car plus they downloaded it to their kindles.
1449410243|5.0|The friend I gave this to as a gift was rolling on the floor with laughter!  She rescues and fosters cats (just moved across 2 states with 18!), so she could see their behavior in the cartoons and 'meditations'.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|My 13-year old son though the movie was great.  I, on the other hand am less than satisfied.<br /><br />Being Polish, the subject of WWII and the persecution of Jews is dear to my heart, and I am a sucker for a good dramatic war story.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />I found \\"Sarah's Key\\" to be predictable.  After the first 15 minutes I voiced my prediction about the film's ending (to my son, out-loud), and an hour-and-a-half later I was proven 90% right.<br /><br />I found uninspired and uninspiring similarities of this film to the 1982 \\"Sophie's Choice\\"by Alan Pakula, or 2010 \\"Joanna\\" by Feliks Falk (both better movies).<br /><br />The acting is over-done, over the top.  There are some naive and illogical scenes, over-dramatized.<br /><br />A good story needs to be character-driven, and this one is plot-driven, and like I already said - the plot is one that is old-and-tried, and predictable.
B005HSL626|5.0|Daughter states very boldly '&#34;AWESOME GAME&#34;. Very fun how you have to chop all the fruit and very challenging in the higher levels. I am her father and I have not played it much but from what I have played it seems like a very fun game. Great job to the developers on creating such a good game. Thanks Guys!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a really fun game. It is a good way to kill some time and is very entertaining. The ads are not bad
B001706I5I|3.0|This is a very flat and boring adaptation of the original story. Jim Carey tries his very best to make this Grinch interesting but the lack of inspiration of the adaptation is limiting his impact on the overall movie.<br /><br />Must watch only if you have nothing else to do
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Reading a book from the viewpoint of a dog was delightful.  The intelligence and insightfulness  of pets is often overlooked; but this book brings those qualities to the forefront.  This book shares all emotions, equally...sadness, fear, joy, but most of all love.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter states that it is very fun and really likes playing. As her father, I really like the fact that it causes her to think about the best possible solution to the puzzle unlike these other games that do not cause her to use her brain. She is 7 yrs old and in the Gifted and Honors program at school and I would like it to stay that way. Great game. Many thanks to the developers for taking the time to actually put thought into creating a great game. Thanks again!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a great movie, in the same realms as Lassie come home. I would definitely recommend this for dog lovers. A real ter-jerking movie.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This is a brilliant book . It is very interesting and funny . I loved it very much . I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in fiction stories and cartoons.!!! I would also recommend the other simply kid books they are brilliant too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldnt put the book down.  Stays with you long after the last word was read.  I have enjoyed all her books.  Colleen has an amazing gift.
B002VISNAS|5.0|Easy to read and full of interesting ideas and stories.<br />Well written and thought provoking - Couldn't put it down
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You either love it or have never heard of it...WE LOVE THE SERIES. Our boys got us hooked on the show.
B005HSL626|4.0|Very fun addictive game everyone in my house fights over who gets to use MY kindle to play! Lol fun for any age
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is a awesome movie. Great to watch anytime of the year and it's good for the whole family, we love it
1400069289|5.0|the book explains how we all have the power to change,no matter what bad habits you may be having at the moment.its not going to tell you what to do, but give you examples on what other people have done, and how the brain work when trying to change a habit.
B0096YBEIS|5.0|Can't go wrong with 4play. Always bringing new & exciting music to the music world. I have all their albums.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and enjoy it a lot. Provides just the right amount of focused challenge and satisfaction of successful completion.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Don't let the 2D scare you away. This game is addictive yet easy. You won't want to put it down
1589795474|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because Mr.Stanley goes into detail on how wealthy people in the real world really live.it's something that i was eager to learn and i think its something that would come to a surprise to a lot of people.
B006CHML4I|5.0|I ordered this watch for my husband as a Christmas present.  He loved it, he said it was exactly the kind of watch he wanted. It has a beautiful face and is very easy to read.  He also wanted a watch without batteries, this watch winds it's self. The blue canvas strap was easy to adjust and fit him well. I would definitely recommend this watch to someone who wants a nice casual watch,
1423124960|5.0|Love the book, I wanted to give it for Christmas but didn't know if I would get it in time so she will get it for her birthday. But it is a very nice, sturdy, quality book,
B00867GJYK|5.0|Almost ten years after the initial release, the quality and attention to details of this movie in both animation and environment is still way ahead of the time, and leaves many of today's animation movies in the dust. This is the movie that not only my kids, but myself will enjoy to watch over, over, and over again.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Love this movie even though not a big fan of musicals, but i have to admit this is a masterpiece.
B005LAII1C|1.0|I thought this movie was going to be funny with some adult fun.  However, it was NOT funny and I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This movie is so cute. It keeps all my kids entertained during the whole thing. I even caught myself watching it :) Definitely glad I got this one!
B009MO5960|2.0|Resident Evil franchise suddenly ran out of ideas at the Retribution. All of the ideas, and even the monsters, are recycled from previous series. The only bright spot is Milla's performance, which I would gave an extra star. $22 to buy the blue-ray is total waste of money. If you really want to see how bad this movie is, rent it at Redbox.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very simple and intuitive. Just like it is supposed to be. A must have on any android device. Try it you will like it.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|My six year old nephew absolutely loved this camera.  He is very into all the Lego toys and this was a perfect little starter camera for him...he was able to start taking pictures with ease once it charged.  He also likes he can &#34;add&#34; some legos to the top of the camera!  Excellent buy!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got these for all of my nieces and nephews. Such a cute movie, so glad I got to share it with all of them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book was excellent! Easy read!! Saw the first movie and thought the book was a lot better can't wait to read the next.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Of the gazillion radio station apps out there, this is by far my favorite. Endless stations to choose from. The only radio app you will need.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This editor is great for editing photos. It's easy to use and has some really great features, like adding text, effects, brightening, cropping and drawing. I highly recommend it.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|loved the movie, and even better on blu-ray.  the story really makes the film.  I liked the character and his sense of duty
B0089ZCCT0|4.0|This bag is perfect for my Canon EOS rebel.  There is plenty of room for extra lenses and flashes.  I am also a  new mom so I am sure there is room for a bottle and diaper as well.  It is the size of normal kids school backpack, but more comfy to carry than the shoulder camaera bag.  There is also room in a front pocket for paperwork of any kind
B0091REZMW|5.0|I'm a hidden object game fanatic and Mystery Manor does not disappoint. It has my attention for hours. You will not be disappointed at all.
0525478817|5.0|The book arrived on time and was in very good condition! I've heard lots of good things about this book and I know that the author John Green has a very unique writing voice and can melt the heart of stone with his ability to create such raw, poetic, and very realistic stories.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I read these books when I was younger, and as an adult, reading them again, I enjoyed it much more! Kids or adults, good easy read.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much diary of a wimpy kid are h<br />The best books I had ever read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far the best thing I've ever read. This book has inspired me to be more grateful for my health, my family, etc. Words cannot describe the amount of emotions I received. I cried with feelings of complete and utter saddness, unfathomable anger , and genuine laughter. John Green is an amazing writer and a true understander of human life.
0920668372|5.0|I bought this book for my sister shortly after she discovered that she was pregnant with her second child. I bought it to remind her that her older son will always be her baby and love her, no matter how big he gets. It brought tears to her eyes as I read it to her. Yes, she loved it and I am an awesome gift giver. :o)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing.  I loved this book and now I can watch the movie.  I can't wait to read the next books.
B009IQ2JZQ|4.0|Item arived on time and in good condition. I gave it as a gift so I can't rate how well it played. Since it was in a seqled package I can only hope that it realy was new
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was an amazing book! I could hardly put it down! It is the best book I have ever read.
B003Q97D48|5.0|I LOVE this show. It has the perfect amount of suspense, drama, romance, and fun. I would recommend this to anyone!
B004EK926K|5.0|Great version!  A little intense at moments for younger kids, but true to the book; which makes it more appealing to our family.
0142403873|4.0|This is my third book by this author and I have enjoyed all so far. Will continue to by them
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|THE BEST BOOK EVER!  AND IT WAS Free@Amazon! I just got my kindle fire HD and I love it alot!!!!!!$
031250926X|5.0|Great book! I am a Special Education Teacher, and think it's just great. I love that this is a &#34;slide and find&#34; book, because it allows a child to interact with the book, while being read to or reading it.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I am a Les Mis junkie.  The music on the movie soundtrack is great.  The singing ranges from great to ugh.  As expected, Samantha Barks is great.  Her voice reveals the intended emotions of the songs.  Hugh Jackman and Marius were  surprisingly very good.  Anne Hathaway was good as Fantine with a voice revealing the torture experienced by the character.  Then there was  Russell Crowe.  My mother taught me that if you have nothing good to say, do not say anything.  So, i will not say anything about his singing.
0321885112|5.0|The Sketchnote Handbook by Mike Rohde is fantastic!  First off the book is wonderfully design and easy to follow.  Mike did a great job designing the book so that you (the reader) can follow.  I enjoy that Mike breaks down the process of how to make sketchnotes a part of your note-taking process.  The handbook shows how you can take the boring process of taking notes and making them into art and a better way to listen and communicate your what you hear.  I recommend reading and checking out the SketchNote Handbook if you want to take your notes to another level and provide a great way to share what your learn with other.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I chose 4 stars because it was a good book, but was only really about one thing. If you are going to do that with a book, leave extra things out like uncle gary. The chicken pocks and pantsing were creative and funny, but uncle Gary didn't have really anything to do with the story. Both pantsing and the chicken pocks went with the story! That is why I gave this<br />Story 4 stars.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A love story that truly keeps your attention from beginning to end. One of the better ones.  I would recommend to anyone.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|We love watching the Supernatural Series.  The DVDs are just what we were looking for.  We are very happy with this purchase.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|She always manages to survive, in spite of herself...<br /><br />This story, more so than the others so far, is frustrating... Because she won't stay put when told to, she finds herself in some precarious positions. I'm beginning to lose empathy for her, but I'm gaining it for Jamie. I feel sorry for him; his principal occupation seems to be saving her life.<br /><br />All-in-all, high adventure and good storytelling... Even if the heroine is starting to get on my nerves.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I gave five stars because this book was very moving and I felt \\"infinite,\\" just like Charlie, once I had finished it.
B0095NCXKI|5.0|The one-liners in this series just keep coming.... Keeps me in stitches.... Hip and sophisticated, exposes human foibles without being mean....
B0055SWM08|4.0|I am really enjoying the challenge to these puzzles. Love variations with the additions of the directionals and the arrows.  I really hate the constant pop ups wanting a review.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, fast read! Really gets the story behind the Mockingjay and where and how the rebellion began.  This is my second time reading it, got much more out of it this time.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really good. A friend of mine has this book and has already read it 4 or 5 times.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|I like the series primarily because I like Simon Baker.... He's good in every kind of role from LA Confidential, to Something Different, to this.... Writing could be better.... Like Sherlock, he's able to spot small details that put him in command of the situation, but unlike Sherlock, the writers sometimes forget to explain the reasons why he's right or what his reasoning is in some situations, and his powers of suggestion are not always believable.... By and large though, it all seems to work....
B004FEL6GO|4.0|I purchased this toy for my four-year-old son for Christmas 2012. He LOVES it, insisting on sleeping with it at night! It's relatively simple to transform, and he had the hang of it after about thirty minutes. The giant gun that comes with it is a little lame: Bumblebee can't stand and hold his gun at the same time without a few minutes of balancing.<br /><br />This product stands up to the four-year-old test! My son continually applies too much pressure in the wrong direction, pulling out arms and other joints. These have been really easy to snap back in, and haven't seemed to become loose as a result. I'm satisfied!
B008GXHOFW|3.0|When I got this app for my kindle fire it was awesome! Until the game reset everything so that I couldn't'  upgrade at all and I was back at the early missions. Then it wouldn't  let me get out of the game because it wouldn't let me get to the map! So whenever I had to get off of it  I had to shut my whole kindle down. On the plus side it was a great game otherwise though. I really liked the open world factor. Please debug this cool game Gameloft!

B00ARAO720|5.0|Who would have thought you could make a compelling movie about a bike messenger...? It's really well constructed, unfolding backstory through flashbacks at critical points. Have been extremely impressed with  Joseph Gordon-Levitt since seeing him in Brick, and would watch anything he's in simply because he seems to be able to pick good scripts, if nothing else. Good supporting cast, especially Michael Shannon, the guy you love to hate, as a near psychotic cop.... Love the on-going duel between Wilee and the NYD Bike Cop...
B006GECE9Y|3.0|This has been my default browser for a year - I own the paid version.<br />For months its become increasingly slower.  I uninstalled and did a clean install, cleaned cache, emptied favorites and history... Nada!<br />Can't explain it and soon won't tolerate it - going to chrome.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Okay - not his best.  15 more works required - are they kidding??  I can't believe they require this - ugh.
0596005903|2.0|I bought this book specifically to learn how to write a block device driver for CentOS 6.3 / RHEL 6.3<br /><br />Alas, Linux has moved on since the 3rd edition was printed (2009) and kernel functions used in the example code, like elv_next_request(), or macros like blk_fs_request(), have since been *removed* from Linux, rendering this book somewhat obsolete.<br /><br />For my driver, I need worker threads, and these can be implemented by means of workqueues.<br />Workqueues are a very important tool for the driver writer - basically, they are the kernel equivalent of user-space pthreads. If you want your driver to do things in parallel, you pretty much have to use workqueues.<br />Unfortunately, while there is a section on workqueues in this book, this section is rather short - just a few pages long.<br /><br />All in all, this book did not meet my expectations.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|It had a little of everything, a love story, action, suspense, fiction all wrapped up in a great package, ie Matt Damon.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|The cast of cooks described in this book again show we are all just human.  You couldn't' make this stuff up...real life tells the best stories.

B0079R8IYW|5.0|As cases go, this one is nice. The cover flap is heavy enough to give holding the Fire for transport a solid feeling. I have used other cases (notably for an IPAD) that feel kinda flimsy and bendable. Not this case!

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This is one of those rare books that just hooked me- I think it was a combination of great writing, a well-constructed plot that unfolded at a well-considered pace, decent to great world-building, decent to great characters, and some solid humor. I'll be honest- the book is not perfect and I can see where I am willingly overlooking a big flaw because the rest of the book was so solid. And... what I think of as a flaw may not have been a flaw to others? So, there is a strong element of personal preference in this review.<br /><br />The pluses (and there are a lot). One, this book has some great world-building. This is not earth shattering stuff that has never been seen before in urban fantasy. Rather, TH has taken a lot of familiar urban fantasy/sci fi/paranormal romance elements and given them some slight twists that create a familiar universe. It is creative but, more importantly, it is exceeding well-done. I cannot praise TH's writing enough. She seems like a really mature writer and this book is nicely polished. It is a fast, easy, read. The plot is really well-constructed with an appropriate roller-coaster of danger and adventure but we are nicely balanced by some quiet time where the characters are allowed to develop and a romance develops a lot more naturally. It is a really well-constructed and balanced book. The action is pretty perfect (for my tastes). We have, at least, two solid and discrete action sequences which are plotted really well and have drama, angst, suspense, humor, and romance. The pacing of the whole story is breakneck- a lot happens in a week or two- but it never felt unbelievable or rushed. The author really does a good job of tying up all her loose threads. The characters are mostly really well-developed and have a lot of angles to their characterizations. They are totally reasonable (a pet peeve of mine- when a character behaves unnaturally because they are serving the plot rather than being part of the plot). Anyway, Pia- the heroine- never once struck me as false. I liked her. She was scared sick, irritated to death, brave, funny, and gentle. Her gentleness is perhaps the best part about her overall characterization- it just fit really nicely. I loved, loved, loved the secondary characters- they are super well-drawn when compared to other secondary characters. Finally, and I think this is just what put this book over the edge into five stars territory, there is some genuine humor in the book. Not characters that the author tells you are humorous but, rather, moments where the snappy dialogue and comebacks are witty and I snorted out loud. TH is a clever writer.<br /><br />Next, I have to give a shout out to the potential bones for a series that are deftly laid down in this book. Bravo! So many books are being pushed as a series that the first book always feels like some dull prologue where the author has just spent 200 pages setting up her mystery and her villains and her war/conflict. This book is a fabulous example of how a series SHOULD start- as a darn good story that makes you want to read another one set in the same world.<br /><br />My only complaint- and it is minor because the book still gets five stars- is that I thought that Dragos was a bit inconsistent in his characterization. Now, I loved Dragos- when his character was firing on all cylinders he was a perfect example of an alpha male with a creative twist. He definitely wanted to keep the heroine so he was willing to change for her- so we didn't have to watch him try to be a better person or be some unnatural hero. Rather, we got to see him negotiate with the heroine. He needed to know what she needed and he would deliver. I enjoyed that approach. I enjoyed his indirect approach to love as territorial-ism. It was a solid and amusing approach to the fall of an alpha male. And, it evened up the dynamics between the characters. It had its sweet moments.<br /><br />On the other hand, there were times where it felt like the characterization wasn't meshing as smoothly- there were conflicts with him being alternately really old, really powerful, really plugged in, and really humorless. Like, he was doing some changing outside the narrative. Just a little. But, every so often I would look up and wonder if what Dragos did or said felt right for the character as I was reading him.<br /><br />All in all- this was an above-average book. To my mind, it is an outright gem. I really enjoyed it and can see myself re-reading it in a few months (the absolute highest compliment I can pay a book).  I really think most readers will enjoy this as much or more than I did.on wasn't meshing as smoothly- there were conflicts with him being alternately really old, really powerful, really plugged in, and really humorless.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have had this book in my wish list for awhile and finally had the time to order and read it and WOW WOW WOW, not what I ever could have imagined.  Thrilling, suspenseful and couldn't stop reading - all night, much to my husband's dismay.  Finished it and I'm not giving any hints about the ending.  Great !  You must get it!
B004UJCYYW|5.0|This is volume 1 of the original novel in French. The vocabulary is challenging, but the built-in Kindle dictionary (French-French) is a big help. This is a free Gutenberg Project version, and it has clearly been very carefully proofed and formatted, making it a pleasure to read. This is a very long novel with many chapters devoted to historical background etc, but also with a compelling story to keep it moving.
B00881VLCE|4.0|These puzzles were good beginning puzzles.The pictures were fun to do. The selections were varied to make doing them fun.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Jeez this book tore a hole through my heart. I loved it so much but this is not a happy perfect love story. There is a ton of baggage going on during this book. I loved Sky and how she was at the beginning with her friends, Six and Brekin. Some of the funniest lines were between them. Then Dean Holder enters the picture and I was immediately intrigued as well as confused by, as sky describes it, his multiple personality disorder. Colleen Hoover did an amzing job of weaving the storylines of this book so that it wasn't obvious from the beginning what the twists were. She gave you enough information at the appropriate time so that you could piece it together naturally. The relationship between Dean and Sky was just heartbreaking and amazing all at the same time. I loved it! I was so mesmerized by the bond that they shared and the commitment to each other despite all the tragedies that had fallen on them. The ending was great with out trying too hard to wrap it up in a fancy pretty bow. It had an ending that fit with the emotional feel to the book it didn't try to jar you into an epilogue 5-10 years down the round when everything is magically perfect. It just kind of stated that life is not perfect and will not ever be so. Fantastically amazing story that is exactly what we have come to expect from Colleen Hoover!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is so different from everything I have played, it deserved a review. While most games are about shooting your adrenaline up, this game calls for loads of patience and the ability to look at patterns of movement and predict what will happen next. It is actually calming! Buyer beware: this game is so addictive you will have a hard time putting it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me on edge all the way thru. I enjoyed the twists and turns plotted out. The only problem was THE ENDING! It was unrealistic and unsatisfying.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A few twist and turns but the story dragged a bit to get to where it was going.  I liked it but didn't love it
B000002KZ6|5.0|i listen to this cd all the time, came in good condition and good shape. talking heads, one of the definitive groups of the 80's gotta have some in your collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is analytical and makes you think.  There are a lot of levels you need to pass, so the game will last a while.  I love it as does my daughter but she gets mad at me because I don't think as quickly as she does and I ruin her score.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|I watched this with my 7 and 9 year old.  We all loved it.  It was really clean with no cuss words, bad attitudes, etc.  In fact, I don't think there was even a villian.  Our new favorite for Christmas.
B004A8ZWWY|4.0|I bought this as a gift. Very funny movie. The hotel hallway and elevator scene is hilariously. Recipient was very pleased.
B000002GYG|5.0|all his cd's i've ordered (too many) have come in good shape, music sounds good. love tom waits ...he says it all. my favorite poet in music. hope he lives forever.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is addicting and I can't put it down.  I love the challenge of getting coins and getting as far as I can which isn't that far.  I just got my Kindle Fire and I have to get used to when to turn corners and jump with my finger swiping across a bigger area than the iPod.  My daughter is better at this than I am so she improves my scores.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great little puzzle game to pass the time while waiting in line, for an appointment , etc. Rounds can be completed quickly, becomes more difficult as you progress up the levels and the game remebers where you left off. I have it loaded on my phone and kindle fire
086547897X|5.0|This book is just what I needed to help me learn the basics of animations. It's especially helpful when used with creativity software.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|FANTASTIC movie! You have to watch this movie, the action is terrific, the characters fit together very well and the storyline is amazing. The movie sticks somewhat close to the first issue of the comic where Loki did indeed bring together the superheroes called the avengers.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Didn't think they could beat Jason Bourne, but this guy is good. Good story line, excellent movie, watch it today.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This story is amazing. I can't begin to describe how talented the author is. She brings you in, making you fall in love with each character and making you feel like you are actually there. I can't wait for the sequel. I'm going to pre-order it right now!!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Game requires thinking and strategy. Extremely fun and highly recommended, very entertaining and will keep you from getting board while playing.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This was a good movie but there seemed to be several storylines rehashed from previous Batman movies. The movie is worth watching and was very enjoyable, but did not have a lot of depth in the storyline.

This is a marketplace for people to buy things they want or need and they are the ones who determine the value of an item by how much they are willing to pay for it. Hello?!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is one of my all-time favorites.  It is a beautiful story of love and friendship.  It brought back so many wonderful memories of when I had a four-legged best friend too.  If I ever get another dog, his name will be Enzo!

B009YP9L7U|4.0|I read this book in one day! I couldn't put it down!!! It has so many real life scenarios. Great read!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. My grandkids insisted I watch it so I gave it a try. I live in the southwest and was amazed at the innovative ways the movie used the  local wildlife. Watch for the \\"famous\\" actor who got his break in westerns years ago in a cameo appearance towards the end.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Let's be honest, either you like Kid or you don't. I have not been disappointed yet and that is saying something for my age group. Kid surrounds himself with some talented people and it works for him.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great story for both adults and children.  Very funny way to deliver a great message. Violence is negligible and fairly safe for young ones.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|No matter what she does, she does it exceedingly well, only one new song (only misstep on this collection)  but a great one and some of her biggest hits reworked and slowed down . A really nice group of well written and sung ballads .
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is by far Tom Clancy's best novel.  It kept my interest to the point that I had difficulty putting it down when the time came to  do my daily routine and chores.  I would recommend this book to everyone .....I have read just about all of his books and will in time read them all.  This is the best.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Nothing bad I can say about this.<br />It's the perfect marriage of two of my favorite things.<br />May be there will be a Angry Birds Hobbit version in the future?!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Pretty addicting game, it is a lot of fun to play. It is a beefed up, version of Bejeweled, but with history stuff mixed in.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was gripped from the first page and could not put the story down. Fascinating characters and twists that I didn't see coming. Would love to see a continuation of the story.
0425263916|5.0|what could i possibly say about sylvia day she write some of the best books ever and i cannot waite to read the third book to this series simply amazing
B008FRFN7A|5.0|PRODUCT WAS EASY TO CONFIGURE.  I SET IT UP FOR OTHER ANDROID TABLETS A YEAR AGO, NOW I ADDED MY KINDLE FIRE AND IT WAS EASY TO SET UP.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a Vince Flynn fan especially his Mitch Rapp series.  I read his books as fiction based on facts.  I get a better understanding about the Mid-East from his books than a majority of our press.  Above all, his writing grips me from page one to the end, and I don't want it to end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son loves this game!  It was nice to have this FREE game ready to play when he opened his Kindle Fire.  Thanks!

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much...great graphics<br />Would love to get the next game !!  Thank you for a fun adventure!!!
B006H3MIV8|3.0|I should give this a few more listens before panning it but... it is kind of blah. There are some good cuts but I would suggest listening on itunes first... I would not recommend buying the whole thing. Not sure why I did. Hate the version of &#34;Lay, Lady, Lay.&#34;
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Probably the  funnest app  I have  on my kindle fire.  The different things you can do make the game really fun.  And besides, it involves ponies, making it instantly awesome.

1468161660|5.0|i loved this book the first one in the series and it was so good i would recomend it to all my friends
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only allows ten posts.  This is the worst app ever.  Can't see any pics or posts past that. Hate it. Fix it!
B004UID2LC|1.0|It doesn't work! It buffers for five minutes then will only let you watch five seconds at a time! It keeps stopping to load this is a bad app and sadly doesn't work :(
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you love Batman you should pick the box set up. It has a nice art book inside with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight rises for a great price. It also comes with digital downloads of all of the movies.
0802798225|4.0|pretty good book but it doesent have the passion i was hopeing for from seeing the cover but all in all a good book
0071766588|1.0|The cd does not  work which  is really annoying. Indeed, the cd is the most important part. How can i practice the listening part?
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun to play!  Great for car trips, waiting for the doctor or dentist and when you have a few minutes to fill.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie was awesome. The blu-ray made the movie so crystal clear. I was always a fan of the movie so I decided to pick it up. The only downside is that the digital copy had expired but I guess that is what you expect for a three year old movie.
0375703764|5.0|I've bought 3 copies of this book. First one I read then gave to my sister. Second one I gave as a secret santa present and the third I kept after I realised I couldn't not have this book in my house. It can be challenging to read but it had a profound impact for me and I don't just want to go back to it i feel like I need to.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|not functional and user unfriendly!<br /><br />needs to be redesigned so you can access older stories . I have ended up using the browser to accessfacebook
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Want to buy the game but, after reading reviews about the ads on the purchased games, I'll hold off for a while. The game kicks butt!
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory! I watched this season already and laughed hysterically at most of the episodes. It's just a great show!
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I liked the show although it was a little like porn with all the nudity. The series finale was frustrating, but I still enjoyed it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a great book read it . In two days. I couldn't pin the boo down and I can't wait to see the movie!
B003YCIE68|5.0|I love this movie!  It's been a favorite of mine and my mothers since I was a young child.  We used to watch it on an old VHS tape, that has become to worn to watch.  Glad I could buy it on DVD.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Finally a book that kept me up through the night reading...it's been to long since having to rationalize a 3 hour nights sleep.The book was a little slow at times and of course I wanted a more complete ending but it was a great read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a very intriquing series - full of plots and twists and turns that keep you hooked from one season to the next
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very catching. Kept me reading. I can't wait until the next book.<br /><br />I have a lot of people reading this
B00A757EFW|4.0|Fast and fun. Identical to pacman machine of old. A little too fast for this old broad but well done.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy fun game. My kids enjoy playing this game as well<br />If you have little ones and need to occupy them during trips or just sitting in the doctor office then this is the game for you.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|The LEGO Town Hall is a beautiful piece of work - tall, classy, and impressive. When combined with other LEGO sets in the Creator series, it can serve as the centerpiece of a full street scene. But this is a very nice set by itself, and it can stand alone.<br /><br />To date, I've built three of the \\"modular\\" Creator sets: this one, the Emporium, and the Corner Cafe. This is probably the best one, because it has the sturdiest construction, the coolest look, and the most detailed interiors (with the exception of the Emporium's ground floor). Several of its features are super-cool, including the clock tower, the columns flanking the entrance, and the little LEGO conference room decorated with a globe and potted plants. (My inner nerd was most pleased by all this.)<br /><br />It's time-consuming to build, which might be fun or frustrating, depending on your POV. As with other Creator sets, you build each of the three levels individually, and then stack them together like layers of a wedding cake. The pieces come in bags labeled by level, so be careful you don't mix up your Level 1 and Level 3 bags. :-)<br /><br />Of course, this is an expensive set, but I think it's worth it. Compared with cheaper LEGO sets, this is much more detailed, has many more pieces, and is a really solid construct (cheap sets usually aren't). So I'd highly recommend this as an elite toy for LEGO lovers...Bricktown doesn't get any fancier than this.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it is really easy to use and so convenient! well worth the money to have the app without the ads!!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Quite frankly we were so disappointed..what  a BAD movie..can't figure out why Tom Cruise and Alec Baldwin would even consider signing up for this rendition ..The Broadway musical was much much better..I struggle to write anything positive and can't really see what the other reviewers were speaking of..This one is a definite nodder..we really tried to like it!..Good luck..if you've seen the musical ..you'll be incredibly disappointed..Proceed with caution..
1572816112|5.0|I am very pleased with this tarot deck. The art work on each card is very unique and the card readings are extremely accurate. Very happy!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|After downloading this because it was free I can not recommened this to anyone. Paying for update, font packs, and other things. This is bad company practice. I'll be sticking to Quick Office Pro.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Didn't really get to use this app yet but I has very nice quality and I can't wait to buy some music.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I read a lot, and very few books now bring me to tears... but this one did.  It is a lovely, easy tale of a young underachieving young lady who takes on the companionship of a quadriplegic who had been tragically injuring in a road accident.  This is well written and very moving story.
140053271X|5.0|its great use it everyday ilove it would recomment it for everyone wanting to read very easy to use the b&n nook is wonderful
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I like the form factor, and the fact that it has an independant volume control, and built in equalizer. My only real gripe with it is the location of the detachable clip - It attaches diagonally across the back, which makes it weird to use when clipped to something sometimes. The battery life is pretty good, but with battery life there's always room for improvement. The only downside I noticed with regards to audio is that when you are charging the device and using it simultaneously, there is a high pitched but quiet whine in the sound. It goes away as soon as you unplug the charger. Easy enough to get around - just charge it *before* you use it!<br /><br />Price is great, too.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Every since I found out about amazon I became addicted. But I really like this app and it is reall a good buy
B009VA1FN6|5.0|While most 'who-done-it?' books tend to leave you heart racing, this is a lovely, gentle and very English book - maybe more an uncovering of a long-held family mystery which moves between three different times - the present day and the impending death of the narrator's mother; the narrator reliving a long-held secret which she had witnessed as a child; and the story of her mother's early adulthood in the second wold war.<br /><br />A very enjoyable read.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|First, ignore reviews and opinions. Then, go to your room alone, and without interruption, and with the best speakers or headphones you happen to have, put on \\"The White Album\\" and listen to it from start to finish. Then you'll understand.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book! I highly recommend for every romance novel lover. Perfect amount of suspense and romance as well as other factors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was great!! I normally do not read a book after I have seen th  movie, but I couldn't stop reading.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Great storyline for any baseball fan, Eastwood fan or love story fan.  Nice amount of humor along with a fast moving story.  The ending is perfection!
B002WY65W4|5.0|Not only did I received this copy quickly but it's an awesome copy to begin with !! It was also perfectly wrapped so I knew it was arriving without damage !!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This would be a great movie if didn't have showing of men's behinds.  This makes it hard to watch with children of any age.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this gift for a very good freind on my watched her opened up she was thrilled =) as she was already planning on ordering a copy of this trilogy. So now the sad part she wanted to watch \\"The Dark Knight\\" apparently her set was missing the disc! we were really confused on what could have happened because it was sealed really good and ordered it from directly amazon. I'm in the process with amazon in getting another copy hope all goes well on this one!<br /><br />I don't blame amazon for this but really what a embarrassing moment..<br /><br />The boxart was really nice and the disc looked pretty sleek gave the movie high rating cause its all you would need in one package to enjoy the trilogy!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I just like it.  I play it on my computer all the time. It is a differant than the computer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app more than my physical bible it travels well and very easy to use,not alot of bells and whistles but thats what I wanted
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|This was a great movie and I would suggest this to anyone.  My teenage daughter and I loved it.  It was well written and directed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I can't help but feel disappointed in this ending book. It takes you through Katniss' end and what happens to the victors who were not taken away with Katniss, but rather by the capitol. It then takes you through all the mental breakdowns, makes you suspicious of what you had previously hoped would be the salvation to all the problems in this series, and make you wonder when something good will happen.<br /><br />This last book took me the longest to complete, simply because I felt it dragged on at times (of course, I tend to like books more filled with action, versus drama). However, the ending was satisfying and what I would have liked to see. If you've gotten this far in the series, don't stop now!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a good game to pass the time of day when you don't want to have to stay on it for a long time or if you have to go and do something in a hurry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All the characters came to life for me!<br /><br />What a great read, I cannot wait to read all the other books!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|good game. easy to play don't have to spend extra money.  well buy the next addition. only problem to short.
1476715904|5.0|I dont write books. However, if I had written this book I would be proud.<br />No vampires, no witches, no end of the world, with mutant zombies. Just plain touching real life.<br />Loved it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It is something I wasn't I wasn't expecting to like but I do.  I find I'm not all that good at it yet.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|i like this book.  It has helped me on my personal endeavors to lose weight.  I am losing it more slowly than the book says, but, I am also not following the book totally to the letter.  I am liking the results and the guidelines established by the book, very helpful, thanks!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Ordered this because already have Rod Steward album of  oldi standards with duets. Same great quality but with Christmas songs.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Wow this is amazing & scary at the same time - interesting to see what goes on &#34;behind the scenes&#34; - Claire Danes pulls off this role with flying colors - definitely recommend this to all action & spy fans, can't wait until season 2 to see how the story continues.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I just found it on cloud.  I haven't had a chance to play it.  So I can't really rate it.  It was to go on my device not in cloud.  Is there a way to get it there?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really cannot say enough about this book. I absolutely loved it. Finished it in one sitting because I could not put it down. I loved Holder and Sky... Has become one of my favorite books... If you have not read it, go get it :)
B000SGGUWS|5.0|These books are amazing.I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.This is by far my favorite.5 stars.
B004K4AVAG|3.0|I'm a Lady Gaga fan but wasn't that thrilled with this CD as I was her first CD - however for those die-hard fans, still recommend adding this to your collection
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss' \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is the first book in a fantasy series called \\"The Kingkiller Chronicles\\".  The book centers around Kvothe (pronounced Quothe) and begins with him posing as an unsuspecting inn keeper in a sleepy little town.  Immediately, the reader discovers that there is much more to this man than meets the eye.  At some point, a scribe comes to town looking to document the story of the famous Kvothe and we are rushed back into the past to relive the whole story through the eyes of Kvothe himself.<br /><br />This book has its ups and downs.  The background story of Kvothe's childhood, the tragic loss of his parents, his education at the university, and his love of the elusive Denna are all very interesting and entertaining.  The problem with the book is that Rothfuss is somewhat long winded.  This book comes in at a hefty 672 pages and it easily could have been trimmed down to 600.  There are several places in the book where things start to drag a bit, and a couple of places where it drags on badly.  I hope this doesn't turn out to be the Achilles Heel for Rothfuss, because I certainly see greatness in the story.  I have to admit though, I'm a little nervous as I start the second book in the series.  It rings in at a full thousand pages.<br /><br />\\"The Name of the Wind\\" definitely has more \\"ups\\" than \\"downs\\" and sets the stage for what could be a very compelling series.  Only time will tell, but I give this first installment four out of five stars.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great fan of G5 games and this one didn't disappoint. Very happy with the price. Definitely lasted long enough with the right a mount of childcare as challenge.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|played for hours.  My family is fighting over the tablet just to play this game.  Looks a lot better than the free web version.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|While I knew what to expect (I watch Famiy Guy and American Dad all the time) I guess I didn't consider the time. While the 30 minute TV shows are funny, the hour long movie kind of dragged on for me.
0385344325|4.0|This is one of many in this series of books that is a good read! Make sure you read One Shot, thats the one that the movie is based on.
B007XHWROK|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas but once he opened it I think I've been listening to it more than him!LOL  It's a great cd and came brand new and in plenty of time to wrap for Christmas.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a good game do relaxing after a rough day at work. My kids love this game as well! Cute graphics
B0098VYCCE|4.0|A dark twist on the snow white fairy tale! I was pleasantly suprised by the special effects in the movie! The evil queen scared the hell out of my kids! Definately not a kid-friendly movie, but damned good for adults. I didn't even have to tell them to leave the room, they left ot their own accord! Get your popcorn ready, ladies and gentlemen!
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book, I love it!!!  Easy and quick to read and very interesting and useful!  I 100% recommend this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a fantastic and wonderful read! I absolutely could not put it down, and read it within a resort hours. It was funny, sweet, and heart wrenching.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I watch this over and over. If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you :)<br /><br />seriously.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|this movie was a lot of fun, although a lot of the action was slightly over the top. Not complaining,tho!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really convenient way to get the bible into your everyday schedule.Any time I find myself bored I just being it up on my kindle or my phone and read my plans.I love there are so many different devotionals and plans to fit whatever you are going through.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I luv this game. One of my fave games!!!  I definitely recommend this awesome game!!. Also, please give this game a five-star or four star rating. ,
B007TNS6JI|1.0|The screen shots looked amazing IMO, however after trying several times a day for an entire week- i have yet to actually get this game to run.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie was very entertaining! I couldn't stop watching! We watched it three times to make sure we did not miss anything! Conspiracy theorists will just love this!I am eagerly awaiting the next installment!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like hog games with a story and puzzles. This has all three. The graphics were great. It was a fun game with lots of hints. Would love to see a sequel.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|easy to navigate and very comprehensive. I liked the way it gave so many variations of a word you looked up..
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great way to pass the time and keep your mind from going stale. Anybody can play and it's a good way for kids to learn.
1603429999|5.0|This is an excellent text for beginning and intermediate knitters.  The explanations and pictures are very hlpful.  I have improved my skills signifigantly using this book.
0425263916|5.0|I hope sylvia continues this series as it is a great series that keeps you wanting more I can not wait for the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is one of the best...it is fun but it is hard, downloaded it on to my new Asus tablet and i just love it. The game looks fairly easy.......dont be fooled ........and I am playing the free one. Wonder how the paid one compares and what it gives you? I may have to find out! If you are looking for great graphics try this one .....get something to drink and take a break you will enjoy spending time with this guy that is running for his life!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I ordered this movie in HD and we watched it on my daughters new smart TV and it was like sitting in the movie theater.  The picture and sound were superb.  Great movie to watch with your young adult child.  Very entertaining.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Not a huge fan of The Beatles but the person I gave this to as a gift really liked it.
0887308589|3.0|I bought this book new, but it was a little beat-up (mainly the front flap). I was just expecting a product that didn't appear worn at all.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Really  like Connelly. Have read almost all of his books and enjoyed every one of them.  A mystery lover's favorite author for sure.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Time to pick up the learning again. Ferris deciphers learning in an easy to use guide that will not only help you cook but also teach you secrets of world class chefs, allow you to impress love ones with cool techniques (in and out of the kitchen) and rejuvenate your skin and sex drive with the hottest new superfood - pine pollen -<br />Pick this book up if you want to learn properly<br />Teachers should be using these methods to teach their students, high school would have been more fun!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Definitely worth the read! Hope the movie stays true to the book. Ending was great. Didn't see it coming at all!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|So good! I can never expect what is coming and the acting is Amazing! I can't wait until more come out!
034580404X|4.0|This was overall a fun read.  The same storyline got rather boring, so it was nice when other characters were brought in.  Definitely not and educational read, but it was a fun distraction.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really enjoy my time using this app.  I will read the Word more often and spend better time learning about Who the Trinity is-God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Son and the Holy Spirit-as 3 Persons in One God.
B000VT7AUS|5.0|There is s synergistic sound between her singing and playing of the piano. Diana not only looks the part, but her sounds are like the words described in &#34;The Look of Love&#34;. This is why I especially care for her singing. She imparts her feelings into the way she thinks they should sound. And this is true with all her songs. It just so happens she not only sings the part but also plays the part and leaves the rest to your imagination.<br /><br />&#34;you go girl&#34;
B0076DELIG|4.0|I've been waiting too long for the next Harry Bosch novel.  I've read them all and this rates right up there amont the rest.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series too!  Another that is much like 50 shades but a must read.  Love the twists.  Couldn't put it down.
B008MM9630|3.0|Free daily genie takes 4 days for the 24hrs to count down. When moving items they don't want to place where put. They jump a few spaces over.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Nice game. I like the graphics but the pictures could be a bit larger. The story is ok too. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes the find and seek games.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Almost lost me during the first one third of the novel.  However, I'm glad I hung in there through the ending.  On balance, I think the book is way over-rated.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Really enjoyed and would love to see more of it. The storyline and timeline tied to other entertainment to add to the story.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you're a spartacus fan you won't be disappointed.  You can watch, stop, watch again and then rewatch anytime you want.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Just loved this album when you here the first note you can tell it's pure Aerosmith. There is not one bad song on this album. But if I had to pick one thing, that would be there are too many ballads. The ballads are good but I would of perfered more classic hard rock songs.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was my first book that I've read on my Kindle! It was defiantly worth reading! Can't wait to read the next two books!!!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|The product got her within 2 days.  It was exactly what I wanted.  It contained the combo pack that I was looking for.  The price was great! Thanks!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love Spartacus.  Awesome.  Not like anything else you've ever seen on TV.  It is bloody but spellbinding.  You can't stop watching.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|seems ok so far. they told me to write a review for more points, and since I have no intention of paying money for this app, here we are.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Mind numbingly difficult, frustrating as all heck. Addictive as heroin. Cute as bunnies. Genius. I have a love hate relationship with this game. In that I love it and hate that I am so bad at it. Definitely recommended to any puzzle lover.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Love the show. Watched all 8 Season so far and they just announced season 9. I would recommend this show to anyone.
B001706I5I|5.0|Looked all over for this movie to have for Christmas.  Everyone was out of stock in stores here in Bakersfield.  Of course, Amazon had the best price and they got it to my before Christmas.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Actually I suck so bad at it I'm embarrassed to tell most people. I am slowly beginning to learn to use this application and impressed every time I discover another way this application helps me to do something my kindle fire H D does not seem capable of doing on its own no matter how long I try. It seems to be having no problem whipping my kindle into shape.Very glad I downloaded this.
1416575464|5.0|Have not read yet, looked at it looks good, with great pics and ideas that look uncomplicated, looks simple and easy to follow
B005K0HDGE|5.0|All the flavor of his best work blends deliciously with the substance  of a momentous event in America. Faithful Reader, you will not be disappointed!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Have loved Phillip Phillips from his audition on American Idol and voted and rooted for him the whole time. He is the epitome of humble real talent. What an amazing voice!
0307951529|5.0|Guillebeau offers good insight and critical process for individuals desiring to start an online or other micro to small business.
0817439390|4.0|Great book. My cousin who’s into photography recommended it when I got my DSLR camera. I think it’s great for beginners who are just venturing out into the DSLR world…..it explains things and all the basics in fairly non-technical terms. All the tech stuff can get rather over whelming not to mention boring at times and this book keeps it interesting with good examples.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|THis movie is just bad from the beginning to the middle which is when I stopped watching it.  It didn't make any sense and seemed to create more questions that couldn't possibly be answered coherently in a frenzied final scene or two.<br />Really bad.  Feel sorry for all the good actors that got duped into being in this one
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book! Really enjoyed the development of the zombie story. But we still don`t know what it is. Gods wrath or simply a disease.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The book was just as great as all the others. I couldn't but it down. I finished it in three days even though I wanted to draw it out. Just couldn't stop.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it. So captivating! A successful show has lot of heart and meaningful human drama. This has it . Great setting too.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|well shot, good-moving picture<br />has alot of action and ups and downs. Isn't the greatest film ever but definitely worth watching
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I bought this as a present and he absolutely loved it, the picture is clear and crisp.  The three seasons are in containers. Would highly recommend especially for avid Star Trek fans! Worth the price.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app does not work on the kindle fire and some of the games that you log in through facebook will not work if this app is installed - deleted it and go through the web
1601253788|5.0|This book (like all the other Pathfinder books) is heavy, with a beautiful glossy cover and an absolute pleasure to hold. Each page in the Bestiary is decorated with beautiful artwork and filled with everything you need to know to fill your campaigns with exotic monsters.<br /><br />I particularly liked the oriental-inspired monsters which are great for creating an Eastern-fantasy setting!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Clint is going to be typecast soon...or he's being typecast.  THis movie isn't bad, its pretty entertaining once you get past the first half hour to 45 min.  After that the movie starts to roll and it loses some of its depressing quality for a more upbeat and comedic feel.  Still sad, but happy ending helps.<br />Worth watching if you are bored and like clint and amy adams and timberlake.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Slammed and Point of Retreat, I didn't think it was possible to top those books. I was mistaken. This book was amazing.
B005HMHPGI|5.0|This is an excellent movie. The documentary that comes with the movie is also excellent. This is an excellent collector's giftset.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like it because it is fun and the challenge levels is just about right.  Hard to make it through the levels but if you keep at it you can do it.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Very informative and a great  show.  Its good to see all these great icons playing and touring.  He realy enjoys being on stage and making music.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An OK read, but not one of his best compared to earlier novels.  In many ways, it was pretty convoluted.
0307720950|4.0|This is an important book. Maker's is basically a sequel to The Longtail. It's a deep look at what happens to the manufacturing (mostly in America) when physical manufacturing behaves like the digital world. If this book doesn't make you want to go out and buy a 3D printer or start putting together OpenHardware robots, I don't know what will.
1476719071|5.0|I love this book! The hardcover & being signed make it that much better! Its beautiful! If you love beautiful disaster you will love this!
B009186JYI|5.0|Another great video about the Rolling Stones.  Some of the information I have seen on other DVD, but a lot of new information.  Overal a great DVD.
B001706I5I|2.0|Does anyone recall when Robin Williams made Popeye? This is Jim Carreys Popeye. Clunky and more than a little annoying.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I had a day off from work and ended up playing this through the day. It's fun when people actually draw something and I liked being able to start games with my kids on their ipod touches and tablets.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is great, similar to the book, will not be dissapointed! Packed with action, romance, surprising plots and adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a lot of fun.  I just wish i'd remember that I have a hoverboard/skateboard ever now and then...
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My teenage son Loves the Dark Knight and this was the perfect Christmas present for him. He loves having all three movies in one package. This made a great gift for an adult teenage boy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Eh, it's alright. The drag seems to lag quite a bit. Playing on a fire hd. Good to kill time with.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded on to my Kindle Fire.  Love it.  Very fun.  Definitly a great way to pass the time.  Haven't stopped playing it.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Any serious student of probability should read this. Prior knowledge of baseball is optional, and in fact, may even detract from the experience.
0205313426|5.0|The Elements of Style is a concise reference for grammar, paragraph structure, and proper usage of words and phrases.  I'm a student teacher, and it's been my most used book for making lesson plans when covering writing conventions and research papers.  I highly recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wasn't interested in the game at first but tried it because of recommendation and really enjoy it. It is addicting.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Love the squirrel as usual.  You wait all movie for his appearances.  NIce Christmas Eve movie for us.<br />Enjoyed it.
145210655X|5.0|Got this for my 8 year old Star Wars freak.  Given that I am a 35 year old Star Wars freak, I jumped when I saw this.  It is pretty funny.  It mixes movie quotes with odd situations, so it's a good laugh for all ages.
B008220AVW|5.0|It was exactly what my daughter wanted and she loved it.  Service and price exceeded my expectations.  Definitely recommend it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|But frustrating! Worth it though, don't give up. Keeps you thinking. Just cancel your plans for the night before you start this game.
141659521X|5.0|Last Man  is nonstop action from beginning to end. It is intelligently written and an absolute page turner. It is so engrossing that it is hard to put it down and it makes you forget all about time and what chores you may have to do. All and all it is a nonstop fun ride.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A combination of hilarity and toe curling embarassment.  Definitely hits a nerve. Both actors are absolutely superb. Definitely worth seeing.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|I deeply respect Michael Crichton. There are some really, really great books of his. However, this is not one of them.
B0098460O4|4.0|After their brilliant performance in their Britain's Got Talent audition, I wondered about several things like how would Jonathan do with a less dramatic piece and could they balance each other on a serious duet. They do have very different styles of voice and selecting repertoire to perform effectively could be difficult. Jonathan answered my first concern with the \\"Ave Maria.\\" His \\"small\\" voice is clear and solid and works very well with Charlotte's more pop voice. Their signature song, \\"The Prayer\\", is more polished and balanced than their audition performance, if a little less dramatic. I particularly liked the \\"Il Mondo E' Nostro\\" and was definitely surprised with \\"La Prima Volta,\\" having not heard this as anything but a solo piece and not in Italian. If I have any complaints they would be fairly techincal. In a couple of places I felt the orchestration and background chorus was a little heavy for their voices, but I was not listening to it on a very high quality system. That may go away with a better sound system. The other concern is that all of the songs appear to have been selected to showcase Jonathan's outstanding voice. Charlotte held her own but many of the selections had her singing in her upper register, ala Sarah Brightman. She has a very nice, solid voice but to me she carries more weight with Jonathan in her lower register. In conclusion, as I listened to this for the first time, I came away totally captivated at the maturity of both of their voices. Individually and together, they can only improve as they age and gain confidence in who they are and what they are capable of achieving. This is a keeper especially to compare it to what they will be doing ten years from now.
B009A9SULS|1.0|I was pretty excited to get my first ereader, but this one will have to go back.<br /><br />I finally found the manual for it, but for the information I was looking for, it just referred me back the their help website, that doesn't have the information I needed.  I did manage to get a couple of PDF books I have loaded onto it, but it is too small to read.  When I zoom in, I have to constantly scroll from side to side (even with the document view set to sideways), and I still can't read all the text because of the dark page turn bar.<br /><br />I've spent way too much time trying to get a free book that I downloaded directly from Kobo to work on this device.  Their help is no help, as it doesn't recognize the error message their device is giving me.<br /><br />After several hours (and I'm fairly tech savvy), I have managed to read a total of two lines of text on the device, and had to guess at several of the words at that!<br /><br />I would recommend getting a better known ereader.  I'm completely dissatisfied with this one.
B008J34466|5.0|I wish I could have liked her earlier than this! She is so amazing and inspiring, I'm glad to be her fan :)
B0074AGVWK|5.0|This is another great read by a great author, she has put into a story what a lot of parents would really like to do when their children are grown and still at home!
B009MF56GC|5.0|on time, my husband wanted it so bad. great movie loved every moment. with a sly stallone fan as a husband, this was awesome
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Ok I have to admit it I'm hooked on these birds and pigs. It the only game I play constantly, its addicting good thing i like to read and do other things or I might not do anything else.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. I have reset this app 6 times and it so fun. I highly recommend this app to everyone
B005CA4SJW|5.0|My husband loved it. Arrived on time, good presentation and quality. Good price for being limited edition. cool cool and cool
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|great job. on time. great gift to give for SOA lovers all over. cant wait to watch it with my family
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|I don't know why I ordered this i don't like Stallone this movie is so like him loud obnoxious and stupid.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Our 9 and 6 year olds love this movie. They have the stuffed versions of the Chipmunks and develop their own story lines for adventures. There is no limit to what these characters get into....lots of laughs....lots of ALVINNNNNNNNNN!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Just got this for the kindle and my kids love it.  I have been through many versions of this app and they keep making it better.  There are many other weather apps but this one is user friendly and very accurate.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My son plays this all the time. It's like an interactive story and that's great. Even I get into the game. And it gives you hints which it even better! Highly recommended!
B004GJVI5C|5.0|Ben Affleck is a great writer and actor and this was another great movie. I love the characters and the way the movies is weaved. Can't say more watch it.
B00519YRH2|5.0|This is a gift for my son. He enjoyed this as a teenager and wants his girls to see it. Haven't gotten the chance yet but can't see any bad side to it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This was really helpful in allowing programs to be installed on the kindle that were not already loaded, and because it keeps everything on the SD card you lose no memory and thus maintain speed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is for all those puzzlers in the world! With awesome Inators and tough puzzles, it's the perfect app with a Disney mix!
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|With all the actor in this and Bruce Willis I thought it would be real good as it turned out it was just ok , a bit fractured for my taste.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great movie, the packaging was soft and caused a little concern but seems the Disc is just fine, no scratches and seems safe.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A great read! I recently saw the play in Milwaukee and it was simply amazing! When I saw this was free I had yo read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Riveting from start to finish. I literally finished it in less than 24 hours. Couldn't put it down! Going to start the next one now.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoyed the book but out of the entire series this one was my least favorite. I've read all the others in chronological order, even Term Limits. Like all the characters and the stories this one just didn't seem to be up to the same level for some reason. Just couldn't give it a 3 star though.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|it was not as good as the first one but i really enjoyed it all the same, would buy it again
B0013FNC38|5.0|This album was amazing. It could be mostly for people that like chill soul music. This cd is easy to sing to since its sort of a relaxing album.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Excellent game, Simple, fun, very addictive, and easy to pick up. Who knew destroying the world could be so much fun? Well worth .99
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is the one movie I could watch over and over again! Love it!! The amazon prime rental was very easy to use on our Xbox too! So cool :)
030758836X|5.0|This book was absolutely incredible, but I am a little biased. I fell in love with the author, Gillian Flynn, in high school when I read her first novel, Sharp Objects. I can't recommend this author highly enough for anyone who enjoys thrillers that require a lot of thinking.<br /><br />Gone Girl is based around a married couple, Nick and Amy, and is in both of their points of views. The first half of the book is present-day Nick and diary entries from Amy starting from when she first met her future husband. In the first look at Nick he seems a little off, and then Amy is missing. There's been a struggle in the living room that doesn't look legit and blood has been cleaned, but not well enough, in the kitchen. The entire first half Nick is acting odd and Amy's diary makes it obvious who she was fearful of.<br /><br />And then everything comes to a head, multiple clues come to light, insane realizations are made and everything you thought you understood up to that point was just wrong. It was amazing! Flynn keeps you guessing the entire novel and the ending is not what you'd expect. I'll admit, the ending was a bit less climatic than I thought it would be from her other novels but it was still shocking and I'm still absorbing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel!
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|OK so I took a chance on this show without really knowing a lot about it and was very pleased. The characters are well formed even for season one and they are funny as hell to boot. The main character's side kick Kenzie is really the best out of all of them, she rocks! If you like weird out of this world shows this one is for you.
B0099114WO|1.0|The previews of this movie on television made it look like a romantic comedy, which my wife and I both enjoy, but after ordering and watching it we realized it was a very heavy handed and cumbersome drama.<br /><br />All the cast members are fantastic actors! Hope Springs should have been an Oscar candidate with this powerful cast, but this show is a total flop. The cast, I believe did the best job that they could with what they had, but the script stunk on ice. It was not at all enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />I used to think that Fargo was the biggest waste of film, and the worst movie I'd ever seen, but Hope Springs out bombed it by a mile, and then some!<br /><br />My advice is don't waste you money on this DVD, but if you did, do what I'm going to do, use it for skeet shooting. It would make a much better clay pigeon than a movie.
B000009ED0|5.0|Was a hard choice to choose what cd to buy but this was a winner. Well packaged and shipped when promised
B0019N8P2W|5.0|These dvd's take me back to my teenage years. I love that I were able to get all seasons and I didn't break the bank. I had no problem with shipping and the product works well.
B0068RQ85K|3.0|Probly my fault.  We had gizmos in the army... Nothing like these.  Ours were bigger -- and better, frankly.  Wasn't nothing we could not do with our gizmos.

B005G5PPGS|3.0|Interesting read but best if you haven't already seen the movie which is pretty true to the book. Does open your eyes to seeing baseball in a different light.
B000W4KT64|4.0|If you like musicals you will like this movie. I think they did a good job on this remake and I really enjoyed John Travolta.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|IZ's &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; is one of my favorite covers of this song.  I bought a copy for me and one for my dad.  I enjoy it very much.  I can only feel happy when listening to it.
B006O3MU96|1.0|This type of game may appeal to some players but not to me. It was boring and repetitive. The End
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|excelent music and recording.. everything was perfect when i get it. thank u for been so fast in sending the item
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is as good as &#34;The Wire&#34;.  I'll be ordering season 2 this week.  Acting is great.  Action unrelenting.  I can't wait to see next episode.
0307594009|5.0|I first read this book as a young girl, half a century ago. Then I bought it for my daughter when she was eleven. My most current purchase of the Diary was for a granddaughter, who is nearly eleven. On her Christmas list, she asked for books that would help her understand war from a historical perspective. I believe every American child, of any race or ethnicity, should learn about the wars in which our country has been involved, beginning with the Revolutionary War, and should understand why our young men are sent to fight, and perhaps die, in these wars. The Diary of a Young Girl is the perfect introductory book on the subject of World War II, introducing the horrific details of Adolph Hitler's Third Reich in a way that is manageable for an eleven- or twelve-year-old. The fact that Anne didn't survive, while not entirely in keeping with our modern tendency to shield our children from anything that isn't warm and pink and fuzzy and happily-ever-after, is a necessary part of the story. I'd venture to say that any young girl who reads this book will remember Anne Frank's experiences for a lifetime, will remember details of the historical setting in which Anne lived and died, and will have a better grasp of the history of World War II.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Very different kind of a book.  I couldnt' read it fast enough!  You had clues along the way so you weren't left in the dark and you really felt yourself connecting to the main character!  I LOVED IT!
B0086700CM|3.0|It's a fun game but it takes a few minutes to load.  I really can't say too much about it because I haven't really played it that much but my son loves it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I definitely liked this book. I don't even know what to type without giving too much away, but by the ending I'm sure you will be satisfied that you picked this. Great story, lots of twists and turns, and definitely keeps you reading!
1609611543|3.0|I was slightly disappointed with this book. It seemed like it started out with some helpful information about what wheat can do to some people who may be intolerant or allergic to gluten products. The first 2 chapters are devoted to the science behind the effects of wheat on the human body- mind you not every is susceptible. Some of the medical descriptions and processes wre a bit boring and could fly over the heads of the average reader. By the 3rd chapter this was where he lost me. I felt like i as reading straight from the pages of the Atkins diet book. I have a problem with those in the medical field who would advocate avoiding certain fruits and vegetables altogether because they they are somehow bad for you, but run straight for the block of cheese and bacon for breakfast instead. Really? Show me the person dying of heart disease because they have eaten too many bananas and carrots. I think not. There are far better books out there if you think you may be suffering from a wheat or gluten issue. I give this 2.5 stars because there are some pieces of good infomation. He is not a hard writer to read in fact his style can be elementary at times. But ultimately he leads you down a low carb lowfat diet that is unhealthy at best.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Been forever since I've  picked a novel up an  read  it. I'm big on movies (see them as an art form) and they take up all of my time. I watched Finches's film version first and knew I had to read the novel. For you critics, I tried  watching the Swedish version and  everything seemed inferior. I.e. camera direction, storyline, and Rapace just seemed like a model in Goth whereas Mara seemed more realistic and believable. I'd like to quickly add  I love foreign film  and usually prefer them, but not  in this  case. Back to the novel, I started  it and just couldn't put  I  down. I love the Lisbeth character and Mikel isn't so bad either. The beauty of the book is, it feels like the reader itself is solving a murder and investigating financial crimes. I felt like I was  in the room with them examining the evidence and looking at photos. At times the book gave m  goosebumps from suspenseful or disturbing scenes, and the ending even made me tear up. If  you're reading this and debating whether or no  to read it, trust your gut and dive into the addicting novel that critiques  ongoing sexually violent crimes  and  the financial institutions in place.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Use it all the time and think its great , I can keep up with all of my friends and enemies so I know what they are up to or planning.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked the book. Was very suspenseful had you think you think what is going to happen next. The ending was great and really satisfying.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. In fact, I can't wait to get started on the second book.<br />This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I just couldn't put it down.<br />However, I did find the book seemed to make me very hungry at times.<br />I would recommend this book to any one who enjoys a good action book with a touch of blind romance.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It was a pretty funny movie and yes even tho all the girls were plain but they were gorgeous it was a great comedy and awesome music but really wondering if it was all there real singing

B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first I wasn't quite sold on this book. The style of writing was one that I wasn't too fond of. But believe me when I say this book was absolutely amazing. It had and affect on me more than any other books before that I've read because it is truly relatable. The feeling Charlie goes through are things everyone can connect to in some way. Unlike books like twilight, this book faces things teens face in everyday life and put them into a new light. I highly recommend this book for everyone. Happy reading.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Most of the songs are pretty good. If you like Taylor Swift, this is a good CD because she's pretty much doing the same thing.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Don't start me on this movie.  It and Slyfall were may favorite 2 films of 2012.  This arrived in the condition as described and within the time that was promised.  No issues at all.  love(d) it!
B008YKRRIQ|4.0|I've always generally liked Klemperer's Beethoven and Brahms recordings, although I'm not in 'worship' mode where he is concerned. Some of these recordings sound a<br />bit congested and they lack the dynamic range of the current state of the art. I must say though, that I found some pleasant surprises among the works I wouldn't have associated Klemperer with such as the Symphonie Fantastique and the Tchaikovsky symphonies 4-6. The Midsummernight's Dream and Mendelssohn 4 were enjoyable; the Mendelsohn 3 and the Schumann symphonies less so. The Schubert 9th and the Franck Symphony were also better than I expected. This reasonably priced collection contains plenty of recordings which were either absurdly expensive or impossible to find previously, so grab it before it's deleted.
B003O86FMW|2.0|In order to understand this book, you should have read the first one, and b/c i wanted to borrow other books, i didn't get to finish this . Heard it was a good read though!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I now have all of the seasons of House that are out.  I like his humor, though it's not for everyone.
B004EK926K|4.0|This is a great adaptation of an old classic. It's funny, but probably not great for the younger kiddos. Some parts are kind of scary.
B003L20IJM|4.0|Not what I would expect from Emma but it is a delightful piece of comedy that keeps you into it.
B000B5XOYI|4.0|Bought this for my son.  It is a nice boxed set for a Batman fan. Plus, it was a good price
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I have yet to watch the series, but I've read the books, and they're great. I've heard pretty good things, so I assume it's good!

Please go on with the winchesters and give us the fans a second volume of this awesome and marvelous book!!

B00AMBK6J2|2.0|This is truly a case of the best lines of the movie being shown in the previews. Huge disappointment.  Don't waste your time or money.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Lightweight & no trouble staying on while I'm on the stairclimber. I wish the cord was a little longer, but for the money, these are great headphones.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Well it was a page turner, that is for sure. Half of the time I was thinking I shouldn't be reading this, It is too dark. But, it was like when you turn on a scary movie and you really want to bed. Instead you stay awake so you don't have a nightmare wondering who wins in the end.<br />I usually can figure out what is going on in books and movies. However, not this one, it throw me off. I read it a couple days. The story line is pretty twisted and there is a lot of violence.
B0076DELIG|2.0|It seems to me that  the author spends more time writing about named places to eat in the LA area than on the plot.  I know where Harry Bosch ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner (and what he ate) for the duration of the novel...take-out and lunch trucks are even mentioned here.  As to the plot it was interesting but seemed that the author decided to wrap it up in thirty pages.  One minute it's an interesting story, and, after lunch and description of place and food...bang it's over and let's go home.<br />Good fast food fiction, and the Harry Bosch saga continues.

B008OE05IG|5.0|This is an excellent documentary about an amazing individual, an 85-year old sushi chef with an unsurpassed passion for his craft. It is a poignant story, from his perspective as well as his sons and apprentices. This one is not to be missed even if you don't like sushi--like me!
B0050SYS5A|2.0|It was a waste of money.  It did not work and we are not using it.  I do not recomend this product.
B009HELT3C|3.0|glad we didn't buy the movie and rented it first. it's a great watch but not one to own. there is nothing outstanding about it that would make me want to see it again
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Good one!!  Jack Reacher will get to Virginia so day...but this is a nice book although Reacher is toned down a bit...not much, just a bit.  Recommended.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A good read, interesting to have a dog as the narrator.  It was hard to put down.  I wanted to read more.

B00A0R42L6|4.0|good movie, great HD picture, the scenes where it would have been 3D are a little &#34;puke-riffic&#34; but other than that this is another great addition to the Ice Age line of movies
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son loves this game. I wish in game purchase content wasn't so relayed so much. Would be expensive if I allowed my son to buy what the game suggests he needs.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is a very high quality kindle edition of a classic story. And of course the price can't be beat!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have enjoyed each and every book in the series.  I admire Martin's thoroughness in character, his unexpected choices, and the way his web of story lines swing and sway into one another and away again.  I think those disappointed readers who miss the excitement of 'Storm of Swords' or feel their favorite characters aren't getting enough 'page time' are missing the point.  Put your expectations aside and let the tale engulf you.  Relinquish your needs and wants and let the story take you on its journey (not yours).  Isn't that what a good tale is meant to do?...  Propel you to escape into an imaginative world as you race and tumble down its path.  I'm a bit tired of those nauseating reviewers who are overlooking the fantastic storytelling in the last couple of books.  Lets take a look at the bigger picture.  Not appreciating these books is like wearing a suit without the belt.  It may not be the flashiest part, but the belt is what assists in holding it all together.  I like to see this series as one massive book.  We are still on the path.  Lets wait to judge until the road has ended.  For now I prefer to relish the amazing story Martin has painted thus far.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Not a steamy romance but a sweet one. Enjoyed the read. Did have some twists so it wasn't to predictable. Overall enjoyed the book.
0385737947|5.0|I read this book and was hooked on it. A first time Dashner reader; about half way thru the book I went out and bought the remaining books in the series. You want a good book; this is one of them.
B0086213XW|5.0|When I first watched the trailer, I tagged this as a chick flick for later viewing... I couldn't have been more wrong with that categorization. The characters and story line were relatable and well developed. 'Ya know that feeling when you finish a good book and you feel a little blue because it's over and you just want more? This is exactly how I feel after watching the movie- I want more! I want to know what comes next. I want to hug/love Seth Rogen... I want to have drinks and girltalk with Michelle Williams... I want to do naughty things to that other guy (Luke Kirby) :) Seriously though... great movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i just finished this book and i have been left breathless! i dont know what to say but you must read this book colleen does such an excellent job with the writing and just when i thought i had the whole story figured out there are more surprises around the corner.  i cant believe i am going to say this but this book was better then slammed or POR. i will read anything by colleen hoover

B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really felt for the lead character, the author did well at making her seem real.  The storyline was good, suspenseful enough to keep you entertained but I was pretty sure I knew what had happened and guessed the ending quickly.  All in all I would reccomend this book.
B008J34466|4.0|Pink, as always, has alot to say, I mean sing about.  This cd too has a number of really good songs on it with even better lyrics.  With the exception of a song in which, unfortunately, for herself, she demeans herself a bit too much for my taste.  Otherwise, this Diva is rocking as usual
0321885112|5.0|I know what you're thinking.<br /><br />\\"I can't do Sketchnotes, because I'm not an artist!\\"<br />\\"I've never been good at taking notes.\\"<br />\\"I used to take notes, but they never did me any good so I stopped.\\"<br /><br />If that's you, then hello! You're just like me. Let me quickly tell you where I'm coming from.<br /><br />I'm not an artist - at least not on paper. I don't draw well, my \\"straight\\" lines are wobbly, my circles are either flat or lumpy most of the time, and when I draw squares I usually don't get the corners to all connect properly. If I need a perfect square, I either get out a ruler or fire up Photoshop. Seriously.<br /><br />I've never been good at taking notes, because the teachers in the schools I went through each had their own, separate methods we were expected to learn - and none of them actually taught us to take notes anyway. They just made us copy them from the overhead projector. And because of that, I couldn't make heads or tails of the gibberish notes I always wound up with.<br /><br />That's where I'm coming from, and I'm telling you that I can do Sketchnotes.<br /><br />That's because Sketchnotes are far less about the visual perfection of your work, far less about capturing every nitpicky detail, and far more about helping your brain engage with the information in a different way.<br /><br />And that's exactly what this book teaches you to do. This book isn't just about giving artists more fancy ways to show off their dramatic illustration skills - it's written in such a way that it will allow an average person (read: not a professional artist, not a professional academic!) to learn the fundamentals of using visual elements (lettering choices, sketches, visual elements such as arrows and lines, etc.) to organize information and create notes that will actually help you remember.<br /><br />It contains visual examples, lots of great advice, and insightful glimpses into the author's thought process when it comes to taking notes. Of course for those of us who aren't artist types Mike *does* include some neat tutorials. He breaks things down into simple shapes, and shows you how to put those shapes together to draw people, houses, cars, etc.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have mentioned pens, paper, etc., so I feel I should touch on that quickly.<br /><br />Mike mentions in the book that he uses small Moleskine notebooks (3.5x5.5\\", or 7\\"x5.5\\" when folded open). One reviewer at least seemed to be of the impression that Mike was mentioning this as a \\"one true and correct notebook\\" that you should use. Of course that's not what the book says.<br /><br />If you're just starting out, you don't have to run out and plunk down $15 for a notebook. When you start any sort of sketching or writing, you just need a way to get ink onto paper. Any pen will do to start, including the cheap $0.20 Bic ones (they work better than a lot of fancy pens). And any pad of paper will work. Inkjet printer paper is remarkably well-suited to drawing and sketching, as a matter of fact.<br /><br />But when you get to the point where you're getting serious about drawing/writing/sketchnoting, you'll probably get more particular about your supplies. Certain pens just work better (and more consistently) than others. Certain paper takes and holds ink better than others. Mike is at the point where that stuff matters to him; it doesn't mean it's where you have to start! Grab whatever you have handy and get started.<br /><br />Bottom line?<br /><br />If you want to learn visual notetaking, this is the book you need to get.<br /><br />If you've ever thought about learning visual notetaking but have been scared off because you think it's only for \\"creative types\\", this is the book you *really* need to get.<br /><br />If you don't even take notes anymore because your twelve years in school beat all the fun out of it, it's absolutely *imperative* that you get this book.<br /><br />Long story short, get this book. You won't regret it!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Excellent port of a great game. It is super intuitive to play on a small touch screen, way better than the PC version.
1907590331|5.0|My son needed this for school, and it was perfect.  The book arrived in good shape and very quickly, so work could be done on time.
B000MV9026|5.0|This too should be a must-see for every child.  Another wonderful movie that is enjoyed by many, young and old.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am still figuring out how to play this game but I can tell I am going to like it.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This movie was very well cast and is entertaining.  It leaves you with a happy feeling, which is rare in many of the newer movies.  At first I was a bit concerned about the demeanor of the aging Eastwood but his professionalism came through as always, and the movie benefits from his years of experience.  The big surprise for me was &#34;pretty boy&#34; Justin Timberlake's job of playing a baseball pitcher who is dealing with the aftermath of a rotator cuff injury that put him on the bench permanently.  His sensitive yet believable portrayal of his character left me wishing him well in his new found career in films.  I was unfamiliar with Amy Adams prior to seeing this movie  but she did a marvelous job.  I will check for other films she has done.<br /><br />You won't go wrong with this unless you just detest baseball.... and even then the storyline carries Trouble With The Curve quite well.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Great to use on your phones, Roku and other computers to communicate with your HTPC server using Plex Server. Allows you to see all your media wherever and whenever you want to.
B002WY65VU|3.0|The first 15mins was gory good, then it was just ok. I'm not a big fan of Zombies. I guess.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Game is really fun and educational, though a lot of the good songs are not available in the free version.<br />Still recommended!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Not what I was expecting when she threw it in the CD player. Truly something different and anyone who has an eclectic music palette should enjoy this one.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Need some better iOS or Windows 8 tools to help make this easier and more user friendly for those operating systems. I use Dropbox now and it has great integrated tools that automatically upload your pictures, once Cloud Drive gets this then it will be more useful.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Now I see why the game is so addictive.  My son will love it as well. And it was free.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Five stars best diary of a wimpy kid yet I liked the part with the<br />Valentines dance and when they were at corny
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|My fave book in the series is dog days. Keep going Jeff Kinney.Keep righting! I read it in 3 hour s make your book s bigger
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This was an extremely fun and enjoyable game.  Easy to play but had alot of challenges. If your looking for a game that is fun yet has a challenge this is the one you want.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Realy liked having the Weather Channel on my Kindel. On Christmas Day, in the mist of tornados, we were easily able to retrieve weather info and satelite photos of the storm even when the cable was out. This was our first day of use since the Kindel was a Christmas present, and the Weather Channel was one of the first apps we downloaded.
B007N8RULO|3.0|This app is really cute but the ads take forever to load and sometimes they freeze and you can't play the game for minutes
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Fire everybody in the production company. I have seen b movies a lot better than this. It is a sad, sad day for RE fans.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|It's a really beautiful game. It keeps my mind busy with all the lovely colors and designs, but it takes a lot of practice and is a bit time consuming. I love it when trying to wind down from the day
B006VREHRS|4.0|Very intriguing from the beggining.  Very few moments of boardam.  Interesting look at the corruption surrounding the prohibition era in our nations history.
B0049M7BDE|4.0|Really enjoyed this version of the Thomas Crown. The photography is great & Pierce B. makes a wonderful Thomas Crown
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|A real let down.  Half of the movie was done very well, but half looked like an amateur attempt at screenplay,direction and editing.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|We are rabid fans of Preston and Child and wait impatiently for each new book. This one did not start out the way I thought it should with the death of Helen. But it got more and more intense as the story continued. A real nail biter!! Now we have to wait for the next book to see what happens with the &#34;evil&#34; twin! Always good stories, and believable characters.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love the Harry Bosch Novels, but this one is a little on the routine side. Still a great read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this app for my opossum as well as the KindleFire, I like it better on the kindle. the game is the exact same but the screen is huge compared to the ipod! there are a few things id like to be added though:<br />caves<br />armour<br />dungeons<br />melon seeds<br />enderman<br />redstone use<br />minecarts<br />Thank you!!!!! :)
B005SCSL56|5.0|When I first heard about who the book was written by, I thought it wouldn't be good. But it's great! It's about two kids whose lives had been torn by tragedy, and they're pulled into a fantasy world. Determined to get back home, they go on a quest, collecting magical items and meeting magical people. They get into danger, magic, and are caught up in what truly is The Land of Stories. Chris Colder has done an amazing job taking previously written stories and turning them into a whole new world. I recommend this book for people of all ages, especially for lovers of fairy tales.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I'd love to use this app but no matter what I do I'm upside down! I can't seem to get it right! Very dissatisfied.
B003G4W49C|5.0|At first, I thought this was going to be another version of The Maze Runner series or even Hunger Games. Post apocalyptic \\"event\\" world with children bearing the brunt of the fall-out.  I should state for the record I loved both those series.<br />I was delighted to find in this book Card takes that same concept but refines it  for an older audience and literally and figuratively takes it in a different direction.  EXCELLENT book and could not put it down!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|bought as x-mas gift for my son,he went nuts  LOVED IT!! will be looking for more gifts for birthdays and more
B004EK926K|4.0|Really nice dark telling of the classic. Jim Carrey played many parts, and he did a great job with all of them.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|I like it, also came in time it was what I was expecting from the description in the website and details.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game came up as a suggestion for me on my kindle fire and when I saw it was free, i decided to try it. I instantly fell in love and my husband and I got addicted pretty quickly!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Like that is free.<br />Don't like the wait time until you can start a new game.<br /><br />I like that it is challenging.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It is refreshing to see a new spin on horror.  The characters, story line and setting are out of this world
B00447G29S|4.0|Excellent movie for all ages with very good 3-D and home theater sound effects without getting into gimmickry.  Worth a buy, especially at sale price.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I got this for my kindle and it works great. No problems at all. It loads quickly, easy to navigate.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is fun and challenging.  I like the achievements and buying different back packs.  Maybe different and harder obsticles are needed.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Lots of fun and challenges! It has been a great entertainment for children and adults alike in our household and beyond!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is a fun and entertaining game with pleasant background music.<br />An easy way to unwind after a busy day.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|I was disappointed that this won't run on my tablet.  It does run on my phone which is also android ICS.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Too many interruptions with pop-ups asking if I want to hear a music rendition.  Don't completely understand the point system yet, but I'm sure my grandchildren will fill me in.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I have been a fan of Diary of a Wimpy Kid since the beginning. This book didnt do a whole lot for me. It was very addictive during 2/3s of the book. The last part of the book made me rush through because it was boring. I would read this book again maybe 1 or 2 more times but I'd probably most likely be rereading the other books more. But I'm not saying that you should abandon the series just maybe only read this book if theres nothing else you wanna read. The series in general cannot be beaten. It is absolutely the best graphic novel series. Dork Diaries can kiss Jeff Kinney's ass ;)<br />~Emma, 13, CA
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|This is the book you read when you can't sleep for worrying about your job or your children or your studies.  Here is a world where everyone is mannerly (and mannered), funny and romantic.  No villains, no poverty and no misery.  Here is the unreal world of Regency England and you will go to sleep with a smile on your face.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book in one day, I couldn't stop. Beautiful and heartfelt, it's amazing how a book written in letters can be so powerful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome best app ever. But in the next update you should put water and lava in the inventory on creative mode. Buy this app it rules.<br />This app is AWESOME. Also in the next update zombie pig man
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|It was way better than I thought, plenty packed into the time used. Great looking covenant and great actors and scenary
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I do not like facebook for kindle fire because it does not allow you to view news feed older than 30 minutes .
B00006D295|5.0|This is a crazy movie.  Susan Sarandon is a cool good-looking young chick in this one.  Eddie's murder and feast is horrifying and turns your stomach.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love this book it's so entertaining and funny. I would recommend it to someone who likes or even does not like reading so anyone.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Wonderful cast.  Loved the movie....great girlfriend movie!  Rented it last New Years Eve with friends and had a great time with it
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can only view the first 10 posts. Please fix!!! This app is horrible because I cannot keep up with what is going on with friends and family because of the post issue.
B000005ALP|5.0|I purchased a used cassette tape of this 10 years ago at a used music store.  It was my first eels album and one of the best.  I had to have the CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Surprised, that I didn't read this earlier. The entire book is a constant didn't expect that.  So don't miss out
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My kids love this, Esp. when the Holidays are near :)  Keeps them entertained.  And it's Free so you can't beat that !
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome! This game was very interesting! The perfect length, and they actually make it challenging enough to enjoy. Definitely worth it! I really hope they continue the story because this was quite an entertaining game.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|The game really makes me think! Not many games do, plus its a lot of fun,  and I would put it in my favorites. &lt;3
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was very funny and I really liked it. The dance part was cool and especially. The book was good.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you like adventure books and mythology this book series is the best for mortals,God's,and demi-gods.hope you like it !!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I found the music relaxing and uplifting. Recognising pop songs performed this way was fun. As thr CD cover says, their &#34;clever and inspiring takes on popular music..............resonate with audiences across generations&#34;.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a great story for adults and children alike. To really understand you need to watch the whole set in one sitting. It was also great to watch the main characters growing up into youmg adults. So far Amazon has allowed me to enjoy many of my favorite movies at great prices and quality customer service. Thanks M.Marr.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I was surprised this was such a big hit because I thought there were big plot holes, and then it had more of a 'fairy-tale' ending than I expected out of Christopher Nolan.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Luv it !!!!!!!<br />Love all the books Rick riordan makes<br />Luv mythology!!!<br />BTW  I'm actually his daughter<br />Perish bye my wrath!!!!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|He just doesn't change or age!  A very pleasant surprise and a joy to listen to.  If you love Rod Stewart, you'll love this!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It helped me very much while reading books.... I would just go to the dictionary and I would fin lad the word... but there's way too many pages!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am a facebook addict so I had to put this on my Kindle.  I have it on my phone too.  So far it works pretty good.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game I like the game within. the game is fun to play wish there was another one<br />price is right to
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The book is good. If you like Inside Delta Force, I think you will like it. But now the book desappeared from a count.
0307887448|4.0|This was a very fun book that was very easy to read.  Recommended for anyone who loves video games or pop culture.  Can't wait for the movie.
B001B51B9M|5.0|The musical holds up well.  My comments concern the Blu ray DVD -- the images are radiant, the color is wonderful, the detail is fantastic.  The sound is also very good.  There are a minimum of extras but the featurette on the making of the Music Man is great.  The DVD authoring allows the DVD to restart where one left off.  There are no previews of \\"comming attractions\\" to get through, which is very nice.  Watching it was a wonderful experience.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is one of the most talented authors out there today---each of her three books have gotten under my skin in such a way that I can't stop thinking about her characters, her dialogue and her incredible plot lines long after I read the last words of her stories. As much as I adored Slammed and Point of Retreat, though (both 5 star reads as well)---I truly think she outdid herself with Hopeless.  The plot was original, compelling and addictive.  I forced myself to put my kindle down every so often so that I could savor the book.  Holder was so incredible  (Sebastian Stan is the actor I imagined as  I read) and Sky was such a lovable MC.  This book made me gasp, cry, and smile. One of my favorite reads of 2012!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Assess high high high=v high high high high John Edwards Goff got. Ghost  get done. Kevin said not least high.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very user friendly, and I like how you can keep your sketches in an album. I also like the range of drawing media although I prefer the colored pencil.
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Even before the CD was released, I ordered it after seeing Kelly sing &#34;Don't Rush&#34; with Vince Gill on the CMA's. LOVED the performance. The CD is terrific, but I especially favor this  new song. I was a bit disappointed that &#34;The Trouble With Love Is&#34; was not included.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book from Grisham. Once you start reading it you can't put it down. So many twist and turns in the story it will make a great movie.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Enjoyed for first month. Somewhat addictive.  Then the elections and other major world events exposed it as blather...useless opine from uninformed self important fools. A waste of my time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game! I have a lot of fun playing this game!  Still trying to master the different levels.  I love the fact that it was free!  Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was absolutely captivating, and truly less of a read and more of an experience. More than once I felt a bit detached, as description was lacking, and I had no idea where I was. Despite those fleeting moments of dissatisfaction, The Hunger Games kept me hopelessly immersed in it's gripping story, rising tension, and emotional impacts. I look forward to reading the rest of the series.
1449417051|5.0|Describes the cats I've known!<br /><br />You've been warned! Just because he/she is purring at you doesn't mean they don't have evil intentions!
B009329Y30|3.0|Not a great script. Moderate acting at best. Neat concept at first, and then every single following event is telegraphed. Loudly. Horrible deus ex machina ending.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is funny and awesome! I hope Jeff Kinney makes more of these books! It is a really good book!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is one of my favorite reads. I am ready for the next one already. !
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game. Good gaphics nice, Different play modes are nice. Great game for the price.<br />Would recommend. hours of fun
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I enjoyed this way more than I should. Fast paced, great cinematic features and a pretty decent plot. All the things MI needs to be successful.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's thrilling, amazing and one of his best. Recommend it for everyone who enjoys an enticing romance. I loved it. Hopefully the movie can translate his amazing work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great transition between the first and last books. This is the second time reading the series and am yet to find any loose ends.
B001F0UQCQ|5.0|Album was reasonably priced and it was exactly as advertised on line. The item shipped fast. I had a good experience with this retailer.
1419705849|4.0|My Review: Greg Heffley is back and this time he and his best friend Rowley are getting ready for the school dance. But Greg is finding it hard to get a date for the dance. He tried his best to impress a girl but would it work? He even tried to get advice from his uncle Gary. So if your child is a lover of the Wimpy Kid books pick one up today and find out if Greg did get a date for the Valentine's Day dance.<br /><br />Disclaimer: As per FTC guidelines, I received a copy of this book from Abrams Publishers in exchange for my honest review. I received no monetary compensation. All opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best stories I heard. Honest. Amazing. I wish it would've never ended. I recommend it to anybody wanting an amazing tale.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love this book, its so great that they created it from a tv series.<br />Castle and Beckett are gorgeous together even on paper.<br />Very impressed with it.
B00461MY30|5.0|Great album collection for Rolling Stones fan. Set was exactly as described on line. Arrived on time. Good retailer to do business.
0374533571|5.0|A funny heartwarming realistic likeable characters loved pat people's and all his friends and his journey through mental illness is both realistic and optimistic loved the writing and descriptions of. Everything including the over zealous eagles fans can really recommend this book
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I will never get tired of Rush. Congrats for being nominated for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, finally.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I like all the MIB movies. Thats all i'm going to say about the movies. I'm not going to rant or rave about it
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The acting is superb from everyone abd especially Sissy Spacek.  Wonderful photographt with huge sweeping scenes.  A very human movie that can teach a lot.
B006LSZECO|3.0|While it kept my attention the ending left something to be desired--I think it was too hyped ahead of time!
0062127241|5.0|Ever since he was busted for &#34;kiddy porn&#34; for researching his autobiography, I anxiously waited for his story. It was every bit as good as I thought it would be.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Lots of action! Great flick to watch at home. If you like vampire movies and you enjoy watching history then this movie is for you.
B006KX3GXO|2.0|When I would try and take a picture using the app, It was always upside down on the screen. just needed to be mirrored but no setting for rotation. Possibly just a kindle fire hd problem.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I always love Grisham but this one was a bit of a letdown even though I couldn't put it down
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|My dad who turned 85 on Dec.18 loved the TV.show he saw  he said to me that he had no way to tape it since he doesn't use his VCR anymore so I bought it for his B-day gift and then bought the CD for his car for XMAS he was so happy he got both he plays the DVD when there's nothing on TV he wants to watch he calls when he's watching it to thank me all the timeI it's the best gift i ever got him he says.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is a BIG name, Amazon Kindle is a BIG name, so why can't they fix the facebook app for kindle?  The news feed only loads the first 10 posts then tries to load 10 more but its only text with blue background.  It's like there is a problem with the CSS style sheet.  I would expect this from a 3rd rate company but not from these big dogs. I can't believe this has been a problem for over two months and FB hasn't fixed it yet. Please fix soon or I'm sure you'll see a drop in sales.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I am a Twitter addict and I love the app on both my kindle fire hd and my phone. I think there just needs to be a version made for the kindles due to settings and view. In landscape mode it looks funny, like it's not fitting the TL to the screen width. Also, in the notification settings, instead of turning on tweets for a specific person it turns on new tweets general. This just gets annoying because every time there's new tweets your kindle notifies you, which for me is every minute. So I just shut if off for now. But overall Twitter is amazing.
B007SGM084|2.0|I have to give this book a low review rating as it was a three book series that continuously repeated the same fetish routine over and over in an attempt to keep readers reading.  If that is the readers goal just go out and buy an  s&m video and at least have the real deal to watch.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|My whole family really enjoyed this movie.  My kids are 11 and 13 so they weren't scared by it, but it does get pretty intense in some places.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a fun book to read.  Quick and funny although sad and meaningful.  I gave this book to my son to read.  He races cars.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does exactly what it says it will. I love that it gives me access to my folders without hooking my kindle up to my computer.
B00A3T5CGU|5.0|i have only utilized the mapfactor once since i downloaded the application but already love it.  found my route quickly and gave me alternative to chose form.  Great feature!!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I liked this cd because each song had a different feel to me and I was moved by them. Especially the first half.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|this came free with purchase of a digital camera on black Friday. Ts too large for the point and shoot camera that I bought but its a good size for a GPS.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works perfect on my kindle fire hd. No complaints since I haven't has a problem with it. If you like Facebook on the computer you'll love this.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Very good video of the Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour.  The concert was excellent and this video showcased the highlights of the concert.  I would highly recommend this video for any Beach Boys fan.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Super retro, awesome responsiveness with the controls, and very fun to play. This game is probably one of the better racing games I've played on my phone so far. It doesn't ever feel sluggish or difficult to control and it looks great. Definitely a worthy download.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|One of Ken Follet,s master pieces. I enjoy all his trilogies, a great storyteller who does a lot of research into the period pieces
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the books and i liked the box set they came in. It makes it easier to keep them together for future reading. was quit happy with my purchase.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Bourn Legacy<br /><br />Lots of action, very little plot/story line, predictable.  Good photography.  Movie much better without Matt Damon.  Wouldn't recommend.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I'd heard of World of Goo from a few friends ever since it came out. I decided to grab it from the App Store because they had it up for free. I have to say, I am not disappointed. It reminds me of the pure genius that made Little Big Planet such a great game.
B004E9SYN8|4.0|Once I started with the book I could not put it down, Good plot and a lot of interesting facts  about the subject matter
B00006CXSS|5.0|my husband has  not been able to watch the movies yet as we  have been busy with the holidays but he was very pleased with the metal caseing for them and is very pleased with the purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved each and every one of these books. Easy reads! Great for everyone! I definitely recommend these books to everyone I know!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|My husband has been playing this all day it is a great way to keep the mind sharp and happy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining with very good graphics and high quality gaming concepts. I wasn't sure about this game, but its very similar to temple run, but in my opinion, way better.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Looking forward to giving it a shot for 30 days!  Looking forward to taking off the weight and trying all the great recipes!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I received my Marware Microshell Folio Fire Kindle case an hour ago from Amazon.com.  I am very upset because I planned to take my new Fire Kindle on a long trip and was counting on the folio case to protect it in my travels.  The problem is that my Kindle doesn't fit into the case at all. I did not see any information on sizes for this case when I ordered it.  Now I am wondering what to do next.  I really don't need this problem right now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Of course, I've heard of the Hunger Games before, but never quite got around to reading it. I got a Kindle for Christmas and borrowed the book with my Prime membership. It's every bit as good as I've heard.
B008MU8ZOI|4.0|This is still one of my favorite horror movies and it looks great on Blu-Ray! If you can get it on Amazon for $7.99 or less it is a great buy!
0783230702|5.0|I'd seen it many times before finally breaking down and buying it.  Bruce and Brad at their absolute best. What a great cautionary tale.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I am a big halo fan and love reading the books. This book is an easy read and a great book for all ages. I would recommend this to any halo fan that haven't read the books.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|We love this movie.  Saw it in the theatre twice and bought the DVD on pre-order!  Multiple viewings since then too.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Great Movie, loved it and watch it many times and will watch it many more times. I LOVE the MEN IN BLACK
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I live for movies like this and it gets me right where I live.  Too rare, too rare.  I will watch this many times  indeed.  Maybe Brad pit at his best.  He's a great actor in my opinion.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It is the worst game on the face of the earth its such a fail that I just spit at it do not get it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a game my kids will play over and over. We have it on our Iphones, and just recently purchased it on their Kindles. So much fun.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I buy this set in my local store (MixUp) here in Mexico, an IS the US pressing, the vinyls are exellent in all aspect and the sound is the most perfect i ever heard, highly recommended purchase!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love the songs on this CD. It's a great mix of upbeat tones and the deeper alternative ones. I can't say that it's very long of a CD, but it's worth every cent and I'm so happy to have it to listen to whenever I want!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this app! This is the type of game I like to play and it is very addicting! Hope they create more along the same lines
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although this is only a pocket addition, all of my kids are addicted. My 5 year old daughter plays it, she picked up how to do everything on the first day. It's less than I expected, but my boys who also play this on the PC like it a lot. One thing I hate is my boys cannot use their original minecraft account on the pocket edition.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I am a personal fan of the diary of a wimpy kid books and this is the best one yet.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, is fast paced and really hard to stop playing. As the game progress y you get faster and that makes it harder but so much more fun! Run dude run!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Thia is such a great app!  My kids love it and it sounds great!  They have actually memorized a couple songs from here and are playing them on our real piano! !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was amazing! I couldn't stop reading!!! I hope there will be many many more past Catching Fire and Mockingjay!!
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Don't look down on this movie because it's animated. Most, if not all, DC animated films are cenima quality (especially considering the mass of terrible films coming out lately), people just don't give them a chance because it's a &#34;cartoon&#34;. This is an excellent movie with plenty of action, story development, acting and twists. I won't give anything away, but don't pass it up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest!  Love to do crafts and cook so I get lots of ideas from them.  Great place to browse!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I hadn't played angry birds in a while as i had grown bored with it.  I love how they changed this one though to try to mimic the properties of space!  Super fun!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love classic literature and Tom Sawyer is definitely  the best of all stories I've ever been trapped into reading in school. I mean I'm actually reading this in my free time... that's got to say something about how great it is.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Love the app, my only complaint is that unlike on your computer or on your phone, you don't get to see everything that gets posted to the news feed.  You only get to see maybe a 1/4 of what's been posted.  When you scroll all the way down and swipe for more it won't access more.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebooks mostly allows me to view pictures of my grandchildren and watch their activities.  Interesting to read from past and present friends.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I was going nuts trying to find a program that I could use for the camera on my Kindle Fire HD (I also bought this from Amazon and Highly rate the Kindle!!)  As soon as I tried the picture taking option - SNAP- I had a great picture.  I had to take a few of the dog as the wife was in the shower and had a problem taking a picture at the time.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely breath taking. Loved every minute of every hour of this outstanding book. Absolutely unforgettable in the best way possible.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this twice and it never appeared on my Kindle.  My daughter was a little bummed but it was free.  Oh well it is what it is.  You win some you lose some.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love this game!  It is a stress reliever for me.  I sit and play while my husband is watching sports!  But I am watching right along with him!  Love it!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A fantastic trip as it should have been done. This film has better acting and special effects have come such a long way. The storyline keeps the viewer interested.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I found this book a very good story.  Characters are defined well.  Locations and characters are well illustrated.  I would recommend this book
B00632HWOG|3.0|I'm only giving this 3 stars but it's not fair to the Amazon app, but Yahoo changed a bunch of things and I am just not happy with the changes that they've made.  The app itself is a 5, but the new changes on Yahoo barely make a 3.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is tragic and despondent but also hilarious when the time comes. It is a great read for ages about 8-14. I hope this helped! Enjoy this book and if you like it... DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THE COMPLETE SERIES! Sincerely, Alisia Bateman.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I love the islands and her music takes me there...at least in my head. Great beats, good love tunes, awesome tunes to dance.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game and play it on my kindle fire but when I installed it on my HD tablet it doesn't work well at all. When you buy something you can't place anything in the farther corners because it won't go over that far. If it wasn't for that I would rate it a 5. Hopefully they will update soon. Until then I wii keep playing on my kindle fire. I do hate having to start over when you get a new device though.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Love angry birds and so do all of my kids and my Hubby.  Had the free version on my phone when I got my Kindle immediately paid for the full version, never disappoints so nice not to have the ads popping up.  I did also but the Path of the Jedi which I think was $1.99 or something.  But everyone in our family of 6 enjoys it well worth the $$!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Recommended to me by a friend who loved it.  I haven't finished it yet but it certainly grabbed my attention.  Looks to be a good choice.
B001QB9H10|5.0|I wasn't sure how I felt about this Transporter movie at first but as the story unfolded I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. Great movie and definitely something I'll watch time and time again.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Only thing to note is you need to unplug the USB device before the song will play in iTunes; no biggie though.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|It's ok, I don't think that I would buy it again, I don't see how it's so HD, the regular camera on the Kindle that is already HD is awesome.  But oh well.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie.  Copy clear on my iPad.  Fast and easy with the instant download.  Great deal free with the purchase of it on blu ray
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I was a little unsure about this but this game is a ton of fun. I've found absolutely nothing wrong with this game. great free game of the day ^_^
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'll need click back when I've finished the book.  I've not completed the book, but I am impressed with the care the author has taken to document his writing.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It looks like the old school pac-man, but since there's no joystick it kinda takes the fun out of it.  My Husband enjoys this app more than I do.  I would give it 3 he would give it 4
0743496736|5.0|Could not wait to get this as have been wanting to read it for so long, came in perfect shape as stated, thank you
8866130915|5.0|I've been a fan of Moleskine for a while.  I like to be highly organized in my personal scheduling, but my highly unorganized purse has no room for a large planner.  This size proves to be perfect.  I have a leather cover for my planner, which makes it personalized to me.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Movie given as gift.  Guess they liked it, they asked for it.  I didn't care for it. Five stars in any event.
B004IWF64Q|5.0|What a joyous time I had watching at this wonderful movie. It was full of love and true life because unfortunately, sometimes our hearts and our minds wander in different directions. I recommend this movie to anyone.
145210655X|5.0|Since our son was totally immersed in Star Wars growing up, as is his son now, and because he named his son Luke (Biblically, not Star Wars - but...) they totally loved this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The kids love playing this game.  Try it, it's a lot of fun to play.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Movie given as gift.  Guess they liked it, they asked for it.  I didn't care for it. Five stars in any event.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The title says all in this action packed, girl-impowering movie. Young Merida is a typical teenage girl who loves adventure, which is unfortunate for her mother, the queen. This is a great mother-daughter movie and I highly suggest it to those who know that there is bond that needs to be mended between you and your daughter or you and your mother. This is not really a manly movie, so I suggest it for those who dont want to see The Bourne Legacy or The Avengers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works like it's supposed to. I just don't know what to say so I am trying to put in fourteen more words so i could be done with this.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The kids love playing this game.  Try it, it's a lot of fun to play.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|everybody loved the movie.  I love it where you don't have to remember to return to the store or lose the movie.
B009C7JS14|5.0|In one page, I have everything I need to know about the weather.  It is well organized and very up to date.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was incredible, it really made me think about the relationships in my life and the people I love and care about. One of the best books I have ever read!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy playing this game. The kids love playing this game.  Try it, it's a lot of fun to play.
B000X107GI|5.0|QUALITY FRONT LINE PRODUCT AT BETTER PRICES THAN CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE REGULAR BATTERY OUTLETS.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND.
0062215507|5.0|My 7 year old granddaughter loves the Harry Potter books and movies.  She was thrilled with this book giving the background of the making of the films.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Charlize Theron is stunning and beautiful, she was the only reason I watched this movie. Other than her...this movie is terrible.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Good movie... always a pleasure to watch a Meryl Streep film.  Very well done and definitely understood by someone who has been lucky enough to be married a long time.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It doesn't update your news feed so I find that I still use fb on my phone instead of kindle.
0060723513|1.0|Frank Seeley's review is spot on! My goodness! Are people still reading and selling this incredulous drivel years after it's been thoroughly discredited even by the very people it purports to write about?  Amazing!<br /><br />\\"Incredible\\"? No! Incredulous! Some of the most vapid doggerel I have ever read.  Written at the level of a high school sophomore. Anyone who swallows rubbish like this deserves to invest all their money in underwater ocean front property in Arizona.  If there is any money left they can spend it on some snake-oil to cure their depression.  Morgan can not have it both ways: she can not claim these are the literal facts and that it's fiction.<br /><br />We are actually asked to believe that a sane 50 year old white, blond, American, suburban, matron, would buy herself a new wardrobe and spend hundreds of dollars in her own money to fly off, alone, to a city (not named) and check into a \\"five star\\" hotel (not identified) where she leaves her luggage to jump into an open jeep with a scantily dressed black `aborigine' (unnamed) driver and whom she never asks to identify himself? And after hours of his driving her off-road into wilderness outback she has no questions.<br /><br />And why did she do this? To accept an \\"award\\" from an (actually non-existent) aboriginal tribe called the Real People (as opposed to the rest of humanity) but only after she walks across the outback for three months in bare bloody, swollen, feet and 130 degree heat to collect it. All this, she claims is \\"literally\\" true but published as fiction to protect the unnamed driver of the nonexistent Aboriginal tribe (no one but this white suburban matron has ever found) from the `legal' consequences of their identify being revealed.  This author she doesn't know Australia from Alaska.  The aboriginal peoples of NORTHERN ALASKA are known as Inupiats, which in THEIR language literally means \\"real people\\".<br /><br />Driven off-road into the desert she dutifully (as ordered) removes all her cloths (jewelry and underwear too) to don a \\"wrap around rag\\" (he does the same and changes in to a loin cloth) after which `cleansing' her belongings are tossed into a fire (along with her credit cards and identification papers, driver's licence, cash, a \\"gold and diamond watch\\" and her new 35 mm camera) after which ritual (it being between 100 - 130 degrees in the desert) she accepts an invitation into a tin shed to sit round a fire. All this done with nary a word of protest because she does not want to offend the \\"unique ... hospitality' of \\"ignorant\\" people.  Not to worry, be \\"flexible\\" after all the plane tickets and other cloths were back at the \\"five star hotel\\" and surely this blond American matron would be able to survive the embarrassment of being dropped by an Aborigine driver in  dirty junk jeep back at her \\"five star hotel\\" wearing only a \\"wrap around rag.\\"  After all, she was later able to dig one ring out of the ashes once the embers cooled (but I guess the diamonds melted) so it was not a total loss.  And cash, credit cards, gold and diamonds? For everything else there are royalties. Her deepest concern in this kidnaping is that, if she does not get back home soon her rented TV will be repossessed.<br /><br />And all that is the first seven pages!  And so it goes from page after preposterous page.<br /><br />She is very careful to not provide one single verifiable detail that might enable any sane and critical reader to vet the facts-- but that's just because she has to legally protect an ancient lost tribe that does not exist. It's to protect them you see.<br /><br />Perhaps the most hilarious scene is her first arrival in Australia where the Quantas flight attendants walked through the cabin with aerosol cans spraying all passengers with decontaminating chemical spray before they are allowed to disembark.  According to the Department of Transportation, while some nations require passenger airplanes arriving from other countries to be sprayedwith insecticide to protect plants, animals and people few countries require spraying of insecticides while passengers are on board. Australia allows planes to be treated ONLY while they are empty and the pesticides used are designed to be effective for up to two months.  In the case of Australia, New Zealand and some other countries, THEY DO NOT SPRAY THE PASSENGERS ON BOARD! They use \\"residual\\" spraying, a method whereby WORKERS IN PROTECTIVE GEAR blanket a solution in AN EMPTY AIRCRAFT cabin that dries and leaves a residue that lasts up to 56 days.<br /><br />Credentials? This first self-published author has claimed she has doctoral degrees biochemistry and oriental medicine but even her first publisher could not verify such claims or even her purported itinerary in Australia, or, for that matter, anything else she claims. They apparently dumped her for a publisher with less scruples.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia and \\"the 90-page report published by the Perth-based Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation, a survey of Aboriginal groups in Central and Western Australia failed to uncover ANY INDICATION WHATSOEVER OF MS MORGAN'S PRESENCE IN THE AREA OR OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE \\"REAL PEOPLE\\" TRIBE. They claim that Aboriginal groups believe Ms Morgan's desert journey to be fabricated and that her book and teaching lack credibility. The Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation stated that it was deeply offensive to Aboriginal people for a white person to be misrepresenting Aboriginal culture for self-promotion and profit. Aboriginal people expressed anger that Ms Morgan's false message is being accepted as fact by a naive American and European market and were extremely concerned about the resulting long-term implications for their culture.  The Aboriginal people are very angry that this book continues to be promoted and sold widely because it gives a very false picture of their traditional culture and of their current political and social status. This is very damaging to their very real struggle for survival... In 1996 a group of Aboriginal elders, seriously disturbed by the book's implications, received a grant to travel to the States and confront Marlo Morgan about her book and to try to prevent a Hollywoodisation of it. She ADMITTED PUBLICLY THAT SHE HAD FAKED IT but this received little publicity in the USA.\\"<br /><br />It's really scary to think so many readers swallow such vapid and incredulous rubbish pawned off as ancient wisdom untrusted to this one blond American matron who is (unlike any white person before her) summoned hundreds of miles to receive an award for her services to them. Like everything credibility demands knowing we are not told any verifiable fact.  No wonder the real Aboriginal elders ridiculed this book offense.<br /><br />No city she talks about is ever named, no history book  she refers to is ever cited, no \\"government publication\\" she discuses is ever identified, and no colleague whose work she boasts about is ever identified either.  It appears this writer's claim of being an \\"educated woman\\" can not be backed up by one credible and authentic  credential.<br /><br />Local Australian reporters have called the book \\"a lot of rubbish,\\" but it also quotes an Aborigine activist named Bobby McLead, saying the book is filled \\"cover to cover\\" with \\"fantasies, misinformation, and distortion... Once again, the colonist mentality feels free, for its own purposes and profit, to exploit and disfigure the Aboriginal world...\\" In addition to claims of plagiarism one Aborigine group claimed Morgan never gave them a share of the proceeds from an earlier edition of her book that she said she did.\\"<br /><br />The only identified testimony she relies on in support of her unsubstantiated facts is the unsigned affidavit of a bogus character called Burman Burman, a so-called Wurundjeri elder, and one of the Real People, whose existence the outraged Aborigine elders claim does not exist, whose existence has never been shown, and who has never come forward. But it's curious that, aside from the young translator/kidnapper not one of these people even spoke English! Yet Burman Burman testifies it is the first complete book he ever read in his life (even tough he cites, with no particularity) to the writings of sixteenth century English Explorer William Dampier) as he claim this book does not violate any trust given to the author by the Real People. If one rightly concludes she has been given no trust by the Real People (who are not shown to even exist) then I guess there was no trust to violate to start with.<br /><br />If this book proves anything it's how many gullible people never learned to read and THINK critically and are willing to gobble up any preposterous rubbish is dished out by quacks and charlatans who, at best, hold doctorates in shallow, vapid, poppycock and pseudo-science.  But hey, slap the names of Marianne Williamson, Wayne Dyer, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross and Og Mandino on the front and back covers and it's amazing what drivel can be spoon fed to the credulous. Now then, about that under water ocean front property in Arizona: how `bout I toss in peyote party with Carlos Castenada and Don Juan. ;-) Marlo Morgan is over the rainbow but pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. It appears the emperor has no cloths.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|It had it's funny moments - nice to see the gang back together.  If you saw all 3 American Pies - than this one is a must.  Nice closure to the series.
B004RLPTT0|5.0|It works and its perfect for keeping me distracted while I'm off in my artsy world. I appreciate how well Emilie sings too, her voice is just lovely!
0060987464|4.0|I must admit I was not a big fan of Marilyn Manson what so ever till I read this book.  A close friend of mine begged me to give this book a chance and I'm glad I did.  For a man who has lived such a complex and rocky life I am truly inspired by his ability to forge through the s*** life happens to throw at you at times.  This book gives you a much better perspective of the man they call Marilyn Manson.  I found the book enlightening and even enjoyed it enough to purchase it for my niece for Christmas who is a big fan of his.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|These books are so dumb. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. Did not enjoy at all.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|DONT BUY IT SUCKS BECAUSE YOUR GIVEN I THINK 30 COINS AND THEN YOUR ONLY GIVEN ONE EVERY 40 SECONDS AND BUGGED ABOUT BUYING.. ITS JUST NOT FUN
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's a great combination of an easy read and good story. The type you should be able to kill over a holiday weekend at the beach if you were dedicated.
B00795P4EG|2.0|This would be an amazing, 5-star little app, *if* it didn't constantly close without warning, instantly deleting without saving whatever you've been working on. Not ready for the Kindle Fire HD, when it is, and the glitch I'd fixed, I'll be happy to rate it 5 stars because it really is-- or could be-- very impressive.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game its fun. so far I only found one flaw and that is that on my kindel it sometimes doesn't do what I tell it to do but 98% of the time its fine. I love the game it is a great time waster :) I recimend it!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|LOL THIS IS SOO MUCH FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AND WE LOVE PLAYING THIS AS A FAMILY AND ITS NOT SO EASY MEAN LITTLE PIGGIES
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|very entertaining for kids, my son loves creating the different dragon species and playing with this app.  would recommend highly
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves this game. He and his friend across the street want to play this all the time. So much, he has to be restricted on how much he can play. He also loves it on xbox.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This game is a fine dogfight with very many jets.<br />You start in 1954 with just a basic fighter without missiles and have short missions lasting from about 2 to 4 minutes. You have to shoot down at least one enemy plane to accomplish the mission. The more successful you are at it, the faster you progress to future years and planes by getting awarded keys. WARNING : if you unlock a new plane, you should immediately fly a mission because it seems if you exit the app without that, it won't recognize the status change.<br />There is no tutorial but flying this strictly air-to-air combat game isn't hard:<br />- the arrows on the left side control airspeed<br />- you steer with tilt<br />- guns and missiles are on the right side<br />- your gun ammo is limited but don't worry: you rather run out of time than ammo<br /><br />The radar shows you the enemy's position but it is easier to just follow the red arrows.<br />The enemy is shown surrounded by a red square; once a red dot appears near it, it is in range and that dot is what you aim for.<br />If you have missiles, keep the green circle that shows it is locked within the enemy's line of sight until the lower right accuracy indicator passes 90%, then fire.<br />Altitude and airspeed are also indicated, though sadly a cockpit view is not available.<br />I strongly recommend to set sensitivity to maximum, otherwise your plane is too sluggish to track the enemy.<br />The planes are able to fly inverted or in any attitude you put them but avoid low altitude loopings - while the controls are forgiving, the ground is not.<br />A very well made simulation though I give it only four stars for a lack of variation such as ground attacks.<br />And yes, I miss the cockpit view.
B005HSL626|1.0|WAYY TO EASY NOT FUN ITS BAD YOU WONT LIKE THEY MAKE ME SAY ALL OF THIS SO LAUGH AND ENJOY ME NOT IT-LOL
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love Pendergast.  I love the intelligent dialogue and vocabulary.  There is always lots of action and I am eagerly awaiting the next one.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games series had some great personalities and a lot of food for thought about the future of our country.<br />I have never liked Sy Fy or anything not reality but these were different.  Good writing and a very different story line.
0156027321|5.0|We went to see the movie after our mother tild us how good it was. We walked away with a number of questions. We ordered the book for us and one for our mother. We also purchased the study guide and have created our own book study.

B009VLX8FS|5.0|This CD of hers has ALL styles of music, yet stays true to Taylor Swift. It's lyrics you know she either wrote or helped to write and is just so fun. LOVE this CD.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book is a good follow-up to the first, with not much time lapse. If you liked the first one, you will like this one as well.

B0086700CM|3.0|I absolutely love this game on my phone. I just got a kindle fire and this was one of the first apps I downloaded. I can't seem to figure out the tilt action. It doesn't function on my kindle. Does anyone else have this issue?
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Have always liked Van Morrison.....My only wish is that he would have better diction, but then I guess he wants us to pay very close attention to his lyrics....hence the mumblings!!! Patrick
B0071AKB38|5.0|Beautiful sound.<br />Son loved it -  transmits phone and radio sounds with excellent, clear quality<br />Well worth the purchase cost.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love playoff spider!  No better way to spend time when you have to wait in line or for someone. Keeps you mind sharp!
6301796535|5.0|I enjoyed viewing this film. Watching it over and over again allows a different perspective each time. This was great.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|For Tinkerbell fans, this is another wonderful movie! My 3 year old daughter loved the winter theme-and I have to say, I really liked the movie too! Some kid's movies are really hard to sit through, but not this one-it is really cute.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I want \\"Fade Into You\\", but I want a real hard copy of it, not an MP3 Download, what do those without this capability, and don't want it that way get? Will this song be on Volume 2?  I'll settle for that.<br /><br />I like real copies, not downloads on to blank CD's with magic marker labeling.
B008476HBM|5.0|I am the proud owner of the Kindle. It has allowed me to buy many books and read them easily. I love the story about the Bennetts as written by Jane Austen.

B009YP9L7U|2.0|Typical romance with obvious plot Line and mediocre writing. Honestly seemed like someone trying to copy off the whole shades of gray lets make a contract  possessive nonsensE.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Same exact controller as the original to me. Haven't found any faults, and I looked hard after reading the other reviews.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Excellent story, I didn't want the book to end.  Two friends and I are planning to check out the PCT...of course we are not walking the whole trail..just a tiny portion of it
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game can be easy to hard depending on the number of suits you choose.  It is challenging and fun especially when you win.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is my favorite classic of all times .You just can't get any better christmas story I recommend it to all the young people
B008FRJ1IW|3.0|This was a present for a five year old.  I was disappointed it was as small as it was, but he was thrilled with it
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Loved the movie. I wasn't sure how well Thor would translate to the big screen, but to my delight it came out great. Hemsworth was good as Thor, but it was Loki that stole the show. Hiddleston made Loki more than a cardboard cutout. You understood why he felt like he did, even as you disagreed with what he was doing.<br /><br />The disc itself was good too. The movie looks great, and there are some decent extras.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was not what I was expecting it to be at all, but I started and finished the book within one day. You need to be in a contemplative state of mind when reading this. It's not a fun and happy read. However, something needs to be said for wanting to finish the book in one day. There's something about Charlie that makes him relatable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is great for all age. the diamond and engery levels run out fast and you have to buy more- money trap. all in all fun game
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'm a big my little pony fan. I've been searching and searching for this game!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />If you love to draw, it gives you ideas<br />Adorable<br />Cute<br />Adorable<br />You get to experience the jobs as a pony<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Too much notifications!
B0086700CM|5.0|Great Fun!<br />This game is so much fun, my four year old likes playing it, too!  So does my Mom!
0547884591|5.0|I am a cookbook writer, and the last thing I need is a new book, however excellent, teaching me the basics. However, this is about how to learn any new skill, not just cooking. For those of us who are in love with learning, and frustrated at the agonizingly slow pace we are told is 'the traditional/only way', Tim teaches the generic steps to 'hacking' fast learning.  Fabulous!<br /><br />But even that does not `define' the book: 4HC embraces a lot of ideas (typical Ferriss I would think!) He slips in, for instance, the importance of enjoyment of quality food, as an antidote to the fast, but low quality, food consumption mania which has created such havoc with our health. Wow: big necessary agenda.<br /><br />Even smaller details are mindblowing to me: the graph he shares on his own language acquisition (one he found matched in the emotional rollercoaster of a start up situation) is just like one on a blog by Oren Klaff (Pitch Anything), as the specific rollercoaster ride your status takes while pitching!<br /><br />This is your book if you like to hang out with a brilliant mind!
B000EUDAWG|5.0|Our little guy wanted a moving spider for Christmas, and this was perfect. He loves it! This product was shipped promptly.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|liked the music and the humor. i would watch his movie again. picture was excellent in hd and had no problem streaming
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I think this game is fun with some of its challenging levels but I still think this app is still very fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Just bought my 9 yr. old a kindle fire hd. The graphics are amazing on this game. My daughter doesn't want to stop playing it. Great game.
B009POCFTG|2.0|This movie is a stream of random sex and violence with no real plot and an utterly unreasonable and unsatisfying ending. I guess the good reviews are based on either people who like random sex/violence with no real plot - or their love of the director. I'm no prude. But it's got to make sense. This movie looks like it was cut and pasted with no real direction and plenty of pure random acts of the utterly bizarre kind. If you like the carnival barker promising you a look at the bearded lady for a buck, this may be your movie. Glad I only rented it on cable.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I had already downloaded this app on my mom's system and had gotten very far into it with many hours spent when, after the latest update, the entire game reset. This game is very fun, but frustrating that I have to start back at the beginning.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Was Always A Fan Of The Outrun Game (Man I Miss AM2)... You Guys Did A Great Job With It... Good And Controls Are Spot On.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|After the first 2 singles were released I expected a much edgier album. Not a fan of country music. There are 3 maybe 4 songs that are worth listening to on the entire album.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son loves to play Angry Birds, thanks for making it FREE! I play it as well. Thank you very much!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|This book was very helpful when looking up vocabulary words for homework and if I don't know what a word means in another book that I am reading.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|This alarm clock does have a lot of bells and whistles, but the big disappointment is that it does not change orientation when you put the Kindle Fire sideways.  The time display is also much smaller than other clock apps I've seen.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Album is awesome & gym worthy! Saw them in concert. Awesome!! A great mix of fast & slow. Edgy & will be adding more than 1/2 of the album to my running play list.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|ChuChu Rocket is a great puzzler. But the Android port crashes every time the screen timeout kicks in (which happens a lot when I'm looking at grid trying to trace the mice's path). I ended up uninstalling and playing a different game instead.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|For any Sci-fi viewers, this series was short lived but very good.<br />Good to be able to get the original feature.
B0086700CM|4.0|Not very challenging once u get the bang of it. Took approximately twenty minutes but then it was easy to beat the level.

B00A0SKFLG|1.0|good special effects technology, but that's all.  Very little story.  Ok for the younger set, but not for us thank you.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Good app to pass some time. Was pleasantly surprised at how challenging some of the levels were. really enjoyed it.

1612680011|5.0|This book has critics and people who pick it apart. IT can't be denied that the information in Rich Dad Poor Dad gets the brain thinking down the right path, and led me to many more books since. I highly recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|The search is just like Google elsewhere.  But the graphics aren't that great, expected more from an app that I needed to pay for.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Her voice is so uplifting and powerful. This is the album i listen too when i am at the gym.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|Worked at first so I didn't get a refund, then the next day I tried to play it and it wouldn't work on my kindle fire 2
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|A great storyline ruined.  Beautiful country side.  It seemed like a poor attempt of a generic take off on redneck Shakespeare
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Could not believe the difference on the screen while watching this movie on DVD compared to VHS, do not yet have a blue ray player, but I cannot wait to watch it on blu-ray. The book and pictures that it came with are amazing.
B008J34466|5.0|What can i say! This album has helped me with the most heartbreaking time. She is an angel. Can't wait to see her in Australia.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|Photoshop is way too expensive unless you are in a business that uses it, if you are a casual user and only want the core features such as filters, levels, and photo blending, and many more, this app is for you.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Really cool little game. Nice new spin on the water physics game where's my water? Highly recommended for a great price.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book will make you cry, laugh, scream and cuss, but it is one of the best books I have ever read. Buy this book. It pulls you in from the first paragraph, Sky is a really strong character and Holder was her strength. Their lives apart are HOPELESS but together they are a match made in heaven
B0035V35PI|5.0|Bought it as a gift. The person told me how they were impressed by how good the picture was. Great
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was the best book I ever read. It's super funny you have to read it its the best book yet
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|First of all, I loved this production when seeing it several times on it &#34;tour&#34; of US cities most particularly Atlanta, GA.  If you enjoy spectacle and grand theatre, then &#34;Phantom&#34; is for you.  If not then, I say look elsewhere for your entertainment.  This production at the Royal Albert Hall is a little different from the show as it was staged in regular theatres....but the few changes that were made to adapt to the &#34;Hall&#34;, do not in any way detract...but make it even more spectacular.  The Blu-ray on a large screen TV makes the experience almost as good as seeing it in person.  The clarity of picture and the quality of the sound make this Blu-ray a &#34;must have&#34; if you love this musical as much as I do.  This product was delivered on time and in great condition....very reliable company to order from......so do not hesitate!
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|This book was interesting and juicy.  I did like the girl who played the part when she was so aware of her surrounds and how she wanted to be treated.  I do understand that relationships are very tricky and not all relationship will work out like this one.  A must read.
B00992CF6W|1.0|seriously! why is it called MINE craft if you cant stinking mine! I mean seriously Joe! der de der! u don't have to br Newton to figure this one out. BIG waste of time and money folks!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|An excellent book, evoking many feelings and inspiring hope.This novel made me, and I'm sure all who have read it, a better man.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this book in 2 days. Loved the suspense and characters!<br />A great read for sure and I definitely recommend purchasing!
B008602KQI|4.0|Bought it for my daughter who requested it for Christmas. It was priced well and arrived quickly. She was thrilled. I love the movie too and feel it is a good criticism on the violence in our society and how we it's 'entertainment factor'. Definitely a lot to talk about with this movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is kind of crazy, but as crazy as it was I loved it! I loved how Pat and Tiffany got together in the end. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I am fascinated by their relationship. I couldn't get away from the story I had to keep reading until I finished. Even better than the first one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|So much Better than the movie!! Beautiful story with beautiful descriptive imagery. I am so sad that it had to end!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is science fiction a it's finest. Reminded me of 'a fall of moondust'.  Very highly recommended and a no brainier at the price.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is the best mystery I have ever played!It is so addictive!IT makes you okay on and on.I wish the full game was free though.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Lots of twists and turns, as usual, where Special Agent Pendergast is involved.  Some big surprises, too.  Hope this is not the last we hear of Agent Pendergast and all.....
B000JMKRKC|5.0|A very well written book.  I would highly recommend for those who enjoy historic fiction, romance and mystery.  Good book
B000JMLFLW|3.0|My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 6.  Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up.  Not my sort  of novel or subject.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|There is very little to do in this game. You spend most of it reading conversations. The puzzles are ok, but there are far too few of them to make up for the endless screens of dialog. I certainly don't have the patience to play through the game a second time, much less the 6 or so required to see all the possible endings, and get the entire story. I would rather read an actual book, if I am going to spend that much time reading text.
044024630X|5.0|Sixteenth in the Jack Reacher suspense series and taking place in Fort Kelham in Mississippi.<br /><br />This is a flashback to 1997 and Reacher is 36, and it sets us up for the events that will follow with the first full-length story in this series, Killing Floor (Jack Reacher, #1).<br /><br />My Take<br />Not what I was expecting. After 61 Hours (Jack Reacher, #15) and Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #17), I could have sworn that Jack was heading for Virginia and Susan. Wow. I was so wrong. Not least, because this takes place back in the past just before Reacher quits the army.<br /><br />This story is important as it explains why Reacher quit the army. And they oughta be ashamed of themselves. Yeah, sure, this is fiction. Unfortunately, there is too much of a ring of truth about events. The cover-ups. The manipulations from so many people. The corruption. All to protect one person, damn it.<br /><br />Ah hell, the truth is, they're lying right and left.<br /><br />Child is setting us up for the little things in Reacher's future: the pocket toothbrush, buying clothes and trashing the old, riding the bus, that remote access bank account, thinking like a civilian. The chat he had with Bruce, the sixteen-year-old kid who simply wanted to be accepted, who loved his sister. The thoughts it roused in Reacher of his brother Joe, who was out in Georgia near a place called Margrave. I absolutely loved Reacher's approach with Bruce. He didn't ignore Bruce's abnormality. He simply treated it as part and parcel of Bruce.<br /><br />I just want to cry.<br /><br />I do wish Child had given us a bit more warning---like use a prologue!---before starting with the contents of chapter one.<br /><br />I felt a bit of a voyeur listening to Reacher discuss the proper clothing for an undercover mission. I don't think I've ever thought of shoes quite like this before. Surprisingly, I wasn't feeling voyeuristic when he was contemplating where to start undressing Deveraux.<br /><br />ARGHHH, part me wishes Reacher had \\"tidied up\\" the other two militia. That or I'd'a helped! That brat! Oh, I'm just so incredibly furious!!!!! Then again, I suppose Reacher had to let 'em go.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's a civilian murder behind a civilian bar with a military base a hop, step, and a jump away. The locals know it's a military man while the military is hoping and praying it's a local.<br /><br />Munro is there as the visible investigating officer while Reacher is sent in undercover. Only, the sheriff is a ringer and she makes him within minutes. And orders him out of town. Yeah. Right.<br /><br />It doesn't actually take long, and Reacher does leave town. He's gonna take on the Pentagon.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Jack Reacher is going in undercover in Carter Crossing---yeah, right. He'll be staying at Touissant's where the sheriff lives. In some respects, it's kind of a shame that Reacher is so damned honorable and honest. How he survived this long in the army, I'll never know. And we certainly need more men like him. Everywhere. Major Duncan Munro is his official counterpart at the base, and he's heard of Reacher. General Leon Garber is the man who sent Reacher on this dead-end mission. I'm not feeling very kindly towards him. A jerk of a lieutenant colonel.<br /><br />MP Colleagues of Reacher's<br />Stan Lowrey is worried. First Sergeant Frances Neagley, another MP friend, bails Reacher out right and left. Major Karla Dixon steps up with info on the money end and some disquieting news about a background check into Deveraux.<br /><br />Fort Kelham<br />Captain Reed Riley, a real ladies' man, is the commander of Bravo Company, one of two super-secret military units at Fort Kelham. His father is Senator Carlton Riley, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Colonel John James Frazer is the current Senate Liaison for the military over at the Pentagon. The Tennessee Free Citizens is a civilian militia called out to help.<br /><br />Carter County Sheriff's Department<br />Chief Elizabeth Deveraux, a seriously good-looking woman, was a marine with the Provost Marshal's office before she quit and came home to Carter Crossing. Her daddy had been the sheriff and the voters put her in office on that basis. Pellegrino and Butler are deputies. A fingerprinting screw-up turns up Audrey Shaw, an aide to Senator Riley. Dr. Merriam is terrifyingly incompetent as a pathologist.<br /><br />Janice May Chapman is one of three victims. Emmeline McClatchy is the mother of one of the victims, Rosemary. Shawna Lindsay is another; Bruce is her sweetheart of a brother, who only wants to join the army. Shawna's mother is simply furious over the whole thing.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is gorgeous with its fluorescent blues highlighting the ties in the railroad tracks as it curves off into the distance. The rails themselves are gleaming gold as is the title.<br /><br />The title led me thinking in one direction and took me in completely another. Although, it is still The Affair that counts. And keeps me worrying that Reacher is slowing down mentally.heriff's Department<br />Chief Elizabeth Deveraux, a seriously good-looking woman, was a marine with the Provost Marshal's office before she quit and came home to Carter Crossing.

1423113497|5.0|Purchased these 3 books for my son for Christmas.  He is a huge Percy Jackson fan & always wants to borrow the series from the library.  Price was better online than any store.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story with many unexpected twists and turns.  I was surprised by how completely the descriptions of emotions and Kat's humanity overshadowed the violence of the story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is an excellent time-waster that can be enjoyed by all ages and levels of game experience. It is sort of like Bejeweled but with a great storyline.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I originally played this game on the Wii. This is a great port to Android. It is a fun unique puzzle game. Worth getting.
B002RKS81O|3.0|My sister recommended this book, so purchased it and couldn't get past chapter 8.  Between the writing style, language & amount of characters thrown at you...I gave up.  Not my sort  of novel or subject.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This right here is a very good gun.It has a very good fire rate up to about 3 bullets per second for me it shot up to 70 feet.And so I got the 18 dart clips and got 144 darts in it wow it was fun!But the bad part was that it took me about 10 minutes to pick up all the bullets.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|Great album but Rage is also a band where most of their albums have a good amount of music. Not like the other albums where only 1 or 2 songs are hits and the rest suck. I guess it's just a reflection of talent - writers and band.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This Tom Hanks - Forrest Gump DVD is a great addition to our Tom Hanks movies, wonderful movie. Like it a lot.
B000JQUZCI|3.0|I had always wanted to read the Mary Shelley Frankenstein ever since the movie came out in 1994.  The book was long & at times very boring.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|It was a fun read.  I drive a Corvette  so I had to check out the Cafe on Route 66.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave had a good story and great visuals. It's a movie I'd probably buy for the library and watch again.

6305511055|5.0|Despite the proximity to Christmas, the package arrived in plenty of time for gift wrapping. Great price, great service. Thanks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down to save my life. I didn't even want to get up  and use the restroom I was so captivated by the very first sentence of this book. This book made me feel and look at life in such a different way. This book kept me guessing there wasn't one part of this book that was predictable I found myself dropping my jaw and gasping scared for the characters and wanting so badly what Sky wanted. Everything she felt I felt. This book describes passion so beautifully that I don't think there could be a better definitnition than the one the author displays in this book. Well done I can't get this book off my mind and I definitely can't wait to read more books by this author.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff kinney  once again writes a good book. Greg has problems getting a date and when he does Rowley ends up ruining it.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I like the group they kick butt and are a real rock n roll band if you're a true die hard rock n roll fan you'll really like this group.

B0043UB0EI|5.0|Absolutely awesome! One of the best series ever produced on cable television bar none! Blood and Sand tops anything anywhere.
0307592731|5.0|Couldn't put it down!  What a good read.  Cheryl is a real person that has a lot of admirable qualities.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good book worth the read. This one was my favorite of all the Shades.  It had a beautiful ending. Must read.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|nothing special about this vs. my phone alarm apps. This should offer  more options and and be easier to use.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My all-time favorite! Greatly written, full of meaning, containing humor, and giving the true definition of kindness as well as many examples of it, this book shall be read by thee, thou, and thy, for a better book shan't be found.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|didnt help me figure out what i needed to do or find on my kindle. It really wasnt well organized.
B000K3BZVU|5.0|I gave the album a 5 star rating even though the first song on side one was scratched. I enjoyed the rest of the album even though I was a little upset with the scratch.. The 5 stars are more or less for the provider of the album, great customer service. Just like any other transaction, my card was charged and I wait for it to be on my front door step. However I receive an e-mail explaining that the album was put in the professional cleaner and a large scratch was on song 1 side 1 and that I would be receiving a full refund and that the record would still be sent to me in hopes that I would enjoy the rest of the album. And if the seller reads this comment/review you did an excellent job and I am pleased with it, and I will be returning to you for more in the future.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Powerful, gripping, and realistic story of one Oklahoma family, along with other migrants, forced to migrate to California due to changes in financial and agricultural industries. The story is thought provoking. I often like to learn about the other side of the story, of what went on with Califonians when hundreds of thousands poor hungry migrants flew to their lands! Hopefully I will find an equally fascinating novel describing those stories!
B00846REIS|4.0|Liked the book,but I wish the plot was different from 50 Shades of Grey. It is almost the same with different characters.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I would reccomend this product to anyone that is a fan of angry birds. It is sort of the same strategy put into another situation and application. You really have to think on some of the levels. Throughout the whole game though it stays fun and inventive, so you're never bored!
0151009554|5.0|2nd time I've read this story and still I love it! Will probably read it again next year! A must read, indeed...
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love hidden object games. This one has cool graphics and a good story line. G5 has done it again
B006O6F932|5.0|The grandkids loved it !!! Some smaller pieces to put together, but all in all, just what we expected .
B003O86FMW|5.0|VERY well written. Held my complete interest through every page. Your minds eye could see everything just as it was written on each page. Loved it.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|I put my memory cards in it and it holds them well. No issues with it and it easy to store in my tablet case.
B007SUW24W|5.0|It was just what I expected. On time and as advertised. It even came sooner than expected, that was nice.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I re-read it whenever I get the chance. I truly loved it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|7th Baldacci book ..<br /><br />..and love them all....looking forward to reading about John puller some more as well...good read..well done..!!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love love love TBBT!!! Regardless of what others say, I find the 5th season to still bring many laughs and hilarious situations. I love the episode when Sheldon can't get a haircut b/c his barber is in the hospital! I think that Howard is still funny, even though he is not a &#34;ladies man&#34; anymore - like he used to &#34;think&#34; he was; I think his relationship with Bernadette brings the story a new flare (the same thing can get old after a while). Penny and Leonard have to find out if they really should be together, Raj still cannot find a gf (no surprise) and has to deal with losing guy time with Howard, and Sheldon still doesn't understand Amy's thirst for affection.<br /><br />If you like the other seasons of TBBT, there's no reason you shouldn't like this one!
B000002U9E|5.0|Kate Bush's &#34;Hounds of Love&#34; is one of the best recordings of all times.  I had lost my copy and really wanted to hear it again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Just the best option to buy, incredible price, great quality picture, and offcourse we are talking about the dark knight, so no more words needed to describe this movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this is a really awesome set,its all there for you to read:)<br />therefore there is no worying about buying each book. this is why its a great book.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Game is &#34;flaw&#34; free. Does what it's supposed to. Somethimes predictable. A good one to have though. Down load by all means!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|I've been a Peter Gabriel fan for years.  Love this recording.  I am an interpretive dancer and danced to &#34;Downside Up.&#34;  In some cases, I prefer the original versions of these songs, but still really enjoyed all of these versions.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|awesome movie very nice to enjoy in 3d also very very funny and entertaining it is definitely a great option if you have kids, and also you will have a great laugh
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is awesome it has perfect, character descriptions, plots, a good summary and all that other book stuff so i really think that anyone in the mood for a good book should read this AMAZING book.<br />Its probily the best book i`v read in 2012!!!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Love these books, they are very fun and fast reads with great characters. Open your mind and enjoy them! Yeah!
1469226413|4.0|This is novel starts with the premise that there is a mystery about the &#34;main&#34; character's grandmother...... the story unfolds by telling us the story from the perspective of the granddaughter in current times, the grandmother's 'notes' and the great grandmother's letters etc that are still to be found... It was a good read and a good mystery... it's a bit convoluted and there are a lot of coincidences but definitely interesting... it's also a bit confusing jumping around from character to character and trying to understand who is who... especially in the beginning...probably easier to read as a book... i read it as an audio... which was excellent but not so easy to flip back and say... who was that?.. definitely recommend it....
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|Clicked 'Rent in HD'. After that, Amazon tested my connection and I wound up getting a non-HD stream. Why not do the test FIRST and then only offer the HD option if it is actually available??? Amazon should not charge for HD if you are unable to receive it. RIP OFF!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book! My favorite in the series! I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!!!! FANTASTIC GREAT SPECTACULAR STUPENDOUS AWESOME MASTERPIECE!! Best book ever!!!!!

0345803493|5.0|If you've read 50 Shades of Grey you must read Darker. It starts of kind of slow but enough to keep your attention but really gets interesting near the end. Must read. I truly enjoyed.

B004HW7JI8|5.0|I am a big fan of the show and so is my daughter in law but she doesnt have cable so I buy her the series each year for Christmas and she is tickled pink.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on my cell phone and now on my Android nextbook so much fun I love playing this and. search games
B00004TS0E|5.0|We bought this to replace the VHS version that we can no longer play on our equipment. This remake lacks some of the innocence of the original; it is even rather dark in spots. But it still makes for good family viewing, and except for a few updates and plot twists, the story is basically unchanged. If you like the original, you may not love this one, but you will like it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would recommend this app for anyone wanting to pass time and anyone who does not get frustrated easily. It's a great app except for the fact that some games are extremely difficult for some.
B001UV4XUG|2.0|This was a gift for my sister in law who loves this movie.  So for that reason I guess it's great, but I watched it and I wouldn't buy it.  I will never watch it again.  So, before buying watch it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|im trying to download it but it says that i have to pay help please send a msssage if u know,
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|stupid, stupid, stupid, not wasting time with sixteen more words.<br />now I remember why i do not do reviews.<br />5 more minutes wasted.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|Because we didn't like it.  It's just okay.  Honestly, if I had seen it before purchasing it would not have even gotten it at all.  Not even at the price we got it for.  I will probably never watch it again.  My kids didn't even seem interested, either.  We'll see if they want to watch it in the future.  My recommendation is try before you buy.
B00569LSUG|5.0|These guys claim to be a &#34;groove rock band&#34; and they certainly live up to the name. Probably one of the better acts to come out in the 00's. I picked up the vinyl from a 3rd party, and I don't know if it was just the batch I got or what, but the side A and side B stickers are the same. So I put kind of have to put the records and see if starts with It Isn't Meant to Be or Lucidity.<br /><br />Either way, this first album is a lot more guitar heavy than what came later. If you liked Lonerism and your taking a stroll through the catalog, then you should still enjoy this one. If you happen here after Currents is released, you'll find a different sound on Innerspeaker. Still undoubtedly Tame Impala, but certainly different.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great twist on the classic match 3 genre. If you like Bejeweled you'll love this one. It takes the classic genre, adds a story line, and imbues the game with special tiles that give interesting powers. The graphics are first rate and the animations are really well done.
B001S86J0I|3.0|We enjoy this movie.  It's a feel good movie and if you enjoy this kind of comedy then get it.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is hysterical!! I saw it with my guy friend and we laughed almost the entire time. I'm buying it this weekend because I didn't get it for christmas!
1401232590|5.0|Just finished reading this today and I want more. I know this story is over and done with but it has definitely peaked my interest in reading more Batman graphic novels.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|This is a great movie for my young daughter.  Of note, everyone is nice in this movie.  The conflict stems not from a &#34;bad guy&#34;, and I really liked that.  Not at all scary for a little kid, no violence, just a nice little story.  Personally I could have gone without watching the movie, but it wasn't made for me!  It's hard to find a movie that's just &#34;nice&#34; for the little kids, and this fit the bill.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I don't often review games, but sometimes one comes by that is so fantastically made, you have to give kudos to the developer and let others know. The graphics and music are second to none, and the physics create a fun yet challenging paradigm. Then there's the mysterious sign maker who leaves vague, yet funny and informative signs to help you through your journey. I say \\"journey\\" because instead of grids if levels for you to conquer (like Angry Birds) the levels in this game winds along a path through a world that moves. The path even forks adding to the enchantment. This game is thoroughly enjoyable! You must play this!
0547884591|5.0|I love Timothy's approach to cooking and life experiences.  Great learnings that can be applied instantly to your everyday kitchen activities.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|The Weather Channel...the best source for weather conditions and event planning.  I check it everyday especially with how fast the weather can change in the upper midwest..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The language of this novel is so real, that I couldn't help falling in love with Charlie and his story. It's a story with an important message, but it doesn't scream and shout it at you. It's subtle enough to allow the reader to find it on their own and personalize it however they need to (requiring them to \\"be a filter\\").
B005LAII3U|1.0|I might have enjoyed this film had not the sound dropped out for seconds at a time (called \\"audio dropouts\\").  Figuring it was just a bad disc, I took it back and got a new one.  Same problems.  Then I find out that all kinds of people are having the same problem.  Well, at least the ones who have 5.1/7.1 surround and actually care about the audio part of the film.<br /><br />It can be solved by changing to PCM (or just play the DVD on TV speakers), but when someone spends a lot on the audio part of a movie, he/she deserves what the package promises.  I don't know how blu-ray.com gave the audio glowing reports.<br /><br />I'm sure someone will castigate me for giving one star based on a technical problem.  Would anyone enjoy a trip of some distance in which every now and then the car feels like it went into a ditch with high sides and jarred your teeth?  It would ruin the trip, in my opinion, and it was impossible for me to enjoy this film with the sound \\"dumbed-down\\" or leaving the speakers altogether all through the film.<br /><br />So, one star for the visual. Pathetic audio.
030758836X|5.0|If you are not a subscriber to my reviews, you probably did not notice that December has been the Month of Gillian Flynn for me. I went on chronological order of her writing, starting with SHARP OBJECTS, moving to DARK PLACES, and finally ending with GONE GIRL, by far her bestseller. GONE GIRL has gone on to be one of the best-selling books of 2012, and once I'd caught up, I was eager to get my hands on this one. But let's start with the little nitpicks...<br /><br />This book was not perfect. In fact, after the first part of the book totaling about 200 pages, I was not entirely hooked. I was interested, but more than that, there was something keeping me at an arm's length. It seemed like the usual story of missing husband. Also, I was pretty sure that I had figured out the twist early on and spoiled the ending for myself. I kept waiting for the inevitable to happen.<br /><br />Turns out, I did spoil myself. But you know what? By the end, with the number of twists and turns packed into the last 50% or so, I wasn't caring about having spoiled a tiny bit of it for myself. I was more concerned with the specifics. Ms. Flynn layers them on bit by bit, heavy details that build into thick repositories of evidence that make everything so unbelievable and so dramatic.<br /><br />Like the rest of Ms. Flynn's books, GONE GIRL is not for the faint of heart. It is dramatic, extremely dark, very disturbed, and on many levels gory and inhumane. There is psychological torture, death, depravity, and deceit. But this is the story of a marriage that is damaged beyond repair, and the lengths people go to cover up lies. Our main narrator, Nick, is a husband who came home to Missouri after his life in New York crumbled. His wife Amy has gone missing, leaving behind a journal that paints Nick in a very bad light. Nick's been having an affair with a college student, and as the evidence stacks up against him, the entire country turns against him. Did Nick murder Amy?<br /><br />GONE GIRL is the epitome of a book with an unreliable narrator. Nick's lies begin to confuse the reader, and eventually, instead of empathizing, you're asking yourself, \\"Did he actually do it?\\" The characters in this were remarkable and completely fleshed out. There was nothing cardboard or stock about these. From the Dunnes to their families to the lawyers and television personalities and neighbors, this book was full of life from the supporting case especially.<br /><br />As for the prose? While not on the level of literary greats, there is little to be missed about Flynn's style of writing. The plot is expertly woven and intricate down to the every last detail involved. Ms. Flynn has set herself apart as one of the best thriller writers of the past several decades, and her career can only go up from here.<br /><br />I do have one nitpick about the movie casting (yes, this will hopefully become a film) possibilities. I know Reese Witherspoon is producing, and she's favored to play Amy, but please - NO!<br /><br />VERDICT: One of the most depraved books I've ever read, and one of the most obsessively readable, GONE GIRL is full of lies, twists, and deceptions that make it truly thrilling. A must read.the epitome of a book with an unreliable narrator.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Would recommend A Tender Bar.  Not as dark as this read.  Still looking forward to the movie.  I think it may be the exception and better than the book.
B000000OUE|5.0|Love this CD,  Forever and always.  Grease paint and monkey brains, turn it up and drive really, really fast in the desert.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love the new songs! As a long time fan of Les Mis, I was suprised by how well done this is.

1439102732|4.0|Wonderful author & definetely worth the purchase. I have read most of her books & I love her style of writing. The best part about her writing is she always gives all points of her characters. Indeed buy this if your a fan of hers.
B00AL1OV0I|5.0|I Liked The Word Play And The features. the Types and Styles Of the Songs Are Very Diverse. I Would Say It Is A Very Strong Album, Considering What Others Are Coming Out With Today.
1250007305|4.0|I purchased this book on a recommendation from one of my Cyber Security professors. I'm glad I did. Really good story...some parts are unrealistic, but on the whole it was a fun and fast paced book. Not bad at all for a geek book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great. If you like this series definitely read this one. There are so many funny tales to relate to.
0143123173|5.0|I watched the television show and I became interested in reading the books which the show is based on. Both the book and the tv show are good.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a relaxing game to play.  Really enjoy it on the airlines to keep my mind off of turbulence.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|The music was very good, however two of the songs would not start playing.  I had to manually switch to the next song.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I really love doctor who and want everything that is doctor who.  I really loved the first season of the revived show and only saw the episodes once by purchasing it I can watch the episodes any time I want.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|One of me and the hubby's favorites.  We can easily watch it again and again.  A must for the collection.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|great season<br />i recommend this to any fan of sons<br />need to see all the previous seasons before watching this
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|was not sure if I would like this movie, but I was totally surprised--the movie was very good--really good.--buy it
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Entire movie is about Jeremy Renner trying to get pills.  Little to no plot or substance.  Chase scene at the end of the movie seems to last for about 40 minutes. One of the worst big budget movies that I have ever seen.  Save your $5 and rent something else.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like using this to get a glance at what the weather will be like. The radar doesn't seem to work very well for me, and I'd like to see a way to read weather warnings.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|loved this movie-was realy amazed during the whole movie--brad pitt did a great job--will watch it over and over again
B008N5UX9M|1.0|This was dreadful.  Musically, it's okay.  Not great like I was hoping, but okay.  The singer ruins the whole project.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|I would echo most of the other sentiments in other reviews. This sonic screwdriver looks great but leaves something to be desired. The pen attachment is pretty pathetic in the way it barely attached to the body of the screwdriver. The cover over the slider that you use to extend the screwdriver is laughable (luckily, it works without the cover since it does not stay on at all). I hear the 11th doctor's sonic is a much nicer piece, but I love the 10th doctor. What can you do?<br /><br />It'll do in a pinch. I'd pay good money for a die cast metal one, but it's gotta be the 10th doctor's!
B003UESJHY|5.0|raised where this movie was filmed--brought back many memories--can relate to the whole movie--loved where the used the real cop-trainer in the movie.
0679805273|5.0|Havent read this one as yet..but soon to do so.  I am sure it is yet another great product from the Dr. Seuss collection and I cant wait to read it to the baby...
B002GHIPYI|4.0|They sound decent. sound is crisp. picks up deep bass. the way they package it damages the ear cushion and the foam actually came out when i was removing it from the package. (and i though i was being careful) but i finagled it back in the ear piece in a few seconds. overall a good deal.  ive only had them for about twenty minutes though.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Wonderful! The book was intense and well written. I'm glad that Jace and Clary got to be together and I'm really glad that we got to see more of the shadow hunters fighting the demons. All in all, there's too much to say about what's good. If you like the first books, you'll like this one too! I'm just wondering how the author will make the next book continue the story, because this one seemed like the conclusion. Still, can't wait to read the next books!!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app only allows you to see the last ten posts on your news feed. Quickly uninstalled. I'll just use the web to go on Facebook instead.
0761536434|5.0|bought this item used and it was great condition! what more can you ask for? I prefer the paper book instead of the online version just because.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great product. It is compact and stands nicely with the stand feature. Folds neatly with nice elastic stay close feature.
B0060D123K|5.0|Surprisingly true to Charles Dickens' original work, this movie strikes the perfect balance between humor and the grim subject matter.  Not all the muppet effects are cheesy/funny; the special effects are surprisingly well done for a children's film from this period.  A favorite of mine as a child, it still made me shed a few years even at 27 years old.  It kept my fiance entertained even though he had never seen it before, a true achievement!  One of the best muppet films, I think, despite it being the first film done after Jim passed away.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I was disappointed with this movie.  The special effects and such were good and it has some good actors and actresses but it just seemed like a very long chase to me.  They could have done better I thought especially with the talent they had in the movie.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is really entertaining to me it gives me a lot of entertaining laughs I hope someone reads and enjoy this book
B008NMT684|5.0|My son loves this app.  I love it too!  He loved how when he was done creating a puzzle, they cheered and there was balloons.  For a free app it is great. There are only a few puzzles, but you can buy more puzzles for your child to do.
B0086700CM|4.0|My daughter really likes this game, she is 12 and rated it 4 stars. She did not give any negative feedback to me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Words don't describe how amazing this book is. It is so detailed and descriptive . It must've tooken millions of years of creativity to make this beautiful well plotted masterpiece. It's so amazing and will take you right to Katniss's own district, to cornucopia, and the capitol as if your right there and going thought the emotions too. Only one other series is as awesome as this book and that's Harry potter series( no offense other authors! I bet your books are good to!) Although I wouldn't recommend to the squeamish, some killing and stuff... but it's still positively AWESOME!After reading The HUNGER GAMES I would DEFINITELY read it again...and again...and again until I get so tired I die! Now excuse me,  I'm off to buy the second marvelous book in the truly magnificent The HUNGER GAMES trilogy.
B008NA3I30|4.0|What I like about this film is probably what so many other people don't like about it - its refusal to moralize, and its refusal to offer pat answers to why the characters behave as they do.<br /><br />Michelle Williams (a fascinating actress who projects both childlike innocence and wisdom beyond her years at the same time) plays Margot, a 28-year-old housewife who falls in love with the aspiring artist who lives across the street. Margot at first tries to resist the obvious attraction between the two of them, but as with so many forbidden romances, their coupling seems almost unavoidable. Many films have been made about infidelity, but \\"Take This Waltz\\" comes across as unique and fresh.<br /><br />Part of this has to do with Margot's relationship with her husband, Lou (Seth Rogan), which doesn't seem like the kind of relationship a woman would want to run from. Margot and Lou have a fairly happy life together, and the two communicate together as real couples do - in a unique, shared language that's been created over years. Lou is sweet natured, has a loving family, and is working hard on publishing his cookbook. It's Margot who seems lost. She mentions a desire for a writing career but seems to have little motivation. Beyond physical chemistry, her attraction to Daniel (Luke Kirby) makes sense - the two share artistic aspirations but lack the motivation to commit to them.<br /><br />The story of passion, attraction, infidelity and betrayal is softened by the film's tone, which is almost always whimsical and fanciful. Set in Toronto, everything that surrounds the characters - the houses, the decor, the clothing - is saturated with a bright, almost childlike color palate. Only one character in the film seems to stand out from the cuteness of it all - Lou's sister, Geraldine, played by Sarah Silverman. The character, an alcoholic struggling with sobriety, seems to offer the film and its characters their only jolt of harsh reality. When she lashes out at Margot in a drunken rage, it's ironically the most sober moment in the film. She accuses Margot of using a new romance the same way she uses alcohol - as a quick, but ultimately unsatisfying fix to temporarily fill the emptiness that is a natural part of life.<br /><br />The film asks a difficult question: if all relationships, even happy ones, lose their freshness and excitement over time, how do you know whether it's better to stick it out or part ways? Even the ending of the film offers no clear cut answer as to whether Margot's decisions have worked out for the best.runken rage, it's ironically the most sober moment in the film.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas sparks book I've read and I absolutely loved it. I will recommend this to everyone I know
B005LAIHEA|5.0|Hilarious is the best word I can say about this movie. Love these actors and love that it was partly filmed in Michigan!
B003L77G10|5.0|It really kept our interest high. Each installent kept us rivited to the screen as the story unfolded.We couldn't wait to start the 3rd season when we finished it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Excellent game for a five year old!  My little girl loves to play...I have to limit her time on it.  She would play all day if allowed!  Great game!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Mr. Buble, you have done it again. I love listening to Michael Buble and everyone in my family enjoys it as well. Love this Christmas CD.
B003FSTN52|5.0|It built up our knowledge of just what had gone on in the story. We couldn't stop watching it. When one episode would end we had to go right on to the next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was absolutely amazing in every way possible. It has everything. Action, adventure, sex, lust love, hot guys…pretty much everything you could ask for in a sexy book like this. It doesn't hurt in the relationship department either((:
B007N8RULO|4.0|great game to pass the time. shame about the ads because they are an interference. but still a good buy.
B0053O89YM|5.0|It brought us right up to date on the series.We couldn't wait to see the next installment as each one ended. We would recommend this series to everyone who likes a good lawyer book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it. It didn't change Greg's character and it stayed original. I read all of these books and they keep getting better
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are a lot of things that aren't perfect about Firefly, but the way the amazing cast comes together to tell their stories is absolutely remarkable. Whatever flaws the series has are completely forgotten once it gets underway; the characters are interesting and endearing, and the writing alternates between suspenseful and hilarious to great effect.<br /><br />Highly recommended; this show ended too soon.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Wes Anderson might need a new movie concept.  This was too much like The Royal Tenenbaums (same palette, quasi-surreal sets, droll characters, etc.), but without its originality or narrative.  Movies need not be plot driven, but a little more narrative arc or a little more movement within the characters'  psyches would have made for a better movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed and I cried.  This book will always and forever have a place near and dear to my heart. Okay? Okay.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|None other than magic. It is a book that is as enchanting as it is extraordinary, and it is writing that truly speaks to the soul.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I like MW as an actor.  Some of his movies aren't so good so I love it when he scores on a new movie.
B00340ESIS|4.0|I would recommend SAVE THE CAT, to all aspiring and established screen writers. I also found it helpful in my own fiction writing.<br />The author used humor to get his point across.<br />A good buy!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Every AB game gets better on every level.  This is the most current so it rocks.  If you like AB this one is a home run.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I bought this as a present for my 3 year old who loves spongebob. This is a nice and small beanie he can carry around, but not to big that he can't play with it.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|What I love about Renner is he renovates houses, maybe not so much any more since he seems to be working a lot, in addition to kicking ass in movies.  Makes him a real person.  Love that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey : Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy<br />  All (3) books are great.  Wish there was a forth book.  Story line was great.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Sort of Jason Bourne, Matrix, waking up with no memory, wondering WTF is going on, tons of tactical skills, mad chase scenes, and two very hot chicks for eye candy, way hot, beautiful, stone cold fox, every guy's type, gun wielding hotties. Winning combo.  Love seeing Collin in full on Hollywood movies rather than independent mood pieces.
B000002UA0|5.0|I've owned this on lp for decades, but it was great to finally get it on CD. One of the best psychedelic albums of the late 1960s. The sound engineering brilliance of Norman Smith ensured that Floyd's debut (much like his collaborations with the Beatles and The Pretty Things),stood out as among the more psychedelic albums of the late 1960s. Pink Floyd owed a great deal to his imprint as well as that of Syd Barrett, especially the space rock elements of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", which led to the more free form experimentations found on Floyd albums from \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" through \\"Meddle\\". A must have album for enthusiasts of psychedelic music, Pink Floyd fans and rock fans in general.
B008M36ER0|5.0|The premise and the plot twists and turns are awesome.  Mel's best in a while.  Check it out.  Not too violent.
B0000009NG|5.0|Easily my favorite David Bowie album. Much like the band High Tide,\\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" combined dark and heavy music and lyrical imagery with a high degree of technical skill which would become prominent in progressive metal bands later on. Definitely not a conventional album for its time, but more a transition towards the sound that Bowie achieved success with on the excellent Ziggy Stardust album a few years later. An excellent album I was finally able to get on CD. Highly recommended.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read this trilogy while on a family vacation.  I knew a few women who had read the series, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Fun but ridiculous, in a nutshell.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Me and my family have watched this movie multiple times and laugh each time. The more we watch it the more we find to laugh at.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I am a big David Byrne and Talking Heads fan and this disc has many of Byrnes &#34;classic&#34; sounds and styles I haven't heard out of him in a while.  I wasn't familiar with St Vincent but enjoyed her input so much that I have gotten some of her solo work since hearing this disc.  Not every song is worth 5 stars, but the well build rhythms and novel use (for a pop record) of brass instruments creates a sound worth listening to repeatedly.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Everything went smoothly in the download and operation of the program. I do wish it had a concordance and commentaries.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Writing a review on a book, good or bad, isn't something I generally do, but on finishing The Martian by Andy Weir, I just had to share.  Mark Watney is part of the Ares  3 team who is left for dead by the rest of his crew in a massive Martian storm that threatens the mission.  Unbeknownst to the crew, he survived his injuries and is now alone on the planet.  This book is about his survival, the crew who left him and NASAs team who work tirelessly on his behalf.  What I loved best about this book was the good ole' American can-do spirit.  It was wonderful.  Despite the absolutely dire circumstances Mark finds himself in, he figures it out and he doesn't lose his sense of humor about it, something we all should have more of.  And while I'm on the subject of humor, this book has absolutely priceless one-liners.  I wasn't expecting them, but found myself more than once laughing, not just a chuckle, but hysterically.<br /><br />I will say that there were plenty of parts of the book that got too long on explanation, but I guess what else would you expect from an official surviving Mars handbook?  Even though I didn't really need to know some of the details, it was amazing to realize someone else had figured out the logistics of jury-rigging together different equipment to get things to work.  And I had no idea that sugar burns and in the right atmosphere, can be used as an explosive.  Is it true?  I dunno, but it sure was fascinating.<br /><br />I should add that the language is rather colorful, but again, given the circumstances, it would be par for the course.<br /><br />For the 99 cents, honestly, you cannot find a better bargain anywhere.  For anyone who reads science fiction, I cannot recommend this enough.  This would make a great movie!<br /><br />Thank you Mr Weir.  I look forward to more by you.  Great job.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Love this new book! Shows us to a whole new side of Agent Pendergast. Always excitement and mystery<br />with Preston & Child. I hope this series continues for a long time.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Worst one in the series that I have seen. I would not watch this movie again. Looked as if the movie had a low budget.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|Hannibal is a delicious film, a dark delight that is full and wet, rather like a warm bucket of blood. It is full of nuance and complexity, and rewards repeated viewings. The music is beautiful, dense, heavy and mirrors many of the scenes with wonderful unease and intensity. More colourful, detailed and richer than The Silence of the Lambs, the performance of Hopkins as the good doctor is wonderful and endlessly watchable. Julianne Moore is beautiful, all marble skin, red lips and fierce intelligence. I must confess, it is one of my favourite films, it is just so evocative and atmospheric that I often return to this black palace and bathe in the many bloody treasures that it holds. A luxurious horror, like being wrapped in velvet drapery that falls to the ground and in the moonlight, blood drips from the trees.
B000OB5UU0|5.0|I don't think you could script a better mockumentary.  The fact that Some Kind of Monster is unscripted makes it more delicious.  I don't think that Lars, James, Kirk, Creepy Performance-Enhancement-Coach-Guy, Bob Rock, et al. are acting, but if it turned out that David Mamet had scripted this as some sort of performance-art piece, I wouldn't be surprised.<br /><br />Very funny, and sometimes even touching.  Kudos to the band for allowing this soup of human frailty be seen. Metallica do not seem to notice the inherent irony of being the richest, most influential rock band in the world, and that makes for some very funny moments. Of course the music is great.  I don't think you need to be Metallica fan to enjoy this, but it helps.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|Totally hilarious! I look forward to watching this every year, and now I finally have my own copy. I love all the National Lampoon Griswold family movies but this one is my favorite!

0547995660|5.0|This has been a powerful book for me ever since I first read it in the sixth grade.  Something resonated from then and I return to it over and over.  In fact, I credit it with developing my love of dystopian fiction in general.  And while this book has its flaws, it's so much a part of my love of books that I simply don't care.<br /><br />Jonas is an eleven year old living in his community.  He has an assigned family unit and the coming December marks his transition to a twelve year old.  This is the year that his job assignment happen and he learns his role in the community.  However, the unexpected happens when he is chosen to be the new Receiver for his community, a role that is only granted to one person and the previous Receiver is growing old.  It isn't until his training though that Jonas learns what this job actually entails.  He is the receiver of memory, good and bad, and the only holder of true feelings besides his mentor the Giver, in a world that has chosen sameness over choice and life.<br /><br />Jonas is pretty compliant.  He was designed to be that way from his birth to his training at home.  But his experiences with the Giver make him grow and he slowly drifts away from obedience to wanting something better for a community that doesn't want the same thing.  The Giver too is a wise but pitiable figure as he has all this knowledge and wisdom and can't really share it with anyone.  He has to suffer alone.  The other characters are two-dimensional, as they are supposed to be.  They have so long been brainwashed and chemically controlled that they are arguably not true humans, but more like robots. And their reactions to each other are so superficial that it's painful to read.<br /><br />The theme is definitely dystopian.  So much so because Jonas does live in the perfect world.  No war, no bullies, everyone is polite; but there is no true life.  There is no art or music or all the wonderful things that we take for granted in this world.  That the quest for perfection and easiness has a high price to pay, and people shouldn't get complacent.  And the ending, without giving too much away I do want to comment on it.  It gives you a choice, and it's interesting too what people think of the ending and why.  I tend to choose the more tragic route.  The only thing I could really want more from this book is detail about Jonah's society.  There is so much about its past and its everyday workings that I would have loved to understand.<br /><br />This is definitely a book that will make you think. It will always remain on my shelf and is one that I take with me on long travels.  There's a plethora of feelings that come from reading it.<br /><br />The Giver<br />Copyright 1993<br />180 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B003204MQS|4.0|I dont really like these kind of movies but this series had<br />intrigued me.  It is very good.  There is some dead time<br />and they dont spend allot of time on the death part.<br />It is more about the paranormal activity.

Of course, the gift was opened yesterday at Christmas and it's now over the 30 day time frame and the \\"set\\" was missing one of the Discs. So now, my gift is worthless since that person doesnt own a blue ray player and the disk missing is the DVD.  I order from Amazon often and will not recommend ever using this seller as their product is defective and there is no way to rectify it now that the \\"gift\\" was ordered over 30 days ago.

B000O1799U|5.0|I just had to snag this movie because it is one of my favorites. The price was absolutely unbelievable!! Very pleased with this purchase.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I saw the movie in theaters and got blown away by the story. A strong female character who fights to preserve her humanity in an inhuman contest of survival.  Seeing it again reaffirmed everything I loved about the movie. Big ups to the Jennifer Lawrence for portraying a strong female lead who is not to show her vulnerability when it counts. The other casts members helped to add gravitas and depth to movie and kept me engaged from beginning to end. I look forward to the sequel.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am very pleased that I finally own this movie. I purchased it for a great price and I could not be happier.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|As usual, the plot moves along smoothly. Reader knows how it ends but never how it gets to the ending until the last chapter.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great, multi-choice version of Mahjong.  I enjoy the different configurations, and the easy to use options (shuffle, etc.) on the side.
B0038P59A0|4.0|My husband is not a man who likes to watch movies after he's seen them but this is one he actually asked for. Robert Downey, Jr. is the best Holmes hands down and the combination of humor and action keeps the movie moving at a fun pace.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to use, easy to see, no problems with operation... I would suggest this to anyone needing a simple alarm or clock.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Well  this is the simplest remote desktop I have tried connecting to a Windows 8 desktop graphics modes are excellent on a 7 inch tablet. I haven't used it enough to fully evaluate but first impressions are great.Keep up the good work.

B003WUYRGI|4.0|A very handy book. Used it a lot for school and for studying. I would advise anybody to get it
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|it only shows Los Angeles and n/a for all the temps, etc - when I type in another location it won't put it on so I can't use it at all - I even had techies look at it and they said the app just didn't work

B002MQYOFW|4.0|It really surprises me how different movie is from this book. i enjoyed this book and am going to book number two.

B0098VYKSA|5.0|I wasn't expecting much with this once and was delightlyfully surprised.  I loved this movie, very exciting and creepy, a fun twist on Snow White.

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I can't help but watch Resident Evil when it comes on TV.  I know it isn't exactly Oscar caliber, but there is definitely something appealing about the franchise.  That being said, I was looking forward to Retribution, but was utterly disappointed.  This movie is just bad, makes little sense, and is not even worth the $3.99 24-hour rental charge.  Skip it!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My favorite movie by far. Joss Whedon done an amazing job with all of the heroes. Buy this movie you will not be dissapointed.
B006OITIQE|3.0|Bought this for my daughter. She likes it, but after the first 6 times, it does get a little old.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|If you're a fan of the 3 Indiana Jones movies then you will love them in blu-ray (and they even throw in a coaster to set your beer on).
B007XF0X16|4.0|I rated this product with 4 stars because I love the movie and I love Blu Ray.  And yet more than that I love the way Blu Ray looks every time I watch a movie.  Now the reason I chose this particular movie to watch in Blu Ray is due to the epic nature and action of this film.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|From everything I've heard these games are amazing. I bought this and of course when I went to play it I found that the blu-ray drive in my PS3 was dead so I will have to wait a while longer.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|I chose Mad Men because I love the show but with the Blu Ray the 50's & 60's come alive like never before.  It is beautiful to watch and to be able to observe fashion of that world on a scale that you just cant get through any other type of DVD.  Blu Ray is the only way to watch Mad Men.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|bad acting, poor script.<br />not worth the money.<br />not worth the money.<br />not worth the money.<br />not worth the money
B002C4YYEU|4.0|David Fincher is probably one of my favorite directors and in this mysteriously magical film you appreciate his visual style so much more through Blu Ray.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Every year I try to add a song or two to my Christmas playlist, and this year I was able to add six!  &#34;O Holy Night&#34; is my favorite Christmas song and this is now my favorite version!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Both my adult son & I get a lot of mileage from this game!  He is especially adroit at killing those targets!
B009LUBA7M|5.0|Love this album.  I was a little worried when I heard it wasn't going to be in the same vein as his last two, but this one is just as good, just is a slightly different direction.  And how he changed &#34;Elle Me Dit&#34; to &#34;Emily&#34; was kind of genius.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I plan to take this on my Kindle Fire to church for following the sermon, and for teaching the children.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is marvelously heart breaking. I loved it. I could feel my heart shatter more and more with every word after Chapter 19.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have become addicted to Mahjong! Can't wait to try Barnyard version to see if it stacks up to this one.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was little and am really glad I could find it on dvd. :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy Spider Solitaire and it's nice to be able to take it with me on my Kindle Fire!
B000FC10WU|5.0|It is an Agatha Christie - what else is there to say - brilliant as always. She will never be a boring read!!!!!!
B000026FOA|2.0|In my opinion, the CD contains two songs that I thought were worth listening to; the rest just sounded like filler music.  I should have purchased the singles instead.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Love this movie. Inspirational. True. And a great reminder that a different mind is not a less mind. Temple Grandin Rocks!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME AND THE VARIETY.<br />CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.  A GREAT ADDITION TO MY NEW KINDLE HD.  GET IT.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|the movie was awesome from start to end, it was a little long but the story and the amount of non stop action kept me interested till the end great movie
B004ZJZQFG|5.0|This is one of the great submarine movies of all time. Best depiction of a depth charge attack ever. Solid acting, script and execution.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie!! Bought one for myself and one for my sister!!  This is definitely one of the best movies to come out in a long time!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The Third Wheel is a wonderful book, can't read  anything better or funnier!  I love these books, the entire series is great.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I still wish Mr. Clancy would slow down pn the publishing and do the research of his earlier works, but this one is much better than the last.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game! Gives you a little bit of strategy but with ease. The game can be played in about an hour unlike some other strategy games. And although it says for 3+ players... it can be played with two
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!  6 Stars!  I cannot put into words how much I love this book!  Colleen Hoover has done it again... what an amazing writer!<br /><br />I love the humour, the clever play on words, the story telling is impeccable!  Both Sky and Holder are characters that will worm there way into your heart, warm it up and find a place to stay forever in it.  I feel as though I know them both personally.<br /><br />This is a book that I know I will re-read time and time again!  Just... wow!
B00008O89K|5.0|Often forgotten, but extraordinary score by Poledouris.  Each piece contributes to the whole, but stands alone in its beauty.  Simple, powerful, and outstanding, even more so considering its genre.  I've often paid more for much less!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a good read. Very interesting. I loved every part of it. I would definetly reccommend it to anyone.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I am NOT into any kind of rap but Ms Keys actually sings like a woman of quality, &#34;this girl is on fire&#34;  Mr. Keys truly is on Fire.  Would like to have her sing more music and forget about rap.  rap just does not do this Woman justice.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, suspenseful and human. Smart and complicated. If you've been following Mitch Rapp for awhile you won't be disappointed.
B000002B30|5.0|when you want to just forget all that is going on around you and all of your aches and pains and limitations, this is the album to listen too and just dance the best you can like nobody is watching and your really do not care if anyone does see you. Thank you Mr. Springsteen for some great Rock N Roll.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I have seen the television show and they are very similar, the book and the show, but at the same time very different. I love the element of surprise in both!
B0028N72A8|4.0|It's easy to forget how Google has changed our lives. True to the title, this book focuses on the company rather than Larry and Sergei. I got a deeper appreciation of how Google broke many rules in the process of making our lives better.<br /><br />I hadn't realized how much much importance Google placed in attracting smart people from universities and competitors (especially Microsoft). The launch of Google China is especially interesting.<br /><br />This book definitely helps you understand Google better.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book was a perfect ending to the Twilight Saga. Amazing and perfect in every way,shape, and form. I have no complaints about it.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent story! Exciting and kept my attention throughout. Five star rating. Thank you very much for a great adventure on Mars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love this game.  It is easy.  It is challenging and I could sit and play it all evening long.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This dictionary app works well in giving a user a concise definition. You should not expect a word defined in depth; go to a bigger, bound dictionary for that. It is fine for what it is.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It does not go where I want it to.  Kind of has a mind of its own.  Don't like it as much as the other games
B005M5PENG|5.0|I was living in Hawaii when the series began so it is fun to watch it again.  Nice to watch it on my time.
B007SUW24W|5.0|My younger sister loved opening this gift for Christmas. I have never listen to Ed Sheeran but It has been a CD that she has already listened to a few times even though it is only one say after she got it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Bought this app for my kids on their new Kindles. Thought it would allow me to get my iPad and my old Kindle back. Let them play the game on their own devices. The problem is, the game will not allow them to \\"see\\" the server of any of the games they start on their new devices. They can join a game hosted on my iPad or on my old kindle, they just can not join any games from one started on one of their new devices. Note, the setting in the Minecraft game for the server is set to Visible. So that is not the issue.<br /><br />I have searched the Internet and Mojang's website for a solution but see no solution. I also emailed Mojang but have not gotten a response. If anyone knows a solution please post it.<br /><br />Thanks
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Curiosity got the better of me and I had to succumb to the read. Recommended for any sane person to indulge and satisfy their inquisitive adult senses.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Quite the addicting little game.  Endless hours of fun and fustration!!  Word of advise DON'T play this at work.  Unless your boss plays it too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first it seemed silly to read this book after having seen the movie, but it was worth it. Loved it. And somehow, even having seen the movie first, the writing is so well done your loyalty is to the book's story. I didn't believe Peeta in the film. I believe him here. So worth it. Impossible to put down.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|As I have said, this movie is a waste of time. Watching it once was one time too many. Too bad.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very suspenseful with a touch of heart. I love Nicholas Sparks book, they are always so hard to put down.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Men In Black 3 is entertaining and funny. We enjoyed it for purely recreational viewing. It would be too violent for young kids.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I really enjoyed this book. A definite read for any love story readers out there. It made me appreciate the man in my life.
B00ARAO6R6|1.0|They tried to do a Tarantino movie and failed miserably.  It's shame to see decent actors in this trashy fare.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. A definite read for any love story readers out there. It made me appreciate the man in my life.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I have the original &#34;recalled&#34; DVD version that contains the alternative ending in black and white.  Back then, producers were very upset that this &#34;banned&#34; DVD was distributed without their participation.  They wanted to have the director's cut for the DVD distribution.  I don't think that they were released in proper version since then.  Now in this Blu-Ray format, we have two versions-- proper director's cut and theatrical release.  Fun to watch a perfectly crafted talking plant puppet from outer space.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My son enjoyed playing this game.  It was easy to learn and still has challenges to keep him entertained. I found the game very addicting.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|3 stars for not including the extended version of Avatar.  5 stars for the story of movie.  Back then, some Blu-Ray 3D player manufacturers had exclusive rights to prevent few of 3D blockbusters from the distribution as retail B-3D disc packages.  It was really stupid idea.  Ebay and Amazon did sell them as &#34;OEM&#34; discs, without player, at ridiculously prices.  Now, this time with the proper package and the proper price.
0307730697|5.0|I read this one evening.  Adam Brown was - without question - an American hero of the first order.  But he was so much more than that.

B00002E224|5.0|The product was received on time. Haven't watched it yet but expect a good quality product. The item was a gift for my daughter as a preview to Vienna before our trip there this summer.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Our family rented Elf and we all enjoyed the movie. We think this is the best movie Will Ferrell has done so far.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The comic book part is a little corney, but the actual game play is fun, the tiles have good graphics and you can change the options for sound/music, which some apps don't do.  I'll keep it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great cover for Kindle Fire HD. Protects Fire from all sorts of mishaps--particularly from dropping it. Well designed so that all features along the edges of the Fire are easily accessible. Great color if you happen to be one of those persons who just sets the Fire down at random and then cannot remember where--it stands out from its surroundings. Would recommend it enthusiastically.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Ok game but it goes a little fast when you have more than a couple of cards you are playing
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|I did not like the first Total Recall - and had no desire to watch this one because of it.  I was outvoted in the house that night and I'm very glad I was.  It was a fantastic movie!  Tons of action and chase scenes, twists and turns.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B0086700CM|3.0|It goes a little fast paced for a beginner. Wish there was an option to slow it down until you get the hang of the game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very Very good book, it showed that true love can weather anything sometimes people cone into your life and you don't know until later on
B0086700CM|1.0|Is there a way I can get this off my KIndle?  I don't like it at all and it's just taking space right now.  I'm not playing it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This will only show the first maybe 10 posts, and won't let you see beyond that.  Also, there is not a great way to get it to show &#34;most recent&#34; vs. &#34;top stories&#34; that I have found.  Really wish it would show entire news feed, then I would give it a much higher score...but the way it is now, it is basically useless!
0316227706|5.0|I pre-ordered it from Italy and I have to say that it's the best photobook about dogs I ever seen! Really nice, it really takes the soul of the dogs! Never-stop-laught!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This has an awesome category function, it works well with a mobile device such as a Kindle.  I never really was addicted to Pinterest...but this ap will let me use it much more frequently.
034580404X|5.0|GOT THESE FOR ME TO READ WHEN I GET THE CHANCE TOO.....HEARD THEY WHERE VERY GOOD TO READ ONCE YOU START THEN YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT THEM DOWN
1938469003|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my beer-brewing husband.  He declared that this was one of the two books that he's been wanting most and is thrilled with it's contents!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|The red Kindle Fire cover is perfect!  The Kindle snaps into it so there's no slippage, it folds to form a stand or be a tradtional cover...and the texture feels nice to boot!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Bought this game for the kids on the new kindle fire and they love it and play it all day
B009329Y30|4.0|Wish movie would keep true to book, but still loved it.  Ending not exactly same as book.  Love the actors.
