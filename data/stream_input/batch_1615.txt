B008645YEE|3.0|Just like the soundtrack to the second film (the dark knight ) the first soundtrack to be released had been chopped up and not what we hear in the film.<br /><br />I remember listening to TDK soundtrack all the time and noticing right away sounds and parts missing form what I heard in the film (the bank robbery for example). Then the dark knight special edition came out and it was exactly right, The music scene for scene in order right as you heard in the film. I was so happy, still Love it. However again they release the soundtrack out of order and missing bits...WHY? Why don't you just put everything you worked hard on in the disc?!<br /><br />Also In rises the first thing we see is the plane scene, so why is it the 3rd track?<br /><br />I loved the music in the movie and the trailer which is also missing from the soundtrack( again why? its so good).<br /> I cant understand why they don't release it exactly how we hear it in the film right away?<br /> I hope they put another one out that has all music in order including the music from the trailers incorporated in it.<br /><br />It's so simple, just do it.
B007HNG5B6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the Game of Thrones series and can't wait to purchase Season II from Amazon Instant Video.  This series was a unique fantasy - Lord of the Rings without the elves and hobbits.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was a huge fan of the books before seeing the movie. Initially, I was skeptical, because we all know that movies don't usually live up to their written counterparts. With this movie, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the movie was surprisingly faithful to the book! Of course, a few adjustments were made for time but they were so subtle, I didn't feel like it took away from the essence or excitement of the story. Great movie. Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic actress. Definitely worth your time to watch!

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Did any body like the bad guy/woman! Charlize Theron (the bad guy/woman) did an awsome job! I had goose bumps! Snow white, um, not so much. Kristen Stewart can play only one role and she does it in all of her movies! Awkward! I've seen the Twilight movies (NOT as good as the books!The books are better!!!)and she did bella playing snow white the best. All of her roles are the same. So... will i spend thirty dollars on snow white and the huntsman to watch again as bella becomes the worlds most awkward queen. UGGGGG!!! No!!! probably not.
1594630844|1.0|I purchased this book based on a newspaper review and the many glowing reviews here on Amazon, but after the first 30 or so pages I was forcing myself to continue reading as not to waste the good money I spent on the book.

Well worth the time spent.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|If you enjoy the Foo Fighters enough not to buy every CD they put out, this is for you.  The number of tracks on the CD is a more economical way to get their best compared to individual purchases through other means.<br /><br />Plus, the Amazon version I purchased had a cover of Pink Floyd that isn't available in other outlets from what I understand.<br /><br />Casual fans who like all of the popular Foo Fighters songs should definitely put this one on their list.

0634060384|2.0|I was very disappointed and plan on returning the item. You would expect , even if the the book is \\"used\\" to have all of the music contents intact. There were dozens of pages missing, especially in the A section.
1439199388|5.0|As a physician, I found Velasquez-Manoff's book a fascinating read. \\"An Epidemic of Absence\\" is quite obviously a labor of love by the author, as he poured through thousands of scientific studies to answer the question: Are our own healthy habits actually making us more unhealthy? More than ever, our Western society is focused on germs - eradicating and avoiding them. Could it be that eradicating these germs actually opens ourselves up to diseases that we wouldn't otherwise be exposed to?<br /><br />Velasquez-Manoff points to our gastrointestinal tract as, quite possibly, the most important organ in our body. It is filled with billions of intestinal microbes that function as more than just digestive aids. He hypothesizes that these microbes also function to educate the immune cells of our body, and altering these microbes (such as with antibiotics, sanitary measures, and even de-worming pills) can wreck havoc on our bodies. Our immune systems then go out-of-control, contributing to such conditions as allergies, asthma, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and even autism. He also hypothesizes that the alterations to our immune system can also contribute to other, seemingly-unrelated, diseases such as depression.<br /><br />If the hypotheses in this book are proven correct, then its ramifications to the practice of modern medicine are profound. In this book, the author presents his findings in interesting and even self-deprecating ways. He even enters the somewhat unusual group of patients who purposely infect themselves with intestinal worms. Do the worms help the author improve his balding? You'll have to read to find out!<br /><br />This book joins another book released this year that I consider a 'must read.' [[ASIN:1594488436 God's Hotel: A Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage to the Heart of Medicine]] by Victoria Sweet is an affecting story about one of the last hospitals that provided medicine in an old-fashioned, unhurried approach. It's a profound journey.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I loved Time Out Of Mind, Love & Theft and Modern Times, but this seems to drag a bit (so did Together Through Life) and this definitely needs a few more up tempo songs that rock a little more.

B009329ZF2|1.0|Trying to emulate Transformers is, uh, not quite going to make the best movie.<br /><br />However if you want mindless (MINDLESS) entertainment- go for it.  End of a long day- with a beer, I'd watch it.<br /><br />Seriously- DON'T think.  I made that mistake- hence 1 star.<br /><br />It's pretty mind numbing- such as: how exactly do they send radio signals faster than light?  How does a loser who get arrested for breaking into 7-11, joins the navy- and gets made into an officer ?  DON'T think, you'll hate yourself.
B000086BB5|5.0|I first purchased this soundtrack on cassette way back in about 2000. I received the CD from my grandmother about 5 years ago. Then, I purchased it on vinyl. I thought it would be neat to play this collection on the older stereos I own.<br /><br />The song Keep on the Sunny Side sounds a bit overloaded for some reason and there are a few light pops throughout the whole set, as can be expected.<br /><br />Overall, I think this vinyl set has a richer, warmer sound when compared to the CD and especially the cassette.<br /><br />Amazon you win again !
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I purchased the book before the 60 minutes interview, which I have still not watched, because I thought it would be an interesting read. I have read all of Tom Clancy's books and have always admired  Mr. Clark, the special operations (ex-Seal?)character, and figured this story would be even better. It is. Even though I knew how it would turn out, I read every page with interest and enthusiasm.<br /><br />Although there was quite a bit of pre-publication publicity, other than a comment about a \\"promise to get together for a beer at the residence\\" which has yet to have been kept, there is nothing in the book that I have not heard, read or been speculated on before. He even goes out of his way to not comment on specific things which have been speculated about before such as the stealth characteristics, if any of the Blackhawks. My point is that I believe I understand why he wrote the book, appreciate that he did, hope it is extremely successful, as most of proceeds go to SEAL related charities, and I hope he is not persecuted or prosecuted for doing so.<br /><br />The only potentially political take aways from the book are: a realization of the asymmetrical nature of the missions SEALS are routinely deployed on in Afghanistan - a team of highly trained SEALS are tasked to take out a dozen Taliban fighters; the apparent shift in the rules of engagement in recent years for political purposes where lawyers have to seemingly approve most missions; how many missions are planned but ultimately never approved by Washington; etc. These themes come together in the final raid itself - tasking untold millions of dollars and putting at risk tens of lives to capture or kill one person, in order to prove that they had gotten UBL, with the additional benefits of gathering intelligence and avoiding collateral civilian casualties. Making that decision, to send in SEALS versus calling in an air strike was a pretty bold decision and gives credence to comments about it being a \\"gutsy\\" decision. If telling the story in this manner makes it political, then that is in the eyes of the reader and was probably not intended, as the author makes it clear that he and many of his fellow seals are not fans of the president.<br /><br />It will be very interesting to see how this telling of the story compares with  Kathryn Bigelow's forthcoming film about the killing of Osama Bin Laden, now titled Zero Dark Thirty, which is due to be released in December.
B00846REIS|5.0|Sexy and easy read. If you liked 50 Shades of Grey you will enjoy Bared to You. I hope they make a movie!
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|The relationship between the queen (Theron) and her brother were better played off than the one between Snow White and the Huntsman.  If I were him I would have thrown her out at the beginning.  To be truthful this movie is worth watching because of the Queen, the Queen's Brother whom almost took over this movie, and one of the dwarves (Bob Hoskins).  Not to say the Hunstman didn't try to play his part it's just when your working with a no talent it's difficult to shine.  Recommend - see it once for the dark and then decide whether it's worth seeing again.
B000LC55F2|4.0|This is a movie with a stellar cast, a good script, an intriguing premise and a lot of twists and turns. It also features a climax in which it changes from one type of movie to another. Whether this type of cross-genre transformation is a good thing seems to be very much a matter of personal opinion; some like it, some don't.<br /><br />The film is set in late Victorian England and is appropriately gloomy (I wonder if everything really was as monotone as it is always portrayed in stories about that era?). Two illusionists are battling each other to be acclaimed as the best magicians of their time. The story follows the efforts of each to outdo the other. The rivalry is not only heightened but becomes bitter when personal tragedy intervenes. One develops a trick that the other simply can't match, until.......<br /><br />And here's where the story shifts. I'm not going to give it away, but suffice it to say that the battle is won and lost by unconventional means. Does the story work? Yes, it does. Is the transformation fair? That depends on your point of view. On the whole, I tend to think it's cheating, but then stage magic is cheating anyway, because it isn't really magic.<br /><br />Watch for yourself and make up your mind. There's such a lot to like about the movie that even if you don't care for the ending you'll still have enjoyed the film, as I did.

B000YABS8E|5.0|We enjoyed this comedy immensely.  I have not belly laughed so hard in a long time.  And yet, there were a lot of subtle and important points made: the power of fear; the place of religion in our lives; the strength of a pure heart and the power of love.  I had no idea that Sissy Spacek was such a great comedienne, and Christopher Walken is one of my all time favorites.  Best of all is Brendan Fraser who was TOTALLY believable in his role.  I highly recommend this film.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|I have been a lifelong Bob Dylan fan.  His evolution has been well chronicled and this is sure to be a treat to old fans and possibly some new.  About 99% of the people I talk to about Dylan comment on his very raspy voice.  Guess what?  Who cares?  His voice fits this CD so perfectly.  I'd consider it a folk and blues mash up.  The CD goes back to the roots of his music in some great storytelling.  This isn't a CD that you will find yourself skipping to the next song.  Although some of them are long for some people; you get lost in this journey of a CD.  Tempest isn't Dylan's best album by a long shot, but to give it anything less than 5 stars would be an insult to a truly great piece of music.
B002M87V0A|5.0|If you enjoy musicals strictly for entertainment, I rate The Music Man as Five (5) Star. From the point of view of a musician the musical score may seem somewhat repetitive. Many of the individual songs are based on the 76 Trombones tune. Though it may seem somewhat composition laziness it does provide for entertaing harmony and interaction between two scenes. I loved it.

0061122416|4.0|One of the most inspiring and extraordinary fables written by Paulo Coelho called The Alchemist, is overall a literary masterpiece. This book is a must read for everyone seeking their own personal purpose. As we follow the story of a mere shepherd boy pursuing treasure we find ourselves pursuing that treasure as well. Coelho draws you into the fable using an adventurous and fun writing style that keeps you entertained throughout. Coelho inspires the reader to take chances in life and trust that pursuit of what one loves results in a rewarding destiny. Throughout the fable the author often references to a higher being or understanding as a key to a successful life's journey.<br /><br />  As Santiago or the shepherd boy journeys through exotic lands, his personal encounters with numerous and diverse characters produces a metamorphosis in his perspective about the world. Likewise, the reader is led on a roller coaster ride of people, places and situations so vivid that you can almost place yourself alongside the boy accompanying him on his adventures. The reader is prompted to find self-enjoyment and seek love. This message is key to a greater humanity and finding peace.
1476712042|3.0|Ugh, it's been a week since I finished this book and still I'm wrestling with how I feel about it.  I liked it, but then I hated it.  This book was an awesome page-turner that simultaneously frustrated me beyond belief and had me begging for the end.  It was a roller coaster of a story; the characters were all over the place emotionally and the plot lines branched out towards the end in crazy, unecessary ways.  The story was so scattered that at times, I would pick it up to read again, and would forget if the main characters were on again or off again.<br /><br />I admire the author for publishing this on her own and making a name for herself as an author.  I respect her for that and I appreciate the talent that went into the story writing process.  However, this book really didn't affect me deeply or stick with me after I finished reading.  All in all, it's not one I would recommend.  The teenie novella, \\"Hearts in Darkness\\" was 1/4 of the book with a much better plot, interesting characters and great writing.
B000002J0N|5.0|I have to begin by stating that in this review I am simply not going to consider the work of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young -- for the simple reason that, when Neil Young joins the CSN mix and it becomes CSNY, you're really talking about a completely different band. The whole vibe changes (the band agrees on this, by the way). So: No effort here to compare this album with, say, CSNY's \\"Deja Vu.\\" IMHO, that would just be apples and oranges.<br /><br />OK: With that understood, I will go ahead and say that \\"CSN\\" is the greatest album of Crosby, Stills & Nash's career. Better than their debut? Yes, more mature in the songwriting and the performances. Better than the big-selling \\"Daylight Again\\"? Yes, even with hits on that album such as \\"Southern Cross,\\" it was dicey, partly because of David Crosby's limited involvement, although \\"Delta\\" is a tremendous song. Better than \\"Allies,\\" \\"Live it Up\\" and \\"After the Storm.\\" OK, now there's just no comparison at all.<br /><br />\\"CSN\\" arrived in June 1977, just a few days before summer's official start that year, and the album sounded like summer itself. The metaphor works perfectly, because the band's debut album -- the eponymous \\"Crosby, Stills and Nash\\" from 1969 -- definitely had been the group's springtime. \\"Guinnevere,\\" \\"Wooden Ships,\\" \\"Helplessly Hoping\\": the songs from that first record were the songs of young men -- young men in love, young men passionate about the revolution-tinged politics of the times, young men learning who they were and would be.<br /><br />\\"CSN,\\" while still driven largely by acoustic guitars and swee harmonies, was sultrier, grittier. These fellows were nearly a decade older in 1977, and had seen some hard times, including an abortive attempt to put CSNY back together in 1974 and personal problems including alcoholism and drug abuse. The seasoning may have been tough on their personal lives but it was, at that time, not bad for their music.<br /><br />\\"Shadow Captain\\" opened \\"CSN\\" to great effect. With words by Crosby and music by session keyboardist Craig Doerge, this was a song for the ages. \\"Shadow captain\\" Crosby and his partners sang, \\"of a charcoal ship / trying to give the light the slip,\\" gliding the pitch up on that last word till it stood the hairs up on the back of your neck.<br /><br />Crosby contributed another song to that first side of what was then, of course, a vinyl record: \\"Anything At All,\\" a slow-paced, self-deprecating piece in which Crosby literally laughed off, at one moment, the idea that he could be anyone's guru.<br /><br />Stephen Stills' songs for side one were both thrilling: \\"See the Changes\\" chronicled the process of aging into one's thirties and realizing one's limitations. \\"Fair Game\\" was darker, dealing with sexual gamesmanship in which \\"an ugly duckling\\" woman grows up and strikes back.<br /><br />The Graham Nash tunes for side one: Nash had written the weakest songs for the band's debut (\\"Pre-Road Downs\\" among them); here, he offers some of the strongest. \\"Carried Away\\" was uncharacteristically melancholy; in the song, the male persona is entranced with a woman he knows he cannot keep. And \\"Cathedral\\" was absolutely magnficent, reputedly based on Nash's having wandered into Winchester Cathedral blasted on acid. Not surprisingly, the narrator does not find peace there.<br /><br />Nash also acquitted himself well on side two, offering the decidedly downbeat \\"Cold Rain\\" and the breezier \\"Just a Song Before I Go,\\" a lovely love song that charted as a single. Stills, almost always the trio's most prolific songwriter, contributed three songs, all top-notch and all hard-nosed and devastatingly honest: \\"Dark Star,\\" \\"Run From Tears\\" and \\"I Give You Give Blind.\\"<br /><br />Crosby offered just one song for side two, but it was a glorious keeper: \\"In My Dreams,\\" a swirling, surrealistic song wrapped up beautifully in fairly sparse instrumentation -- just the acoustic guitars of Crosby and Stills along with a minimal drum part from Russ Kunkel and some haunting vibraphone touches from Joe Vitale. What a stunner. CSN has performed this tune onstage at times over the years, despite its tricky timing. At one such occasion in the 1990s in Kansas City's Starlight Theatre, they played the absolute daylights out of it just as dusk fell over the outdoor venue. Crosby, obviously delighted, said, \\"When that one goes well, you know it's going to be a good night.\\"<br /><br />The singer/songwriter wave of the 1970s was like many other developments in pop music, from punk to disco to grunge and so on: That is, the quality of the work varied widely. Perhaps that is true in all times. But when the singer/songwriters were at the top of the game, they were able to get music onto tape that would outlast their time. Some of the watershed albums of that movement/era would be Jackson Browne's \\"The Pretender,\\" Warren Zevon's \\"Excitable Boy,\\" Joni Mitchell's \\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter,\\" and Bruce Cockburn's vastly underrated \\"Humans\\" -- and, oh yeah, a little thing by another Canadian rocker, Neil Young, an album called \\"Harvest.\\"<br /><br />And yes, \\"CSN,\\" which, in the end, lived up to its title. That is, it was the album that represented the purest, most concentrated, most focused version ever of this band -- the true fusion of these three personalities into one creative entity.

Usually I just delete them, but I just got a new tablet and I'm having to fill it up with the programs I linke on my phone here.<br /><br />The main reason I have the tablet is for reading and the internet. But to reading. I have to say that the majority of books that I want to read are mostly on pdf files. and this is the best of all the pdf viewers that I have found. Its even better than the official Adobe version of a pdf reader. The Reflow is the one that I use the most if its just plain text for pictures I switch to landscape in the wohle thing and remove that editing tools at the tome and its very viewable.<br /><br />Give it a try and if you need all the rest of it then go for it.<br /><br />Doc

B008XG1X18|5.0|Coolest app yet! Anything you need at your finger tips. Great ideas and recipes for everyone in your family including your dog.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Loved it, loved the recipes at the end.  I read the book quickly, it was very different from the movie, I thought that the book was much better and wished that the movie would have followed the book a little closer, it made much more sense, and described the parts of the movie that really didn't flow well.
0553801473|1.0|George:<br /><br />If you run out of ideas, please don't just rehash some of your prior \\"Kings\\" drafts and call it a new book. Same old same old here. What were you thinking? Did your publisher dump a truck load of money on your driveway and asked for SOMETHING, ANYTHING. And you pulled out some of your notes and gave us the previous book rewritten. This is terrible stuff for a good writer. I think I've just lost interest, so somewhere in the next five or eight years when the next one comes out, I think I just don't care anymore. I'll have forgotten it all anyway.<br /><br />I feel like I was had.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|THIS is the Madonna I remember and loved.<br /><br />When this hit the streets, gay men in my country cackled like a coven of witches and howled like hyenas over the album's titillating title.<br /><br />Erotica - filled with house tunes and the lead single's video featured Madge indulging in all sorts of sexual perversions in underground sex clubs. I just love it when M was the dirtiest biatch in the world and ran naked on the streets! The back cover has her sucking someone's feet. Yeah! Those were the good old days.<br /><br />Aside from the hell raiser Deeper And Deeper, Bye Bye Baby is kind of trashy house at its best. Where Life Begins is a totally direct ballad - \\"Go down where life begins.\\"<br /><br />The real show stopper is Secret Garden. A really sexy, sophisticated number. Love that ticklish tinkling piano bit!<br /><br />I was in Australia at the same time Madge was doing her Girlie Show Down Under. Needless to say, tickets were sold out and hotel rooms fully booked.<br /><br />This album is so underground in its musical feel and direction that I consider it as Madonna's bravest effort. Totally LOVE it.
1609611543|5.0|The book is a very in depth analysis of how modern wheat is effecting our health. I have given up all wheat products and anything containing gluten. I have lost seven pounds in two weeks and am looking forward to losing thirty more. The book is very well written and is a must read for anyone interested in their health.
B000FA57RG|5.0|I did not like this at first but after watching it a few times, I started to appreciate it for its own merits instead of comparing it to Truth Or Dare.<br /><br />While Madge came across as self centred and narcissistic in the earlier documentary, I'm Gonna Tell You A Secret reveals a more introspective woman \\"I don't miss being an idiot\\". The film goes on a journey as Madge tries to figure out life's mysteries through religion and uses her music to draw attention to conflicts bigger than squabbles between Madge, Elton and Gaga.<br /><br />There are some strange moments. M says she did not remember performing a concert after the show. Did she get possessed during the show? Tarot cards are also flashed during the Hollywood interlude featuring her fabulous dancers. For Lament, M was strapped to a chair as she spat at a dancer. Is she forced by the industry to do or say things against her will? Oh and the credits roll backwards, the visual equivalent of backmasking.<br /><br />I was actually moved by her rendition of Lennon's Imagine. Sure, the song has a one world message but it is true that countries and religions can divide people. There's a controversial segment where Madonna visits Israel to get in touch with the spiritual centre. She says the energy there is stronger than elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />Directed by Jonas Akerlund (Lady Gaga videos), I'm Gonna Tell You A Secret is a pretty absorbing film and is definitely more than just a superficial rock documentary. The film concludes with an Israelite boy and a Palestinian boy being good friends. Like when M sang \\"You can say that I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one.\\"<br /><br />From the movie, I gather that Madonna lip synced some songs like Nobody Knows Me. It is not possible for her to be prancing around like that to sing in tune. And the vocals sound way too processed. However, I think she sang live for Lament, Imagine and Like A Prayer. You can actually hear her breathe.<br /><br />There are some funextras like two men having facials in skimpy swim trunks and high heels. And Madonna is seen assaulting party guests with an anatomically correct man doll.<br /><br />The CD is very well mixed. I especially like Vogue, Into The Groove and Holiday. It's such a pity that the actual concert is not available as the audio sounds really exciting!
0688091717|5.0|Is a great book for kids like mine, that are going into first grade and are learning how to read.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Im not one usually to brag on something but this is an awesome flashlight.  After watching various video reviews, reading customer feedback I decided on the TK41.  This light for its size out performs large corded spotlights and its duration lasts much longer than any high powered halogen cordless spotlight. The beams hotspot is bright & very focused with good spill to light a large area thoroughly.  Deer are easily lit up at 250 yds & rabbits are well lit at 175 yds.  An entire pickup truck and the area around it are lit up so bright at 150 yds  that details can be seen from that distance. The lower settings are very usefully, the strobe is fun to play with, but on turbo mode this light exceeded my expectations. Mine has a slight rattle from the battery carrier, a small piece of electrical tape around the butt end fixed it. Well built, very easy to access the buttons easy to operate.  I want another one....
0439023513|1.0|Compared to The Hunger Games, and Catching fire (which were excellent) this book lacked action.  It did not hold my attention and just was poorly written. I got the feeling when reading this book that the author just threw it together.  The end was very lack luster and made you feel like reading the book was a waste of time and money.  Too bad that I had to keep wasting my time reading this book in order to just know what happened next.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my fist purchase for my Kindle.  I was pleasantly surprised by Hugh Howey's writing style: Both exciting and vivid.  The Omnibus Edition makes for a very nice read.  It actually flows more like an entire book than several strung together.  If you have not read Howey yet, then this is the book to best introduce you.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Happy there is finally an app for kindle fire but there are still some kinks that need to be worked out. Lately it hasn't been loading well. Creating your own pin from a website doesn't seem possible at this point, although maybe I just haven't figured it out yet? I'm sure with time it will get better.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Repetitive, boring,poorly written.Gave up after 25% on Kindle. Wasted my money!<br /> Read Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights,Pride and Prejudice if you want to find out about alpha males and Lady Chatterleys' Lover for sensual sex instead.
0811877485|5.0|I put this up on the wall of our school Library with the words, \\"Hungry for a good book?\\" It really added color to our reading area and the kids love it! Really fun and colorful. Great product!

B001G7CAGI|5.0|We watched this by chance when it came up under our prime membership.  I loved it from the first episode.  This has to one of the best Sci-Fi shows I have seen in a long time.  I have never been through a series so fast.  This show take you on a journey full of twists and turns.  Just when you think you know what is going on they put in another twist.  It is like a roller coaster ride!

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I saw the movie with my wife and son.  The only reason I was going to watch it was that it took place in Hawaii and I love all things Hawaiian.  Well, the movie was above average and the soundtrack was fantastic.  Once I saw that I could actually buy the soundtrack, I did right away.  I have not been disappointed.  There is a wide variety of Hawaiian music here and forms a good foundation for someone just getting into this genre of music.  Lots of traditional sounds mixed with some contemporary along with some of the \\"Tiki\\" type stuff for fun.  A great CD; I love it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I downloaded thinking my 3 year old would love a new puzzle app. But once I tried it out I ended up loving it for myself.<br />It can be made very easy with only 12 parts and them made harder with 30 or 40 parts. So its an app for the whole family!<br />It has many free puzzles to choice from whice are beautiful. But there payable ones as well for. 99&cent; a bundle.<br />I simply found this to be great. It will surly be on my phone for months to come. Go ahead and give it a try, there is nothing to lose and I'm sure you won't be sorry!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is an excellent Movie very much like its book.  I look forward to seeing the next movie of this series.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|I am very happy to add to my collection of great movies this one.<br />The movie is a wonderful lesson for children, too.<br />Great one! go get it!
B00846REIS|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much...perfect for men or women who want a steamy break from reality. Quick read and should make for interesting conversation at our monthly book club.  :)
B0015AARJI|5.0|I owned a playstation 2 for over six years, and came t love the dualshock 2 controller. As a dedicated sony gamer, I was of course pleased when i bought a playstation 3 last month. The controller is unchanged,except for the shoulder buttons, which I thought weren't as god as button triggeres, but i came to actually like more. All in all, I'd say this is a great controller for a great system.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day, yet consider it worthy of purchasing.  It's perfect for my needs, particularly the multiple groups.  There has not been a time when it's design has left me wanting more.  The product is not perfect, but it earns a 5 star.  What I don't like is the slight delays; however, I'm extremely impatient with computers and such.  I do wish the data could be backed up someway other than having to use gtasks - at least it can be backed up.
0385737424|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of sci-fi or fantasy, but I do love reading about time-travel. I also love realism: kids (or adults) in common situations, learning how to act, taking steps that shape them into the people they become. When You Reach Me mixes sci-fi and realism. The realism comes from the basic story premise: 11-year-old Miranda lives in New York during the 1970s. Her mother is obsessed with becoming a contestant on a tv show, The $20,000 Pyramid, and spends meal times studying and practicing. In school, Miranda encounters the types of people we've all met in school: true friends, false friends, and classmates you just can't figure out. The friendship issues, as well as the true-false issues, drive the story forward.<br /><br />But so does the time-travel aspect of the plot. Miranda witnesses some seemingly weird actions on the sidewalk: she keeps encountering one particular homeless person who acts strangely. Then somebody starts leaving notes-- notes that Miranda does not understand. The first note reads, in part: \\"I am coming to save your friend's life, and my own. I ask two favors. First, you must write me a letter . . . .\\" Soon after, a pair of shoes are stolen from Miranda's apartment.<br /><br />This story is well written with believable kids in believable situations (except, of course, for the time travel). Of all the time-travel stories I've read, this is the only one that delves into the \\"how\\" of time travel. The \\"how,\\" coupled with the \\"why,\\" is especially poignant.

B007ADIRDM|5.0|I bought this set because I enjoy creating dioramas but I don't collect Monster High dolls.  There is no doubt about it, it is an adorable playset!<br /><br />This cafe is mostly made from plastic with the exception of the background for the black shelves and that is made from a coated heavy-duty cardboard, a coated heavy-duty cardboard \\"magazine\\" called Monster Beat and a black fabric apron that has a color picture of a dead coffee bean on it.  All the plastic pieces seem to be quite sturdy too.  There is some assembly required.  The directions are all in pictures, so no reading required.<br /><br />Lets examine the black shelving unit:  There are 4 shelves, the upper black frame has coffee mugs, skulls and scrolly designs.  The upper middle of the upper frame has a sign shaped like a vampire-style coffin with a picture of a dead coffee bean.  There is an extra L shaped table/shelf that attaches to the shelving unit and this has a spider web design to it.  The background is that coated heavy-duty cardboard that has a scene on each side so it is reversible and is held on with 4 spiderweb brackets that can only be seen from the back side.  I did have a bit of a problem snapping the upper frame piece to the lower shelves.<br /><br />The couch is light blue with embedded spider web design and along the top has a black scrolly design with a black spider in the center.  There is actually a sturdy plastic back to the couch.  The Monster High dolls are so thin/narrow, I think 3 dolls can sit side by side on this couch.  2 Barbie dolls can sit comfortably there too.<br /><br />I just love the chair that came with this set.  I believe that was the selling point for me!  In some lighting at home and in the pictures I have seen, the chair looks red and black but in actuality in good lighting, the chair is a darker pink and black.  The upper middle has a black skull and the chair legs/feet are bones.  This chair does have a \\"tuffed\\" seat and back.  The MH dolls fits this chair beautifully.<br /><br />Also included is a small black coffin table that has a wood-grain finish to it and a flat black skull in the center.  There is a plain green coffee dispenser, a grey cash register that has a drawer that opens but no money in it!  The register screen is a purple sticker that has boxes with pictures in it, a touch screen style register.  Way above, I did mention the black apron and the magazine, 2 grey coffee cauldrons w/skull imprinted (one has a green drink and the other a bright pink drink), an adorable cupcake that is made to look like a green spider and the other snack is ??? I haven't the foggiest idea what that is.  Maybe a strangely shaped chocolate covered doughnut?<br /><br />The doll has very thick rooted soft hair pulled back in a ponytail, a tendril of hair on each side of her head and bangs, a gold spiked ponytail holder, 2 gold rings pierced in each ear, gold double-strand necklace with a moon pendant, gold spiked cuff bracelet, gold three layer belt, pink/purple striped dress that has a black/gold \\"zipper\\" down the front and gold buckle design throughout the dress with a gold lame collar and purple shoes.  The dress closes with Velcro.<br /><br />The only two things that are a bit negative are the slight difficulty I had with snapping the upper frame to shelving unit and that could have been my clumsy fingers and as I said earlier, I don't collect these MH dolls and this is my very first one but her head is kind of loose on her neck almost as though her hair/head weighs too much and wants to tilt backwards.  But these two things are so very minor.beautifully.<br /><br />Also included is a small black coffin table that has a wood-grain finish to it and a flat black skull in the center.

0345803485|4.0|Shades is a fun read that will keep you interested and give you a couple off the center ideas to try, but it is not exactly a benchmark in American Literature. I finished it in a couple days. Thought about it for a couple more and have now moved on to other things without a second thought.

B005NWHE0O|4.0|Walter Rhein's book, Beyond Birkie Fever, is an ice cold snowball to the face. Any person desiring to understand the sport of cross country skiing and the dedication required needs to read this book. The words take you through a young man's life and ambitions while detailing the work required to achieve success in a sport that gives very little reward beyond personal satisfaction. Interspersed with humor and some delightful characters, it is an easy read. Still, it manages to take you through the years of work it takes to become competetive in this solitary sport.<br /><br />Two minor complaints: 1. It could have used another edit.  2. I think I would have preferred the prologue on the origins of the Birkie at the end of the book.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Now I never read the books, but the movie was really good. Granted it was more action than SciFi, but there was enough to make me want to read the series. I would like to see the reactions of those who read the books, and then watched the movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|a great app that is loaded with information that keeps close tabs on battery life.

I would highly recommend getting this app.
1400069289|4.0|This is a quality piece of material as it actually explains how habits are formed and how we can introduce new habits to take place of the old. It really helps one manipulate oneself in a most positive way. But, this is the wordiest piece of literature I have come across. Mostly its just stories explaining things which is way, way over the top for me, nevertheless, the info shared is much too vital to ignore.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know my review for 50 Shades will disappear into the morass of nearly 12,000 others, but I just can't NOT share how well and truly horrible this book is. Well, to be perfectly honest, how well and truly horrible the first few chapters were, because that was the point at which I threw the book across the room. I was on vakay with my hubby in Hawaii, and though I didn't really need anything to read (I'd brought my fully loaded Kindle), there was 50 Shades sitting on our condo's bookshelf. Well, heck. What better time to read a little erotica, as well as see what all the fuss was about, than on a romantic trip to the Islands?<br /><br />The very first chapter made me want to scream. Not only do I dabble in fiction writing, but I'm a journalist by profession, so to see this twit asking six lame questions (questions written down by the hotshot journalism major, no less) and consider that a deep and probing (ha!) interview drove me to distraction. Considering what a magnificent coup this interview was, that roommate would have been grinding into her (ha!) the details of the subject. No way would she have handed her a list have a half dozen dumb questions and said \\"See ya later!\\"<br /><br />Ok, ok, whatevs, right? So I cooled down and thought I'd at least keep going till I get to a good part. Two more chapters of the worst writing I've ever read and her panties were still on. What the? Where's the sex, people?! I finally decided that, since my elevated heart rate wasn't from all the hot sex scenes but rather from fury at wasting my time reading this garbage, I'd be best served to put it down and go snorkeling with my fella.<br /><br />Ironically, the 60-some-year-old Kiwi dude sitting next to me on the flight was reading it! I asked him how he was liking it. He said, \\"It's horrible but my lady loved it and wanted me to read it. It's got its moments.\\" LOL!<br /><br />So the bottom line is, if you like well-written books but still want a little boom-chaka-chaka to go alongwith it, you can find thousands of better reads here on Amazon, many by very talented Indie writers. If you just want to see what all the hype is about, enter at your own peril.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful -- or at least made you chuckle -- please feel free to click the YES button below!
B007M45PMU|4.0|3 to 4 songs are very good and the rest are decent. Overall, slow and nice album to relax too.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|The first time I listened to The XX's eponymous debut album, it was hard to not be excited about the band's future.  From start to finish, the record was excellent - the band used minimal instrumentation to create quiet, moody atmospheres to let their songs dwell in.  Most notably, the two vocalists, Oliver Sims and Romy Madley Croft, carried the album with their soft duets - their voices would rarely rise above a murmur, but together they were able to evoke heartwarming love or heartbreaking pain.  After a handful of years, The XX is back with COEXIST, an album that picks up right where the band left off.<br /><br />The band has largely preserved their sound even with the departure of guitarist Baria Qureshi who left in 2009.  Qureshi, who left in 2009 due to personal differences, was not replaced, and the band has moved forward as a 3-piece.  Unfortunately, the prominent guitarwork that made songs like \\"Untitled\\" and \\"Crystalised\\" so irresistible is missing on COEXIST, but the band is able to compensate for this absence through other means.<br /><br />Most of the COEXIST's music is created with minimal instrumentation and a touch of reverb; every now and then, new instruments enter the fold, notably a steel drum (\\"Reunion\\"). The album starts off with \\"Angels.\\"  It's the album's lead single, and the song is surprisingly bare - Madley Croft's vocals are complimented by spare instrumentation, but the song relies completely on her voice to sell it.  Not only does this track set the tone for COEXIST, but it's one of the highlights on the album.  \\"Chained\\" introduces slightly more instrumentation, but not much - the album rarely rises above a whisper.  The following track, \\"Fiction,\\" is another one of the album's best: it's held together with a nice electronic beat that doesn't really change throughout its running time, but it offers Sims a nice opportunity to create a brilliant melody.  There are times when songs' rhythms edge towards dance-territory (\\"Sunset\\" or \\"Swept Away\\" for example), but the album never feels cheap or pandering with its pulsating beats.  \\"Tides\\" makes use of a funky groove and guitar accompaniment.  The final song, \\"Our Song\\" features a duet over a slightly dissonant loop, it features a similar cadence to \\"Angels,\\" so the album begs to be put on repeat.  It's a good song to end the album, but for me, it was one of the weaker standalone tracks.<br /><br />I think it would be remiss to talk about this album without spending a little time on the lyrics.  There are moments on COEXIST when the vocalists paint beautiful imagery with their words.  Most of the subject material involves lovers pining over one another or confessing their love for the other - it all works with the perfect delivery of the vocalists.  In \\"Angels:\\" when describing her love-interest, Madley Croft sings \\"if someone believed me, they would be in as love with you as I am.\\"  In \\"Fiction:\\" \\"I wake up alone, with only daylight between us/ Last night the world was beneath us.\\"  In \\"Our Song: \\"And there's no one else / that knows me / like you do... The walls I / hide behind / you walk through / you just walk through.\\"<br /><br />Pound for pound, I don't think I enjoyed COEXIST as much as the self-titled album (which would hard to top for anyone), but it's certainly worth checking out.  Listeners that enjoyed THE XX should seek out this album; I would recommend this album to listeners unfamiliar with the band as well.

B008BDZOZY|4.0|I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />It's hard not to go into this album with ridiculously high expectations.  David Byrne and St. Vincent teaming up for a collaborative album?  Sounds too good to be true.  David Byrne, famous for his tenure in Talking Heads, has been on somewhat of a hotstreak recently with collaborations with Brian Eno (EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WILL HAPPEN TODAY) and David Sitek (\\"Apartment Wrestling\\").  St. Vincent (also known as Annie Clark) has established herself as a terrific singer/songwriter on her own right after a string of wonderful solo albums.  The pairing of these musicians wouldn't seem likely, but they've come together to create LOVE THIS GIANT.<br /><br />First things first: this isn't a Talking Heads album.  It's not a St. Vincent album either.  It's not even somewhere in the middle.  In fact, it's probably best to just not expect anything at all.  The bulk of this album is carried by a funky and jazzy horn section.  Most of the guitar and bass instrumentation has been pushed aside for saxophones, trumpets, and trombones.<br /><br />The album makes no attempt to hide what it is: the opening track \\"Who\\" begins with the prominent horn section before Byrne's vocals jump in.  The second track, \\"Weekend in the Dust\\" serves as a early highlight, with St. Vincent's vocals bouncing around just as much as the musical accompaniment.  \\"Lazarus\\" works as a duet between the two songwriters, beginning with a scholarly sounding introduction before the drums add a funky groove.  By the time the noodling guitar riff supports the verse, the most of the brass has disappeared. \\"Lightning\\" has a more laid-back and jazzy feel to it - St. Vincent leads this track, and it almost sounds like it would have fit in perfect with her recent album STRANGE MERCY.  The song has a jarring, disrupted chorus reminiscent of her \\"Chloe in the Afternoon\\" or \\"Cheerleader.\\"  The horn section erupts completely on the penultimate track \\"One Who Broke Your Heart,\\" where there are times when the brass gets so chaotic, it's hard to predict just what's coming next.  LOVE THIS GIANT ends with \\"Outside of Space & Time,\\" where the horn section finally takes backseat to the vocals; it's a welcomed rest for an album that is so frequently busy.<br /><br />Although I recognize it's not supposed to be a continuation of Byrne or St. Vincent's solo work, it's hard to not compare LOVE THIS GIANT to those high standards.  And honestly, it's a little hard not to feel a bit disappointed (and I think some fans will feel a bit angered as well).  I wouldn't consider this a wasted opportunity - there are plenty of high points here - but the sum of this pairing isn't that of its separate parts.  The advice that I do have for this release is this:  give it time.  LOVE THIS GIANT will definitely grow on you if you are open to it and you give are patient enough to explore some of its more busy moments.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|I know there's a lot of hype around this album (as with every Bob Dylan record), but seriously, TEMPEST is great.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about his music, Bob Dylan is a national treasure.  We were lucky to have him in the 1960's, and we're lucky to have him now.  He's been making music for 50+ years, and 2012 finds the singer/songwriter releasing his 35th studio album.  Once upon a time, Bob Dylan said that he wanted the record that would become TEMPEST to be filled with religious songs.  Well, the record might have some religion in it, as lyrics do deal with death, the afterlife, and retribution, but these songs aren't uplifting hymns.  TEMPEST is an album that contains some of the darker material Dylan has ever released - it's a glimpse of an artist who, after all this time, success, and fortune, still isn't satisfied.<br /><br />The opening track (and lead single), \\"Duquesne Whistle,\\" is a jazzy rocker that finds Dylan howling and growling in a way that evokes Tom Waits.  It's an immediate track - it grips the listeners and commands their attention, but it doesn't quite hint at where TEMPEST will lead.  The next track, \\"Soon After Midnight\\" is a more standard ballad, made great by its lovelorn lyrics.  \\"Narrow Way\\" finds Dylan rocking out (with a great, repetitive guitar riff), borrowing a chorus from \\"You'll Work Down to Me Someday\\" by the Mississippi Sheiks - it's times like this where it is so easy to forget that you're listening to a 71-year old guy making a record.  \\"Pay in Blood\\" is one of the album's highlights - everything seems to come together perfectly: the rolling guitar, Dylan's growl and lyrics, the loose drums - it might rank among one of Dylan's all-time bests.  The smoke-filled \\"Scarlet Town\\" becomes more paranoid as it goes on, with fiddle and banjo marking time behind Dylan.  \\"Roll On John\\" feels like a hymn, made all the more powerful from its lyrics and the fact that it follows the sprawling \\"Tempest.\\"  As it ends, it gets slower and slower, and quieter and quieter, making for a perfect lead in for \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" for those listeners who have the album on repeat.<br /><br />It would be remiss to talk about not talk at least a little bit about Dylan's lyrics no this record.  TEMPEST is the strongest album lyrically that we have seen from the songwriter in a while (a tall order, I know).  The title track, for example, relies almost solely on Dylan's lyricism to sell it.  The centerpiece and namesake of the album is a 14-minute long track with no real chorus.  Across 40+ verses, the song chronicles the sinking of the Titanic, and its melody sways back and forth not unlike a boat at sea.  \\"Long and Wasted Years,\\" a song mourning a slow dying relationship contains the brilliant \\"I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes / There're secrets in them I can't disguise / Come back, baby / If I hurt your feelings, I apologize.\\"  One of the darkest tracks on the album, \\"Pay in Blood\\" builds its chorus along the line \\"I pay in blood / but not my own;\\" Dylan's ability to sell the line not only carries the song's melody, but it packs the line's meaning with so much baggage to unpack.  The final track, \\"Roll On John\\" is an ode to his friend John Lennon, and Dylan eulogizes him by alluding to Lennon's own lyrics (\\"A Day in the Life\\" and \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" are referenced here, among others).<br /><br />It may be worth mentioning that the title of the album shares its own amount of heft as well.  \\"The Tempest\\" was one William Shakepeare's plays, and it's notable for two very important reasons: 1) it was one of the final plays the author wrote, and 2) the story comes across as one lusting for revenge only to subvert expectations with a happy ending.  Dylan's record, while it might not be his last, really threw me for a loop with the final track -- after so much of the album's gloom, \\"Roll on John\\" is a nice moment of absolution.<br /><br />Pound for pound, TEMPEST is the best Dylan record released ina long time; I would even argue that it may stand among some of his best.  The album is so consistent: musically, lyrically, it's all here.  The only track that I will occasionally skip is \\"Tempest,\\" mainly because it's so incredibly long, and most of the enjoyment comes from the lyrics.  I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys Bob Dylan's music.

0061122416|3.0|This book was inspirational but was also very tedious.  The main character puts too much faith in resources that are unreliable and unrealistic.  If you want to appreciate this book, you need to read it with an open mind.<br /><br />The main character, Santiago, travels through life, trusting in omens to make his decisions.  He believes that the color of a rock or the way a hawk flies can predict the future.  These resources are foolish to rely on because of their inconsistency.  As Santiago chooses to follow these omens, he gets repeatedly mugged and stolen from, as well as encounters many other hardships.  Even though he was told by many \\"wise\\" characters he met, to trust that the omens would lead him to success, these misfortunes prove that incorrect.<br /><br />Coelho failed to create relationships that could be easily understood by the typical reader.  It is difficult to relate to a main character who frequently participates in unrealistic activities such as speaking to the wind and desert.  Despite the lack of potential connection between the reader and its characters, this book still has many thoughtful morals that make it worth reading, such as that following dreams can help you reach your goals.  If you like to read meaningful and enriching fables that may not be realistic, this book will be beneficial to you.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|is very fun. I have cleared all of the scores and started over. it is never boring.  this is so much better than mahjong blitz.
B004LROMX4|1.0|Every character is a cliche. The dialog is embarrassing. The plot goes nowhere. Sci-fi smothered with family oriented Velveeta cheese. Keep looking.
B008602KQI|4.0|I remember hearing all hype when the movie came out but I never went and seen it but after reading the books. I knew. I had to see the movie and was impressed as to how close it followed the book.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I was an F1 fan since I was in college in the 60s and followed to F1 circus through the 90s. I have attended many F1 races in the US and Canada. One of the aspects that attracted me to this form of racing was the great variety of characters you found there - James Hunt and the Teddy Bear team, the suave Graham Hill, the fiery Rodriquez brothers, etc., etc.<br /><br />One who I respected because of his incredible driving ability was Ayrton Senna. I watched the drama of his first great F1 race at Monte Carlo on TV. I could not believe that this new driver was so incredibly fast and fearless as he reeled in Alain Prost and was destined to triumph in bad rainy conditions until politics overcame the natural process and the race was stopped handing the victory to Prost.<br /><br />Senna was a figure in racing that was misunderstood by me and many others. He was often depicted as a prima donna and someone that insisted on getting his way all the time. This movie showed the other side of the story and revealed the human being that he was. One might assume that the story may have been slanted to his favor. However as all the content came from actual newsreel and television footage, it seems hard to dispute that this probably reveals more of the truth than we have had before.<br /><br />Already knowing the details of the story being told did not prepare me for the impact that it had on me. Nothing seemed to be hidden from the viewer including the tragic scenes of the racing shunts. When the movie ended I sat staring at the screen trying to comprehend and deal with what I had just seen. I will never forget this film and plan to see it again very soon.<br /><br />Racing fan or not, it will have the same impact on you.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|As a fan of the last Cohen project I was eager to see this movie. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. As expected with this genre and director, there were several genuinely funny scenes. However to much emphasis and time was given to silly, sophmoric and, indeed, middle school humor. Big waste of time and money.
1466401885|5.0|REVIEW<br />Undeniable superb story ! I fell in love with every single aspect of this book from he title and cover to the numbers and letters on each and every page , Torturous , sweet , stunning oh so many words I have running through my head and none of them seem enough . I just adore the characters especially Travis and Pidge with their up and down all over the place exceptional relationship . I really can't gush enough about this book and the highly talented author behind it , my only complaint is that I have such a long wait for the next book in this heartbreaking , endearing ' Beautiful Disaster ' . As I picked this book up I didn't at all expect to be awake until 4.30 in the morning because it simply was impossible to put down , page through page something great happens cover to cover unfolds a heart stopping story  that will stay with me for a long time to come !<br /><br />5 chocolate kiss stars and a few more for good measure !<br /> [...]

B0085OEU1I|5.0|This film is an excellent adaptation of the musical Sweeney Todd to film.  I have seen it preformed on stage and was very impressed at how thye adapted to film and stayed basically true to the story.  The preformances are outstanding and capture the characters quite well.  A definate two thumbs up for every one in the cast.

0307719774|5.0|On one of our vacations, my wife and I came across these in a bookstore. My wife had always been a \\"journal-er\\" so to speak. But like most, she has stopped and started over the years across many journals. Sometimes she would write a ton, sometimes she would write three words. I tried but had far less success than she ever did.<br /><br />This is why these are perfect. Each page corresponds to a day in the year and has spaces for an entry for 5 years on the same prompt, or question. As an example; \\"What about today would you like to remember?\\" or \\"How could today have been better?\\". The benefits are two-fold. It will allow you to track yourself over the years in responding to the same question. For my wife and I, it allows us a chance to peek in on each other and lets us see our shared experiences through each others eyes. This can be a very valuable exercise.<br /><br />I travel a significant amount for work and my version is a bit beat up. But it will not wear any worse than any other hardcover book. I have also purchased additional ones for when we run through the 5 years...just in case they are not around in the future.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest things I have ever bought that have had a significant impact on my life. It has earned every single star of the 5.

B008KOMMTA|3.0|This review is for the Titanic Collector's Edition. If you're a long time TITANIC fan and wondering whether or not to buy this exclusive, my advice is -- don't unless the price is around $50 or less. I got mine with Swagbucks coupons; had I paid $70 for it, I would have been disappointed. The exclusives are a 28 page full-color book with pictures in it (no text), a handful of reprint postcards of the costume designer's sketches for the main characters, a little bag full of reprint articles / memorabilia about the TITANIC's sinking, and the 3D Blu Ray/Blu Ray/Digital combo pack. And of course the box, which is pretty cool -- it has bumps for rivets, raised text, etc.<br /><br />The extras in the set are cool, but not worth an extra $40-$50 dollars.<br /><br />TITANIC and its ported over extras: in a word? AMAZING. This looks INCREDIBLE in HD. It includes \\"The Final Word with James Cameron,\\" which for any historical / TITANIC freak is a must-have, since it's about an hour and a half think-tank discussion on how TITANIC wound up in so many pieces on the ocean floor. The new documentary about the film, its troubling early days, the media blitz, and its long-term success is also a lot of fun. Not all the extras are ported over from the 3 Disk Collector's Edition from a few years ago, though, so you may want to hang onto that set if you like HBO's special. But the trailers and extra features look terrific in HD.<br /><br />I haven't yet watched the entire film on Blu Ray, but was blown away with how good it looks (I checked out the \\"Jack, I'm flying scene!\\" among others); the restoration was impeccable, colors have been made more vibrant, and the detail on some scenes is simply jaw-dropping. The sound is wonderful as well, but some users are reporting a \\"popping\\" sound right after the Paramount logo fades and the movie begins.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must-have movie on Blu Ray... but it's not a must-have set. Save your money and pick up the standard edition disks instead.stead.

B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games has been one of my favorite book trilogies like forever.... and this product although it is the movie adaptation still makes me love the series even more..... The DVD came pretty much on time and came with the movie and the special features disc which I was dying to see... I was not expecting more or less, it came exactly how it was described and I actually couldn't have been happier. Also, the price, for a movie as popular as this or any other movie, I was actually expecting it to be pricier. Eh.... it really does not bother me as I got my favorite movie all for about $26 (shipping included). But in the end, Great Movie, Excellent Product, Highly Recommended!
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|I've been an Animal Collective fan since the early 2000s, and I've always loved their seemingly free and intensely creative approach to music. I absolutely love Centipede Hz, and I think it'll be especially appealing to early Animal Collective fans, and most certainly to those who, like me, weren't particularly into Merriweather.<br /><br />Each song on Centipede Hz is a mashup of rhythms, vocals, and musical styles. It's also the first album in quite a while to feature Deacon again. If you've missed Deacon, then Centipede Hz is a must-buy. He even sings!<br /><br />For me, listening to this album just puts a smile on my face and sends me into all kinds of imaginary worlds. It's been making my commutes, workouts, and down time a lot cheerier and much more interesting. But then again, I've loved Animal Collective for a very long time, and I'm a huge fan of Avey Tare's writing.<br /><br />All in all, I think people who love early Animal Collective will enjoy Centipede Hz. But if you're looking for another Merriweather, this album is not that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this site!!  So many ideas, along with a wide variety of subjects to look at.  I can spend a lot of time looking at the different categories.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I found myself completely immersed in this album unable to put my finger on what kind of music this is representing. Truthfully, it does not matter. I had never heard of Ocean, but I am now a fan. And I must say that it will be a long time until I find myself enjoying music, melodies and sounds like in this album again. Especially when an artist manages to make music sound so brand new and fresh. Is there a sexier, sadder, more complex, delicate song than \\"pink matter\\" out there?
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I downloaded Kindle for PC on old XP computer that works just fine.  Kinkle did not work.  So, I did it again and again.  Same results.  Another disappointment like the Kindle Fire, which I returned.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was recommended after I read the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy, so I thought I'd try it.  I have no idea when this was written, however, it seemed to be a complete rip off of fifty shades, but not as good.  Poorly written and almost raunchy in some spots.  Definitely not impressed.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is definitely one of those movies you can watch again and again and still grab something new every time.  That's my favorite kind of movie.  The graphics are incredible, the storyline is great, and the acting is good.  While you're at it, be sure to check out \\"Memento\\", one of Nolan's most interesting movies in my opinion.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|One of the most lucid, touching books I have read. In the telling of the Ramayana, it is always said that after the entire recitation, one should again listen to the story of Rama's ascent to the throne, because it is so full of good will for Rama and is an auspicious moment. In the story of Harold Fry also, I felt that in order to rise above the grief experienced by Harold and Maureen on the death of their only son David, they recapture the joy they had felt when they first met - across a dance hall - and fell in love.<br />Harold Fry resides in all of us as does Maureen. They embody the decisions that one takes which finally define our life for us -either because it impacts us or because it has consequences for those whom we love.<br />The friendship and gratitude that Harold feels for Queenie is awe inspiring. He is beholden to her for taking responsibility for something he did in a fit of anger and grief, at the work place. The author, Rachel Joyce, has re created in simple words, a very poignant picture of the fragility of human interactions, the way in which we cocoon ourselves into comfortable nooks and crannies -  \\"we hang on by so little, he thought, and felt the full despair of knowing that.\\"<br />There are any number of people who show immense kindness to Harold Fry along the journey and this is one aspect of the story which I found most uplifting. The Slovakian doctor who cleans his feet and offers him food and a place to rest, while she herself waits in vain for her partner to return to her....while she fills her days by cleaning houses and toilets....a trained doctor!!! This is just the kind of devotion to a guest which is prescribed in Hinduism where it is said that a guest is like a God \\"athithi devo bhava\\". The oncologist who shares his table at a tea shop and enlightens him about the different manifestations of cancer, the stray dog which follows him around asking for nothing but only offering its companionship, the occupants of farm houses who offer him food and shelter him in barns........<br />A beautiful and unforgettable story, which makes you introspect and maybe conclude like the mother of six in the story, who confided that she never knew life could be so solitary.\\" \\"The superhuman effort it sometimes took to be normal, and a part of things that appeared both easy and everyday. The normalness of that.\\"

B008FPZQRO|5.0|This is a review of the new 3 disc DELUXE edition of TARKUS. It would take a couple weeks of listening to fully grasp the entire project. (Especially the 5.1 aspect)<br /><br /> I cannot imagine any serious TARKUS fan not wanting this set. This is a dream come true release for me, because it this was always my favorite ELP album. I went straight to disc number two \\"The alternate mixes\\" and it was great. There are aspects in here that I had never heard before. It feels like Wilson took the music and performed an autopsy on it. As if he cut into it and the listener is now sitting inside amongst the pieces. Sonically I find that the mid-frequencies really benefit from Wilson 's work. I hear much more in the drumming and bass definition than ever before. There are other things I hear which I never noticed before. I have heard several versions of this disc, including the MSFL version, and this is the winner mastering-wise. We know the multitracks were used here, so this is as good as it has been. Too me, Tarkus is ELP 's heaviest album.<br /><br /> The bonus tracks are interesting, although the Greg Lake song \\"Oh, my father\\" has a strange drum beat from Palmer that just does NOT groove. Struck me as an awkward drum track actually. Was great to hear these and they make a nice adition.<br /><br /> I was a little disappointed that the cardboard cover seems a bit flimsy. It is not as sturdy as other \\"Deluxe Editions\\" but perhaps being a 3- disc version they cut back on weight. The booklet is a bit disappointing too, as the only thing I found interesting was the Steven Wilson remarks. Who are these people that are working in graphics today? Why float text over photos? It makes it hard to read! *Wilson would do well to issue a DVD where he just talks at length about what he found/discovered or was challenged by in working on material like King Crimson/Tull/ELP. It would make for a fascinating product.  The 5.1 disc is well done as usual and once again Steven Wilson has delivered!<br /><br /> After several listens I come away feeling as though Carl Palmer and Emerson are just monsters on this album. Their playing is just incredible. I still remember Lake 's comments while being interviewed on the \\"Beyond the Beginning\\" DVD about how TARKUS \\"didn't make a very good concept.\\"> No one cares about whether it was a good concept or not! The music and the imagery are immense! No disrespect intended to Greg Lake but the more I think about the big picture of ELP, its history, the reunion-era Producer troubles, the High -Voltage festival horror, the stronger I feel that it was Emerson and Palmer who made/make this group soar.<br />Yes, Lake's voice was great and the lyrics on this particular album were cool, but without Emerson and Palmer it would never be so revered. In my opinion this is Carl Palmers best work. I guess I have been spoiled by the King Crimson releases and give the 4 stars only because there is no video content. There is no doubt that this is a great bargain. I paid $23 for the import version (and a week earlier release date) but for the lower price of the U.S. version this is an astounding deal and non-brainer for a serious fan.ed!<br /><br /> After several listens I come away feeling as though Carl Palmer and Emerson are just monsters on this album.

There is no doubt that this is a great bargain. I paid $23 for the import version (and a week earlier release date) but for the lower price of the U.S. version this is an astounding deal and non-brainer for a serious fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the few games I've played that's pure fun and sheer enjoyment where you really have to think and plan your moves :-).
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  We cannot wait for it to start back up in January 2013.  My husband even enjoyed it so there is something in it for men and women.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I also wish I had read some reviews first and don't understand the popularity of this book.  Sexy parts in a story are fine, but this is too much sex, not enough story.  I just don't identify with the whole dominant/submissive sexual relationship and find it repetitive and boring.  And I need at least SOMETHING realistic about the characters or the story, but this had neither.
B005ES0XVO|5.0|This is my second pair of this brand of Croc, and its not because the first one wore out!  This is the most durable and sturdy pair of Croc's ever.  I am using these to hike with right now, yes, I said Hike in.  I just returned from a 55 mile hiking trip along the JMT (John Muir Trail) and finished with a climb to the top of Mt. Whitney (tallest in lower 48 states!) and I did the entire voyage with a 35 pound pack and a single pair of these Croc's.  They were amazing, no blisters even after hiking for 7-8 hours straight a day (10 miles average per day), the soles held up with no problems, and plenty warm.comfortable even in 30 degree temps (I wore socks) and 3 of my friends ended up with pretty bad blisters with expensive hiking boots.  Oh, also no problems rolling my ankle, these things really grip!  I am definitely more sure-footed with these than in those hard sole, super heavy hiking boots.  I highly recommend these, certainly everyday use and definitely for heavy outdoor use, I love them!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not so much more to say than \\"wow\\". This book is a real page-turner, surprises every few pages, really well written. Would like to read this author on something positive and more exhilarating than this dark story, but really, do yourself a favor and read it.
B001ECPJZO|1.0|I ordered one of these and it was defective.  The red loops for the laces touch/overlap when you tie the shoe.  It is very confusing as an educational tool since tied up it doesn't look like a real shoe.  Amazon sent me a replacement for the first one, but the problem was the same with the replacement shoe.  I'm returning both and will likely just use an old shoe for this lesson...not as cute, but I know it will tie properly.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|It took me a while to understand the rules of this game but afterwards I found myself playing for hours on end and quite enjoying this game.  I really enjoyed the well-thought-out strategy, creative use of maps, and the challenges this throws at you. I never played multi-player, I found the computer to be challenging enough, plus I didn't have any friends who also had this game. But I am impressed with the fact they have it in the first place.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book...the hunger games was great, catching fire was even better!!  As soon as I finished reading it, I bought and read the mockingjay.
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is one of those physics games but with a new twist on things. Instead of driving over a bridge or something you are trying to save the life of a dummy who has bombs exploding, rocks rolling their direction, and large items looking to steam press them. You build a structure to protect the dummy from these things.<br /><br />My only disappointment was the word \\"defense\\" in the name of the game. This is NOT a defense game in the traditional sense. You are building structures, not paths, to protect your dummy. I do wish they had thought of a different name and left the word \\"defense\\" out of it.<br /><br />I did find it challenging and it did test me to try and improve on my star earnings. I would make a structure that worked but if I didn't get three stars then I would tweak it until I would. To be honest, when I first started playing I thought, \\"I can see this getting boring in a couple of minutes.\\" Wrong, I've played for well over an hour and am still being entertained by it.<br /><br />Well worth a buck, in my opinion, if you like challenging mind games.
0553381407|5.0|Intresting to read. It was so hard to put down once I started reading and it opened my eyes to such a lot. I've found it really helpful and working through each section is useful for anyone on their healing journey. Thank you Susan a fantastic tool and a must for others looking for a book that can assist them. Heather.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I've beat this game twice, once on Android and once on iOS. That is how much I've enjoyed playing it. It is fun and challenging and only takes seconds to play a round so you can whip it out anytime you have a few to spare. Try to get three stars on every level, that is what I mean by beating the game. It is a challenge that took me quite a while (over a month) to accomplish on both platforms. And I loved every minute of it!<br /><br />For a dollar, this is a no-brainer recommendation and a \\"must have\\" game.
B001NTNJL4|5.0|I fell in love with this album back in Jr High when it came out. I rediscovered it just recently and had to buy the mp3 download. Nuno is an amazing shredder and the riffs, melodies and grooves are far above and beyond majority of what you'll ever hear.
B00701L5XS|5.0|I've whipped this out a few times while leading the Boy Scouts, especially when we were working on the fishing merit badge. The instructions are easy to follow and I found more use out of this app then I did with the official knot-typing pamphlet the Boy Scouts had me buy. I'd recommend this app a hundred times over that pamphlet.
0545128285|5.0|Loved this book - but paid a great deal on money for only 100 odd pages - but those pages were very enjoyable.<br /><br />The Dumbledore commentary was excellent - highly recommend this book to Potter lovers.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The hunger games trilogy is an entertaining read overall. One is the best. Two is interesting as you are curious about 'what happens after', but the third doesn't have any revelations you hadn't predicted already. Worth the read if you have some time to spare.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|tells me what I want to know in a concise way with no extraneous stuff not needed.  I recommend. it to anyone who needs to know where there battery stands at any given time.
B005FISBTO|1.0|If you haven't paid attention to the other amazon reviews like I hadn't, the dvds force you to watch the climatic ending of this season in an unskippable ad sequence at the beginning of EVERY disc.  Before I saw the first episode the ending was already ruined.<br /><br />That having been said, the actual season was one of my favorites and is a vast improvement from the last two.
B004LQYSQG|4.0|Very well acted comedy/drama about the friendship (and unspoken love) between<br />two young women in the 1920's south.<br /><br />Jessica Tandy, Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson are all terrific, and<br />the story is sweet and entertaining.<br /><br />There's something a little dishonest in the film's resolute refusal to deal with the<br />homoerotic inferences, and a few too many times I could feel the film's conscious intent to<br />push my emotional buttons in the dramatic sections.<br /><br />But still well worth seeing for the strong acting, and warm sense of time and place.
B0055S348W|3.0|After a few mis-starts I was able to print to my wireless printer from my Kindle Fire. The process is a bit odd but it works better than nothing.
1417006048|4.0|Very well acted comedy/drama about the friendship (and unspoken love) between<br />two young women in the 1920's south.<br /><br />Jessica Tandy, Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson are all terrific, and<br />the story is sweet and entertaining.<br /><br />There's something a little dishonest in the film's resolute refusal to deal with the<br />homoerotic inferences, and a few too many times I could feel the film's conscious intent to<br />push my emotional buttons in the dramatic sections.<br /><br />But still well worth seeing for the strong acting, and warm sense of time and place.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|Nice little piece of kit for your truck or camping.  Doesn't make the ultra light list but it works well and is more durable than the one you made out of two soda cans.  As a bonus you can store left over fuel in the burner as it comes with an o-ring sealed cap.

B007SGM084|5.0|Read most of comments before ordering . Literary comments had been included and were on incorrect dias. Product delivery by Amazon was instant and on both of my Kindles! I love getting Kindle books. Trilogy was inexpensive.
1419702238|5.0|This book is excellent it's funny, relatable, and teaches life lessons, sorta. I haven't read all of the books in the series but one problem stood out for this one the cover the spine and the back cover I don't know what happened or if this happened to anyone else but there's a brown tint when I read it in a bright light but barley noticeable when in a lot less light. OVERALL: This book is great for kids and is on the not to hard side to read.
0307951529|4.0|This book is full of valuable information, I would suggest this book to anyone interested in started a business. Excellent!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you are a hopeless Romantic but want to know what a real life twisted romance is then this is the book for you.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This book is a must read whether you believe in god(s) or not. If you believe in god(s) you had better have very strong, rational reasons to do so because this books will challenge you in a way no other will. It is, very simply, the best argument against the existence of god(s) I have ever read. If you do not believe in the existence of god(s) this book will be an immense help to you for articulating your reasons why. This book helped me break away from cultural relativistic agnosticism to atheism. And it did so painlessly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i hate when people complain about their phone not being able to run this game. get a new phone or figure out how to make your phone faster. game rocks.
0374214913|5.0|There are old-fashion-booklovers who hate eBooks passionately. And, there are people who dismiss them as \\"dying creatures\\" and declare, \\"Paper books are already dead!\\" My work involves with both groups, and I have been quite sick of their bickering. I read paper books, eBooks, and audiobooks. If they make books directly transferring to my brain, I'll try it immediately. In my opinion, there are books I love and books I don't.<br /><br />As soon as I started reading \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\", I knew I'd enjoy it very much. Sloan's Mr. Penumbra and Clay don't care about above nonsense. They see the world with wide-eyed excitement and that made me excited to follow them.<br /><br />This novel is in a way very simple. There aren't any mind-blowing revelations or surprising twists, but this book still gives you fun adventures. There are many references you enjoy catching, such as Google books, the first generation Kindle (I have one, too), and fantasy novels you love but embarrassed to tell serious booklovers. If you use Google everyday and read books a lot, you'll definitely love this book.<br /><br />I also loved the optimistic nature of this novel. Dystopian fantasies with black and white characters are very popular. Future is bleak, grown-up are corrupt, and friends betray friends. I do enjoy these books, but I sometimes want to have a fun adventure with my strange, but good friends. And be optimistic about our future. \\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" is just like that.<br /><br />I totally recommend it to everyone who likes that kind of book.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|The final book in the trilogy of Cristian Grey and Anastasia.... I had talked to a lot of people who said they had not enjoyed this one as much as the other two. I however did enjoy it!!! Not wanting to reveal what happens I will only say that it left me satisfied and maybe a little sad that I had to leave these characters.... it was almost like saying goodbye to an old friend.
0345505387|3.0|SINCE I'VE READ THE ORIGINAL BOOK IN THIS SERIES, I CAN SAY THAT THIS PICTORAL ACCOUNT OF SAME[FIRST PART ONLY] IS TRUE TO THE BOOK, BUT I DON'T LIKE THIS VERSION OF IT NEARLY AS WELL AS THE WRITTEN ONE....PRIMARILY SINCE THE CHARACTERS AS PRESENTED WERE NOT TRUE TO MY IMAGE OF THEM FROM THE BOOK! I'LL TAKE THE WRITTEN VERSION ANY TIME!! ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE NEXT BOOK [#8] CONTINUEING THE SAGA!!
B000WQTDR8|5.0|Can't say enough. I've owned it many times over the years. Just bought it again and it's better than ever.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love! Love! Love Pinterest! Its now even better since I'm able to go on my Kindle Fire and search for cool and amazing ideas.
159448385X|4.0|I'm a frequent visitor to the region and I picked up a few books on Afghanistan, all novels to read, and I have to say that while this was very good, it didn't really compare with Mr Hosseini's epic 'Kite Runner'. Well, I guess he put so much of himself in that first one that there wasn't that much left for the second. Forsyth's 'The Afghan' while a thriller pales in comparison. Among the new books on the block that are Afghanistan related that I would recommend is The Watch. Also 'An Afghan Winter' by Rajesh Talwar, which since it's written by a UN staff member who's been there done that has something special to offer on that account.<br />Look forward to your next book, Mr Hosseini. Perhaps something about Afghans in the US...
B007UQRW62|5.0|First off my wife wanted the umbrella! This movie is probably ageless. This is a great buy for any collector.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It wrapped every detail and added a little more to the plot to keep it interesting. It read a little quickly at first by starting a new plot and closing unanswered questions. Somewhere in the middle the author returned to her writing style found in the other two books. It's a must read if you read the other two.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Held my interest. Wanted to dislike the wife but could not. Wish I could create a story line like that, but got a little old towards the end. Made me want to read her other books.
B001AR0DS6|5.0|I was excited to finally get a copy of Amy's first record on vinyl.  i was not dissapointed...this album is truly a gem from end to end...from \\"you got me flyin'\\", \\"f me pumps\\", \\"take the box\\", \\"in my bed\\"...i could list every song because each and every one is great.  highly reccomend this to anyone with an interest in modern jazz or anyone who wants to hear more than just \\"back to black\\"
B000YXMMAO|4.0|I am an audio nut and find this to be one of my favorite Radiohead albums, though they can't really do any wrong. The only thing was that the quality the first half of the album was recorded in wasn't particularly great and they used many effects that make things distorted/static. Great on vinyl (Reckoner is AMAZING), consider before purchasing.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great game. Allow a plethora of time for it. I played this game until it was beaten due to the fact that it was so good
0345803507|5.0|Very happy with the product.  Was very happy how it ended but wasn't ready for it to end.  The books are very addicting once you start reading them.
B006ZZANFG|5.0|This is an excellent live concert (hard to tell sometimes  because the crowds are so quiet that it might as well be a recording studio) featuring wonderfull middle-eastern percussion stylings along with Loreena's Celtic vocal inventions. Together, the whole disc set provides a concert of wonderfully-diverse music, with a sound that only McKennitt's voice can produce. Definitely worth the purchase if you are into Celtic/world music influences,created with innovation, great musicanship, stylings and entertaining songs.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting reading for a doctor however it contains too much technical data about gluten and starches and genetics of engineered wheat for the causual reader.  If one makes it past the first third, there will be smooth sailing.  Dr. Davis has had a footnote  in medical articles on celiac disease.
B006RUJST6|2.0|Pros:  I was immediately sucked into this book.  I found the personality of the characters endearing, and there were so many twists in the plot which kept my interest the whole way through the book.  The title also tied in nicely - which is always nice.<br />Cons:  There was a lot of profanity.  I guess a lot of people aren't that put off by profanity anymore, but unfortunately the book ended with a lot more profanity than it began with or I may not have finished reading it.  I found the profanity over the top and distracting.  The language didn't go well with the wholesome characters that were described.
B005K17RU0|5.0|the app is great and easy to use. different selections so you get exactly what you want. have had no issues and have had for months.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This CD takes me back to all three wonderful books and puts me in the scenes that I love so much.  I have it in my car and have now just listened to it in its entirety.  What wonderful pieces E.L. James chose for these erotic novels.  Bravo!  A must have for any 50 Shades fan.  It will warm your soul.
1400067936|5.0|Excellent book. Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in statistics or financial markets. I will be looking for more of Taleb's publications.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|If I Stay is a good read, I only had a few problems with it. I decided to read this book because for one there is a ton of hype about how amazing it is on goodreads and for two it was a book of the month for one of the book clubs I'm in. I think I expected too much from this book and that's why it only got four stars. Don't get me wrong and please do not misinterpret what I'm saying, this book is worth the read and I am very excited to read Where She Went, I definitely recommend you read it. I just feel like the way Mia was so unemotional and detached for so long in the beginning of the book wasn't realistic. To a point yes, adrenaline can cause a delay in the shock of events as traumatic as these but it seemed like it took her FOREVER to realize what had happened to her family and her. After she finally started showing some emotion to what the heck was going on this book got way good, I also loved learning more about her and Adam's relationship. The little scene where they play each other like instruments is so sweet and intimate, I loved it. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys young adult books about trauma, it does have a little bit of a love story twisted in also. It's not a huge, huge part though. I think it will be more about Adam and Mia in Where She Went! (:<br /><br />Favorite Quotes<br /><br />\\"But there's no one else like me around. Maybe the rest of them figured out how to get to Hawaii.\\" - Mia<br /><br />\\"I know that all the magic kisses in the world probably couldn't have helped him today. But I would do anything to have been able to give him one.\\" - Mia<br /><br />\\"I'm not sure this is a world I belong in anymore. I'm not sure that I want to wake up.\\" - Mia<br /><br />\\"I do have a point to all this,\\" she continues. \\"There are like twenty people in that waiting room right now. Some of them are related to you. Some of them are not. But we're all your family.\\" She stops now. Leans over me so that the wisps of her hair tickle my face. She kisses me on the forehead. \\"You still have a family, she whispers. - Kimon the forehead. \\"You still have a family, she whispers. - Kim
B008LZHA3G|3.0|The album is not that impressive . But goes well while listening it in the car, travelling etc.. I loved the basic beats but they could have done more with the vocals.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love mahjong! The backstory that goes along with the tiles is intriguing &amp; mysterious. As you progress thru Quest the tiles change. The graphics are quite lovely,  and collecting all the artifacts keeps me coming back to this game. Already purchased 2 and look forward to 3 &amp; 4.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|I was most blown away by the THX sound performance logo, so much, that the people sleeping in the next room on the other side of the wall yelled at me to turn the sound down.  This movie is the reason I stepped up to Blu-ray.  The picture is so clean it's like staring through a window, the sound is cleaned up so well, it's like listening to Arnold talk (Put dat cookie down Now!) in real life.  But the one real problem I had is the disc's loading time.  Absurd, unreal, WHY does it have to check for updates?!!!  I do not put in movies just so it can waste my time searching for firmware updates.  My whole reason for why I became a movie buff is because I no longer have the patience for slow moving updates or bad internet connectivity.  I found out (get this) that this blu-ray disc was incompatible with the cheap blu-ray player I bought from Walmart.  I had to order a not so commonly known electronics brand from Canada called Seiki which I discovered can load up blu-rays, and dvds faster than you can fast forward a vhs to the opening scene of a film.  It was expensive, but I love it.  I can also watch uber rare foreign films that have different region coding.  It also bypasses blu-rays that tries to annoy the viewer with that stupid \\"searching for firmware updates\\" on blu-rays equipped with the BD-live feature (which I feel is completely useless).
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book!!  Every page is a clift hanger...never can guess where the author is taking you and where the ending will leave you.  I would totally recommend this book but make time for it because you won't want to put it down.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I used to have problems with the app, but now it's great.  It works as well as it does on my Mac.  Pinterest is totally addicting.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|Gave this movie 5 stars. There was lots of action. Suspense and a solid story line worked together to build a enjoyable movie. A movie that should work for both Men and Women.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|With PINES, Blake Crouch leads us into a seemingly never ending labyrinth of terror and intrigue. Ethan Burke has been sent to Mayberry hell on a mission to find two fellow Secret Service agents who went missing without a trace, but with every turn he finds more questions than answers. Just when it seems like he might be on to something, BLAMMO. He's blindsided once again by opposing forces. With heart-pounding drama on every page, Crouch masterfully turns the screw tighter and tighter toward a conclusion that will blow you away. PINES is a roller coaster ride you won't soon forget. Highly recommended.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|I enjoyed this movie kept me entertained during the whole movie.<br />This a good movie for a collection addition, had some real actors.<br />The zombie Vampires not Bad.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I first heard this cd from a friend of mine and thought this is cool.  I bought it and have not grown tired of it.  The music makes you feel like you are down in New Orleans on a musical adventure.  It is a great mix of old and new styles.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I've been considering a better way to mount my Maglite in my Jeep Wrangler. I had originally sandwiched it in the velcro grab handles i have on the roll bar but wasnt happy. I bought these mounts, drilled four small holes in the seat frame, attached the mounts using the supplied screws and now i have the perfect mounting spot. The mounting brackets were the perfect mounts! The flashlight is easily accessable and easy to return to its spot. Very nice design and well worth the money!
0345803493|1.0|Second in the Fifty Shades erotic romance trilogy revolving around Christian Grey and Ana Steele.<br /><br />My Take<br />What a load of garbage. James didn't write the first Fifty Shades well, but at least she gave it some heart and drama. In this one, the writing is simply horrible. Its only saving grace is Ana \\"saving\\" Christine Grey from himself. Otherwise, it's a lot of whine, whine, whine. I try to remind myself that she's young and hasn't had much experience, but, ohhhh, the whining...and the juvenile romancing. Yuck. Somebody, please, find me a bucket!<br /><br />I do enjoy the emails they bat back and forth; I don't understand why Ana is such an idiot about refusing to use her BlackBerry for those inflammatory emails she does send him. I can't figure out if she's simply stupid or if it was an easy way for James to ensure Hyde got his hands on material.<br /><br />Not unexpectedly, Grey is overly protective of Ana. And terrified of her touching him.<br /><br />Okay, um, why does James make such a big deal out of Jos&eacute; using Ana's image on his portraits? The way she goes on about the attention Ana gets at the opening, I was expecting to discover they were all salacious nudes. Instead, they're simply great pictures of her. I rather like Grey's reaction to them *she says with a grin*. It certainly is a good wake-up call for him.<br /><br />Ana does make a good point about the difficulties of communication with Christian. After all, that contract back in Fifty Shades of Grey was pretty explicit. It's too bad that she doesn't communicate herself. Nor does she hold to her word. Any bump in the road and she forgets her promises and heads out the door on the run. At one point, Ana whines about not liking being scolded like a child. Well, if she doesn't like it, stop acting like a child. Then she whines about wanting \\"a calm, normal morning\\" and I can't help but wonder if it's even possible with her around.<br /><br />I dunno, she's such a twit. Yet I try to remember, again, her youth, her inexperience. I do enjoy the teasing and the reactions of her inner goddess make me laugh. I like that Grey is trying so hard. He asks her to have faith in him, to have patience. And she finally considers that maybe she could do the same with him. Have some patience for the poor guy. He is doing so much to try and be what she wants. But she refuses to do the same for him. To have any thought for the work this is for him. She's not the only virgin here in this respect. Idiot.<br />She keeps pushing to go back into his playroom and Christian wants nothing to do with it because she left him the last time they were in there. After she said she'd never leave. She whines on about \\"How can he possibly want me? I can't give him what he needs?\\" Has he complained? Has he insisted on going back to the playroom you keep trying to push him into??? She pushes and pushes and pushes at him. They're back together, what, two or three days, and she has to know everythingthisminute. Then of course Ana will whine when it doesn't go well. Explain how someone as intelligent as him can love a doofus like her? James does not do this at all well. She gives us the words, but definitely does not make me believe it.<br /><br />Anna claims she barely knows the man??<br /><br />I do agree with Ana that Christian does have some double standards. If he expects Ana to accept his taking care of Leila, then he should be able to handle her having a drink with Jos&eacute;. Trust is required in all aspects of a relationship.<br /><br />Why does Ana have to keep bringing Mrs. Robinson up? She always manages to destroy the moments between her and Christian by...whining on about the past. Give it a rest! Ana does learn a bit about Christian's childhood from Mia that cause some pieces to fall into place.<br /><br />I'm curious too. Why does Christian act so cold with his mother when he loves her?<br /><br />Oooh, Ana is setting Ethan up with Mia. Another, ooohh, I love the giftAna gives him for his birthday. The perfect gift for a man who has everything.<br /><br />On the whole, borrow this from the library if you absolutely must read it. There are only a few bits in here that are worth reading. It's certainly not worth gagging through the ninety-percent of juvenile whinging that this installment consists of.<br /><br />The Story<br />The story picks up where the first left off. With Ana starting her new job...and whining about how much she misses Christian. It's Jos&eacute;'s art show opening that gives Christian the opportunity to see Ana again and just being with him is enough to make her want to give him another chance.<br /><br />Yet Christian doesn't understand boundaries. He wants to protect her from anything and everything. Her new boss, her new stalker. And the best way to protect is to install her in his own apartment.<br /><br />It's an opportunity for them to get to know each other better, to test their hard limits. For Ana to talk with Dr. Flynn about her own concerns. Concerns that suddenly don't seem so important when the news comes about Christian's chopper going down.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Anastasia Steele, a.k.a., Miss Snap Judgment, is now the assistant to an editor at SIP. A job she got on her own with a company that Christian doesn't own. She thinks. Ray Steele is the stepfather she considers her real father. Jos&eacute; Rodriguez is a friend of Ana's who'd like to be more. His first photography show focuses on Ana as his muse.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a billionaire interested in a wide variety of technologies although many seem to revolve around food. He's fallen in love with Ana and it takes awhile for him to realize it. He's incredibly controlling, although he does back down when he realizes it could lose him the woman he wants. Jason Taylor is his personal security; he has a seven-year-old daughter who lives with her mother. Gail Jones is his housekeeper. Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey and Carrick Grey are his parents; his siblings, all adopted like him, are Elliot who is involved with her roommate Kate and Mia.<br /><br />Jack Hyde is an editor with SIP and Ana's boss.

I should have thought lighter more accurate than Fifty Shades Darker.m for his birthday. The perfect gift for a man who has everything.<br /><br />On the whole, borrow this from the library if you absolutely must read it. There are only a few bits in here that are worth reading. It's certainly not worth gagging through the ninety-percent of juvenile whinging that this installment consists of.<br /><br />The Story<br />The story picks up where the first left off. With Ana starting her new job...and whining about how much she misses Christian. It's José's art show opening that gives Christian the opportunity to see Ana again and just being with him is enough to make her want to give him another chance.<br /><br />Yet Christian doesn't understand boundaries. He wants to protect her from anything and everything. Her new boss, her new stalker. And the best way to protect is to install her in his own apartment.<br /><br />It's an opportunity for them to get to know each other better, to test their hard limits. For Ana to talk with Dr. Flynn about her own concerns. Concerns that suddenly don't seem so important when the news comes about Christian's chopper going down.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Anastasia Steele, a.k.a., Miss Snap Judgment, is now the assistant to an editor at SIP. A job she got on her own with a company that Christian doesn't own. She thinks. Ray Steele is the stepfather she considers her real father. José Rodriguez is a friend of Ana's who'd like to be more. His first photography show focuses on Ana as his muse.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a billionaire interested in a wide variety of technologies although many seem to revolve around food. He's fallen in love with Ana and it takes awhile for him to realize it. He's incredibly controlling, although he does back down when he realizes it could lose him the woman he wants. Jason Taylor is his personal security; he has a seven-year-old daughter who lives with her mother. Gail Jones is his housekeeper. Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey and Carrick Grey are his parents; his siblings, all adopted like him, are Elliot who is involved with her roommate Kate and Mia.<br /><br />Jack Hyde is an editor with SIP and Ana's boss.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it is going to be one that I read over and over. Very happy that I decided to purchase this.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is such an interesting story I could not put it down.  Just plain people interacting.  Sounds dull? Totally not dull, delightful & poignant. You just have to read it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Still very good, but not a good as book 1 & 2 which I could not put down.<br />Last part of the book was a little slow going.
B008XG1X18|5.0|was worth the wait! works very smoothly, and can pin right from my kindle fire. very, very easy to navigate.
0439023521|5.0|I originally read this book to review it before letting my nine year old daughter read it. Well I fell on love with it and had to order the other two books in the series. After devouring those in less than two days I am left wanting more! Great writing, I couldn't put any of these books down! I really hope Suzanne Collins writes more soon :)
B000NQRE1E|4.0|I have nothing to add about the movie, in fact I didn't even buy it for me, I bought it for my wife.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!!! If you are anything like me and were expecting to find a Ultraviolet Digital copy included with this movie, you will be disappointed! This movie only includes an iTunes digital copy, which is so 2 years ago in terms of what most studios are offering now a days. I've seen many movies come with either only a Ultraviolet Digital Copy or the option of choosing an iTunes or/or Ultraviolet Digital Copy so I didn't even think it wasn't going to include an iTunes Digital Copy only. Thanks for nothing Paramount!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved everyone of these books, I had to re read them because they were that damn good. I am still looking for another book that will give me the same intensity of this trilogy. I love it...

B004QK5N5W|4.0|Adapter functions as described, however I did experience some issues with most steaming videos. For obvious reasons there is a loss in quality and a bit of lag with streaming but all other mirroring and function of the iPad is translated over great.
B002MZ1UQE|5.0|Blu Ray quality is very good overall sound is great what more could you expect in these transfers of these great eastwood movies and the price was great also.
B000G6OFO0|5.0|Having seen part of this movie on satellite, I knew was a winner. This movie slipped by the public, more than likely because of its violence, but I found it was quite good, supurb cast & storyline, and what I consider a really well done script.  My kind of movie!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard for Android by far. I have tried lots of them, and this one is the best
B00866H7SS|3.0|Not the worst book I've ever read... Lots of sexy bits but the story line was a bit heavy for me. 6/10
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Still stuck with Gingerbread and the keyboard was driving me crazy. Kept miss hitting the wrong keys. Decide to try Thumb Keyboard, it looked like it would solve my problem. But every time I hit the back space the &quot;L&quot; would keep popping up. I don't have big hands. Saw SwiftKey 3 on sale thought I'd give it a try. I know the strength of SwiftKey 3 is the predict engine but the keyboard layout is the best. Just enough space between keys to prevent miss hits.
0201721481|4.0|I have some experience with programming (10 years, I'm 21 y.o.). But I have never learned C++ the way I should have learned. So I searched for a good primer and found about this book.<br /><br />Really, an awesome book that covers everything (?) of C++ language and give the newcomers to programming (in general) a solid background. It explains a lot: starts from basics like sintaxe, variables, functions, libraries, and others (considering structured programming) and only after that it goes to object oriented programming and C++ coverage about it. But I guess it should have a little more pages to cover better some aspects like 'preprocessors' (while it's a bit advanced topic, it's still a C++ topic that you will need to know - my way of thinking).<br /><br />Approximately three or four months ago (I acquired it in August 2011 - I haven't had much time to read it and I had a whole mountain of books to read), I finished it with great smile: I learned C++ and the money was well spent. Now, time will give me experience - together with more advanced books that covers code optimization, inner work of C++, algorithms and so on.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone - including those that doesn't have English as a mother tongue (like myself), experts or novices.  But be prepared because it's a gigantic book.<br /><br />Note: I don't like to read only one book covering one subject. So I like to read at least 2 (or have more than one for future consultations). I suggest you doing the same.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This third book had it all romance, intrigue, action, suspence & tragedy.<br />If you have read the first two books, this one is a must read. I look forward to reading it again.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Great music, great progression and all for a great price. Ed Sheeran is by far by new favorite musician. Easy to download, no trouble opening the files and transferring them.
1612130607|5.0|My mother lovrd it. This was used book . Yet was like new . I always love to send gifts
B006LSZECO|4.0|Masterful use of unusual twists and turns. Very well thoughtout. Characters you love to hate. Find I keep changing my opinion about each character as they weave their complex web.
B00866H7SS|5.0|This book had me glued from the first page, a more mature read and deserves more than the hype recieved by 50 Shades of Grey.  A more realistic read that will have you hooked from beginning to end!  Can't wait for the next instalment!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really rated this book 4 1/2 Stars. I would also categorize this book more of a memoire. It starts out with the author telling us how at the age of thirteen he knew he wanted to be a seal and that he basically grew up in the Alaska where he hunted and continued his love of the Navy Seals. For the first 50% or more of the book we get a recounting of how he delayed going into service, went to college but in the end he knew he was to be a Seal. Then he takes us through how much he struggled and the fear of failure. How he worked and became part of an the elite group of the Navy. He also takes us on some of his missions, one being the rescue of the captain of the ship that was captured by pirates down on Cape Horne. By giving us all this back ground he allows us into his world and knows we are ready when he starts telling how and what led up to the taking down of Osama Bin Laden. The story is very moving and I can honestly say NO secrets were devulged. The author gives credit to all that were envolved, starting from before 9/11. After reading this book I'm very thankful to all Special Ops everywhere who keep all Americans safe each and every day.<br /><br />The reason I didn't rate this book higher was only that it is personelly not my favorite reading material. But I have to say it is definitely worth reading by everyone
0345803485|2.0|I read this book mainly because everyone was making such a big fuss about it.  I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  I still don't know!  I must have missed something......  I wasn't impressed.  The writing is amateur and the descriptions of the \\"sex\\" were boring and not at all what I was expecting.  The characters, and the book itself, didn't have any depth.  Very flat.  Predictable.  By the end of the book I would read to my husband laughing at the ridiculousness of it all.  ....  at least I can say that we got a good laugh out of it.  I have books 2 and 3 but have yet to decide if I will continue with the series.  I doubt it.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|this is a great book one of the most interesting autobiographies that ive read its a must read for any one who is a fan of his comedy or the late late show
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It does what it says. This isn't the most necessary app for the Kindle Fire but it works as advertised.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|I really enjoyed the book Eat Pray love and got a lot out of it on a personal level. She is an inspiration to many woman.
B000063Y8F|5.0|This garlic press is worth the money. I am a skeptic when it comes to expensive things being worth it, but the numerous favorable reviews enticed me to try this garlic press and I am glad I did. It's really not necessary to peel the cloves (or toes, as we call them in Louisiana), and the press is easy to clean.<br />Spend the extra money to get this one, and cut out a couple of restaurant lunches to make up the difference.<br />You won't regret it!
B008BDZOZY|4.0|Putting this right on front street: I only know a handful of Talking Heads songs (from the radio) and nothing of David Byrne's solo stuff except for one track off of the Future Soundtrack of America and his appearance on Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast...which endeared me to him forever.  I am, however, a huge fan of St. Vincent, and I understand how singular and innovative and amazing Byrne is, and so I also understood how awesome it was that they were working on a project together.  And guess what? It turns out that project is pretty awesome.    The album started as bits and pieces sent back and forth between Annie Clark (St. Vincent) and Byrne; some music without vocals, some vocals without music. Over a period of about three years, they assembled Love This Giant, the instrumentation of which is built around an eight-piece brass band, with some drums, guitar and light programming thrown in to flesh out the mix. The album is split about fifty/fifty when it comes to St. Vincent and Byrne's contributions.  LTG opens strong and brash with \\"Who\\", an excellent way to usher in this experiment in horns and style and the collaboration of two amazing artists. The horns' interplay with the beat and vocalization is just perfect, and the accompanying music video is fantastic. One is required to boogie. After this, aside from the Clark helmed \\"Ice Age\\", the programming on which gets in the way and which never really goes anywhere but up in volume, the album stays well-crafted and vital, showing off the strong points of each artist beautifully.  The stand out tracks for me include \\"Weekend In The Dust\\" (which feels so sassy and snide and...I don't know...sunglasses in a dark room? Plus, the horns (as on the majority of the album) wind their way perfectly through the song), \\"Dinner For Two\\" (in which the overly paranoid lyrics are offset and made enjoyable by the horns' whimsy), \\"I Should Watch TV\\" (another Byrne-only contribution with some spectacular horn arrangement and his trademark rejection and ridicule of all things pop culture (\\"I used to think that I should watch TV/I used to think that it was good for me/wanted to know what folks were thinking/to understand the land I live in/and I would lose myself and it would set me free\\"). This one gets dark and epic right around the middle, then it's back to the jittering, driving electronics-laced horns), \\"Lazarus\\" (which starts off slow, but evolves into something grand thanks to some really excellent guitar, rife with Biblical language and references), \\"Lightning\\" (which has an almost dubby feel to it before it opens up into one of the best arrangements on this album), and \\"The One Who Broke Your Heart\\" (a manic, insane samba? Mambo? to which one must dance like a fiend so as to sweat so no one can see the tears rolling from one's eyes. Laughing and crying at the same time.).  This truly amazing album comes to a close with the soft and sweeping \\"Outside Of Space & Time\\", which, I think, could have used more St. Vincent, but, whatever, this whole project is about 93% solid gold and I have no right to complain.    Anyone remember Chris Cornell and Timbaland's bowle movement, Scream?  No?  Good.  Love This Giant is better.  Lots better.  Lots and lots and lots better.  In fact, this might just be my favorite album of 2012.  So buy it, listen to it, and then go see them in concert (details and dates and such at [...]), because, if it's half as good as the album, it's probably going to be something people talk about for years to come.
B005LAIHGI|4.0|This isn't Sasha Baron Cohen's best comedy, but it more than holds its own.  It manages to be outrageous when it needs to be and gently sweet when it needs to be.  Mostly, though, it is a showcase for parodying prejudices.<br /><br />There are a number of confusingly negative reviews here that lambast this film simply because it isn't as all-around great as \\"Borat\\".  Apparently we now live in a world where films can no longer be good -- they have to be AWESOME.  That's hardly fair.  \\"The Dictator\\" isn't awesome but it is funny and it is worth seeing.<br /><br />Even if you get the theatrical version on DVD instead of the unrated version, you're still getting an entertaining show.  And one of the supporting characters, Nadal, almost steals the show.  He has a great scene on a bridge and another great moment in Times Square.  He \\"grounds\\" the movie very well, fleshing out a supporting character more than we usually see.<br /><br />Recommended.
B008FOB124|3.0|What a weasel I am to be saying something less than glowing about Anastasis. I really liked the first song, but then again I really liked the opening cut of the Best of Guild Wars 2 soundtrack. I prefer my DCD more Gothic and weirdly gorgeous. This release was tame and pretty mainstream. I'm afraid DCD is now in the same category as other older musicians that mellow with age -- which isn't great for me, because I didn't.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|this is one of the best movies that I have ever watched (I have watched it about 10 times).  The message is beautiful.  Why this doesn't get an award is beyond me.  Doesn't say much about humanity.  This movie is for anyone who wants change in their life.
0307888681|5.0|A fun read!  It was very entertaining.  If you like plots about zombies, this one is a definite must buy.  Even my mom (who doens't seem like a zombie fan) enjoyed this book to a degree.  It was well written, and I like how it was set up.  Every chapter was a different interview/story from a different person who survived the 'apocalypse'.  It was cool how it was set up like a collection of interviews, and it gave the plot multiple perspective.  It was cool seeing how every country handed the invasion (US retreated to west coast, Africa developed a 'plan', etc.) Great read.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|As I listened to this album in the kitchen, my eight-year-old daughter walked in, stopped abruptly, and cocked her head.<br />\\"Wait,\\" she asked quizzically, \\"is this the Muppets? The guy with the gold teeth?\\"<br />\\"Do you mean Doctor Teeth and the Electric Mayhem\\"? I replied.<br />\\"Yes!\\"<br />\\"No, but it's somebody who sounds a lot like him,\\" I said, leaving it at that.<br />She walked out with a carrot stick in her mouth, humming--or did I just imagine this?--the song \\"Can You Picture That?\\" from *The Muppet Movie*.<br /><br />I agree with her about Dr. Teeth. This album does have some toe-tappin' songs that you can rock out to if you sold all your out-of-print Muppets LPs at a garage sale years ago. The last three songs, however, really drag; I wish Bob had let Big Bird or Gonzo sit in as guest vocalists instead, and let Animal sit in on drums.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|My daughter is addicted to Toms unfortunately. These shoes are basically cardboard flip flops with a linen covering.  I hate to use the word canvas fabric because it does not qualify as canvas. The fabric is very thin.  My daughter managed to scrape a hole in the toe within the first month of wearing.  If these were not on her Christmas list I would have never purchased them.  In fact I refuse to buy anymore.  I think she has about 3-4 pairs and wow do they look crappy.  Its impossible to keep them looking nice.  Her girlfriends have them too and bring them over for me to sew the holes in them.  I suggest if your kid is begging like mine was, just get them a pair of Vans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this new app. I would rather use Pinterest on my Kindle or my smart phone rather than my lap top!
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|I have always enjoyed George Harrison's music. In my mind he was the best Beatle and highly underrated living in the shadow of Lennon and MacCartney. I discovered this album in the 80's after listening to Mike Rutherford (Genesis) state that he considered \\"Your Love Is Forever\\"  - a track on the album - as one of his all time favorite songs.I totally agree, it is George at his best and sadly, one of the least aired songs out of his collection. The album is full of great tracks and is a must for Harrison fans. If you don't buy the album certainly try to get a listen to this song - a haunting, beautiful love song with great lyrics and some wonderful guitar work.
B000007WK4|4.0|I can't understand the lack of recognition for Chris Rea here in the US. I have all his albums and am rarely disappointed by him. His writing, melodies, guitar work and gravelly voice combine for some truly great tracks. Every album has a stand out track and on this one I would say that \\"I'm Sill Holding On\\" is it on Blue Cafe. Once you listen to him on any album you will be captivated by his presence and will enjoy that rare opportunity to explore more music from a new (to you) artist. You won't regret it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I found it difficult putting this book down.... leading to many late nights!  Upon conclusion, I wanted to save many of slam poems and a final letter for sharing with family and friends.  Very moving, thought provoking.  Great characters.  I immediately  ordered the author's next book and now must stop writing this review to continue reading Will's story.  Slammed is  unique and is beautifully written.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I may have first had interest in this album because of the 50 Shades books, but the music is so hauntingly beautiful on its own. As I was reading the books I found myself pausing to look up certain songs mentioned, so while it may seem silly to have an entire album based upon books, I'm really glad there is. Not only am I excited to re-read the books and play this as my background music, but I see myself listening to this when I just need to unwind and relax too.
B00479SVBU|5.0|My car is 12 years old and I did not want to spend the money on an AUX port installation.  This product is even better in terms of features because while my initial intent was to connect my mp3 player, instead I just put ALL of my music on a 16GB SD card, popped that in and now I can listen to all of my music and have no messy cords to deal with.  I'm set!<br /><br />Now, for some critique... the sound quality is about as good as that of a cassette player.  It's not bad, it's not spectacular, but it's good, very good actually.  With road and car noise already existent, it really isn't an issue.  The navigation on the device and the remote are helpful, but i don't think you can pick a specific folder to play and repeat or shuffle within that specific folder.  Shuffle function basically shuffles through the entire music collection and repeat repeats the current track.  I wanted to be able to pick a specific album, genre, or artist to shuffle/repeat.  That is unfortunate.  Hopefully this will be rectified in newer models.<br /><br />Even if someone already has an AUX port in their car this device is worth using because it has a line out function which can connect to an AUX port and allow the user to play content through the SD card or USB port which many cars may not have.  Overall, a really nice product at a really nice price.
1594745692|3.0|I love the art on these cards, but the card material sucks.  Although they are a thick card stock, they are not playing card style.  Actually, they're almost too thick to shuffle.  They are matte and not glossy.  The edges are rough from the cut.  I don't believe these cards will hold up with normal use.  I will end up putting them aside as a conversation piece.
B007N8RULO|4.0|this game is my favorite game especially here on my kindle. only problem is once or twice its sort of gone blank screen for a second but the game keeps going g. but after a moment its back to normal...
0547569653|5.0|I have already reviewed my first purchase of this book:) this one was a gift for a friend in the USA. I have leant my copy to two friends in France (one Vegan and one non Vegan) and both have loved it - another friend read some of the chapters in my book and bought it (an Ex Vegan and an athlete) and everyone loves it as I say. He writes very well and it is an easy and great read/ life story full of sadness and highs and lows and lots of inspiration for the runner and the non-runner alike. In terms of aspiring to lead a more thoughtful, healthy and considered life I cannot recommend it enough. Nor can I recommend it enough for anyone who already keeps fit/ is an athlete or simply wants to learn how to embrace their bodies abilities and start running if they can. It is also wonderful in terms of its humour and insight into the reasons why someone would want to and be able to run that far!<br />All in all it is a fantastic book on living life to the full in a way that helps the planet and is also healthy for humans body and soul.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Read this book in high school in 99. Read it again anticipating the movie and felt it still held up well. Loved it and can't wait To see it on the big screen. This book handles many difficult subjects and while some are not as sensitive as they were a decade ago, the approach and writing is still moving and leaves some strong messages.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|What can you say about this band or it's members without running out of space to write? Amazing DVD well worth the money and well worth the watch. It's hard to believe it's lasted so long and still remains so fresh and inspiring. Very few bands ever capture what this trio has. Immortality in music. Do yourself a favor and buy the new CD to see what I'm talking about. Those who want be critical knock yourself out but as a musician I know not only the delicate touch it takes to write music but also the difficult task it is to re-create it in a live show. Amazing guys and I appreciate this effort. Thanks!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I bought this special edition blu-ray for my better half's birthday. The original arrival date was supposed to be<br />on his birthday. Imagine my surprise when it came 4 days early.

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The case is a nice quality and easy to use. The headset fits inside easily, and it keeps the headset protected when it is in my purse.
0812550757|1.0|I really looked forward to reading the further adventures of Ender and the characters from the first book.  Unfortunately, it was as if this was written by a completely different author.  Not much to add that others haven't already stated in other reviews.  I was told to skip Xenocide, and go right to Ender's Shadow if I enjoyed the first book.  I should have listened.<br /><br />Side note: I even picked up the audio version at the library (on CD), hoping that maybe I could stomach it if someone else was reading.  Nope.
0375842209|5.0|Liesel Messinger is a girl forced to live her childhood, confronting the experiences of an adult. Witnessing the death of his little brother and handed over by his mother to foster parents, she grows up  surrounded by a hostile environment in the heartland of the Nazi Germany, she develops a love for the words that she find in books, books that help to cultivate her mind and free her of her harsh reality at least for a time. There are also other great characters  going along with her battling adversity, her foster father Hans, her friend Rudy and Max a Jewish man that her family hid in the basement during the Second World War<br />The narrator is death itself (the grim reaper) which tells the story and interacts with the characters time and again. The author intends to use this fiction novel to express his strong criticism of the Nazi horrors but applying surrealist elements<br />The wording was carefully crafted, as every expression and discussion appeals to the heart more than the mind of the reader, there is also a great job playing with words to convey the idea that the characters are surrounded by a somber climate and dark sad colors<br />A book to read slowly, pondering every paragraph

0985114606|2.0|A lot of people have commented on the fact that this book is pretty much a rip-off of E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey, and they are correct.  I don't care if FSoG started out as fan fiction for Twilight, when you read both books, you don't immediately think, \\"this is exactly the same storyline\\" like you will when you read Bared to You.  The big difference between the two is that in FSoG, the male lead (Christian) was the victim of abuse, and the female lead (Ana), while having some issues with self-esteem, is basically from a loving family and has a strong sense of self.  In BtY, the female lead (Eva) was the victim of sexual abuse and has serious issues as a result, and the male lead (Gideon) apparently also was the victim of abuse, though it's never made clear in the first book what the abuse was or who did it.  Making the two leads victims of sexual abuse is pretty stupid, especially when the book is hinting towards a BDSM theme (though it's not explored in this first book at all).  BDSM is sexy (in novels at least) when it occurs between consenting adults who are not damaged or f*d up by an abusive past.  When the sexual abuse is a main part of the storyline, it's just kindof sick and wrong.  It's almost like the author said, ok I changed the names and the city, now I have to also change the type of abuse....I know, sexual abuse!  Really lame.<br /><br />Several reviewers and commenters have pointed out that the romance genre is pretty pat, so following the same story line is par for the course, but I would argue that yes, many romance novels appear interchangeable in terms of plot, etc., so the ones that stand out are those that have exceptional dialogue, or a new twist on the age-old story, or whose characters get under your skin and make you want to revisit them and their journey again and again.  This novel has none of those things going for it.  It's just a bland retread of the current \\"it\\" trilogy.  If you've read and reread FSoG too many times and want a weak, limp version to pass the time, go ahead and read this novel.  Otherwise, keep looking.weak, limp version to pass the time, go ahead and read this novel.  Otherwise, keep looking.

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The bonus making-of documentary that comes in this 4-disc set is spectacular.  It merits the purchase.  Too bad the same cannot be said of the movie itself.  The movie is disappointing on many, many levels.<br /><br />Watching the making-of documentary, one really gets the sense of the tremendous amount of skill and care that went into the production design of this film.  It's a shame that the same skill and care was not put into the script or the character development.  It's like the right dress on the wrong girl.<br /><br />I did have problems playing the documentary, though.  I had to stop and restart it several times, and even unplug my Blu-ray player twice to clear the player's memory.  The disc would freeze in the middle of fast-forwarding, and it had great difficulty returning to the Top Menu of the bonus disc on command, if it responded at all.  The documentary is nearly 4 hours long so it is not practical to watch it in one sitting.  Sometimes it would offer to resume playback at the previous cut-off point, but more often than not I'd have to start from the beginning again and fast-forward and chapter search.  My Blu-ray player is only 4 years old.  I haven't had this issue with other discs.<br /><br />The movie itself was a beautiful-looking disaster.  It made me sad to watch it because of all the amateurishness in the script and dialogue.  I hope there truly is a sequel to this because I'm fairly sure Ridley Scott and his writing team may have learned from this mistake (and hopefully will jettison Damon Lindelof from all future involvement with these movies).

B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Another try at a sexy action movie, which is just plain bad. Pull in the audience with women being the villain or just a stand by eye candy. The actress is B movie material.<br />Put her in the ring not in a movie.

B000SXMSJ0|5.0|After reading the other reviews about her new album, I decided to purchase Norah Jones' first album.  She has a delightful \\"old country\\" style.  Relaxing music that is appropriate for many occasions.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This version may not be as true to the book as the early version mentioned by some other reviewers, but I found the characters more believable. (Ciaran Hinds as Cpt Wentworth? Really?) I love Rupert Penry-Jones in this role. Wonderfully angsty! This is one of my favorite of the more recent Jane Austen adaptions.
B005LAII5I|4.0|When Sylvester Stallone dreamt up the original EXPENDABLES film, it was designed to be a throwback to the cheesy 80's shoot-'em-up spectacles that were low on plot and character and high on action and adrenaline and combine many of cinema's greatest (or at least somewhat famous) action stars in one film, and it succeeded in some ways and failed in others. The biggest problem that I had with the original is that there were too many patented Stallone-As-Screenwriter moments when he tried to make the film more serious than it EVER needed to be. But when the action was on, it was really glorious to watch all of the over-the-top silliness explode like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon on crank. Fortunately we're treated to much more of that silliness and much less of the seriousness in the Simon West (CON AIR, LARA CROFT: TOMB RAIDER) directed EXPENDABLES 2.<br /><br />As the film opens with a terrific opening set piece of an assault on a fortified bunker, we are reintroduced to our team of Expendables: Barney (Stallone, not losing a step), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham, he of the mighty chin and eternal 5-O'Clock-Shadow), Gunnar (Dolph Lundgren, who's gone from potential villain to one of the good guys again), Yin Yang (Jet Li, still short), Caesar (Terry Crews and his loud auto-shotgun), Toll Road (Randy Couture... who's barely there), and the new kid on the block, Billy (Liam Hemsworth). The whole opening sequence is an orgy of heads and limbs popping off, kung-fu butt-kicking, geysers of digital blood, and big BIG explosions. It also reveals another bit player with a much larger role in this film, and that is the character of Trench, played by none other than the former Governator himself, looking to get back into film in a big (and fun) way. After a brief interlude, Yin Yang departs the film for... really no particular reason, and they're down a man. When they arrive home, Barney in confronted by the mysterious Company man Mr. Church (played with much more relish this time around by Bruce Willis), who orders his merry band to go and intercept a \\"package\\" that's been lost in a plane crash in a faraway land. Church also insists that one of his people, Maggie (the lovely and lethal Nan Yu, whose only other \\"major\\" Hollywood role was in SPEED RACER), goes along for the ride in order to secure the package. Before you can say \\"Time for the big villain entrance\\", it's time for the big villain entrance, and that is in the personage of Vilain (yes, that's his character's name) as portrayed by Jean-Claude Van Damme (clearly having a good time playing the bad guy). Vilain and his crew rather shockingly kill one member of the team, and that leads our Expendables on a path to vengeance. Vilain leads a vicious group of mercenaries and other cut-throat types whose current objective is to steal five tons of old Soviet weapons-grade Plutonium and sell it to the highest bidders. Church, Trench and another player who appears on the board named Booker (Chuck Norris, playing up his \\"Lone Wolf\\" image... get it? \\"Lone Wolf\\"?) all come together to take down Vilain and his operation and his seeminlgly endless parade of cannon fodder.<br /><br />Basically everything that was good about the first film is better here. West has a much better and more dynamic style than Stallone does when it comes to having some flair about the action sequences. The film also knows when to lay off the more serious moments to create more forward momentum. Some may find this to be a disservice to the character, but believe me, if this film had gotten bogged down in this death and the reflection/meditation on life and death that the first film had, it would have done the film a greater disservice. The whole cast, particularly the old-timers, seem to be having a really good time here, even if some of them have less to do because of the inclusion of Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris getting in on the action. The second act does plod on a little, but the film, coming in at a brisk 103 minute run-time, doesn't allow the film to plod for very long.<br /><br />The other thing that is much more evident in this film is its self-awareness. This film, unlike the first film, is VERY aware that it takes place in \\"Action Movie/Video Game Land\\", as opposed to a semi-realistic setting. Just look at the opening sequence; the good guys fire their weapons with unfailing accuracy as they travel at fifty miles per hour while the throngs of bad guys couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. The sea-plane used in the first film has been retrofitted into an airborne tank. In the second act, one man is able to take down a few dozen bad guys AND a tank in a matter of about seven seconds. By the third act, you have our heroes crashing planes into the ground with no real consequences, drilling machines coming out of nowhere, and people RIPPING THE DOORS OFF CARS. This same idea also applies to the character motivations and dialogue: Vilain is evil because he's the villain and he knows it (It's in his name, for God's sakes), and even has the line \\"No loose ends\\" at one point. The good guys are super-quipping machines. Willis and Schwarzenegger share a scene where they throw each other's movie catch-phrases in their faces. This film has abandoned all pretense of reality and that makes it work SO much better than the first film. It's also a real thrill for those of us action fans who were coming of age in the 80's to see Sly, Bruce, Ahnuld, and Chuck killing dozens of bad guys together. The only notable absence from the first film is that of Mickey Rourke, who, admittedly wasn't much of an action star anyway, unless you want to count HARLEY DAVIDSON AND THE MARLBORO MAN or the Van Damme/Dennis Rodman action film DOUBLE TEAM. I think those films are better off forgotten, though, don't you?<br /><br />The best sequels are the ones that learn from the mistakes of the previous films and improve on what made the original entertaining in the first place, and THE EXPENDABLES 2 absolutely does all of that and ends up being one of the more entertaining, if least substantial, films of the summer.<br /><br />4/5 Stars.ute run-time, doesn't allow the film to plod for very long.<br /><br />The other thing that is much more evident in this film is its self-awareness.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|The first thought to cross my mind was the return of the wordsmith, and that someone I know who kind of deserted the later of his work as, \\"he was focusing on the musical cpmposition now, and less on lyrics\\", I think she would like this.<br /><br />My second  thought, take this I only played it once, The song \\"the Tempest\\" great work, and so dramatic that I felt the same emotions in this 10 minute song, that I did from watching a 3 hour movie. Different mediums, and the movie was a revolution in film making.<br /><br />And last for now, how I really feel Dylan has come with the musical style and compositions that fits a voice that has had 50 years of studios, concerts et al. A voice thats boasts of wisdom, and is at the same time no less confident, then when I saw him perform in the 60's. Fifty plus years later is alot of living, and a lot of changes and much we must alter to press on. I for one would like to thank him for thinking of his fans.<br />Peace and Happiness, EZ

0143116738|1.0|I started reading The Element with excitement after reading an article about the author in the Costco magazine. I have been considering life coaching, and doing a lot of reading in order to find my life's calling.  The first part of the book was inspiriting and filled with great quotes and research (although not all of it is accurate as with the standard intelligence tests). As I continued to read; however, I began to feel depressed because all of these case studies were about rich and famous people. Sure they had rough starts, but they are now in the public eye. What about the rest of us? I was hoping he would get to that, and sure, Robinson says something about how not everyone will be able to make their passion their fulltime career. He claims doing it, your passion, even a little, will be fulfilling enough. He's wrong. I have been writing and painting on the side for years. If I could make a living at it, I would. I come home and paint, and I still hate my job. It's not fulfilling, my job, and it's not my passion, or \\"Element.\\" The worst part of the book comes in the last two chapters because they are so far from the point he starts with it's laughable. Who is his editor? They should read my works. They're much better and don't stray as far from point. Robinson digresses to his pet project: education reform, then shifts to political reform. In both areas he fails to come up with a plan to implement, something that's hands on and school districts will use. He is not alone in this as most who attack the public education system rarely have an actual plan, they just want to jump on the bandwagon of \\"I'm against the current state of education, blah, blah, blah.\\" Overall this book is a depressing waste of time and will make you feel bad about yourself and your life and the future in the end.
B008BIZ06M|5.0|I have been a long time Offspring fan but have not been overly impressed with anything after Ixnay on the Hombre. This album gets back to the raw Offspring sound with well written lyrics and even a surprise re-vamp of previously released song off of Ignition.
B004B32500|5.0|Es una gran película, que puede tener muchas lecturas o simplemente vista como un drama.  Es muy intensa, con momentos de mucha fuerza sentimental y un importante análisis de la fuerza de las madres en los hijos, buenísima!! 100% recomendable.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Powerful and unforgettable -- these are the two words that immediately come to mind when trying to describe \\"Spartacus: Vengeance.\\"  The first one tells you about how hard it hits you while watching it and the second one is the feeling that you have after watching it. Hell, for that matter, I shall also add a third word: addictive - you just can't get enough. And if you thought that the first two installments of the series, \\"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena\\" and \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand,\\" could not be surpassed, think again. The writers keep it excitingly fresh and honest.<br /><br />After two seasons, for a lack of a better word (\\"Spartacus Vengeance\\" is labeled as the second season), we now find Spartacus and his fellow slaves free, after terminating Batiatus' empire. If you recall, Batiatus (John Hannah) was the mighty owner of the best gladiators in the town of Capua. However, even though the gladiators are free, they are still slaves and the Romans will do anything to get them back. This time, the Roman-in- charge and the new owner of the Batiatus house is Glaber (Craig Parker, who does a great job). Glaber, as we know, is married to Ilithyia (Viva Bianca), who barely escaped the wrath of Spartacus and his followers when they ended Batiatus' regime. In addition, it is also known that Spartacus, who was originally played by Andy Whitfield, who died at the height of his career due to cancer, was replaced by Liam McIntyre. He commands an impressive group of gladiators and slaves - both male and females --, including Crixus (Manu Bennett), Doctore (Peter Mensah), Mira (Katrina Law), Agron (Daniel Feuerriegel), and others. Spartacus keeps freeing and recruiting slaves throughout the region, always telling his people that \\"an empty hand can yet become a fist\\" and \\"even the mighty republic bleeds when stricken.\\"  Of course, along the way we will find new faces and the return of older ones who we thought were gone for good. There are also mutinies within Spartacus' troops, and all is done well. My favorite episode is \\"Libertus,\\" number five of the season, which by itself could have been a movie. I couldn't believe my eyes while watching it and I was at the edge of my seat. What suspense! What a show! The final and tenth episode, \\"Wrath of the Gods,\\" is also as good as it gets, and closes the season in a satisfying and majestic manner.<br /><br />\\"Spartacus Vengeance\\" has elements of \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" Hitchcock, James Bond, \\"The Godfather,\\" \\"Caligula\\" (Tinto Brass' version), and more; you can see the influences on the filmmakers. The violence gets more gruesome (if that is possible) and the sex is more graphic, without being x-rated (or NR-rated?), and I have to confess that, even though I am not a fan of today's brand of violence (especially the new wave of horror movies), this series is my guilty pleasure. Ah, of course there is also the nudity - male and female - which is a delight to any sexual preference. And then there is the matter of Liam McIntyre replacing Andy Whitfield. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it, as the action and plot keeps you busy. However, that said, I was surprised by Viva Bianca's incredible range of acting on this particular season. I was also impressed by Katrina Law, who was a perfect partner for Spartacus. Both of them, I believe, stole the show from the others, including the males.  Now, of course, we have to wait for what is supposed to be the final season of this spectacular series: \\"War of the Damned.\\"  Knowing Spartacus' end in real life, according to history and in Stanley Kubrick's film, is kind of hard to just think about it, and I hope that the filmmakers have the wisdom on how to give the series a great closure. A hint of that end is given in one of the episodes. The DVD edition includes the season's ten episodes, Starz studios used for Spartacus, a making-of feature, bloopers, a teaser for  \\"Spartacus: War of the Damned,\\" and much more. (USA, 2012, color, 556 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on September 11, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Anchor Bay / Starz Originals.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|In this the second book of the trilogy,the writing does not get one bit better. Was nothing learned by the author from the first book? That aside, Fifty becomes a bit more likable as he softens up a bit in dealing with Anna. Clearly he is trying. Anna also learns to assert herself. The story continues the sexy scenes are still hot and there are alot of them in this book. Not worth a second read, but good for a summer beach book.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Great movie from begining to end. Robert Downey Jr.is at his funniest I've ever seen him. Jack Black and Ben Stiller are very funny as well .I thought it was one of the most creative comedies I've ever seen plus there's a lot of action so you can't go wrong with this purchase

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I've read every Reacher book and I got well into this one yesterday when it first arrived on my Kindle. I really like them.  But can anyone explain to me why the author always gets key facts wrong?  Reacher observes all the little details and claims to be a student of geography, so why doesn't Child get the geography right?  Little mistakes may be found in almost every Reacher book.  This one starts out in the middle of Nebraska at a place we are told is west of Omaha and 700 miles from the suburbs of Denver.  A long car ride east takes our hero past Des Moines.  My map shows that Des Moines is 700 miles and Omaha is 550 miles from Denver.  A place in Nebraska west of Omaha could not be 700 miles from Denver.  Are mistakes like this put in Child's books intentionally, and if so why?

When he leaves all kinds of schemes are followed to make a living, theft, and  ultimately bank robbery. The book sadly tells the tale of a young son and escaped sister who deal painfully with the loss of their parents. There is somewhat of a happy ending, mainly the son following a career and marriage. A great story for our time

I just dont get it, everyone talks about this night and then someone comes forward that was acct. there and he gets shunned. The only reason Mark is under the spot light is because the US government said UBL was armed/and the military dosent like Obama. I thought this book was very good. It is somewhat of a biography which I liked. I felt connected with Mark as he went on missions/trainings. The ranger said Mark will be his sons hero forever, this is true as he is mine. It takes a special person to be in the military let alone make a life of it. While I sit here with my family eating a nice meal there are people out there alowing this for me. Thanks to the men/women who killed UBL.<br /><br />P.S. Mark lives in America and can write a book about his life if he wants. He can also profit from the book as well. He could keep a 100% from the earnings if he chose because he earned it. Just make it to Lunch.

Lost many nights sleep reading til wee hours of the morning. Time passed too fast. Having withdrawals in search of more Grey. Who cares how many times a specific word was said. This was FICTION.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Yes, this new Reacher book gives us lots of Reacher wit, strength of character, and kick-ass moves against the bad guys.. I think the story line is complex and as usual has wonderful characterizations. Poor guy doesn't get enough romance though!  Lee Child always delivers a good read.....it's great to delve into his books, like slipping into a fantasy world where the 6'5\\" hero fights for an idealistic form of justice we rarely hear of in 2012.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is a terrific read if your a teenaged virgin girl.  It's an okay venture for everyone else.  Everything is pretty superficial and direct.  There are some twists and turns I guess but not particularly challenging.  To me this novel is a byproduct of a jaded society dominated by quick hit television and movies.  The is author is talented and does address what she intended to...coming of age for teenage girls and dealing with violence.  A catchy little pop tome.

B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I really enjoyed this documentary. It was eloquent, and well-paced, but I wanted more! During all the musical cut scenes of the city and such, all I wished was that someone just let Jiro-san have his own camera and shoot a whole day or week or year of his life with no music or anything else...his character is so compelling, I thought that Gelb almost took a little bit away from the man Jiro was by trying to insert some music and metropolitan cut-scene art. I think the silence and the quietness of Jiro-san's life would have been something else to watch in itself. Still, an amazing documentary about a man who dedicated his life to the perfection of nigirizushi!

B0094OLFUW|4.0|It is hard to find the right words to describe the XX, especially the music on this album, and that is because it is treading in water where few bands dare to go. This album may not be as heavy sounding and aggressive as some have hoped. For as quiet as most of the album is, it demands your attention and is addictive.<br /><br />With their debut album, it had a sound and song writing that showed the age of the musicians. This album carries much of the same focus that you could find on their first, but it feels like the band has grown up. This album is something new and shouldn't be overlooked even if it doesn't hold your attention the first go around.

1401324649|5.0|The Hundred-Year-Old Who Climbed Out Through the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson is a fictional book which follows the adventures and mis-adventures of its protagonist. So far this book has been translated to 29 languages and has been a best seller in many countries.<br /><br />Allan Karlsson's health is good, so good that to his dismay he is facing the horrors of putting up appearances for this 100th birthday. Leaving the mayor, the press, his friends and the bane of his existence - the nurse - behind, he escapes moments before the big celebration. When a young man asks Allan to keep an eye on his suitcase at the train station, the centenarian steals it and sets the ball rolling on a month long chase involving the police, the underworld and a handful of accomplices.<br /><br />Parallel to the escape, Allan's long life is revealed to the reader. As it turned out, Allan is not just an old man with a suitcase, but one of the most influential persons to ever walk the face of the earth in the 20th Century. Alas, through the comedy of life, Allan is only remembered for his age.<br /><br />The Hundred-Year-Old Who Climbed Out Through the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson is a hilarious romp through the 20th Century. The book is very enjoyable and doesn't take itself seriously.<br /><br />The book's characters focus on lampooning the espionage genre and parody the mystery/chase genres as well. The important people Allan Karlsson, the protagonist, has met and influenced (Truman, Churchill, Mao, Lenin and more) shines a light on their dark side rather than the pillars of world affairs we have built them to be. Allan's contribution to the Manhattan Project doesn't get bypassed either.<br /><br />While I did get the feeling that the book was very much influenced from Forrest Gump and/or Woody Allen's Zelig. Allen Karlsson is the eternal optimist, half way through the book it is clear that nothing will happen to him, but it is how he gets out of trouble and his unbelievable luck and improbable coincidences which makes the book so entertaining and endearing.<br />The characters are not as well defined as they could be, but I still enjoyed this book very much, especially since it doesn't take itself seriously.unbelievable luck and improbable coincidences which makes the book so entertaining and endearing.<br />The characters are not as well defined as they could be, but I still enjoyed this book very much, especially since it doesn't take itself seriously.
0345803485|2.0|I am an avid reader and have an open mind to all types of books. When I heard the buzz about this book I had to read it. I'm now sorry I wasted my time. It was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I am still trying to figure out why It is on the best seller list. It has no real plot, and the main female character is annoying. This book could have been written so much better. I found it to be slow moving. By the last few chapters I was questioning if I should bother finishing it.
0525953728|4.0|At some point the American public deserved to hear the story of Neptune Spear from the horse's mouth rather than being left with the filtered, \\"no photos\\" official account. Kudos to the author for breaking ranks with the traditional special forces code of silence in order to tell us what he could this soon after the mission.<br /><br />This is not the first (and certainly not last) example of a special operator \\"going public\\" regarding a notable mission - and an occasional glimpse behind the curtain seems appropriate, so long as it is done in a way which does not disclose official secrets or otherwise threaten national security. The author seems to have succeeded in this regard.<br /><br />The author has also succeeded in giving a basic introduction to the modern SEALs and an overview of the types of operations they have been involved in since 2001. The author does this by highlighting some of the notable missions he participated in, which in turn provides a framework and background for Neptune Spear. This approach was important given that the audience for this book was going to be different (i.e. broader) than that of the typical special forces autobiography.<br /><br />However, and in large part due to the foregoing two factors, the book does not stand out among the field of special forces autobiographies. This is not to say that the book is not a good read -- it certainly does accomplish its primary mission to provide an accessible and engrossing account of Neptune Spear. For this reason I recommend it, with the foregoing caveats for those who have read extensively on modern special operations.<br /><br />My thanks to \\"Mark Owen\\" for his service, and for taking on the additional risks he faces by coming forward with his first-hand account of Neptune Spear.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time.  So many twists, turns and surprises!  The author has a great style of writing.  You'll love it!!
B006H5120E|5.0|Not going to go into detail about the movie because if you have seen the movie, you know how it ends. The ship sinks, Jack freezes and Ismay pretends he's invisible while sitting in a lifeboat. Oh and Mr. Murtoff <-shoots himself and falls into the water. Sooo<br />the 3D blu ray IMO was the best movie to be released. Granted I have not seen every 3D movie however have Transformers Dark blah blah, which has it's moments - but wasn't as great 3D wise as I had read prior to actually having owned or seen the movie. It was okay... With this movie, found myself getting lost in just about every scene because the 3D is just there. Doesn't matter if it's when Rose if looking at the paintings or Jack is eating a roll before tossing Cal a box of matches. JC did a wonderful job in bringing 3D to this particular movie. Cannot wait to watch Avatar 3D - have seen a 2D conversion and was impressed. My favorite scenes were: When Cal fires the pistol down the stairwell - the water from the round hitting errr the water flies up. Opening scene of the movie is pretty neat as well. Loved seeing Kate and Leo running through where the guys were I guess shoveling coal - the steam really stood out. Could go on and on but what's the point, there'll be some folks who will not agree and that's fine.<br />Overall I am very happy.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Got this game as the FOTD a while back &amp; quickly became addicted! I like that it's fairly easy to &quot;pass&quot; most the levels but increasingly difficult to get the full score; this makes it great for quick-play as well as some hard strategy rounds... After mastering all the levels I was left feeling empty &amp; at a loss for what to do next instead of sleep... Solution? Buy Quell Reflect! :-D<br /><br />So why only 4 stars? Same as everyone else: quit asking us to like/rate/review your apps! Besides, do you really want people to review your app after interrupting their game?

0761169431|4.0|I went to see Chris Alexander at the Star Wars Origami panel at the San Diego Comic-Con, where he taught us a couple of origami projects from \\"Star Wars Origami.\\"  We made Boba Fett and a lightsaber.  When I bought the book, I searched for the most difficult project and made Jabba the Hutt first.  It wasn't bad.  Then, I tried the X-Wing, which was one level down in difficulty, but I got a little lost and gave up on it.<br /><br />Each project comes with a synopsis of the character, droid, or ship we are making, in case we are unfamiliar with its role in the saga.  Many are well-known, like Princess Leia and the X-Wing, but some are lesser characters, like Taun We, or the Armored Assault Tank.  Inserted between the pages every now and again are trivia pages to test your Jedi prowess.  Do you know how many starships survived the battle of Yavin?<br /><br />The projects are indexed by difficulty level.  Many of them come with two pieces of printed origami paper, in case we want to repeat it.  I would like it if the origami paper was labeled with the project name.  I don't like searching and it's not always obvious.<br /><br />Also, the origami paper has an arrow on the back of each page.  I'm not sure how that is supposed to be oriented when we start working.  I just fold and hope it's right.  Luckily, it was good when I did Jabba the Hutt.<br /><br />My son is eleven and he thought this book was too difficult.  The children were frustrated at the panel we attended and so were many of the adult attendants.  My husband wouldn't even try.  He thought it was hard, and the lightsaber (the one we were being taught) is one of the easiest projects.  I would say the book is definitely geared more for adults.  I can get most of the folds, but the sink fold is extremely difficult for me to do properly, even though I understand what needs to be done (hard to explain here, but the fold is inverted).<br /><br />For the adult Star Wars fan, this is a wonderful book.<br /><br />____________<br /><br />UPDATE 2/3/13:  Just to clarify my rating of this book as it was brought to my attention that it appears I'm complaining a lot about this book.  It was my intention to alert the buyer that this is not easy for children to do.  It is better for an adult or teen, one who is good at following visual instructions.  I am able to do most of the projects that I attempt; and I did try to do the most difficult ones first, just to see how challenging that can be.  It is a great book, if you know what you are getting into.________<br /><br />UPDATE 2/3/13:  Just to clarify my rating of this book as it was brought to my attention that it appears I'm complaining a lot about this book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was curious to what all the hype was about with this book, so i purchased a copy. Safe to say curiosity got the cat because it was a waste of time and money
0425263908|1.0|I can't believe this book has a rating of 4 stars. I think that it's pretty much plagiarism, the characters and the plot are almost exactly the same as FsoG.<br /> BUT to be fair I will not base this review on a comparison of the two novels, I am writing about just Bared to You:<br />I don't know where to start-it's just a train wreck. There's so much wrong with it! The characters are too perfect and just described in a way that I really don't care about them, their emotions are written but not felt, they're not endearing at all. The story is the same thing over and over: sex, fight, run away, sex, repeat. The characters don't grow at all. I think the best way I can sum it up is to say that's it's just not believable, and that, for me anyway, ruins it. It's just words, she doesn't write in a way that I can relate to the characters.  Everyone is so perfect but then we're suppossed to believe they are really so messed up inside?! They never demonstrate how they're messed up, they just keep saying they are over and over. It just doesn't work!!

B0014JKJHK|2.0|These Crocs were not up to the usual good standards of the brand. Within two days of moderate wear the strap of the right shoe became disengaged and the sole of the left separated from the rest of the shoe.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Great album, hands down.  I have listened to this one about 10 times through already.  All of the songs are very different, yet strong in their own right--incredible imagery.<br />No one creates a picture and mood with his listeners like Bob Dylan.  For example, I could literally feel the story of the Titanic as told by Bob.  That is a true artistic gift.  I think that \\"Narrow Way\\" is the most enjoyable song on the album; very tight-great riff.  This one will stick in your head for days--what a talent!  But let's get to the point.  Someone said to me recently, \\"I tried to read Shakespeare and I just couldn't see the genius.\\" Someone also said to me recently, \\"I stared at a Picasso, but I just couldn't see the art.\\"  Finally, someone who just listened to this album said to me, \\"I just don't get Dylan's music.\\"  Point taken, enough said.  Never fear Bob, you are in good company!  Good health and longevity to you from a constant listener.
B0088TG252|4.0|Great movie! My husband wanted to watch \\"something with lots of explosions\\" so we chose Safe House. This was a very fast paced action filled movie with a good plot. Definitely worth the rental.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved every word of this book and found it hard to put down.  Cheryl's journey through the wilderness gave her a new outlook on life, a renewal.  It gave me inspiration to get out and do some of the things I always been afraid to do.  It also gave me a new interest in backpacking!
B0090EIILU|2.0|Just aweful! This movie was so stupid and a complete waste of time and money. Would never watch again and would NEVER recomend it to anyone!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I thouroughly enjoy how Kathy Reichs is so meticulous about her story and all the many parts. She keeps me enthralled with her wit and how her characters evolve. I have been an avid reader since her very first book. She is absolutely amazing!!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I loved Lonely Boy but was hesitant to purchase the full album. So many bands/musicians nowadays have great singles but manage to epically fail at a full album. I am so happy I took the plunge with El Camino. With the start of Lonely Boy you are transfixed into almost a time warp of sound that is modern yet harkens back to the 70s... the GOOD 70s.<br /><br />I have literally listened to this album every day since purchasing it about 2 months ago. It makes my day at work so much better, or any time in the car so much more pleasant. While I love pretty much every song on this album, some standouts are:<br /><br />Lonely Boy<br />Little Black Submarines<br />Money Maker<br />Sister<br /><br />One of the best album buys I have had all year.

B008B1VYP0|3.0|I have been a fan of Maroon 5 since their debut album, which came out when I was in my teens. They were fantastic, catchy without being bubblegum poppy, and sexy without it being forced down your throat. However, with the new success of Adam on The Voice and this new 'pop' album (which please, they've always made a form of pop rock, you are only finally admitting it), I feel like the music is now suffering. This was a good buy for about $3 ($5 but I had free amazon dollars from a previous mp3 purchase) but to be honest I listen to maybe a third of the album.<br /><br />The Keepers:<br />One More Night<br />Lucky Strike<br />The Man Who Never Lied<br />Doin' Dirt<br /><br />This is a far cry from She Will Be Loved, Harder to Breath, and Misery. 4 songs out of 12 that were truly worth it, and the song writing has suffered. I can't even begin to rant about how horrid Payphone is. Mediocrity from a favorite band... I guess not so much a favorite anymore :(

B000IJ79UW|5.0|Thanks to this movie, we now have the 89' Batman movie, and all other comic book movies. After watching this again, this is what a Superman movie should be, I'd give it more stars if I could. The movie opens up with John williams soaring iconic score, and then we come to Krypton, now the original intent was to film a massive Superman movie, kind of like what the salkynds had done with the three musketeers. They wanted it to be really campy too, but Dick donner ruined that, Now it's already been said about the behind the scenes arguing between Donner and the salkinds. Christopher Reeve as Superman, Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Now, he was cut out of Richard Lester's Superman II because the salkinds were cheap and didn't want to pay him, pure and simple. Now, for it being 1978, the effects of this movie stand up pretty well, and I'm sorry, but even the modern movies could take a lesson from this movie. Because I honestly believe that Superman is flying, and it's all done without CGI, the romance between Superman and Lois is believable. Now yes, Gene Hackman played Lex Luthor over the top. But to be fair, Lex Luthor wasn't the evil billionare in the comic books yet. Now some have complained about the whole turning the world back ending, I honestly didn't care. Because that's something that Superman is capable of doing, and it was supposed to be the ending to Superman II, but because the salkinds never told Donner that he was over budget. They wanted him to wrap up Superman The Movie, thus the ending was Taken from the second movie and put in the first. And it works, this movie was ground breaking, and Christopher Reeve is Superman.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Story was good,but there were to many details about the diamond mines and the RCMP. She seem to babble on about these and sometimes got away from the actual story, which I was disappointed in.  Her books are usual the type that you cannot put down and this book took me at least a week to read it all.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|I hate to tell people this, but what you see in \\"The Dark Knight\\" is not Batman, nor the Joker. This movie is a Batman movie, from the 40's, Tim Burton and the producers had gone back to Batman's early days as a crimfighter. And this is what was produced, all I can say is woooooooow, I still become alittle kid when I watch this movie. Micheal Keaton was the perfect choice to play Batman, And Jack's Joker is perfect. Batman actually acts like a detective in this movie, the movie opens with him beating the crap out of a couple of thugs. Then he disappears after uttering that now famous line \\"I'm Batman\\", not with a growl, but with a low menacing whisper. Then we're introduced to Jack Napier, as he's having an affair with his bosses mistress. Jack goes off to pay the mob's informant on the force, and now we're confronted with Vickie Vail and Alexander Knox, both working for the Gotham Globe. But wait, Mob Boss Carl Grissom wants to keep the new district Attorney Harvey Dent from getting to close to his businesses, so Jack suggests they break into Axis Chemicals. But he's signed his own death warrant, as Grissom asks him to be in charge of the job personally, since Grissom knows about the affair and is going to have Jack killed. But at the plant, the police interrupt Jack and his men. As does the mysterious figure, Batman. Jack gets shot in the face, and just before he falls into a vat, Batman tries to save him, but alas he can't, and Jack supposedly falls to his death. But he survived the chemicals, and it turns him into THE JOKER. He goes after Boss Grissom and kills him so he can take over the mobs of Gotham. Meanwhile, Bruce and Vickie start dating, but the Joker notices Vickie as well. And wants her as his as well, which leads to murder and Mayhem on the streets of Gotham, I forgot to mention a character in this movie. It's not a person, but it's THE BATMOBILE. A true Batmobile, that is sleek and menacing. Jack's Joker is what the Joker should be, Micheal Keaton is Batman. And surpisingly, Kim Basinger's Vickie Vale is a pretty decent Character, even if she gets let into the batcave. And we get one of the greatest moments in the Batman movies, when Bruce wayne suits, and Danny Elfman's score is incredible. An Awsome, awsome movie. Better than \\"The Dark Knight\\"Batman.

B007T9FRFS|5.0|I love the book version so much better than the TV show.  This tackled a subject no one really likes (dead babies), but as the story unfolds, it really grips you with the question 'Who done it and why?' My only moan is that I have to wait for the next book in the series!!!  Glad to see Ryan back on the scene, too, though I missed Birdie <g>
B000B5XOSO|5.0|First, this movie was not aimed or promoted to kids. And I wouldn't suggest letting a child under ten years old to watch this movie, it's darker and colder than the first one,It opens on a snowy evening, where a wealthy couple has given birth to a child, but the doctor and the nurse go running out of the room, we never go into the room. And the father rushes in, as we cut away we hear the father scream. Cut to a few years later, and they're celebrating christmas. This time,the child is in a small cage, grabs the cat and kills it for its dinner. All the while his parents just watch this, an idea pops into their heads. They take their child out for a midnight walk, and dump into the sewers, and we cut to the credits. Now I must say, this movie is long, and does focus on the peguin, Batman's appearances are brief, but honestly, that's because unlike Superman. Batman is trying to figure out how to stop the peguin, not be a reactionary hero. Since he's not, Burton also gives is Max Schreck an evil CEO. His son, the Red Triangle Gang run by Oswald Cobblepot aka the Penguin. And last but not least, Catwoman. Now no offence meant to Anne Hatheway, I'm sure she'll do a decent job. But just like Micheal Keaton is Batman, Michelle Pheiffer is Catwoman. She's sexy and dangerous at the same time, is she a part of the penguins gang or not. who's side is she on, now yes. I do agree that there was no reason for Batman to remove his mask at the end. But then again, Schreck was dead. Surpisingly, Batman doesn't kill anybody in this movie, except for one member of the Red Triangle Gang. Penguine dies because the ac unit in his hideout was blown up, Catwoman electrocutes Schreck. Yes this movie is dark and depressing, but that's because it's really a true Batman movie. Batman as I've said before isn't exactly a eat your vegetables kind of character, Superman is. That's why it's not surprising, that when people rate the series, the first one and this one are the top two people really like.
B001DTWJRE|4.0|Hemingway has a way of narrating that you really feel he's written a true story. While I like his narrative, it becomes a little boring sometimes. A book for school, or to take when vacationing.
B0014Z4ON4|1.0|Raiders was awsome, and Empire strikes Back had just come out. Lucas even admitted that when he wrote both Empire and Temple, he was going through a divorce. And so both movies are dark, I have to say this movie doesn't even feel like an Indiana Jones movie. Kate Capshaw screams all the way through this movie, Short Round adds nothing to the movie. And the Nostalgia Critic is right, Indy says he doesn't believe in the power of the stones, but yet all of a sudden does at the end. There really is no reason for him to go after the stones, not a good Indiana Jones movie. The only reason I have it, is to complete the collection.

We would not have the school problems and people would act respectful to each other and be respectful of authority.  Start in the home and then it would ripple effect into the high schools.  Please see Facing the Giants.  Great movie also
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I've got to join in with those folks that are rating this album as 5 stars. Upon first listen, I was instantly captivated by the return to storytelling in these new Bob Dylan songs, trying to guess at the allegory he might be employing to refer to our modern times, while at the same time enjoying the music itself and Dylan in his now raspy but timeless vocals. Of course, you have to marvel at the epic song and title track, \\"The Tempest\\". What is the storm he is referring to and what is the symbolism of the Titanic? Bob Dylan is at his best when he makes you think and there is a lot to think about in these songs. There's even a time to reflect as in the song \\"Roll on John\\". Overall, my opinion is that this album is Bob Dylan's mystical clarion call to the current age, the one on which the sun will eventual set for him, but in which his legecy will continually endure.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I read an article about this book in Time Magazine. The article intrigued me and upon reading the book, I wasn't disappointed. The writing style was interesting. The female character was depicted through most of the book by her diary entries, the male through his thoughts and actions. I do not want to spoil the read, but truly both women and men will enjoy it. It was very interesting throughout and explicit in some areas, which made it difficult to put down.
B000V63BN6|4.0|Used to have some Stevie Wonder back in my youth (vinyl and tape) and like this album but feel like they didn't pick the best music.  Maybe it was the highest on the chart or something to that degree but it left me unsatisfied.
0451527046|5.0|This novel is one of the best novels written in this genre.  It has been turned into every imaginable type of media.  Plays, musicals, operas, and a movie adaptation by the Muppets.<br /><br />I don't need to go through a detailed analysis of the plot.  Nearly everyone knows that.  The contribution this work makes to pirate lore is legendary.  Everyone in the culture knows of Captain Flint and the quest for the treasure.  The Black Spot, et al. demonstrates the complete cultural penetration this work has.  It is a masterfully developed one.  If you know of the previous matters, and have not read this book, do so, you will enjoy it.
B0074EIQQU|5.0|I'm starting to think this band can do no wrong.  Noctourniquet is indeed an obvious continuation from Octahedron, as all of The Mars Volta's albums tend to evolve directly from their predicessors.  But as is always the case, it is not an exact copy, either.  The creative juices just keep flowing, and Rodriguez-Lopez and Zavala-Bixler aren't anywhere near their plateau.  Not at all.<br />The focus here tends to be on more laid-back pieces.  But that is not to say sappy ballads.  No, the disturbingly eerie atmosphere keeps the listener glued.  Granted, some tracks are hard to grasp until you listen to them a few times, but doesn't that tend to be true of most great music?  There's also more electronica influence, and this is a turn-off for some who feel Omar's virtuosity on guitar obligates him to do nothing but jam.  But both of this outfit's leaders are extremely creative and proficient musicians overall, and their genius is best left unrestrained to any box the masses would want to keep them in.<br />The abstract, sometimes humorous lyrics are there once again; how can you not chuckle at the psychotic line \\"And the traps in the cellar go clickity-clack 'cause you know I always set them for you\\"?  Absolutely delicious.<br />If you're just hearing this album for the first time, please wait until you've listened to it several times as I did before forming an opinion.  What's great about it is it takes a spin or to to truly relish.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|Well I like it but I don't see the point in spending 3 dollars for an angry bird game. It is fun.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like that it is formatted for a tablet device like the Kindle Fire. It loads quickly and has great interactive maps. I just wish there was a paid version so I didn't have to put up with advertisements but, that is a small quibble for an otherwise well done application.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game temple run so fun I play it every day its that fun. Great game for all age's.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|First I am an adult that enjoys a good book no matter who it is written for.  I enjoyed the \\"Hunger Games\\" series very much and watch for similar series that will catch my interest.  This one did and I am now on the third installment, \\"Specials\\". This was originally planned as a three book series, but the popularity of it convinced the author to write a fourth book which I have already obtained for my pleasure after reading the \\"Specials\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fast-paced exciting read with well written but not preachy attitudes of how our past world (the world of today) wasted and destroyed our environment.I am not what one would call an environmentalist, but I do feel that we should use what we have without waste and plan for future needs.  This story does bring some of this up in a fantastic story that moves along and keeps one glued to it to find out what will occur next. I hardly ever pay full price for a book and will get one at the library if at all possible, but I was unable to obtain the second of the series in any way  but to purchase it. This in itself shows how much I wanted to continue reading. By the way there are NO VAMPIRES which is unusual in YA novels these days. Thank goodness for that! LOL<br /><br />My recommendation:  Obtain this series and enjoy!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I hate these town games and zoos and reality game types buttttttt I'm addicted to this game its not exactly like the Oregon trail I played in school but fun as hayel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down. finished it in 4 days. Went on to finished mocking jay in the same time. Great series.  Waiting to see how they do the movie.
B00466HM28|5.0|To be honest I'm new to this whole midi world of music, but as far as I can tell this works great. Just some heads up though. If you're planning on using this on a computer, you don't need a usb to midi cable. It comes with a standard usb cable that connect to the unit to your computer, and it works great. Another thing, if you're new to the whole music thing, you need software that allows a input. Like Fruity Loops, for example (it's what I use). If you don't have software, you're gonna have to buy some, the only software this comes with is an editing software to customize the buttons. However if you have all of the listed items, it's great for beginners, like me. Also delivery was so fast, I got it today, and I wasn't supposed to get it for another two days :D
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Consistent with the other books in the trilogy. Character development is very good and the story line is captivating. Ithe books contain good life lessons while providing a read that was difficult to put down.
B006POGWB6|1.0|FYI. This video is not playable in the US. The vendor is working to refund my cost.<br />Great movie, worth owning. I will keep trying to find it in 3D
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I'm forcing myself to finish the second book of this trilogy. The first book was great! However very disappointed with fifty shades darker.  I find that it is very repetative, and I'm getting bored of the characters.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Challenging game that gets you thinking. Dummy Defense (by the same developer) is even more fun and engaging. Great job all around!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|By book 2 I was pretty sick of repetitive sex scenes. Book 3 has a much better plot and was a lot more interesting. Sadly, I ended up just skimming over the sex scenes after book 1. If you enjoyed the first two books, you should definitely read the third.
B007TML4EI|5.0|I really like this game (even more than Simple Physics).  It's challenging to build something that protects the dummy and then piece by piece reduce the amount of beams until you get the cheapest design through trial and error. I was able to get the 7th lowest cost design on the heavy sledgehammer level so far. Great game,  thank you!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am sooooo disappointed.  I'm like several here who think Lee Child turned his idea over to a ghost writer...and it wasn't Diane Capri. Her Reacher stories can take over. She's a good writer and her Reacher story gave a new twist. I enjoyed it. Tom Cruise can play in that one. His short stature won't be noticed. The way Lee Child has always in every novel portrayed the giant of a man named Reacher, how can Hollywood let a short dweeb play the character? With Dwarfs? Pretty sad...both this book and the movie idea.  I'm no writer but I do understand, writer's block...it is best to let characters go and start fresh with something entirely new.  I'm sorry Lee, I have infatuated over Reacher but your last two novels??? I'm over him.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Surrealistic Pillow is the second album by the Jefferson Airplane and the first to feature singer Grace Slick. It produced two Top 10 singles, (both penned by Grace Slick), \\"Somebody To Love\\" and the iconic psychedelic rock anthem, \\"White Rabbit\\".  The album came out in 1967 and help fuel \\"The Summer of Love\\" which gave spirit to alternative lifestyles, culture, conciousness and music of that era.  Surrealistic Pillow reached #3 on the Billboard album chart, ensuring for Jefferson Airplane a lofty place among their San Francisco based peers.<br />I bought this CD to replace an older version I essentially \\"wore out\\".  This newer version has the original 11 tracks, plus 7 bonus tracks, including a hidden track of \\"D.C.B.A.-25\\"(an instrumental version).<br />Surrealistic Pillow is one of my favorite all-time Jefferson Airplane recordings.  I recommend starting with this CD if you are building their catalogue.  I hope this helps.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Simple concept with challenging puzzles to solve.  The app works every time and you are able to pick up right where you left off.
0425188809|5.0|Watchers was the first Dean Koontz book I ever read.  I am now an avid reader of Dean Koontz.  I have collected almost all of his work.  I actually carry around a printed list of his books so that if I am ever faced with one for sale I know which ones I already have.  My mom used to read romance novels and I introduced her to Watchers.  She has become a Dean Koontz fan now and let go of the romance novels.  She has completely switched genres and now we are comparing and trading books all the time!  This is the man that inspired me to live out my dream of being a writer as well.  My husband made me the same deal that his wife did.  He is supporting me going to school while working on my novel.  If I haven't been published a year after getting out of school, I go and get a job in my field (I'm majoring in English).  Read any one of his books and you will fall in love right away.  Watchers is my all time favorite, but another great one is Intensity.  This story just takes off!  Right from the start you are in the thick of it.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I love the suspense in this movie... a lot happens..a whole lot happens so hold on to your seat!! You have to make sure you had watched all of the movies before you watch this one. Now I am ready for part two and hope to gather all the collection soon.
034580404X|5.0|I heard about the book but did not rush out to purchase them as I read Amazon reviews that did not rank very well.  I have now read all 3 books and could not put them down.  I love the charcters!  The best way to describe the triology is a Erotica Romance!  If you are lookinbg for more BDSM then these books are probably not for you.  I typically am not much of a reader but could not stop reading these books....very easy reading.
0060512806|3.0|...this writing style is way too wordy.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I am a computer geek with a love for hacking, crypto and math.<br /><br />But does he need to tell me about the chemical nutrients in the grass that's eaten by the sheep in the English countryside while (WWII) Waterhouse rides the train to Bletchley Park? Does he need to tell me about all the different ethnic groups in the Phillipines while (present day) Waterhouse goes to check on the Japanese gold on Avi's behalf? I could go on for ever.<br /><br />This droning reminds of my Grandfather, telling me stories that would go on and on and on but never get anywhere.<br /><br />Again, I loved the plot and the \\"spy novel\\" aspect of his book. But his writing style was a major turn-off for me.<br /><br />I rate this item 3 stars, because of the seemingly daunting effort the creation of this book must have been.
0525953728|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Hearing about these exceptional men made me wonder what the rest of us were doing with our lives these past ten years.  I highly recommend reading this.
B0053O89XI|4.0|As a \\"Star Wars\\" & \\"Indiana Jones\\" fan I was a late bloomer to the show.  Started watching it when the repeats started airing in 2011.  My favorite episode is in season 4 what I call \\"the Raiders\\" episode.<br /><br />The 5th season is good, but NOT nearly the best.  I consider the 4th season the best.<br /><br />As a \\"Star Wars\\" & \\"Indiana Jones\\" fan I want to know why not one actor from any of those films have been on.<br /><br />2 favorite episodes in season 5:  episode 19 \\"The Weekend Vortex\\" & 20 \\"The Transporter Malfunction\\".<br /><br />Now, I am going to stick up for \\"Star Trek\\" fans here.  Episode 5 \\"The Russian Rocket Reaction\\" is another Wil Wheaton episode BUT the blu ray/DVD package does not mention Brent Spiner.  And, of course episode 20.  Leonard Nimoy has been mentioned in more than one episode in the series, my favorite when Penny gives Sheldon the autographed napkin.  So, having him do the voice of the \\"Spock\\" action figure was great.  BUT, he got NO MENTION in the credits or the blu ray/DVD episode list like Spiner.<br /><br />I did feel the season finale about the wedding was a let down.  You normally get surprises in finales & season openers, so episode 1 of season 6 should be fantastic to make up for the \\"no surprises\\" season 5 finale.<br /><br />Normal, good extras in the packages.<br /><br />You have 2 blu ray disc & 3 DVD disc in this.<br /><br />Looking forward to season 6.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Free Flow is a very challenging and addictive game.  I enjoy trying to figure out the paths even though at times it is frustracting when it is difficult.<br />I have recommended it to my sister and daughter and would to anyone.
B001NLKT60|5.0|What an awesome ride that was. Continuing on with the series. Very enjoyable reading. It's a bit scary to think these types of things  do go on in our world,  but what's a body to do?
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I loved this book so much! Fast-paced, fun, exciting, and un-put-downable! It's very reminiscent of Robert Heinlen but is written so strongly that it differentiates itself from him. Highly recommended, and what a brilliant idea.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|did not expect this movie to be that good but it was awesome and worth it. sorry friends blew batman away.
0345803507|1.0|When I bought this it said buy within 2 hours get it before sept 4th!! So I did didnt get it!! Then it said sept 7th......still nothing!! Now sept 14!!! This is bs!!!! Very distatifeid!!!!!!

B000FA57RG|5.0|I borrowed a copy of this DVD from my local library.<br />I enjoyed it so much and watched it over and over that I finally decided to buy my own copy.<br />This is a GOOD documentary DVD.<br />Aside from showing how the Re-Invention Tour was put together, it also focuses a lot on Madonna's intellect, views about life and spiritual side.<br />The BEST parts of the documentary are meeting Madonna's amazing dancers (particularly Daniel Cloud Campos), following her tour from country to country, seeing live performances of her songs from the American Life album and hearing her talk about the world, politics and religion.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|\\"No Easy Day,\\" as the title states, is an honest, straight-forward account of the mission to take down UBL.  Serving in Afghanistan when the book was released, I downloaded the Kindle version and read it over three days.  I appreciate the detail in the book as it related to where I currently am located.  Written at a level that my 13-year old could grasp, the book is accessible to anyone interested in hearing the story behind the death of UBL.  This story is a valuable piece of history, and to me provides closure to the events on 9/11 that Bin Laden and Al Qaeda perpetrated on our country.  Of note, I finished the book early in the morning on September 11, 2012, in Afghanistan, while listening to Giant Voice warnings of possible rocket attacks on the base... circumstances I will not forget.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I'm very much enjoying this book. The story just keeps getting deeper into the characters and plot. I find myself staying up to late reading wanting to know what will happen next.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The writing isn't the greatest bit it was an easy to read story. The is actually a ploy aside from all the sex. The sex did get a bit boring and predictable but it was still an entertaining read.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|What a fabulous book!  I did not want to finish it......so poetically written illustrating the innocence of a German family, in Nazi Germany.  The family's innocence is sharply contrasted quite beautifully to the horror and violence going on right outside their family window.  The boy, Bruno, was so perfectly, and sensitively illustrated in this book.  The book was much better than the DVD, in the details, etc (I also purchased from Amazon). The ending of this book was so ironically illustrated, and such a sad commentary on the history of that particular time in the torn apart world we lived in!  Gayle
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|movie was a little slow but interesting if you are interested in the space program.what more do you want me to say?
B0019O6IWU|5.0|Excellent, excellent.  This was the missing link for me in so many ways.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this transformative book and form of communication.  It takes a little practice but it's easier than you think to change and drastically improve your world.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the most fantastic app for a Bible. It comes with fantastic plans that you can read and study on. You can also access this app online to track your progress and see your badges. It has everything at you finger tips. This is fantastic!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book was so different from the start, an absolute page turner. I was so impressed - that is until the end, so disappointing. I was sorry I read it. Who would ever end a book like that!!!!1
B004HW7JMO|1.0|This is the worse version of Spartacus anyone could come up with. Every other word was blatantly spoken with sexually explicit language with the \\"C\\" word and the other \\"C\\" word. Wow. So disgusting and how disappointing. The timing was terrible. It was like a rushed dialogue and none of the actors were acting in a cohesive manner except Peter Mensah as Oenomaus. The set and costume were good but the script and direction were low budget soft porn. My rating of one star is being very generous.
034580404X|5.0|It has been a long time since I found a story that could hold my attention, this was it. I had a hard time putting it down. Adult content, yes, but great story!!
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I don't want to call this album overrated, but the pre-release festival of praise was definitely a little over the top.  Tempest fits right in with \\"Love and Theft\\", Modern Times, and Together Through Life - similar style, similar sound, the songs aren't appreciably better.  If you liked those three albums, you'll like Tempest.  If not, you might want to give it a pass.  A solid, enjoyable album, but certainly not in the top tier of Dylan's catalogue, as some reviewers have placed it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game easy to play and always something to do. My kids love and I can play it for a good long while too.
B0000041A9|5.0|The five sonatas for cello and piano may not be the most ambitious or profound works that Beethoven wrote, but they bear the unmistakable stamp of his imagination and are very enjoyable.<br /><br />Rostropovich's playing is beautiful and expressive as usual, but I think what makes this set particularly special is Richter's presence - they are a great match, both putting their virtuosity in service of the music's inherent expressiveness. The rondos of the Op. 5 works both sparkle like no other performance I've heard.<br /><br />The sound overall is good. Generally I have found the sound of analogue-era cello recordings to be less enjoyable than more recent digital recordings, but here there is just enough room ambiance to complement Rostropovich's big sonority. Throughout the recordings there is a thin layer of noise that is mostly harmless; the lone exception is in the adagio of the final sonata where some crackling in the left channel spoils things a bit.<br /><br />These works are pretty well served on disc, and many of the sets can be found very cheap. Other sets that I particularly enjoy are Heinrich Schiff with Till Fellner and Miklos Perenyi with Andras Schiff. I think this performance is as good as or better than either of them; really it's a question of whether you need the clean digital sound.<br /><br />Of course it's important to note that the variation sets are not performed by Rostropovich and Richter, but rather by Maurice Gendron and Jean Francaix.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. I read this one while ago and I'm still thinking about it. It was cute, romantic and heartbreaking story. I have read many books since and every time I writing a review I can't help but compare to this one.<br /><br />I just saw that there will be book told from Travis Maddox pov. I'm a bit skeptical, but very curious to read about what author came up with :).
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I love this app, it seems to be working well most of the tome however, Sometimes after ive been messaging a lot, it says &quot;Cannot retrieve messaged at this time&quot; even though all my other apps are connected perfectly to my wifi. therefore I have to use the browser for twitter. This is not appriciated. Overall though its great (: well done (:
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Great price great product. Thanks to my new Sony PS LX 300usb now I can really enjoy my old vinyls once again after being stored away for many years in my attic.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Engaging book throughout most of the text.  However, I think that the author ran out of time, energy, or the will to write when it came to the ending.  Probably one of the most disappointing endings that I have ever read.
0525953728|5.0|I received this yesterday and spent the entire day reading it. Now my wife is! It gives you an up front and personal view of the SEAL life and the operation that took out UBL. I don't want to give any details away but will just say, this is a captivating book that you will not want to put down once you pick it up! I salute this fellow combat veteran!
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|This comes with high expectations and lives up to them all. Wonderful words and music and the band sounds as easy and clear as that whistle on tract one. My only negative, and it's like a -5star negative, is the $6 more you pay for the cheesy little notebook of obscure and uninteresting magazine covers. I thought it was a pocket size day planner when it fell out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Plots much like Harlan Coben's books.  Ideally ave enjoyed reading the book.  I am about three fourths done, and can not wait for the next plot twist!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Started reading it and couldn't stop. Nice transition from First Book of Hunger Games, which also let me wanting to read the third right away.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so easy to use! and it is so handy to have it on my kindle! so many great and useful pins.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is one of the most relaxing puzzle games I have ever played on any platform. The hints are generous and new obstacles are added gradually with adequate tutorial help.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book and its popularity scare me. It takes rape and abuse, dresses it up as BDSM, and calls it sexy. This isn't BDSM, and it isn't sexy.
1402270275|4.0|Wow is all I can say to this book by Bec McMaster. This is my first steampunk romance and I'm glad that I picked it up.<br /><br />McMaster creates an alternate Victorian era that is ruled by science and technology. Unlawful experimentation on humans, experiments gone wrong, blood, death, some gore are just a few of the elements in this book. The paranormal aspect incorporates vampires and werewolves: the upper class are created vampires and the werewolves are from traditional European \\"wolf\\" areas such as Scotland, Norway, and Germany. The romance is hot and emotional with characters that are strong and memorable.<br /><br />The story is about a scientific turf war between upper class London and the criminals of Whitechapel in east London. The upper class are people ruled by money and ambition who double-deal and stab their way to success in search of a way to preserve their vampiric characteristics, and to prevent themselves from turning rogue and being killed. Whitechapel is ruled mainly by the hero, an involuntarily turned vampire who is out for revenge against the upper class in general, but one duke in particular. The heroine is part of the scientific crowd that straddles both world, but she and her family have fallen on hard times due to the murder of her father.<br /><br />Just a warning that the action is fast paced and can be brutal. At times some scenes are a lot more gory than what romance readers are used to reading. Usually romance writers who write about east London just allude to how dangerous it is and toss in a few knife fights and slash injuries. However McMaster is unafraid to describe the blood and pouring entrails (in one scene). It's not a book of just blood a gore, but a warning to the squeamish reader.<br /><br />This book is a huge breath of fresh air in the stale paranormal genre and I CANNOT WAIT for McMaster's next book. I highly recommend this romance for readers who have been waiting for someone willing to really write about the darkside of London and are tired of reading paranormals where shape-shifting and drinking blood seam to be the only abnormal aspects.<br /><br />For those that are unfamiliar with steampunk (I was!) according to unreliable but readily available Wikipedia: \\"Steampunk is a genre that originated during the 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates elements of science fiction, fantasy, alternate history, horror, and speculative fiction. It involves a setting where steam power is widely used--whether in an alternative history such as Victorian era Britain or \\"Wild West\\"-era United States, or in a post-apocalyptic time --that incorporates elements of either science fiction or fantasy. Works of steampunk often feature anachronistic technology, or futuristic innovations as Victorians might have envisioned them, based on a Victorian perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art.\\"
B007NWPB4S|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter and my 5 year old daughter, love this song . They both love to sing and dance to it
1401235417|4.0|The last Batman comic I read was the Knightfall series, so it's been quite a while. I'm very familiar with the current art style for comics, and felt right at ease with The New 52's Batman. Admittedly, it was more different than I initially felt comfortable with, but the younger Bruce Wayne grew on me. I even like the new costume. It's still the same Bruce Wayne we all love, just less wrinkles on his face. He has much to learn.<br /><br />The Court of Owls is an interesting take on Batman and Gotham City. We all know how much Gotham City is desired by its villains (I wonder how the city manages to still have a large population; I'd move out), but the Court of Owls threatens the very idea that the city is Bruce's--er, sorry. Batman's.<br />With modern storytelling techniques, the narrative gives more explanation and scientific and technological explanations of bizarre and seemingly incredible experiences. We develop through the mind of Bruce, which is far more mature than his physical features, and the torment he suffers at the claws of the Court. I'm excited to see what secrets Gotham holds, and look forward to the next installment in this refreshing series.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars, but it was missing some of the videos. It's a great DVD for any Whitney fan. Made me smile watching the older videos and remembering how much fun the music was.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I CERTIFY THIS TO BE A TRUE AND ACCURATE REVIEW AS I HAVE NOT, NOR HAVE I EVER BEEN, A SOCK-PUPPET.<br /><br />I rarely do reviews. On the rare occasison I'm really blown away by something it's already garnered tons of good reviews so I feel it's redundant to throw my .02 cents in. PINES is a book however that I can't stop talking about. And you may end up that way too. ***VERY MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW***<br /><br />With a gripping premise in hand we meet our Secret Service protagonist Ethan, who starts the story in a bad way. We're immediately given a tour of a mysterious town that leaves us with far more questions than are answered. The mysteries of the town and its people grow as the main characters situation worsenes and before he's know it he's running for his life and struggling to retain his sanity.<br /><br />The questions for the protagonist are doozies: why can't he contact the outside world, why can't he leave, why are the towns people apparent psychopath's, and what the hell is making those nightmarish sounds out in the woods.<br /><br />Suggestions of possible time warps are bought in as we see characters in a different way then they were described or introduced, including a woman who came to the town a week ago...in 1985. Driven by guilt and angst from the husband and father that he was, Ethan finally does make his escape to the outside world. We're treated to a harrowing fight for survival and freedom as he faces the source of the townspeoples fear...and the source of the noises from the wood. Ultimately, he learns the stunning truth behind it all.<br /><br />I simply loved this book and plan to read it again soon to see if I missed anything the first time around. Crouch displays his masterful wordmsithing and structural expertise here, excellent execution overall. The pacing was very efficient and made PINES very hard to put down. However, some readers may not care for what they learn when the big reveal comes. Especially when the last quarter of the book is Ethan's escape. As you're watching your book read percentage on your device tick up into the 90's, you're thinking off all the monumental questions that still haven't been answered. Relax, it's coming. It was a lot to swallow, all within a few pages in the end, but I think it was very well researched, fairly plausible, and smoothly pulled off. But I'm no scientist, opinions may vary here. I will say that his denouement is no more \\"un-plausible\\" than 98% of the sci-fi novels out there and virtually every TV show or movie you've ever seen. Just let yourself be entertained here.<br /><br />In closing, if you like almost any kind of Sci-fi, suspense, horror or thriller writing I think you'll love PINES. The cross genre appeal is clearly why it's doing so well. I don't want to jinx the author, but I think this would make an incredible movie. As much as I love genre indie's, far too many just don't \\"get there\\". Crouch delivers here. Big time.
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|There is just something so heroic and powerful about this band and this album is, to me anyway, the best representation of that. Its melodic death metal based in a viking realm; What else do you need?
B008G33PMI|5.0|This is a live album for those who love live music.  Live music doesn't always have the best sound.  It can be more about the music mixed with the feeling of being there.  As one reviewer mentioned, the bass can get a bit overpowering but other than that, this is an awesome concert recording.  This is done well and Tarja sings with her usual perfection.  This is a great live set and well worth the money to enjoy.
B000SZDMES|5.0|I hemmed and hawed about getting this based on the little clips that didn't say much as well as some of the reviews.  I have to say I am so glad I bought this when the price dropped!  What an incredible trio of musicians and composers!  Stellar, absolutely stellar!!!<br /><br />After a few months, this is one of my all time favorite mp3 albums!
B008RKPC9E|5.0|A great show with lots of twists and turns and drama between the lines. Fun for all ages from teen to adults.<br /><br />Amazon's streaming leaves a lot to be desired though, much better through Itunes and Netfilx, what's up with that?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|love these quell games as they're challenging, yet serenely relaxing &amp; highly addictive that you just can't put it down till its over.. ..
B004MPESSY|5.0|There is no need for me to be a spoiler in telling you what occurred in the movie. I can say that if you like movies who take things up the next level in horror, gore, xxx, then this movie is right for you. Enjoy!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved every minute of this book! First book I've read in 10 years! Helped me get my love for reading reignited! Also spiced up the bedroom with hubby! ;) any mom looking fOr a little fantasy escape, read this book!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a good app for kindle and.......no bugs! I would recomend buying this app because it is realy fun and it gets challenging.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I purchased this book because it seemed like an unusual one and I was not disappointed.  Throughout Harold's pilgrimage he faced his past; however, his past was so expertly hidden that I didn't figure it out until the author revealed it near the end of the book.  I loved that as well as the process Harold went through during the pilgrimage because almost always I can figure out the ending of books, but not this one!  Definitely a good read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lets you see the end from the beginning.<br />It's read in the natural with spiritual discernment.<br />You'll enjoy reading the scriptures to make you wise.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|I enjoyed the first movie okay, it wasn't the greatest thing ,but it had it's moments. This follow up, for me anyhow, was not nearly as good. My biggest gripe would be the script. It just wasn't entertaining for some reason. the kid ( The Devils son) was not a cute sympathetic character you could warm up to, he was a cold little emotionless boy. Johnny Blaze did not appear as the rider nearly enough, and the film as a whole just didn't draw you in. Cage did a good job as usual, but the story just lacked something. It felt more like a sy fy channel movie than a theatrical big movie. And when the devil is plaaning the big end of the world body changing ceremony, he only had like three guys standing gaurd with guns! HE'S the DEVIL!! Wal Mart has better security than that??!!  Blaze and his partner just waltz right in the place.. WHAT??  C-mon.  I had heard that this was better than the first from alot of people, but our tastes must be miles apart.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book was excellent.  I had heard all the buzz about potential security risks with the book.  From my military experience, there was nothing tactical described that wouldn't be common knowledge to soldiers.  You would not buy this book to learn secrets...however the story is truly inspiring and the description of the Seals makes me feel very proud to be an American.  We all cannot be / nor want to be, Navy Seals, but we all can do our part to make our country safe and the world a better place to live.<br /><br />I'll be sharing this with my son to read.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Ok so I'll be honest, I saw this book a few times but never wanted to read it..the cover didn't grab me and I thought it was going to be something other than what it turned out to be. After 3 different authors I follow on FB said to check it out, I finally decided to since I didn't have any other book in my \\"to read\\" list left. And I'm so happy that I did...this book throws things at you that your not expecting, and grabs you right from the beginning. I didn't realize there was a 2nd book, so of course when I got to the end of this book and sayw the preview I had to order it right away! I read both books in 1 night, and they are both perfect. 5 starts all the way :)
B008GXHOFW|1.0|atfirst I would of given it five stars, but now after getting to the same point twice. Then it starts over on it's own, I have to say what the hell. This needs to be fixed fast. I don't have 6.99 just to throw away this is BS, I want my money back. It could of been fun, if I didn't have to keep starting over, now I'm burnt out on it. What the hell!!!!!?????
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Swinging onto Blu-Ray at last, INDIANA JONES: THE COMPLETE ADVENTURES is undoubtedly going to rank as one of the fall's must-have format releases.  Paramount's five-disc set includes the HD debuts of \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" on Blu-Ray with a fourth disc of extras and a fifth (\\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\") that some fans likely feel is best left as a beverage coaster. It's a great package that starts with new AVC encoded 1080p transfers and remixed DTS MA soundtracks of each film -- and by this point, is there any reason to re-analyze Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' legendary Saturday Matinee adventures? Each entry in the original Indy trilogy is immeasurably entertaining on its own respective merits, though fans can still quibble about which one is best.<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK thankfully still retains its original on-screen title (despite its packaging as \\"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\\"), and remains a classic of the action-adventure genre. With a smart Lawrence Kasdan script (from a George Lucas-Philip Kaufman story), classic stunts and Spielberg working at the peak of his talent, \\"Raiders\\" is pure and unadulterated fun, with Ford introducing us to the centerpiece role of his career and Karen Allen easily providing the best female love interest of the series.<br /><br />Paramount's AVC encoded transfer of \\"Raiders\\" is much more \\"contrasty\\" than I've seen the movie before - and not quite as green and \\"lush\\", especially in the early jungle sequences -- but it's also clear this new HD scan is light years ahead of any prior video release in terms of detail. I can't recall how the film originally appeared in theaters so it's entirely possible the color scheme is also more faithful to cinematographer Douglas Slocombe's theatrical version than the prior DVD releases - certainly it's an excellent transfer overall, with fine detail visible throughout. The DTS MA soundtrack is forceful and superbly engineered, offering a broad stage for John Williams' legendary score and crisp sound effects. Three original trailers are the disc's sole extras - a short teaser (selling the film on the merits of Spielberg's past blockbusters), full theatrical trailer, and a 1983 re-release trailer (from the \\"Superman\\" trailer voice-over guy) are each presented in AVC encoded 1080p.<br /><br />The first sequel (technically a prequel, even though it's a standalone adventure), INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM was controversial in its day (along with another Spielberg production, \\"Gremlins,\\" it helped create the PG-13 rating, which was initiated before the summer of '84 was out), and even now it's a nasty, violent ride compared to the other Indy adventures. The script by Lucas pals Willard Huyuck and Gloria Katz (\\"American Graffiti\\") is silly and more excessive than either \\"Raiders\\" or \\"The Last Crusade,\\" and Kate Capshaw's whiny Willie Scott is a comedown from Karen Allen's Marion -- so much so that it's tough for \\"Temple of Doom\\" not to be compared unfavorably with its predecessor. Still, the movie's final third is a blast, and John Williams' majestic, triumphant score may be his most inspired of the series: his themes for the Indy-Willie romance, Short Round's Theme, the mine cart ride, and the regal music that accompanies our heroes through the jungles of India are simply spectacular, and when combined with the original \\"Raiders March,\\" create a phenomenal underscore that effortlessly carries the audience past the sequel's lesser aspects.<br /><br />Opening with the glorious musical staging of Cole Porter's \\"Anything Goes\\" (a lavish set-piece many critics rightfully noted was one of the highlights of the entire picture), \\"Temple of Doom\\" is the most colorful of the entire series in terms of its appearance, and the Blu-Ray's impressive HD transfer looks so natural that viewers can more easily spot discrepancies in the original cinematography (particularly during the climactic rope bridge sequence) they may not have noticed before. The soundtrack is again impressive, and both the original teaser and what appears to be an early (and underwhelming) theatrical trailer (running just a minute and with a 1983 copyright) included for extras.<br /><br />The problems with the second film were rectified with the 1989 blockbuster INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, which on a surface level sounds like a \\"Raiders\\" rehash but adds a warm, richer emotional component through Sean Connery's magnetic performance as Indy's father, Dr. Henry Jones. Connery is magnificent and his interplay with Harrison Ford is amusing and poignant, giving the movie an added human dimension absent from the amusement-park action of \\"Temple of Doom\\" and matching the level of character development found in \\"Raiders.\\" John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott return from the original, and the movie entertainingly reprises the quest-styled plot of \\"Raiders\\" as Indy tries to track down his father, who was lost while searching for the Holy Grail. While \\"The Last Crusade\\" may lack the freshness of the original, it's right up there in terms of my personal fondness for the material - Connery and Ford are so good together that the film's strengths are only magnified on repeat viewing, and the lengthy opening sequence with River Phoenix as a younger Indy is a sheer delight, with a buoyant John Williams score to match.<br /><br />Paramount's 1080p transfer is in line with the \\"Raiders\\" and \\"Temple of Doom\\" discs - displaying crisp detail and a thankful lack of DNR - while the DTS MA soundtrack is again effectively engineered. Both the film's original 1988 teaser (showing the crew at work on the sequel) and full theatrical trailer are included as well.<br /><br />Shortly after INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was released, I received an email from a reader saying that I was unfairly harsh on the belated - and thoroughly unnecessary - fourth installment in the series. Frankly, after reading my original review over again, I actually don't think I was hard enough on it!<br /><br />Ranking as one of the most disposable films in director Spielberg's canon, this lightly entertaining but forgettable fantasy is compromised by a leaden David Koepp script nearly completely devoid of interesting characters, wit or innovation. While Harrison Ford still fits comfortably into his iconic role - with Indy coerced into helping a group of nefarious Russians search for an ancient relic that possesses a supernatural power - the film rolls snake eyes in terms of Cate Blanchett's villainess (one of many thankless roles), Indy's relationship with a young greaser (the continually charisma-challenged Shia LaBeouf) who needs his help finding a lost archeologist (John Hurt, playing what was likely Sean Connery's role) and his kidnapped mom -- who turns out to be none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen, wasted in a few minutes of screen time) herself.<br /><br />The film overdoses on plot exposition (the mid-section of the picture is crushingly dull, bogged down in endless babble about the skull and its power) and fails to give its terrific cast much to do. Ford is as amiable as ever but even he seems a little ill at ease with some of the leaden dialogue, which doesn't exactly crackle the way Lawrence Kasdan, Jeffrey Boam or even Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's work did in this film's far superior predecessors.<br /><br />Recalling the sluggish pacing of \\"The Lost World\\" (I cringe even writing that statement), little in Spielberg's direction clicks either: would-be comedic moments fall flat, while action scenes tend to exhibit a \\"been there, done that\\" feel at every turn. The infusion of CGI - heavily used in the movie, as it turns out -- is also in stark contrast to the prior films in the series (as is Janusz Kaminski's overly stylized cinematography, which does no favors for the picture either. It's amazing how claustrophobic and unappealing this movie looks, the bulk of it all too obviously having been shot on soundstages). Finally, the picture also greatly misses Sean Connery's warmth and humor as Indy's dad -- so much that it's unsurprising the few times \\"Indy IV\\" manages to strike an emotional chord is in its pair of direct references to Indy's late father (Connery was contacted to appear in the film but ultimately passed on it -- a wise maneuver in hindsight, particularly considering how well the third movie turned out). In the end, \\"Crystal Skull\\" commits the worst sin of all: it's completely forgettable. Five minutes after the film was over I struggled to recall the specifics of the plot or individual sequences in it, feeling as if the series truly finished with the ride off into the sunset at the end of \\"The Last Crusade.\\" Everything about this entry, ultimately, screams too little, too late.<br /><br />Paramount's HD presentation of the fourth film is on par with their prior Blu-Ray, boasting a clear 1080p AVC encoded transfer and DTS MA soundtrack. Three trailers (marked trailers 2-4) in HD round out the disc.<br /><br />Trailers aside, all the supplements are included in the fifth Bonus Features disc, which one imagines will remain exclusive to the box-set, offering a satisfying mix of previously-released content and one significant new addition. Here's a breakdown:<br /><br />On Set With Raiders of the Lost Ark: The set's big new extra is this hour-long compilation of behind-the-scenes footage from the production of \\"Raiders.\\" Taken mostly from 16mm handheld camera sources with some never-before-seen outtakes from the picture mixed with candid interviews from the cast and crew - and even a few deleted scenes - fans should love this piece, which gives viewers a real, honest sense of the day-to-day shoot, both on-location and at Pinewood Studios in the UK. (HD)<br /><br />Making The Films: The original 1981 \\"Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" fromHoward Kazanjian and Phillip Schuman (57 mins.) is presented here along with Laurent Bouzereau's retrospective documentaries for \\"Raiders,\\" \\"Temple of Doom\\" and \\"Last Crusade\\" from the 2003 DVD box-set, each offering a 40-50 minute segment devoted to each picture (all of these segments are in standard-def). The 28-minute \\"Crystal Skull\\" Making Of, meanwhile, is presented in HD (a much longer version of this Making Of was included in the original, two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film).<br /><br />Behind the Scenes: A number of featurettes from the 2003 DVD Indy box-set include a John Williams interview in \\"The Music of Indiana Jones,\\" plus \\"The Stunts of Indiana Jones,\\" \\"The Sound of Indiana Jones,\\" and \\"The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones.\\" Brought over from the 2008 DVD release are \\"Raiders: The Melting Face!\\", \\"Indiana Jones and the Creepy Crawlies,\\" \\"Travel With Indiana Jones: Locations,\\" \\"Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute,\\" and \\"Indy's Friends and Enemies.\\" Reprieved from the original \\"Crystal Skull\\" release are \\"Iconic Props,\\" \\"The Effects of Indy\\" and \\"Adventures in Post-Production.\\" Note that these \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" featurettes are presented in standard-def (the original Blu-Ray of the film offered these same segments in HD) while several other \\"Crystal Skull\\" featurettes from the prior release aren't included here at all.<br /><br />Completists who enjoy \\"Crystal Skull\\" may want to hold onto the original BD release of the film for its more extensive supplements - otherwise, this set contains basically all of the extras from the prior Indy DVD releases, sans storyboard galleries.<br /><br />Ultimately, Paramount has delivered a great-looking, and sonically superior, Blu-Ray set that pays tribute to the work of Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Douglas Slocombe, John Williams and all the other master craftspeople involved in the production of the Indiana Jones series. Highly recommended, just as one would hope!
B009329ZF2|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high for this movie after seeing the trailer, but I was disappointed by this movie.  The special effects were really good, on par with the Transformers movies.  And the basic premise of an alien race invading Earth was okay.  I found the biggest drag on the movie to be the lead actor, Taylor Kitsch, as Alex Hopper.  His role as the screwup Naval Officer was eye-rolling bad.  Where a more accomplished actor may have been able to take the role and make the audience root for him, he had me disliking the character for the whole movie.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten that this actor was also the lead in the John Carter movie.  There were, however, other actors in the movie that did really well in their roles, which saved this movie for me. I also liked the twist at the end, when they went \\"old school\\".  I would say that this movie will be enjoyed by teens and people who like their movies big, loud, and with lots of CGI action.  If that's not your cup of tea, I'd wait for a special deal on this movie.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As with all Kathy Reichs books, I could not put it down.  I am amazed at her knowledge, when<br />she writes.  I have met some authors, but not Reichs.  Will get books as they are printed.
B0052CK5PQ|4.0|If this book had included only the autobiographical sections, I'd have given it five stars, because as a memoir it's really very, very funny indeed. She has a wonderfully quirky turn of phrase. However, all the other stuff gets a bit didactic and heavy. She seems to have a complete obsession with porn for one thing, which I can't quite fathom.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|I recently saw this movie for the first time. It was excellent. I was glued to the screen. The performances were stellar. Loved the way the foreign dialogue was not subtitled. It really added to the sense of cultural confusion. And the America portrayed in the film was the real America, not the sugar coated version we get in so many movies and TV shows. We saw how money aka capital protects itself by waging war against the working class. How the working class is divided along ethnic grounds so that U.S. workers can never fight back, as Engels predicted over a century ago.<br /><br /> After the film was done, I tried to imagine what critics of 1980 hated so much about it. All I could come up with is that the America that elected Ronald Reagan in 1980 did not want to shatter the myth of the American west. Cowboy diplomacy sounded good to them after the failure in Vietnam.<br /><br />I recall a history professor in college who should have known better declaring that he was a social liberal but an economic conservative. That was in 1979. Now that we have seen what \\"economic conservatives\\" have wrought---<br /><br />---voodoo, trickle down economics<br /><br />----class warfare between the rich and everyone else, with everyone else pitted against each other in the classic \\"divide and conquer\\" strategy that has made a handful of businessmen god awful rich<br /><br />----bloody imperialism as Americans wage war in third world countries for the natural resources that we seem to believe are rightfully ours, none of this new, of course, just a recycling of the America that lead Gen. Smedley Butler to write \\"War is a racket\\"<br /><br />----a country that let its best and brightest die because AIDS was God's curse against gays (and because straight versus gay is another way you can divide the working class for profit)---<br /><br />---now that we have lived the nightmare that was Reagan-Bush-Bush-Bush (with a brief Clinton-Clinton intermission), I think that the critics' snubbing of this film was an early warning that we were heading down the same path as those cattlemen. And look where it has gotten us.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I love the Holmes stories, always entertaining even if you're re-reading them for the tenth time! This edition is quite good, and includes some illustrations, but I did spot a few formatting glitches. While there's nothing that's a deal-breaker, they're still a little annoying. However, overall, this is a value for money edition.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Negatives:<br />(1.) Bad science (and for people who don't care, \\"What a reflection!\\") right off the bat with the idea of increasing the strength of transmission by 5x to \\"Planet G\\" which has nothing to do with how long it takes for EM to arrive anywhere in the Universe - it all travels the same speed no matter what the strength of the signal. The poorly researched stupid idea that the alien craft were not composed of any elements known in the periodic table (therefore anywhere in the Universe) except the does-not-make-sense, manmade, and always radioactive - very short life, Lawrencium. Alien craft construction that defies everything known about physics; both the time to receive the initial transmission and physically travel (they were just waiting for that random signal) should have taken decades if not hundreds or more years - not a few months that the movie indicated for the whole shebang. The aliens must have had their space craft idling at the curb for millions of years waiting for that one transmitted signal so they could jump right on it.<br />(2.) Usual dorky, nerdy weird scientists. Usual '80s style Pac-man graphics to show some really stupid triangles representing aliens traveling through a grade school background of our solar system. A '50s scify bubble force field -  whoopee, not likely! The aliens Mi34 rotating mingun style battery grenade launchers seemed more appropriate to WWI - just dumb!<br />(3.) Usual dialogue for 9th grade drop-out fans of this stuff like Goldilocks paranoia (mistake to invite just anybody into your house), aliens stolen from \\"Predator\\" and other old scify pushing the cowboys vs. indians stereotype.<br />(4.) Usual hooks of lost guy finds himself in time to save the world motif; bar hopping alcohol with hot chicks; lots of military hardware (representing an insecure tuff guy cultural mentality); usual military cooperation showcasing publicity budget - RIMPAC.<br />(5.) Usual bad acting with the obligatory one or two film \\"minority\\" representations all in one shot with Rihanna representing both African-Americans and females. Liam Neeson continues his acting decline of junk performances for quick money e.g. his two previous performances were just as bad - \\"The Grey\\" & \\"Wrath of the Titans\\".<br /><br />Positive:<br />Studios are increasingly investing in cheap, mostly overseas, CGI to produce movies. The positive? Newer, algorithm crunching, computer processors and lots of low cost animators will produce graphics that are better than the year before and thus continue to impress us, but ...
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Even though it was a bit rough at times, she said the story was quite good.  It also helped settings the mood easier...  That is worth a few stars on its own
B005Q1W10A|1.0|The show itself is great and we are enjoying the series, but unfortunately the DVD disks were damaged when they arrived, with significant skipping and tracking issues. Since we have already opened it, I'm not sure if we can return it.  It is too bad - we were enjoying the show.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|In short, if you are looking for a high-action movie with fantastic special effects featuring giant robots pummeling and shooting one another, you can't do much better than this. The story is spotty, the characters exagerated, and everything is completely unrealistic, but that's not what you're watching this movie for, right? It's a decent action movie, but it isn't great.
0345803485|2.0|This book is a big disappointment.  I don't mind raging sex as part of a story, but where is the story?  I got about half way through the book and stopped reading from sheer boredom.  This is not my kind of reading, and I should have read the reviews before I bought it (on impulse).  If you love raging, kinky sex and really get turned on reading about it, this book is for you.  Otherwise, try something with a story and some action to go with it, besides the sex.

030758836X|5.0|Nick & Amy.<br /><br />Two young aspiring writers who managed to find each other and who fell in love during warm summer nights, silly weekend trips and who bonded over all the whimsy and fun that NY offered them. Fast forward to their five year wedding anniversary and Nick is a mess and Amy nowhere to be found...<br /><br />Gone Girl is a story about a marriage that is hijacked buy something twisted, a need to play and make people learn their lessons. It's a highly intelligent and witty story with more plot contortions and turns than a labyrinth in the middle of a grand garden. I was surprised with myself when it ended that I still rooted for one character over the other, you think you know them but you don't ( just like with people in real life) and as with all books the reader will add his own personality to the enjoyment of the outcome.<br /><br />The writing style and the content reminded me of my favorites; Kate Christensen, Jennifer Egan, Greg Iles and some Hitchcock thrown it, the book will punch you in the gut and smack your in the chin and tell you to keep reading or else.. I had a blast diving into this story every time I opened the book and it's tales like this one that stay on my mind longer, parts of it cling inside and come up every once in a while when I rethink my favorite reads. I don't suggest that everyone jumps on the popular book band wagon because I don't really care about that status, read what speaks to you and if you love it then great, but I see people read it only to bash it with glee because it is popular, and that's just sad. Hating books because they are popular and wanting to rip them apart is more psycho than the actual characters in this book ... just saying!<br /><br />- Kasia S.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I don't know what people expect a Joe Walsh album to sound like, but after all these years I find Analog Man to be a typical Joe Walsh album. He spent a little more money on backing personnel, but the lyrics are typical Joe, and so is the music. It's an album any Joe Walsh fan should be very familiar and comfortable with. Maybe the detractors aren't really JW fans at all? Maybe they thought this would be a \\"Joe Walsh does an Eagle album without the Eagles\\"? No, this is a Joe Walsh album, pure and simple, and it's great to hear.

B007TML4EI|4.0|I was lucky enough to get this app for free the other day from Amazon. It runs well on my Galaxy S III (though it has, infrequently, crashed when loading). The puzzles are interesting and, since I'm no engineer, occasionally frustrating. But in a good way.<br /><br />I think this game would be tedious on a phone smaller than the Galaxy (as it is, sometimes placing a beam ranges from tricky to annoying).<br />However, I now have it for my iPad (it was free on iTunes last I checked), which is much easier. I'd hazard that the experience would be similar for an Android tablet.<br /><br />What I really like: I find that when I think I've tried everything and decide to do something goofy, that's what usually works. My solution to stopping a locomotive was, I think, the most bizarre thing I've done that worked.<br /><br />Final word: Good game. Makes you think.

I don't think my wife would find it of any interest.<br /><br />Not only does the book cover in detail Steve Jobs from his early childhood and the creation of Apple but also has strong references to Bill Gates, Microsoft, HP, IBM and Xerox.<br /><br />For me, worth the read....so far.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I put this book down several times before I eventually forced to myself to finish it - and only because a few friends were raving about it, and saying it gets better towards the end. Well let me tell you, it doesn't get any better! It's probably the most boring book I've ever read. It was simply some badly written dialogue and back and forth email conversation interspersed between unsexy sex scenes. The plot was virtually non-existent and the characters superficial, contradictory and lacking in depth. This author really has no idea how to write. I'm actually wondering whether English is her second language because there were so many words used completely out of context, and it left me wondering whether she actually understands their meaning. She also repeated descriptive words and sentences dozens of times throughout the book, sometimes several times on the same page! For example, none of the characters in the book speak normally, they either `murmur' `mutter' or `whisper'. For every single conversation! They also `roll their eyes', `bite their lips' and `set their mouths in hard lines' a lot. I think the author came up with around 10 sentences and then randomly inserted them into the book to fill up 50% of it. She also seemed to pull out some `big' words directly out of the thesaurus and then use them repetitively for around 10 pages, and then stop using them entirely, and then move onto another word. I completely disliked the main characters, they felt like empty, two-dimensional cartoon people, that I simply couldn't connect with on any level. A CEO of a company who never spends any time working - in fact we never even find out what his business does. Christian is supposed to be 26 but when reading the book you get the image of someone much much older. He listens to opera for goodness sake! And when he wasn't listening to music and playing his piano, he was stalking the younger, virginal college student. I found him to be incredibly creepy, unsexy and paedophile-like. He apparently has ginger hair, a hairy chest, long fingers and cigarette burns all over him - sorry, not my cup of tea! And then there's Ana.. the plain, uninteresting college student who Christian pursues. She routinely listens to voices in her head (`inner goddess' wtf?!) and likes classic literature and drinking tea. Sounds like a barrel of laughs, no wonder she was a virgin until she met Christian. She literally is a `nothing'. You do not get any sense of who she is or what she's about, even after finishing the book. The author also writes her character in a contradictory way...one minute she's so shy that she cannot even look at Christian without blushing, and the next minute she's challenging him in a confident manner. She doesn't make any sense as a human being. If I met someone like that I would assume they had split personality disorder. As if someone of Christian's status (and apparent `hotness') would have any interest in her. Sorry, but that's not the way the real world works. The entire book has sex scenes scattered throughout it, which are as boring and repetitive as the rest of the book. They did not float my boat one bit. Christian comes across as predatory, and Ana as much-too-young and inexperienced. It read like a 50 year old school teacher trying to take advantage of his 15 year old student. I for one will not be purchasing book 2 and 3, and will be deleting this one from my Kindle.like.

0955729319|5.0|OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE CONSTRUCTION BAR AS WELL AS CIVIL ENGINEERS AND ARBITRATORS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As someone who originally qualified as a civil engineer before being called to the Bar later in life, the author, Daniel Atkinson, is very well placed to share his varied experience and expertise (acquired over the course of a forty year career) in this important work on construction law.<br /><br />With \\"Issues in Construction Law\\", Atkinson identifies the relevant practical problems that arise from construction practice, as well as the essential legal principles in order to provide answers to questions of the formation, terms and interpretation of contracts.<br /><br />It's predictable, therefore, that the book focuses on contracts, because, as is pointed out in the Preface, most disputes in construction law raise questions, first, of whether there is a contact and if there is one, what are its terms and what is the meaning of those terms.<br /><br />Having been involved in dispute resolution across the full range of engineering disciplines in some 9 countries including the UK, Daniel Atkinson takes the approach of a construction lawyer who actually knows how things are constructed, from marine and offshore facilities to roads, bridges, tunnels and buildings.<br /><br />From what we can gather, the book contains virtually everything you need to know about contracts within the construction industry.  Within its almost 500 pages and over six detailed chapters the author covers such issues as the formation of construction contracts... formality, incorporation by reference... and incomplete express agreement.<br /><br />As you would expect, the longest chapters are on implied terms and interpretation of contracts.  In the latter chapter there is, to cite only one example, a particularly intriguing reference to `business common sense and absurdity'. Designed to interpret what a contract really means, the assumption here is that words are (or should be) interpreted in a way in which a reasonable commercial person would construe them.'  A number of important cases are cited elaborating on this point, some warning that, like it or not, `judges are not always the most commercially minded... (or) commercially experienced of people'.<br /><br />In essence, the approach taken in this particular volume is to indentify information that the construction lawyer or other interested party, would need in order to apply the principles of construction law to practical problems.<br /><br />To this end, frequent reference is made to decided cases. The fifteen pages containing the Table of Cases lists all cases cited therein, cross referring them to the relevant pages in the text.<br /><br />There is also a useful index at the back for further ease of use.  The book therefore will be extremely useful to anyone involved in construction disputes, including arbitrators and mediators, as well as lawyers.  The publication date is cited as at July 2012.contract really means, the assumption here is that words are (or should be) interpreted in a way in which a reasonable commercial person would construe them.'

B001J9EHSC|5.0|Tidal, Fiona's first album, was the epitome of her career.  It was Fiona at her absolute best.  This had the smash hit \\"Criminal\\" on it, and the entire album is nothing but pure good for those who enjoy piano-driven songs.  It can be a little dark, both lyrically and sonically, which is a turn-on for some people and a turn-off for others.  Bottom line: If you're a fan of Tori Amos, I believe that you'll be a fan of Fiona Apple as well.

Lauren Oliver has taken that idea and developed a world that believes that it is. In this world love (otherwise known as \\"amor deliria nervosa\\") is the cause of everything bad. Once they discovered this, they developed and perfected a \\"cure\\" to be given so that all can \\"be happy and safe forever\\". Yet not everyone is safe from love since the cure cannot be performed unless you're 18. It hasn't been made safe for anyone younger. So until then, there's a chance they may catch the \\"deliria\\". To keep everyone who has been cured and those who haven't from catching the disease or spreading it, everything is watched closely by the government to ensure the safety of their people. The \\"uncured\\" youth go to separate schools, and so on.<br /><br />Enter Lena Haloway, 95 days away from getting cured. She's been looking forward to this for a long time. She's been preparing for the day she turns 18, preparing for her planned future. Then she meets Alex, and everything changes. In those final days before the procedure, she begins to learn about the other side of the spectrum. It causes her to question the reasonableness of the regulations around her, the ones she grew up trusting and believing in. She's torn between the two worlds: the one she's always known, the one where love is gone forever, and the one outside the fence, the one where love is embraced.<br /><br />This book was enthralling. Lauren Oliver has an amazing voice. You know those books that keep you up at night, the ones that you cannot stop thinking about for weeks? This is one of them. Lena's story is gripping and it stays with you for awhile.<br /><br />Delirium is book one of a trilogy. The second book will be released next February. I'm marking my calendar.<br /><br />My Rating:<br /><br />Exceptional: Stay up until at least 1 AM<br />My Rating:<br /><br />Exceptional: Stay up until at least 1 AM

The two player ends up being the most fun, while the four player doesn't really work as well (though that could be a result of all of us being beginners). The good thing is it's easy to pick up and the games take 10-20 minutes. Which is short but sweet.

B0086449YA|3.0|Mark Knopfler's big album launch date came and went with no availability. No digital downloads. Physical copies listed as overpriced \\"imports\\" that are \\"out of stock.\\" You can't even download it from Amazon UK, thanks to \\"international sales restrictions\\" imposed by, I'm guessing, Knopfler and/or his label.<br /><br />This seems for all the world like a poorly-conceived roll-out strategy, and it won't work. It's only likely to encourage pirate downloads from fervent fans and loss of interest from casual fans. Too bad, too, because the album is probably good. Then again, who knows? Even reviewers can't seem to get their hands on it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bob Dylan, who's headlining with Knopfler on tour, also released a new album today and it's selling for five bucks on Amazon!  (I hate to use exclamation points when I write but I couldn't end the last sentence with a period.) If I were Bob, I'd be tweaked that my supporting act was holding out for $20 for an \\"import\\" that wasn't available by digital download on the eve of our tour when my album, which is doing well critically, could be had for a measly five dollars. I might even try to get Elvis Costello to warm up for me instead of Knopfler.<br /><br />I'm a huge Mark Knopfler fan. But an album should be available on Amazon and iTunes on the announced launch date. Period. This bait and switch is unbecoming for an artist of Knopfler's integrity.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is one of the best Comedy Series of the past.  The price was perfect for the whole Series.  Picture quality was a little grainy but it does not take away from the comedy effect of each episode.  I just used an empty CD/CVD spiral case to put each DVD in upside down after I watched it.  The first night I got the Married with Children Package I was up until 3AM in the morning watching the first two seasons.  There were a few episodes that I must have missed when they were originally on TV.  It was like finding a hidden treasure of comedy.  Great Series and Great Price.

B000001DQI|5.0|One of the best albums of Elton John's career, containing many of his most memorable hit songs, as well as a number of lesser known gems. Taupin's lyrics are poignant and remain relevant today, John's melodies are fantastic and Dudgeon's production is top notch.<br /><br />Highlights include Candle in the Wind, Bennie and the Jets, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting.<br /><br />The only criticism that could be laid against the album is that there may be a few too many songs, but for me, the more the better.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|I cannot find that anyone has commented on the audio quality.  My question is about the audio format.  Does it have a 5.1 surround sound track?  How about a 7.1 audio track?  I would hope that by now, the USA Blu-ray productions audio would finally catch up to the magnificent European productions that contain 7.1 DTS Master audio.<br /><br />I realize that the description by Amazon lists the audio as DTS 5.1 HD.  My experience (sad to say) is that this info is not always accurate.  I am hoping to get a confirmation from someone who has played the Blu-ray disc.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|The title \\"Last of a dyin' breed\\" is the most accurate album title I've seen in years.  With the first song this album gives a good swift kick and doesn't let up. Even after all the probems that have plagued this band, they still keep going and (seemingly)getting better.  The \\"Dying breed\\" in question (I think) is the dwindling number of bands who can write good songs, and play REAL instruments instead of drum machines and rhythm tracks. When groups like skynyrd, aerosmith, and the stones are gone we will be stuck with a bunch of no talent fools who would be more comfortable making their music on a computer rather then bothering to learn how to play an instrument.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Since I have been reading a lot of contemporary fiction with unsatisfactory endings lately, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  (I was surprised how the book turned about halfway through, as well.)  Flynn cleverly winds up the tale while staying true to the characters, as well as leaving open a possible sequel.<br /><br />For those who need to \\"like\\" the characters in order to enjoy a novel, maybe look elsewhere.  The dark humor in this one is its best feature but can easily be misunderstood by people looking to connect with one of the characters.  It's hard to say more without giving too much away so I'll just say if you loved the movie \\"The Last Seduction,\\" this book is for you.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob Dylan has been making music for over 50 years, and some will argue the 71 year old has seen better days.  Has he?  Oh yeah, the voice is shot, and the distinctive whine of his vocals is a thing of the past.  His last release was somewhat of an embarrassing, Christmas collection!  Having said that, I will tell you, that Bob Dylan still has a story to tell, and his latest release \\"Tempest\\", is right up there with some of his modern day critically acclaimed releases like \\"Love & Theft\\", and \\"Modern Times\\".  The opening tune, \\"Duquesne Whistle\\", is typical of Dylan's current sound, as the band kicks in with a moving shuffle, that will make the listener snap their fingers to the raspy vocal of Dylan.  Only Bob Dylan would release a 10 minute plus \\"Tempest\\", and not repeat a verse, as he tells the story of the epic Titanic disaster.  Almost every tune clocks in at over 5 minutes, because this man is not and has never been your typical three verse pop songster.  He sings about John Lennon, and Roman kings, and is not shy about violent lyrics, which makes a few songs, some of the darkest he has ever written.  If you truly liked \\"Love & Theft\\", and \\"Modern Times\\", this release is a must for any Dylan fan.  No, this isn't \\"I Want You\\", \\"Just Like A Woman\\" or \\"Mr.Tambourine Man\\", but it is modern day Bob Dylan who is one of the last of his generation who is still standing, and proving an iconic musical poet, does not necessarily, need that old voice to tell his stories.
B000060P79|5.0|This is the only cd I've ever had of Simple Plan's and I have listened to each song countless times over the past 10 years. I was 9 when my older brothers introduced me to this cd, and still at 19 I am finding new ways to relate and reminisce.<br /><br />With all of the other music aimed at teens, this cd expresses a timeless, universal look at what it is like to grow up which transcends genders and ages alike. It doesnt talk about texting or tweeting or ipods, ect.<br /><br />It talks about love, loss, pride, loneliness, disapproval of parents, hope, apologies, forgivenes, ect.<br />it talks about relationships whether it be romantic, parental or friendship. (and they songs are not always bound to one type- a favorite song of mine is 'meet you there' which is most likely written about a girl, but when i listen to it, i feel like its me singing to my mom who died)<br /><br />they do all this in fun catchy punky rock songs as well as softer more heartfelt rock. very easy and enjoyable to listen to!<br /><br />This is a great music companion to any tween or teen/young adult out there regardless of sex/gender/sexuality/race. it can help get you through the tough times!

I have watch it over and over again  and every time I find it more amazing, because you don't really know if this is a sex movie, if it's a detective movie or if it's a movie about the Psichotic claustrophobia felt by the main character. The movie is brillantly handled because it's full of surprises right up until the end, when the truth comes out.<br /><br />It is such an interesting movie that I just bougth the DVD for my son who's want become a criminologist. Also I wanted to watch the cool music video inside the movie featuring Frankie Goes to Hollywood, an important music group from the 80's.<br /><br />Melany Griffith performs real well in all the scenes, incluiding some nude ones.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob's album is mysterious and dark, and bloody. Some reviews have quibbled with the length of the title song (13:55), but I am here to say that this song alone is one of his best songs, and I've been with him for 48 of his 50 years of recording.  He once promised that the Titanic sails at dawn, and brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, hearken to this gentle waltz through hell on earth, or in this case, on the sea. Dylan's humanity and brilliant story telling, the still amazing rhymed couplets, the uncanny ability to paint a cohesive narrative from disparate images-- all of this is here.  It is a journey through the ten songs down a dangerous and deadly path.  Thanks Bobby, thanks for shining a light on our mortality, our struggle for meaning when there can be none.

B005GFPZYK|3.0|This is definitely a decent bookbook, and it is well written. I guess you only downside for me, and what other people also said, is that Kyle doesn't go into much detail about his individual kills. Rather, the book is more of an overall description of Marine and SEAL operations in Iraq. There are some personal experiences written about, but they are usually quite shortshort and only a page or two long. I also thought the excerpts written by his wife were a little out of place and boring for this type of book. But, it was still a good read about a great soldier and what he did during the war.

0984999302|5.0|Recently I read the book Lean Startup and said ... That's it! Well Startup Owners Manual goes beyond ... Following the instructions, because it is really a manual, you just misses the modeling of your business if the idea is not what you imagine and you insist, or the execution is really poor, because this book gives the correct recipe to test hypotheses that you had not even imagined. Not everyone has great ideas (or luck) as Zuckerberg, Larry Page or Jeff Bezzos, so if you do not want to take an unnecessary risk, read before ordering investments or leave your current job!

B00001X591|3.0|I first became acquainted with Albinoni's Op. 9 concertos about forty years ago through an Erato release featuring I Solisti Veneti under the direction of Claudio Scimone. I've since acquired those performances on compact disc and listen to them partly out of nostalgia but also because of their energy and, well, because Albinoni's music is fabulous stuff. The more recent recordings by Simon Standage and company - on original instruments - employ at least four Chandos discs to cover even more of the composer's concerto output while sharing the measured vivacity of the older Scimone recordings. I approached this set by Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music anticipating that I'd hear the same or even more spirit but, sadly, I was a bit disappointed. I'm not sure whom to fault, but these recordings to my untrained ear don't generate the same excitement as the other two do. Weaker, subdued, shy and retiring - those are subjective, metaphorical descriptions I'd used to characterize this collection. The performances are certainly not bad, just to my mind not as inspired. I'm not sure about the current availability of the Scimone, so I'd recommend the Standage recordings, which as I said offer more concerto sets but do spread the Op. 9 pieces across more than one disc.
B0090EIILU|4.0|Really bad humor in some parts, the kind not many would laugh at. But it is supposed to be over the top and offend everyone, in a joking manner. Hey, if we can't laugh at this crazy world sometimes, then we are in trouble. Some real truths in the movie about the deceptions in the world that well, almost everyone knows now. Which is good. Some reality about how backwards some remote areas of the world are due to being isolated and in old beliefs, and obviously some things are meant to be overly dramatic and not real, just like our media and world news. But you really want to keep watching, it is funny, strange and, well, just ignore the really off parts, and enjoy this off the cuff view of things going on in the world. I love it when a movie has parts in it that pretends it does't know about, but are in your face truths, like this one does.
B008Y2IU12|3.0|This movie was well scripted and visually beautiful. I liked the darker story line too. I think that Charlize Theron did a great job as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth did a great job as the strong and rugged huntsman. But Kristin Stewart can not act. That women had the same frozen poker face throughout the film. Whether she was suppose to be scared, happy, hurt or fighting, she just had this blank, frozen, straight face without any expression. She can't act at all and I think she ruined the movie. There is no way to relate to this woman's character of Snow White. If she were over 50, I would think that she got too many Botox injections. Her face does not move. Too bad they didn't use a different actress. This could have been a great film with the right actress.

0743297334|4.0|Reading this novel was like taking an extended vacation back in time, to France and Spain. Though it is written like a detailed diary in a stream of consciousness style, it felt as if I was with the group of Americans and British who ventured from the artsy and partying of Paris in the 1920s on a road trip to Spain. And like being with a group on vacation, the story can at times test your patience. However, I found myself feeling as if I was experiencing the sensations, emotions, sights, smells, as if I was really with them.<br /><br />There is more to the story than travel though; as the drama and sexual tension of the characters - who are in their 20s and 30s - makes for unpredictable swings from one scene to the next. Told from the point of view of the American journalist character, Jake Barnes, the characters and settings seem unsettlingly real, and the travel journey gives way to the ups and downs of their individual journeys through life.

0345803485|1.0|Im a huge fan of erotica seeing as im single good looking 25 year old female. Kept hearing all the hype that I should put my cowboys down and pick up these books about Christian. Biggest mistake in my life. Granted I read 2.5 of the books, I still found no reason for the hype. Its atrociously written with everything sounding like a prepubescent girl wrote this. Ive read better sex scenes written and more s&m in Anne Rice or Laurell K Hamilton books making the sex in these look mundane. Character development is low when the potential for it and story plot were so unlimited. Everyone is falling in love on first sight, blushing, flushing and unbelievable. Not to mention the bad guy in books 2 and 3 is so predictable. I felt so betrayed by reviews I had to go reread the Anita Blake series just to feel better about books. Twilight has destroyed American culture in fooling everyone into ignorant poorly written stories being glamorous and mind blowing. Its appalling.<br /><br />Characters- 1 star, she tried to be creative but failed on instant gratification, shallowness, and the fact Christian is a self-made Billionaire at 26 who falls in love with a 21yo college student. *rolls eyes* The only thing believable is Christians dysfunction and childhood story.<br /><br />Plot-1 star, it got my hopes up starting out with a college student doing an interview but got less believable as it went. Non-reporter college students cant take each other's place, a billionaire wouldnt ok an interview with a college. Not to mention countless other things that eventually leading to him giving up his s&m lifestyle for her.<br /><br />Writing- 1 star. Seriously. A sixteen year old could write better then this. I wasnt drawn in at any time during reading these. I dont know how people couldnt put it down, I couldnt pick it back up. Books this length take me 17-24 hours to read. This took me 1 week- not because i got busy but because i kept having to force myself to read. 2.5 of these books took me 3.5 weeks and I didnt even finish book 3 because by the first chapter i had the rest of the book pegged.me 3.5 weeks and I didnt even finish book 3 because by the first chapter i had the rest of the book pegged.

B0076UXKDG|1.0|Come on, Nikon. This accessory is virtually identical (and probably should be identical) to the MB-D11 for the F7000, which sells for half the price. How do you think you can retain customers by gouging them this way?
B000XVSU9O|5.0|I can't help but feel peace and love after reading this book. It is so beautiful and if you are a skeptical type of being I still recommend this book, as you will get something out of it. Even if it's something small. This book makes you want to love, be nice, caring, and help others around you. I also feel a great sense of peace knowing that I will be with our Lord and Savior one day in a very peaceful & loving way. For me, it has given me a great understanding of people around me and what their purpose is, which I have questioned. I now have a much better understanding. I say give a try. It's a quick read, I read it in only a few hours. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did. God Bless

B0036WHM1E|5.0|I came upon Angus and Julia's music via a website offering a \\"first listen\\" of Julia's solo CD, By the Horns.  I liked that so much that I looked her up and found that she also sings with Angus.  That led me to this CD.  The songs are beautiful and sung with such passion.  I've tried to listen to other new music I have, but I keep coming back to this.  The more you play it, the more you will love it.  I also highly recommend Angus' solo CD, Broken Brights.  Solo and together, their CDs are great.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This is the first AmazonBasics product that I'm less than 100% satisfied with. I originally was looking for a new screen protector for my recently replaced phone, but decided to get a new AmazonBasics case to replace the one one I had.<br /><br />So.. 2 reviews in 1.<br /><br />The screen protector - 5/5 stars.<br />If you use align the screen protector as you want it before removing the peels, then tape one side like a hinge, it takes 1 easy attempt to apply. So 5/5 for ease that way. The screen protector was a millimeter smaller than the full edge of the phone which is what I wasn't thrilled with. I was hoping for end to end coverage. Otherwise, its perfect.<br /><br />The Protective Case. - 4 stars<br />I had a previous rubberized Amazon Basics case which I loved. It just got a bit lose from being taken off/on the phone at various times. The case is much sturdier, which I like. All the ports are accessible. The big drawback for me is that the edges need to be sanded. While a small issue, the edges are sharp plastic. I'll be sanding this when I have some time. I feel a bit more care could have gone into this case to ensure its easy/painless to hold. The case also takes a bit of finessing to get onto the phone. I was a bit worried about breaking it, but it turned out fine.<br /><br />A big difference between the rubberized case and this one is comfort. The rubberized case is easy and nice to hold. It also wouldn't slip or move when on a surface like a car dash or a desk. The TPU case is slick, which looks nice, but combined with the sharp edges, makes it a bit tougher to hold.<br /><br />After a couple weeks, I'll re-evaluate to see if I will switch back.
B002DEPJB6|5.0|I loved the show from the first episode, and this season is perfect viewing if you've never watched the show or you want to reacquaint yourself with it.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie!  I went to see it 3 X in the theater.  Pay no mind to the jealous men's reviews.  Awesome, steamy movie!  I have it on pre-order and would order more than one copy to give out as gifts if I had more money!  LOL!
B001D2AYCI|5.0|Black Sabbath's Paranoid was reissued as a deluxe version in 2009 as a three disc set. Disc one contain the original album newly remastered and it sounds better than ever! I'd put it on par with the Black Box remaster from 2004 at least, though it does sound slightly better I believe personally. Disc two contains the 1974 Quadraphonic Mix as DVD audio, and I have yet to listen to it as of yet. Disc three contains 8 previously unreleased bonus tracks, it contains instrumentals of War Pigs, Iron Man, Electric Funeral, Hand of Doom, and Fairies Wear Boots, the other three bonus tracks are Paranoid with alternate lyrics, Rat Salad with an alternate mix and Planet Caravan with alternate lyrics as well. This release is in digipak format and has two disc trays that hold disc's one and two and disc three goes inside the cardboard/paper flap. (though I wish they wouldn't have done this as it can scratch the disc) The booklet included is also quite expansive and includes many photos I've never seen and a cool story as well. This release is only available as an import, which sucks, but if you don't want to pay the upwards of $30 for the album, I recommend looking around and finding a lower price, believe me, they are out there. Overall a great release of a classic album, highly recommended!<br /><br />*The only thing to be careful of is that there is a sticker alongside the bottom of the CD and it wraps around the back (on some editions) and if you aren't careful it may rip off part of the front and back covers (as it did mine) so I just left it on.

B001QC9PSO|4.0|What's to be said about the TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES? First there was the underground comics published by Mirage Comics. Then we got the immensely popular 1987 Fred Wolf cartoon which put the Turtles on the map. Then came a series of arcade and video games. Then there were toys, cereal, bed sheets, pajamas and a whole lot of other merchandise. Then in 1990, we were given the first feature length movie which solidified the popularity of the Turtles. This film, released just a year later, is its sequel. It builds on the continuity of the original film but due to parental complaints and outcry over the violence of the first film, the tone is more light-hearted. It borrows the mood of the popular cartoon series and amps up the comedy. Many of the actors in the original film are missing or are replaced. Elias Koteas as Casey Jones was part of the charm of the first film, but sadly he is absent in this one. He is seemingly replaced by a made up character for this movie, Keno, played by Ernie Reyes Jr. April O'neal gets less screen time in this film than she did in the first and is also played by a different actress. The focus of the plot is switched from The Shredder and the Foot Clan to the origin of the ooze that mutated the turtles as well as an ongoing battle with a mutated wolf and snapping turtle. Very fun film. More of a cartoon than the first but still fun! 4 out of 5 stars!
B0053O89WY|5.0|In response to \\"Mskrisklark\\"s review stating the need to \\"stick up for Star Trek\\" fans....Im lost.....If anyone needs sticking up for in regards to this show in this context it's star wars fans. Theres really very little reference to it, esp. compared to Trek. I count, on average, some Star Trek reference once every two episodes or so. And every one is GLORIOUS. I am a huge Trek fan and hate star wars but it does also make sense....Star Trek is much more about science and scientific ideas than the fantasy-in-space long,long ago far away of star wars. From Nimoy to Spiner to Wheaton to Takei to Levar Burton {who I met recently}, this is cleary a Trek show!!!!<br /><br />In regards to ssn 5 specifially there's no real dip in quality. The progression of the Sheldon/Amy relationship was interesting. The wedding was ok but there was nothing particulary compelling about it. Same for the howard as an astroaunt arc. It made sense in the progression of the series though.<br /><br />In the end, a fine chapter to add to the Big Bang dvd collection. Really as good more or less than any of the other seasons with plenty of stand out moments.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was looking for a game to play for some spare time fun. I had never played solitaire before so I thought I would give it a try. It is so much fun and very easy to learn. I love how you just touch the card and it moves to position so you don't have to drag it. If I get stumped I can click on hints and it will show me some more moves avail or indicate that no more moves are available. Since this is a free app you get an advertisement with each game that is annoying, but there is a skip button that is nice. I would recommend this fun game!!
B008OHV5HS|5.0|This album has some similarity of Extinct Instinct & Dead Reckoning. Has melody throughout and Damian returns with a good blend of melody and range. The album starts off with the song \\"Ashes\\" which is a awesome tune and a return to how they began in some sort of way. This album marks a return following Mac's death which was very sad. They came right back instead of bringing in a new singer (what most bands do nowadays), instead they brought back Damian Wilson which was cool cause his 2 albums with them were epic and extraordinary. Threshold is one of my all time favorite bands and this album is a sure fire hit with cool songs. Other great song from the album are \\"Staring At The Sun\\" and \\"The Return Of The Thought Police\\".
0307592731|4.0|Rivetting book.  A different \\"recovery\\" story as told from her perspective of a compelling search for herself and her need to escape personal demons.  The physical discomforts of the hike are set against the backdrop of the beauty of the Pacific Crest.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Love this movie, big fan of Dr. Seuss since childhood and now even as an adult love his humor and view of society!  Quick, witty, colorful and entertaining.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I had never read a book narrated by a 5 year old boy but thought it very interesting in how a child sees his world. It doesn't seem to matter to Jack that his world is just a small room and a loving Ma. Children grow where they are planted. I could understand his fear of the real world.
B000ID37T0|4.0|Al Pacino at his best.  Chris O'Donnell was a relative newcomer at the time this movie came out (1992), but the dynamics between the two actors was brilliantly performed. The dance scene between Pacino and a young Gabrielle Anwar was mesmerizing.  Language not for the faint of heart, but by today's standards, probably tame!
B008E374T0|5.0|For fans of The Gaslight Anthem or those who have never heard a Gaslight song in their life, this album is a must own for ANY rock and roll fan. Highly recommended.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|...stars for this app! Works perfectly. Best I've seen for Picasa Web. And in order to fufill the 20-word requirement...more words.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|There's no need to introduce Iron Maiden. They are easily recognizable worldwide and their career has seen the release of (as of now) 15 studio albums. The unlucky thirteen is Dance of Death, but it's not as unlucky as the ominous number might lead us to believe.<br /><br />Dance of Death is a great mixture of the best selling points the Maiden guys have to offer. As most of their recent records, they have altered their sound to make chords more prominent, and thus the end result delivers a heavier tone than earlier albums, which tended to sound more brightly (think of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"The Number of the Beast\\", songs that really a lot more on single string plucking than chords).<br /><br />If you're the Maiden fan that relies on the more immediately accessible and shorter singles and catchy songs, \\"Wildest Dreams\\" and \\"Rainmaker\\" will surely deliver what you're searching for. However, Maiden restructured their composing right after their reunion at the beginning of the millennium, delivering songs somewhat more complex, but still far, far away from progressive metal.<br /><br />Maiden's classic war themes made it into this record in the form of \\"Montsegur\\" and \\"Paschendale\\", both strong songs that correctly portray the thematic they try to represent.<br /><br />\\"Wildest Dreams\\", \\"Rainmaker\\", \\"No More Lies\\", \\"Gates of Tomorrow\\" and \\"Journeyman\\" all take personal perspectives, while \\"New Frontier\\", \\"Face in the Sand\\" and \\"The Age of Innocence\\" are songs with a political feeling portraying a band that no longer wants to write about fiction on most of their songs. As a mature band, their themes have grown up with them and they have managed to keep every song different and fresh, without any song recalling any other song in their repertoire.<br /><br />\\"Dance of Death\\" is this record's \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" or \\"Fear of the Dark\\". A lengthy song, it uses the storytelling lyrics Maiden is so capable of producing. The song's solos are mind-blowing, and the bridge between the second and third solos is as classic as any other Maiden has composed. The story told is obviously fantastic, but Dickinson's delivery on the vocals enthralls you and conveys the dilemma with great success. By the end of the song you are capable of relating to the character's relief and his final decision.<br /><br />The only, and I mean only point I disliked about this album is that Janick keeps using the same solo pattern he introduced to the band back in 1990 with \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" in one of the songs. It just bothers me enough to comment, it is way to recurrent and his solos should try to be more original.<br /><br />I have to say myself, the intro to \\"Rainmaker\\" is the catchiest riff Maiden has ever come up with.<br /><br />To close this opinion of mine, for it is nothing else, I would like to let you know that Maiden is definitely not the band you used to listen to during the 80's, but, again in my opinion, it is now much better. Chords and harmony now go hand in hand, the vocals are unbelievable for a man Dickinson's age, the album and songs sound fresh and never stale, everything you hear is new, but it is definitely Maiden.<br /><br />Up the Irons.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app! I use it to store many files and I can make one public to share. works really well. no problems.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've had this cd since the day it was released. I've listened to it everyday since and it never gets old. The songs are solid, the playing is probably their best on record, it's an amazing cd. I could write a review of every song, but it's already been done. If you like old Rush, the 3 piece guitar band with the big sound, you'll love this cd. If you ever wondered how Rush would sound if they improvised rather than rehearsed every note to metronome perfection, you'll love this cd.
1419701533|4.0|I ordered this for my grandchild for X-mas. I know that she has read atone volume and enjoyed it.She also asked for the books.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Director Kenneth Branagh delivers a visually stunning movie, boasting a thoughtful yet funny plot brought to life by an incredible cast. For me, the father-son triad of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) really make this film a treat. Anthony Hopkins owns the floor as the King of Asgard, as always; his chill-inducing banishment speech to Thor has been practically immortalized. Even as a spoiled brat warrior prince, Thor is fun and likable; and when he comes into his own with humility and sacrifice, you can't help but admire him. As for Loki, if you can't appreciate the subtlety and finesse with which Tom Hiddleston manipulates every facet of this character, if you can't sympathize with the pain Loki expresses when begging and screaming to know his true identity, then you have no heart.<br /><br />A must-see, whether you plan on watching The Avengers or not.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Cool picture wish I had read the books.  The story line is interesting and the actors do a good job.  Ready for the next movie to open.
B004XQO90E|5.0|Very awesome action thriller. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I definitely would and have referred my friends to watch/buy this movie.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I heard this song a couple of weeks ago playing in a 1925 movie theater that I often visit. I asked the man who works the controls who this was. He told me it was Diana Krall. I had never heard her before, but loved her voice. After the movie I came home and went on Amazon and bought two of her cd's. I had fast service and it was exactly as described.

B00933JL0A|5.0|Townsmen is a fantastic and addicting game. It's not like other free to play games that make you buy items to win or play for more than 5 minutes. You can literally sit down and play all day if you want without having to purchase anything. You do have the option of purchasing prestige points that unlock maps and buildings. Prestige will also give you the ability to quickly build stuff. But again, it's not necessary to purchase and spend prestige points. Buildings complete construction as fast as the villager can carry over the supplies (sometimes 2 or 3 trips to complete a large building). Prestige can also be gained by completing quests. I've played for about a week and unlocked all items and maps for free. I now have a surplus of prestige points that I don't use. Even the ads can be removed by simply spending some free prestige points.<br /><br />Great game and fully worth checking out!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is poorly written, but the story line is pretty good. It did make me want to continue on to the next; however, it wasn't as great as many made it out to be.
0525953728|5.0|I am going to keep this review short. If you like anything military especially special forces, get this book. I just got this book and just finished up chp 5 (side note - end of chapter 5 is f'ing hilarious) and I can't put it down. Definitely recommend!
0525953728|5.0|Great descriptive telling of the raid on Bin Laden. Tells the true story, not the spun up nonsense the Obama team is using for their campaign. Nothing in here crossed the lines of what was top secret. Glad the story was told.
B004JHY8A8|4.0|This is about an American woman living in Paris. She got interested in a incident which happened in Paris during World War II. Her research led her to a girl named Sarah. Another story about a girl is also written at the same time. It was the very girl, Sarah. She was a Jew and sent to a camp with her parents, but left her little brother in a secret cupboard locked. She thought she would come back soon, and she has the key....<br /><br />Actually, I didn't know these sad things in Paris, I know Holocaust thanks to movies like \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"Life is beautiful\\". This book made me learn something we should know. I have to watch the movie too.
0425263908|1.0|How many \\"similarities\\" can one book have to another VERY famous book before it's called plagiarism? I'm a die hard Fifty fan and there are just too many similarities between the two stories that it makes me so angry that this is what \\"people suggest reading after Fifty.\\" Heck-to-the-NO! The plot is very poorly developed and the characters are not likeable. I read the entire book HOPING that things would change and that there would be SOMETHING different about Bared to You... what a waste of my time. Please don't read this book if you loved Fifty- it is an insult to Mr. Grey!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Intense book cant put the book down.curious to see what happens next. Im on book two now and so far its as good as book one
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is like crack for the eyes! Read it the first time in less than 24 hours and read it twice more in the same week.

I cannot get enough of Travis Maddox and will be one of those weirdos who's camping in line a week before the movie comes out... YES! There is going to be a movie!!!! Meanwhile, the sequel (Walking Disaster) comes out in April- ooooh the agony of waiting! We want more Travis!!!

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I don't think this was a great movie. But it was entertaining.<br />I am older and have not read the books. The movie was fun to watch - sort of- some parts had me saying to myself \\"really?\\".
B00338QENI|5.0|The story seems too incredible to believe but once you research and know that these things did occur the old sterotype of the 'mad scientist' doesn't seem so stereotypical. WARNING! this may serve to enrage you at the atrocities people endured here in the US. When thinking of the war criminals we tend to overlook the 'war criminals' that lived here and chose to neglect human suffering in their pursuit of \\"scientific\\" research. GREAT BOOK!!
0345529057|5.0|A great read, one of the best fiction series i've read in years. If u like fiction about kings & knights. U must read this series.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I deleted my original review. I was so shocked by Angelina Jolie's appearance, or changed appearance is more accurate, to settle down and \\"taken in\\" the movie as I might have. The one thing writers and directors strive to impart in their characters is to bring out at least one facet in the role that the viewers connect with or find appealing...in other words, the good guys are suppose to be liked by the audience on some level. This film role for Jolie was flat and single faceted...no emotional or kindred spirit the viewers could have invested any rousing interest in, or even like very much. Her wardrobe was as flat and benign as her role. One would not have been surprised to have it suddenly revealed that she is really an emotion less clone of the real woman she is supposed to be. I couldn't help wondering what the director was aiming for...certainly no positive connection with the viewers. The plot of the film is very good and deserved a much better delivery from the director. THAT much I DID take in. Johnny Depp? Looking unkempt and careless with his grooming works for Pirates of the Caribbean. All it does in this film is sharpen the contrast between his character and Joli's to the point of being an impossible to accept. I think it was the hair growing over his lips and his truly nasty looking stained teeth that plopped him into the \\"yuck\\" category. What a shame all the way around.....when the characters are directed in such a way as to distract the viewers from the actual plot, well...you end up with a great plot that remains unfulfilled and dead in the water; one not all the action/special effects scenes can keep afloat.  As for the reviewers who found Jolie and Depp's performances captivating enough to hold their interest, may I suggest \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\", and  \\"Muppet Take New York'? Trust me, you'll be glued to the screen.

0345363132|5.0|I am halfway through this book and I have become obsessed. I've given up yoga class, running, even my favourite TV shows because nothing at the moment is more compelling than this story of the medieval feud between the Lancasters and the Yorks, and between the York brothers. This book is so exceptionally written, the subject matter so intense, that I'd rate it as one of the best books I've ever read, up there with Gone with the Wind.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|Pince Valiant was a childhood vaforite of mine. Watching on TV it was always fuzzy and seemed lower quality than I remembered. The DVD played through blu-ray really makes the DVD pop.

1455502626|4.0|Plum Island was the first Demille book that I've ever read.<br />John Cory is not your everyday type cop.  I can imagine him as the kid in class who was always causing trouble and never on task.  He is resistant to authority and does his own thing.<br /><br />He is so sarcastic that you can't help but laugh at every comment he makes.<br />The story line is simple.  The murder happened in the first chapter and I was hooked.<br /><br />If you love a mystery, take the time to pick yourself up a copy
160459201X|2.0|Book was in clean condition but barely readable.  Even with my glasses, the print is very, very small.  Could not read it.  Am disappointed.  They should have mentioned how small this print is in the description.
B008602KQI|4.0|I usually do like the book better than the movie but in this case, I liked them both. The movie you can understand why it needed to be cut shorter and left a few things out that may have helped the plot but all in all it was great. The make up was good, the acting was great, I really enjoyed it. I do Hope they have a sequel to follow the rest of the series.
0374275637|5.0|Great book! This book has provided insight in countless areas of life! Kahneman is a genius, and I urge most people I meet to read this.
B0086449YA|5.0|Although I've always quite liked Mark Knopfler as a guitarist I've never really been a fan of his or Dire Straits but this new solo record is really good with lots of variety - rock, folk, Celtic, blues and lots of Mark's distinctive guitar and equally distinctive voice. The song writing is also really good, the more folky songs like \\"Yon Two Crows\\" and \\"Haul Away\\" have definite British references but so do some of the more rocky songs like \\"Corned Beef City\\" and even the down home country blues \\"After the Bean Stalk\\" refers to pantomimes! Mark and co-producer Guy Fletcher do a great job in achieving amazing sounds on all the different styles of music on this record, helped by the excellent band featuring amongst others Richard Bennett on guitars, Jim Cox on keyboards and Ian Thomas on drums.<br /><br />One real bonus for me is the presence of Kim Wilson's wonderful blues harmonica on so many of the tracks and this is definitely Mark's most bluesy album. He fully demonstrates his skill as a very versatile blues guitarist, both electric and acoustic and with or without slide, and like all the best blues guitarists he can show real emotion through his playing. However, his voice is just as effective and is totally individual (with just a nod to Dylan) and on many of the slower songs like \\"Go, Love\\" his vocals are heart-breakingly sad.<br /><br />This is a very consistent album and with so much variety that it means it is very hard to pick one track as your favourite. On my first few listens the beautiful, gentle \\"Miss you blues\\" (with its wonderful slide guitar solos) is the track that stands out for me but I suspect that in the longer term it will be the more folky songs that linger, or perhaps my favourite track will continue to rotate...

B008MJC6ZS|4.0|With Gene Hoglan maintaining his seat behind the kit, and Alex Skolnick back in the fold, Testament is tighter than ever.  This is by far the best album they've put out since The Gathering, and quite possibly the best since Practice.  I've always been a huge Testament fan, but I've always thought the drumming left a bit to be desired.  That problem's been rectified, and the band is now one of the best thrash bands still around, and can easily hang with the hardcore/deathcore bands.  My only remaining gripe: I really wish they'd stop doing the ballads...Trail of Tears...uh, The Ballad...enough already.  If you've been hesitant to pick up this album for fear of a lot of filler or sub-par writing, pick it up NOW.  You won't be disappointed!!

B00526ZKYS|5.0|After being immersed in a future world where frightening social values are the law, the reader is invited to ponder the possibilities ahead. \\"Regulators\\" with attack dogs and batons randomly raiding the neighborhoods and townships of a peaceful seaside city, cultivating social misfits infected with \\"love,\\" instill the fear of being identified as an \\"invalid\\" or someone who has not been \\"cured.\\" Borders separate \\"civilization\\" from the \\"wilds\\" where the uncured invalids reside in mysterious darkness, separated under penalty of imprisonment or worse. An easy read, with urgent page turning story lines, Delirium is hard to put down. Lena and best friend Hana are tormented by curiosity and temptation as they approach their procedure date. Womanhood is at hand for the two of them and the complexity and bewilderment of what lies ahead after the \\"cure\\" splinters their hopes and fears about evaluations and marriage match-ups. Descriptive passages invite the reader to a sit down to a family dinner or a run past trans-placed neighborhoods of the richer and poorer of the future. Thought provoking and solemn this story evokes somber and sober thoughts of what could become our own providence. A must read for all levels.

B00913DPW2|5.0|What a great entertaining game!  i HATE boring redundant Hidden Object games, frustrated that the app world is being saturated with them.  Was SO glad to finally see a game like this out for those of us that like an adventure and to actually need to think a little bit.  I enjoyed it as much as my 13 yr old did.  Creepy to play in the dark! But not ridiculously gory or anything.  The little subtle touches like a single candle that wasn't burning last time you were in a room but now is, etc was clever.  Hope they make more!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story has you addicted and awaiting this awesome ending, \\"that doesn't happen\\". In fact ending was ridiculuos. A better title could have been, \\"how many ways to ruin lives, and no consequences, ever\\". Everyone wants a rightous outcome, right?<br />Read it and decide for yourself!

1416914285|3.0|SPOILERS!!!!<br /><br />Well, let's see - beginning was good - characters seemed interesting - the story had flow and, believe it or not I could not put it down, for the first half - then, it got too much teenage drama and angst and that got mixed in with a healthy dose of evil monologues and dialog that went nowhere except to provide back-story that I didn't care about - and how many people can possibly lie in one story - but, I thought - nope, that was a lie and here is the truth - only to (possibly) find out that the new truth is really a new lie and that the real truth is yet to be spoken - confused? - so am I - too many plot twists and turns in this one and I got motion sick - I will not be completing this series, because in the end, I do not care about the characters in the end the way that I did in the beginning - I started out liking Luke, but he turns into kind of an a** - I liked Jace, but then he turns into kind of an Emo - I never liked Simon because he is too nerdy yet not - he is not a cool geek, just a convenient one - not at all believable to me - and the main character, Clary, I just have no care what-so-ever if she lies or dies at this point - this is not a complete failure, because as I said, there are some good parts of this story, but in the end, I just don't see the need to continue.

1401233791|5.0|Batman is undergoing a modern revival of sorts.  Between the fantastic Activision Arkham video game series and the Christopher Nolan movie trilogy, he has firmly secured his place in today's world.  With so many great representations of the current character and his cast, it would be easy to overlook some of the classic story lines that made him the icon that he is. Fortunately, DC has collected one of the best story arcs in this numbered collection of the Knightfall series from 1993 to help us remember.<br /><br />Modern comic book readers tend to shy away from classic collections.  Even though I am a long time collector I cannot blame them.  The outdated art techniques, stinted dialogue, and over adherence to the Comic Code Authority standards have produced many a stinker over the years.  Paging through back issues or graphic novels will leave most feeling that this is more of the Grandfather's comic than something that would appeal to their modern sensibilities.<br /><br />But understand, that other than the lack of sophisticated art work brought on by the computer age, comics of the early 90's are much more accessible to today's audience than you may suppose.  During this time, DC especially, seemed ready to embrace the new conventions and darker themes wrought by their big named creators from the late 80's (e.g. Gaiman's Sandman, Moore's Watchmen) and apply them to their mainstream titles.  The shiny, squeaky clean stories of the early 80's are stripped bare and replaced with dark, modern tales that still hold up today.  Enter Knightfall.<br /><br />Originally spanning from several of Batman's ongoing titles, Knightfall features the writing talents of Doug Moench, Alan Grant, and the fantastic Chuck Dixon.  Their script focuses on the character of Bane who is obsessed with breaking Batman both physically and psychologically.  Raised from birth as a prisoner in a Latin American prison, he survives sadistic torture and gruesome experimentation to eventually escape.  His survival was based in part on his obsession with the mythical Batman rumored to rule the far away kingdom of Gotham.  So it is only natural for him to pursue this goal, even if it means freeing every crazed lunatic from Arkham Asylum to demoralize and break the Bat as a precursor to his destruction.<br /><br />Anyone who saw the Dark Knight Rises movie will be forgiven if they think it is derived from this story.  It shares some of the same characters, a strand or two of DNA, but it is as different as Michael Keaton from Christain Bale.  First and foremost there is the gauntlet that Batman must run before meeting with Bane.  Batman must recapture the majority of his foes and everyone is there including majors (Joker, Two Face, Riddler, Scarecrow, Killer Croc) and minors (Anarchy, Firefly, Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist).  Each is devoted one to two issues as Batman hunts and attempts to apprehend them.  Each battle takes more and more out of him until finally exhausted and beaten he must face the man truly responsible BANE!<br /><br />If the only thing you know about Bane is what you learned from the latest film, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised.  Bane holds all the warped and twisted genius as portrayed by Tom Hardy, but also has a chemically induced strength that makes him a more \\"realistic\\" force of nature.  This is the Bane who is not only methodical enough to take out Batman, but who is strong enough, vicious enough, and big enough to take over all of Gotham.<br /><br />This first volume spans 600+ pages and not one of them is wasted.  Like most collections of this size there is some action that appears off screen in the form of fights and minor plot developments that occurred in other comics or one shots that did not make the collection.  But never is there something that makes you lose the thread of the story.  Watching Batman's physical and psychological deterioration is fascinating and knowing the fate that awaits him telegraphed clearly by thecover art will stir compassion in the most jaded readers.  The writing is top notch, and at times ascends to the heights of true literature.  The stories are well plotted and the conflicts presented are both engaging and realistic (in terms of the universe created).<br /><br />What surprised me most was some of the violence that the writers skillfully present.  Sure we expect to see a million fights in setups like this, but the casual violence is what caught my attention.  Scarecrow testing his control over someone by having them shoot a classmate point blank in the head, a montage of gang war scenes in which innocent bystanders are shot, people catching on fire and jumping out windows as a result of fear gas, these are all very modern takes on storytelling.  Each of which are applied with perfect dramatic timing so that they move the story forward and are not used as violence for violence sake (think of how perfectly Joker's magic trick with the pencil was used in The Dark Knight and you'll get what I mean).<br /><br />And just when you think you have seen it all, Bane's defeat of Batman causes Bruce Wayne to declare Jean-Paul Valley (aka Azrael) as a temporary fill in.  The result is a whole new level of darkness as we witness a Batman who has taken off the gloves.  For Jean-Paul is a trained assassin, a man willing to kill, to let innocents die, to do whatever it takes to return the rule of Gotham to its rightful place.<br /><br />The last issue in Volume 1 stops at a perfect dramatic pause.  A place where balance is restored but with huge questions as to how long and what final outcomes will be realized.  But still, the Volume could be read without ever taking up the next book in the series and you will not feel cheated.<br /><br />Speaking of feeling cheated, I picked up mine at my local comic shop at 40% off and still paid more than the advertised cost here on Amazon.  Even if you have to pick up the shipping costs, it is still a good deal.  As for the physical construction of the book, I was pleased that despite my on-again-off-again reading the binding remains firm and there is little to no evident cracking or wear in the spine.  Truly unusual for a book that is 2 1/2 inches thick.  Though the pages are not the glossy affairs found in modern trade paperback's, the colors are still vibrant enough to leap off the page.  All and all a great value, a great product, and a story that far exceeds expectations when viewed with the eye of a modern reader.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!cover art will stir compassion in the most jaded readers.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was good I couldn't put it down. I finished all three within 4 days. What I liked most was after reading the book and seeing the moview the producers stayed fairly true to the book. There just wasnt as many differences like other series.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My first impression of [[ASIN:B005LAIHPE Battleship]], was one of OK, I'll just wait for it to come out on DVD because I'm not paying movie prices to see this on a big screen. In hind sight, this was a really stupid decision! I carefully watched all of the ads and purchased the brand new Battleship 2012 the day it became available. Even then, I found Amazon.com to have the best price on this product. I received it in less than the two days expected and in excellent condition, of course.<br /><br />My wife and I sat down, with a big bowl of popcorn, and watched this movie without even a bathroom pause. We didn't want to miss a second of this film. Yes, I know we can pause it, but it's just not the same, do you know what I mean? The time went by in a flash and the next thing we knew, we were looking at the credits. For a few seconds we just sat there, then looked at each other and said, \\"That movie was outrageously crazy fun! Let's watch it again.\\" To say we were very pleasantly surprised at the acting, writing, overall plot with superior special effects, even throwing in a good 5 minutes or more of them actually fighting the aliens by playing the original form of Battleship the game, is a gross understatement.<br /><br />I can't figure out how a movie like this can get panned so badly by the alleged critics, appear to bomb at the box office and yet when we watch it, the film is outstanding. Do these critics not have an imagination or have any fun in life? The premise is somewhat predictable, so big deal. Like stupid humans we send a powerful radio beam message to another planet inviting them here. As stated by one to the science people, if this is successful it will be like the Indians sending a message inviting the Conquistadors and the more advanced societies always win. Meaning, we are the Indians. By this time we're saying, \\"No .... kidding.\\" Sure enough this very advanced civilization of aliens come to Earth and it's not to play Hazbro board games either. Then the fun really begins.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but visual candy for the sci-fi adventure people, especially if you enjoyed the \\"Transformers\\" series. It's appropriate for just about any age as there is a lack of bad language, violence or blood and gore, all while teaching the lessons of thinking out of the box and good wins out over evil. The bottom line to us was, if Liam Neesan was playing a major role, this was going to be a quality movie and we were not disappointed. I highly recommend this movie as a multi-watch quality product appropriate for the entire family. Of course, if you're going to watch it on your own home theater, turn the volume up high cause it's gotta be loud to be good.he fun really begins.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but visual candy for the sci-fi adventure people, especially if you enjoyed the \\"Transformers\\" series.

B0053B347M|3.0|So I set this up in my dedicated movie room. Bought two strips, installed them on the back of my LG 55 6700 Series LED. It looks amazing behind the TV. At first I thought it was too bright, but after one day, I got used to it, and it actually in fact does look nicer and makes the brightness of the LED not hurt as much (reduced eye strain). The only negative is the adhesive removable backing. It failed after 7 hours and fell off. This is either from the heat of the LED TV or just inferior adhesive. If you apply this to a wall, it will rip off the paint, just an FYI. I'm looking into a way to make the adhesive stronger to keep it on the back of my TV with out falling of. For the bad adhesive on this product, I knock it down to 3 out of 5 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I first got Angry Birds; I loved it and I couldn't stop playing it! I played it whenever I could. Hard levels that take a while to beat; sometimes I had to look up a walk-through to pass them. Plenty of levels. Once I completed all the levels; I stopped playing it. Once you complete the level; its boring to do it again. Very few and small ads. Get Angry Birds; but it takes a while for it to get boring.
B008B11R1Q|4.0|Part of me thinks Coexist is incredibly boring and monotonous . . . yet I've been totally engaged each of the several times I've listened to it.  It's also simultaneously cold/distant, yet very emotional (i.e. it seems refreshingly \\"post-ironic\\".  Which is to say, \\"sincere\\".)  As another apparent contradiction, the album is minimal with whispering vocal turns and simplistic electronic beats . . . yet actually quite nuanced and revealing of subtle depth upon repeat listens.<br /><br />Ultimately, I like it (more than most, apparently) and it seems like the perfect antidote to the \\"maximalist\\" overstuffed music of much indie pop/rock (I'm looking at you, Centipede Hz) as well as the typical autotuned, overproduced Top 40 R&B.<br /><br />Of course those looking for minimalist indie alternative soul music in this vein would probably just prefer to listen to the xx's awesomer debut instead.  Not a great leap forward for this band, but a nice companion piece.

B0059XTV4Y|2.0|This year seems to be the year of Wallis Simpson.  For some reason, there were many books nad movies made about the American woman who was twice divorced and yet managed to marry British King.  He had to abdicate his throne in order \\"to be with the woman he loves\\" and he did so probably without fully realizing the consequences of such decision.  Historians consider Edward as a kind of royal that would make an inadequate king: he liked to party, he was always surrounded by women and he had uncanny affinity towards Germans, that in late 1930s made many nervous.<br /><br />Wallis on the other hand, was from humble background.  Growing up,she always depended on her rich cousins and her goal in life was to marry good, financially stable and reliable husband.  Her first marriage was tragic, because her husband, a professional soldier, turned out to be a drunk.  Her second husband who had business interest in England was boring yet well of and reliable.  It is through his social circles that she met british royalty.<br /><br />This movie gives parallel stories of Wallis and Edward's affair compared to the modern day couple: a successful NYC doctor and his young and beautiful stay at home wife who incidentally bears the name Wallis.  Modern day Wallis is fascinated with the other Wallis woman and she ha romantic view of the relationship that many labled as the \\"biggest romance of the century\\".  Isolated, lonely and largely ignored by her husband she finds solace in researching the life and love of Wallis and Edward.  In her pursuit to learn more, she goes to the Sotheby's auction of Wallis Simpson's personal possessions.<br /><br />Madonna directed this film and seems to have tried to make it an art film.  But other than realy nice costumes and make up I found movie disappointing.  There is no depth in any of the characters.  If one did not know about these characters from other sources, film would provide very limited information.  During the film action switches from the current events to the past and at times it all appears very confusing.current events to the past and at times it all appears very confusing.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I couldn't put the book down, and was eager to unravel the mysterious plot - which would normally garner a 5 star review from me. But there's something about this book that I can't shake.  It's like eating filet mignon at an upscale steakhouse, and not really enjoying it at all because the aftertaste is off.<br /><br />I can't share why without spoiling it, but there were too many unanswered questions for me to really say that I liked the book.  It's a good read, and exciting.  The stamina and endurance of the protagonist is borderline unbelievable (falling just short of the believable line).  I'd suggest it to anyone looking for a casual diversion, but there are probably 3 dozen other books I'd recommend first.

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's powerful memoir Dying To Be Me tells the story of her near-death experience and the choice she made to come back and heal. Not just herself, but millions of people who are struggling for answers on the earthly journey.<br />It all starts on April 26, 2002 with a lump on her right shoulder, just above the collarbone. Ignoring the ugly little voice in the back of her head does nothing to alter the diagnosis. The doctor pronounces Stage 2 lymphoma. Four years later, having exhausted all treatment modalities--hypnotherapy, traditional Chinese medicine, ayurveda, prayer and chanting, yoga, and Western naturopathy--Anita is staring death in the face. Rushed to the hospital on the morning of February 2, 2006, comatose and grossly swollen, she is pronounced clinically dead. Her organs have shut down and there is little hope.<br />As nurses and doctors rush around attempting last-minute emergency measures, Anita leaves her body, floating above it with an incredible sense of freedom and a total absence of pain. Instantly, time and space cease to have relevance. The compelling part of the transition is that Anita wakes up to the realization of her true self: a divine being in a temporary physical shell. She describes a \\"sharpness of perception\\" in the afterlife, and the fact that she can \\"feel\\" everyone's feelings--fear, hopelessness, resignation--as if they are her own. She describes the transition thus: it is not as if she'd moved physically to another realm but as if she'd awakened.<br />\\"I discovered that since I'd realized who I really was and understood the magnificence of my true self, if I chose to go back to life, my body would heal rapidly--not in months or weeks, but in days! I knew the doctors wouldn't be able to find a trace of cancer if I chose to go back into my body!\\"<br />Sure enough, five days later she is transferred to a regular room and makes a miraculous and full recovery. Not a trace of cancer can be found anywhere in her body which wasriddled with tumors the size of lemons just days before.<br />I found this memoir truly inspirational. I believe Anita was returned to the physical realm in order to teach us what is really important in this life. The biggest lesson for me was the reminder that I have all I need for this journey--if I trust in my magnificence. Anita also focusses on another theme which is: release all fears. She is convinced that fear is what caused her cancer. Fear of contracting the dreaded disease, fear of everything that produced cancer including microwave ovens, pesticides, preservatives and plastic containers, fear of life, fear of brutal treatments, fear of death.<br />\\"I'm at my most powerful when I am working with life rather than against it,\\" writes Anita in a memoir that is a must-have on everyone's shelf.

I laughed so much in the begining of the book that I instantly became attached to the chara<br />cters. It was a great great story.. I was in love with Travis.. He made a complete change for Abby. Abby at times got on my nerves because she was to blind and tormented by her demons to see the relationship between herself and Travis.... I cant wait for Walking Disaster in April... I hope to GOD that Jamie Mcguire writes a sequel to this story after the first book not only in Travis' POV!!!!! I give this book a FIVE STAR review!!!!!!! IT WAS AMAZING...

Maybe it's because they have run out of good ideas, or because they have changed musically, or because some record company told them what will sell. In the '90's I felt Rush was starting to head down this road, but at this point I have to say they definitely have recovered.<br /><br />Despite being a concept album with a theme across all the songs, the music is still pretty diverse. Parts of \\"Clockwork Angels\\" sound like they could be King Crimson, while elsewhere there are shades of Yes and some other style I can't name but it makes me think \\"California.\\" Yet it's still Rush through-and-through, whether it sounds like \\"old\\" or \\"new\\" Rush. The comparisons to 2112 are apt, in my opinion, but with the newer style added.<br /><br />Musically this album is very complex, with complicated rhythms in many places, fantastic bass lines, chord changes, and everything else that makes for a good prog rock album. There's no \\"Tom Sawyer\\" here, but that just makes it all the better.<br /><br />There are probably little things sonically that could bother people individually, but I find it hard to say that there's anything annoying on a large scale. I was going to put in a snarky comment about how listening to the mp3's on your ipod is not going to give you the full experience of the music but I will leave it at that non-snarky version and just say I enjoy it best at a loud volume with real speakers where I can feel the music instead of just hearing it.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|After being completely spellbound by the first two books in this series, I found this one a disappointment.  The story meanders around, never really doing anything much except giving an extended background to the final showdown.  And even that wasn't written with the same panache and flair as the first two books.  It was a true bloodbath, with so many oddball happenings it was like the author had a whole bunch of macabre ideas and wanted to use them all up in a hurry before the series ended. So the first two-thirds, or thereabouts, were wishy-washy, most of the last third over-brutal, and then it all subsided into a sort of happy-ever-after. Not in the same league as the first two.

B005EGXTHG|5.0|After barely being able to breathe while reading \\"The Hunger Games\\", I bought and began reading this second book within minutes of finishing the first.<br />I had no idea how the author could possibly keep up the momentum of the first book, but she did.  I found this book just as thrilling, chilling and breath-taking. The heroine might have some very human failings, but she is uncommonly strong and courageous, and I felt like I was right there beside her through all the horrors and twists and turns of the plot.<br />It takes great imagination to create this our-world-other-world scenario, and Suzanne Collins has it in spades.<br />I am happy to say that this second book continued the pace and potency of the first book and did not disappoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son convinced me to see 'The Hunger Games' with him earlier this year.  I was dubious, but went anyway.  The movie was compelling, and the book is even better! It is a page-turner for all ages.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|The author has created a clever and intricate world, which enables him to pose interesting philosophical questions set against an uprising of downtrodden people. The characters are well developed and credible even when possessed of incredible power.<br />The Plot moves well even with complex concepts and events being introduced.<br />The trilogy is long enough to be a good read and not so long that it looses continuity. Well done indeed! you will enjoy it.
B002JUXNOY|5.0|I am a big horror movie fan.  But as far as I'm concerned, no one is even making REAL scarey, horror films anymore.... except for this one!!!!!!!!  OMG, this movie actually had me scared out of my mind.  I was afraid to move, afraid to close my eyes, afraid to keep them open - I didn't even want to speak! lol. But, I could NOT stop watching it.  Not only was this movie super scarey, it actually had a great message to it in the end.  And even though I had horrible chills up my spine and tears in my eyes, at the very end I felt sooooo relieved.  Not because the movie was over, but because His rod and His staff, they comfort me.  A MUST SEE.
0307594777|4.0|What a great book!  After hearing about these books last year and then reading That Girl Started Her Own Country over the weekend, I really wanted to read these books as well.  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo really kept my attention and was super witty and intelligent.  I will say that Lisbeth does seem very similar to Zaydee, the main character in That Girl Started Her Own County.
B003MXAQJW|5.0|Don't let the title sway you. This movie has an awesome array of unique characters. It's a great movie that most people can personally relate to. If life has ever tested you to your last wits and caused you to just say \\"forget it!\\" then you will relate to this film.  They all come together and learn to appreciate each other despite the troubles they each have...and their journey will crack you up! I've watched this one three times and I'm not one to really watch movies more than once. Trust me, you'll love this movie no matter what your age or general movie interests are!

0393338827|5.0|Ralph Waldo Emerson said that \\"All History Is Biography\\" and where Michael Lewis' book shines is as a biography of those few who saw the subprime crisis coming and made millions by betting that adjustable rate loans made to low income subprime borrowers would fail once the initial \\"teaser\\" rate expired,  and borrowers were exposed to market rates.  They were right.  They predicted that human nature being what it is,  more than 5% of subprime borrowers wouldn't pay those loans back,  and that the mortgage bonds and CDOs into which they had been bundled and would become valueless.<br /><br />What this book demonstrated to me is the folly of Dodd-Frank.  The belief that somehow government regulators would have have prevented this from occurring,  while bank presidents and institutional investors did not, is laughable.  Sure,  now that every government regulator in the United States has read this book this type of economic crisis won't be repeated.  Dodd-Frank locks the proverbial barnyard gate, but it only does so now that all the livestock have fled.<br /><br />What about the next crisis?<br /><br />We've gone from the junk bond crisis (1985)to the savings and loan crisis (1990) to the dot-com crisis (2000)to the sub-prime crisis (2008) and next to the fiscal crisis of 2013 known as the \\"fiscal cliff.\\"  Each of these crises can be traced back to the federal government.  The simple fact is that only the federal government is of sufficient size that a single move in its policy can shake the financial foundations of the nation.<br /><br />What could have been explored better in this book is how Congress created the subprime mortgage market,  taking home mortgage regulation away from the states and giving it over to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  It wasn't lax regulation of credit default swaps or mortgage bonds or CDOs or ratings agencies which was the genesis of this crisis,  it was Congress trying to give persons with low income \\"the opportunity to borrow money to buy their own homes.\\"  It sounds good,  but in reality market forces reestablished themselves and the market crashed.<br /><br />The guys who shorted the market bet against Congress and won.  I wouldn't want to be them,  but I enjoyed reading about them.  Good book.eir own homes.\\"  It sounds good,  but in reality market forces reestablished themselves and the market crashed.<br /><br />The guys who shorted the market bet against Congress and won.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|It is a very good book, but you must have a broad mind to enjoy it.  I wondered where I missed out on in my youth.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Those looking for some special insight into the events of the day will be disappointed. Honestly, I was a little disappointed that some details, such as the use of altered Uh-60 helicopters, were not revealed. Otherwise, it is what it is: the story of the death of UBL through the eyes of one soldier. No more, no less.

0439023521|5.0|Let's be honest. This isn't some literary gem that historians will use to define the literature of our time. And if it is, we have reached a new low. However, if you look at it for what it is, a highly entertaining and well thought out piece of fiction, it is a success. The movie drove me to read it, and I was not even close to being disappointed.
0307951529|3.0|This is the first & last book from Chris Guillebeau that I buy. I ordered this book with a lot of hope of finding great content & guidance to create a start up with a very low investment. I firmly thought this could be the next 4 hour workweek because all the reviews I read all over the internet.<br /><br />It turned out to be a book with a Great Title, but no $100 Dollar StartUp Case Study whatsoever inside.<br /><br />I started reading the book with the most enthusiasm, but after the first 50 pages I realized the book is full of Fluff Advice. For instance the author mentions a certain principle and says he'll talk more about this principle in chapter 7, but when I get to chapter 7 and read about this principle it's all fluff. I honestly think this a very, very basic book about launching a start up, but the best I could get out of it, it's his recommendations about pricing a product, which he gets from Robert Cialdini's Influence Book. Altogether the book is a very short attempt to be an inspirational book for those looking the courage to start a business. Though no great advice, not formulas or systems to do it.<br /><br />Now I can be certain that Chris Guillebeau is great at Launching Products, like this very book, but not great at delivering good content books. Just another great Internet Marketer with great Sales CopyWriting Skills and friends with Blogs who promote his books with an affiliate link in exchange for a hefty commission.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Overall, Mockingjay is a great story with all of the elements that made the first two books successful. But can you say rushed? I honestly feel like there should have been four books, not three. The ending had the feeling of being completely rushed and thrown together. So much so that it felt like Collins was dealing with a page limit and had no choice but to smash 300 pages into 50. Is there such thing as a mulligan in literature?
B007L3BMGA|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read. I could not agree with one star reviews more.<br />I regret buying it and reading it.

B006X08EZY|4.0|David Byrne never ceases to amaze me with his on-going versatility (and restlessness), and at an incredible pace too. This particular diversion actual stems from a collaboration Byrne had with legendary Brazilian singer-songwriter-guitar player Caetano Veloso in early 2004. This concert was recorded on April 17, 2004.<br /><br />\\"Live at Carnegie Hall\\" (18 tracks; 71 min.) consists of three separate and distinct parts. In the first section, Veloso brings 6 songs mostly just himself and acoustic guitar. Check out the opener \\"Desde Que o Samba &eacute; Samba\\", which is representative of the overall sound of this album. In the second part, Byrne brings 7 tracks, again mostly just himself and acoustic guitar, and mostly Talking Heads classics like \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Life During Wartime\\", which of course elicit gread applause. But beware Heads fans, this sounds NOTHING like the original songs, these are just acoustic arrangements. I personally think they sound quite good. Check out \\"And She Was\\". a great acoustic reinterpretation by Byrne.<br /><br />But the real reason to buy this album is the third and final section, when Veloso and Byrne perform together, and simply creat magic. The first of those 5 songs is \\"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses\\", co-written by Veloso and Byrne. Even better is \\"Ilê Aiyê\\", which Veloso comments he co-wrote with his son Moreno when Moreno was only 8 yrs. Veloso starts off the song, but then Byrne joins in, in Portuguese no less, and the crowd goes nuts. Next comes the Talking Heads cover \\"(Nothing But) Flowers\\", which they brings wiht just a great touch of humor and tongue-in-cheek. Next comes the Veloso classic \\"Terra\\" (at 6 min. the longest track here), with Byrne just providing guitar support. The album closes with the Talking Heads classic \\"Heaven\\", with Veloso providing background support. Not that the earlier part of the album is not enjoyable, but what a fabulous final section of this album! I only wish there was more than these 5 songs. Meanwhile, this release is a beautiful time capsule of a great live show.eanwhile, this release is a beautiful time capsule of a great live show.

B00846REIS|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book after having read all 3 50 shades books. I thought I would be diappointed but I wanted something else to read that was similar. I read some reviews and decided to give it a try. I was blown away! This is a GREAT,GREAT book! I loved it!! It is very much like 50 shades but there are lots of differences also and the writing itself is much better. From the moment I began reading I didn't want to put it down. The writing is good, the story is good and I cannot wait for the next one due out on Oct 2! If you liked 50 Shades Of Grey, I HIGHLY recommend this book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Best book I've ever read. I tell everyone to buy it and read his story.It's going to be hard to top this, I've read a few after his came out and they pale in comparison!!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|It's a good movie overall but Kristen Stewart has the emotional capacity the size of a teaspoon. She just always looks the same and has the same facial expressions and her fake accent sort of goes in an out. The accent will be stronger at certain times and weaker in the next scene. Don't get me wrong, I do like this movie, I just think the main character was sort of lacking well, character. I would still recommend this movie to anyone who's interested though because despite K-Stew being a crappy actress it's still a good movie and provides an interesting take on the classical Snow White story. So, overall, good movie and action packed!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|If you know me, you know that I am an introvert and love books. A book written by an introvert about introverts, seems like a great read to me.<br /><br />Enter Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain. In it, Cain looks at the different between extroverts and introverts. She looks at research on the brain, how each interact in team settings, how they learn, how they make decisions, how they make speeches, how they recharge. It was a fascinating look at how we are the way we are.<br /><br />One of the more interesting things for me was not only understanding more about who I am (high school and college made a lot more sense to me after reading this), but how I raise our kids, especially introverts. The research she cites about education and how introverts do in education in elementary schools was downright frightening and something more parents should be aware of.<br /><br />Here are just a few of the things I highlighted:<br /><br />-Introversion--along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness--is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.<br />-Introverts are drawn to the inner world of thought and feeling, said Jung, extroverts to the external life of people and activities. Introverts focus on the meaning they make of the events swirling around them; extroverts plunge into the events themselves. Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone; extroverts need to recharge when they don't socialize enough.<br />-Introverts often work more slowly and deliberately. They like to focus on one task at a time and can have mighty powers of concentration. They're relatively immune to the lures of wealth and fame.<br />-Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions. Nor are introverts necessarily shy. Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating. Shyness is inherently painful; introversion is not.<br />-Introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude can be a catalyst to innovation.<br />-Teens who are too gregarious to spend time alone often fail to cultivate their talents \\"because practicing music or studying math requires a solitude they dread.\\"<br />-Top performers overwhelmingly worked for companies that gave their workers the most privacy, personal space, control over their physical environments, and freedom from interruption.<br />-Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory.<br />-Studies have shown that performance gets worse as group size increases: groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared to groups of six, which do worse than groups of four. The \\"evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,\\" writes the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. \\"If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.\\"<br />-Highly sensitive people tend to be keen observers who look before they leap. They arrange their lives in ways that limit surprises. They're often sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, pain, coffee. They have difficulty when being observed (at work, say, or performing at a music recital) or judged for general worthiness (dating, job interviews).<br />-The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves ascreative or intuitive (just as Aron's husband had described her). They dream vividly, and can often recall their dreams the next day. They love music, nature, art, physical beauty. They feel exceptionally strong emotions--sometimes acute bouts of joy, but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.<br />-If we assume that quiet and loud people have roughly the same number of good (and bad) ideas, then we should worry if the louder and more forceful people always carry the day.<br />-We don't need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.<br />-Introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers. Because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social situations, introverts are more likely to hear and implement suggestions.<br />-Studies have shown that performance gets worse as group size increases: groups of nine generate fewer and poorer ideas compared to groups of six, which do worse than groups of four. The `evidence from science suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming groups,' writes the organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham. `If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority.'<br />-We can stretch our personalities, but only up to a point.<br />-Introverts tend to sit around wondering about things, imagining things, recalling events from their past, and making plans for the future.<br />-In other words, introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly.<br />-If it's creativity you're after, ask your employees to solve problems alone before sharing their ideas. If you want the wisdom of the crowd, gather it electronically, or in writing, and make sure people can't see each other's ideas until everyone's had a chance to contribute.<br /><br />All in all, a fascinating read.

I absolutely love Crouch's haunting style and incremental character development, I was drawn in instantly and kept going because of a compelling kind of morbid fascination.  The only thing that jarred slightly was the level of violence exhibited by the townsfolk ... Crouch didn't really give us a valid explanation for the witch hunts.  Usually I hate it when something doesn't make sense, but in this case I didn't care because the book sucked me in so completely.

B002M9WW30|5.0|Although the Rocky series has been maligned for some of the later installments (mostly notably IV & V), but the first three films are as good as film trilogies get.  The original Rocky was a huge underdog hit, garnering the 1976 Oscar for best picture and catapulting unknown Sylvester Stallone into a star.  While he would descend into cartoonish performances later in his career, he is superb as the ham & egger boxer Rocky Balboa who overcomes all odds and goes the distance with the champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) losing on a split decision.  Rocky II & III find Rocky winning then losing the championship and fighting to regain glory and the title.  Rocky IV & V are both low marks in the series, especially V which is borderline ridiculous.  Rocky Balboa is a nice way to close out the series (unless Mr. Stallone decides to revive the series) with some fine acting, but a fairly unbelievable scenario of Rocky at the almost 60 years old fights the current champ and again goes the distance losing on a split decision.  The pictures on the blu ray editions are really good, adding a crispness and vibrancy to the older films.

B005FISBV2|5.0|This is an amazing series and this season is no different.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|The Hunger Games follows Katniss Everdeen as she becomes the female tribute from District 12. Katniss is a strong person, who's taken care of her family by hunting. She takes this skill into the Games, where she's forced to kill or be killed.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in an interestingly personal, up-close, and (sometimes) blurry way, especially at the beginning as we take in the bleak life of District 12. The special effects are quite sound, though nothing that hasn't been seen before. The score is fitting, but again, not outstanding. The costume designs and make-up were outrageous in the best way possible to fit the people of The Capitol.<br /><br />Though a lot of the movie is very action-oriented, the connections Katniss makes during the tense atmosphere of the film are moving, even - or perhaps, most especially - when they lead to heartbreak and pain. You can definitely feel connected to this character, who's had to be strong all her life, but also cares very deeply. Too often we see a \\"strong woman\\" as cold and uncaring<br /><br />The Hunger Games is also a very good book-to-movie adaptation. I was quite happy that they didn't skip the lead up to Games, which I find a very interesting introduction to the world. There were a few things that I missed, but the movie does a great job in capturing what it shows you. I think a fan of the books would be likely to enjoy this movie.

B00887490Y|1.0|My co-workers and I decided to watch this during a slow day at work. Judging by the cover, one is led to think....\\"Horror Movie\\" At first the errie atmosphere seems promising. As it drags on you realise it's meant to be a thriller and by the end of the movie it's safe to say homicide has been commited. That's right, this film just killed over an hour of your precious life that could've been spent doing something actually enjoyable. Nope, it's gone right down the toilet so to speak. This movie has one of the most dull endings I've ever seen, it's just a really bad, BAD MOVIE! Please heed my advice and walk away, otherwise, consider yourself warned.

0142419303|5.0|There's a seal on the cover of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that says \\"The World's No. 1 Storyteller\\" in reference to author Roald Dahl. Even though there are many cool and ingenious pop-ups, pull tabs and lift- the -flaps in this book, the emphasis is on the text.  This is a great story that can be somewhat enhanced by pop-ups and other paper engineering tricks, but the really good stuff is in the text, like the songs sung by the Oompa Loompas when each greedy, spoiled, dull, or obsessed child is eliminated from Willie Wonka's game. The book cover says ages 4 and up, but probably 5 or 6 would be better. Lots of thought -provoking ideas for children and grown-ups to discuss after reading this story.

B000K7VHQE|3.0|This movie has quite often been recommended to me by friends, and it is almost ALWAYS on television here in Australia so it must be doing something right, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I was quite pleased with my decision to watch the film and it made me feel a bit better from illness for the 2 hours it lasted.<br />However I don't expect much more from more viewings, I doubt I'll opt to watch it with friends at a movie marathon and I doubt I'll go out of my way to watch it again.<br /><br />That being said it's a fun little movie that most other people will enjoy again and again.<br />I would happily recommend it to people, despite not being extremely fond of it.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key started off a little confusing as it flipped back and forth to Sarah and Julia.  This book was well written and the detailed story of Sarah was moving, and angering that left me in tears.  This was a book of fiction that left me in awe of what happened during that time period, so I can only imagine what I would have felt emotionally if it had been a non-fiction depiction of war time in France/Germany.  Good Book I would recommend reading.

B008OHV5HS|5.0|I first have to say I own all of the Threshold catalog and this is my favorite. From the start of' Ashes', you know this will be one hell of a disc.That's 'Why We Came' shows Damian Wilson has a great voice and one fantastic song. 'Rubicon' is the longest song at over ten minutes and it does not seem like it. You must get the disc with the bonus 'Divinity 'on it . Another killer tune. While not has heavy as the last it is the melodies that make this such a great disc. Something I feel Dream Theater lacks.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|A great movie.  I wanted to see it again after seeing The Dark Knight Rises.  The Nolan treatment of the character, while \\"dark\\" (no pun intended) is just what The Batman needed.  Christian Bale is a bit self-indulgent, but isn't Bruce Wayne?

B003OA6AOI|1.0|Looking for some mindless science fiction fun to watch in the evening. This episode (series?) was not it. Anyway, at least I got it free with my Prime account. Terrible implausible plot. I have a hard time understanding this but the \\"butler\\", don't remember his name, was responsible for the murder of two people-an innocent woman too! and threatened to kill the team but Jack Harkness and crew had no trouble forgiving him and welcoming him back. The plot is a rehash of the Borg from Star Trek, but the writers made a fundamental mistake, there was no internal struggle for her to be good, even though she wasn't completely upgraded. Instead she was just evil, so no sympathy for her so what a waste of time, should have watched Stargate instead.

B0016OLC5Q|3.0|I am familiar enough with this incident to know that the movie makes several factual errors, perhaps intentionally for dramatic purpose.  What I am struck by, however, is the perhaps unintentional layering of Penn's generational angst onto Chris McCandless.  They both came of age in an era where too much attention was given to their emotions by their parents and extended family.  Over time, this generation came to imagine their hurts, pains and emotions were more and greater than others.  I know that is somewhat true of Penn, and he has pasted that over McCandless.  We don't know McCandless well enough to trust that interpretation.  I think Sean Penn admired McCandless's willingness to throw himself into situations he didn't know he could handle, and so he glorified that.  McCandless was looking for adventure, and he found one, although not with the ending he imagined.  I don't think movie directors do the viewing public any justice when they change facts and personalities to make a better movie.  Whether or not Penn meant to portray McCandless as slightly touched, perhaps mentally ill, I was frequently left with that impression.  I also was left with the impression of a spoiled wealthy child who took his own emotions too seriously.  As did all of his family, according to this film.  If we use this film to \\"know\\" McCandless, he also comes across as naive, simplistic, and reckless, as well as someone who arrogantly overestimates his own abilities.  I, for one, would never have shot that moose without having a fire pit waiting and ready with an ample supply of wood.  While the storyline is interesting, as presented, and the photography beautiful, I am uneasy with the creative license Penn took with the life-and death-of a real human being.  Watch with caution would be my final words, and then do a little further research online to see where this film departs from the facts.

0385344333|2.0|I've read all of the Jack Reacher novels. Love the character and loved many of the earlier books.<br /><br />A WANTED MAN continues a downward trend in the quality of the series, however.  Get to Virginia already. I'm sure Jacker Reacher fans will understand that reference.<br /><br />There are many sequences and sections of A WANTED MAN that remind me how good this series can be. Sadly, in my opinion, not enough of them.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|As a faithful reader I always expect Temperance Brennan novels and read them the minute they are available. Bones are forever is quite good, but really not the best I read: too slow, and the different plots doesn't add up consistently.... Brennan and Ryan are just starring at each other.... Not one I will reread...

030758836X|3.0|After a somewhat slow start, this novel pushes you at breakneck speed from one twist to the next. It is a cleverly plotted page turner that takes you on an emotional roller coaster along with the pivotal characters. Once started, you will have a hard time putting it down. However, the ending left me feeling cheated. Yes, I get the point that the main characters are both pathetic people and that they continue on in some sick semblance of life. For me, it was an unsatisfying climax nonetheless.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Love this book! This is a great gift idea for someone thinking about getting married. Good counseling material too. An easy read!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I saw \\"Batman Begins\\" in theaters when I was in 8th grade. I never got the chance to see \\"The Dark Knight\\" in theaters but completely blew me away when I got it on DVD {Since then have upgraded to Blu-Ray for both 1 & 2}. I was not excited for the ending movie... \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". Especially after the movie theater shooting in Colorado. I thought to myself \\"Is it even worth it to go see this movie?\\"<br /><br />My husband was begging and counting down the days until it came out. Of course we saw it Friday afternoon of Opening Day. I was literally blown away... yet again. HOW can you hit 1,2&3 movies completely out of the park & out of this world? Well if you are Christopher Nolan, I guess it's just another day at the office.<br /><br />I am completely obsessed with these movies. I love how Nolan took the concept of Batman and made him modern. Made the whole thing dark and tangible to our generation, unlike the 60's versions. He made the characters possible and real. You feel as if bad guys do exist and Batman will find a way to make things right.<br /><br />Oh and I might add, I really did not like Bane. I much prefer The Joker {and Harley Quinn, obviously not in the movies, I was hoping she'd show up in the 3rd giving a reason as to where The Joker is} as villains. I never liked Scarecrow either. And I also thought 'Cat Woman' would be AWFUL in this movie especially due to the fact Anne Hathaway is very different than the 'darkness' of Nolan's Batman movies. I thought she'd totally make the movie Bomb. But... It didn't happen. She came into her character very well. Even with me going into the movie wishing they had cast someone else. She portrayed the character very very well. After the first 5 minutes of her in the movie, you are convinced of her character.<br /><br />I loved the fight scenes in this movie... you can tell they really went all out. And you can also tell throughout the whole movie that it's the ending. Which I really liked... the fact that the end didn't pop up 20 minutes before the credits. The whole movie is a progressive movement to the end of Batman.<br /><br />And the subtle hint of \\"Robin\\" at the end of the movie {That my husband didn't even catch, by the way}... I almost died of Happiness. I LOVE that they didn't make Batman have a sidekick... but I still love Batman and Robin. The fact Nolan detached them for the sake of the \\"legacy living on\\". Superb. 5 Stars.<br /><br />I can't say enough about these movies. I only can wish Heath Ledger would have lived to make it into the final film.end didn't pop up 20 minutes before the credits.

034580404X|4.0|This trilogy is very intense and the more I read the better I like it. I think most reader will enjoy this.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Better than the Movie. The book offers so much more than the Movie. It has a different and way better ending..
0345803485|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I've read a crap ton of books. Some good, some bad, some 'meh', some amazing. And occasionally I cross a speedbump of a travesty like 50 Shades.Only twice in the past have I actively tossed a book and given up on reading any further. The first was Stephen Donaldson's \\"White Gold Wielder\\", in which the protagonist arrives from Earth onto a fantasy world, discovers his leprosy has been healed... and promptly celebrates/tests his healed flesh by sexually assaulting a girl in a stable. The second was one of Laurell K. Hamilton's \\"Anita Blake, Vampire Hump--er, I mean, Hunter\\", because the plot had long since stopped being a plot for multiple books past and replaced by supernaturally ginned-up IKEA porn. BAD IKEA porn.    So, getting through this book I consider to be an endurance test. I wanted to set it alight many times and dance around its flames chanting the names of the Great Old Ones. I wanted to fire it from a cannon aimed across the Atlantic and into EL James' brainpan. I wanted to dial up the publisher and ask \\"What In Hell Is Wrong With You People?!\\"    Reading this book was by turns annoying, painful, disgusting, and pathetic.    If you're looking for quality literature, you won't find it here. If you're looking for an enrapturing love story, you won't find it here. If you're looking for solid three-dimensional characters, engaging writing, or anything resembling sanity, a believeable narrative, or even a semi-believable one, you sure as hell won't find those here either.    What you WILL find, however, is the 'story' of a mousy, barely-there shell of a girl with a preposterous lack of any sexual or personal agency (seriously, as the book opens, she's never dated, never gotten drunk, never had a boyfriend, never had sex, made out, or even masturbated, doesn't have an email account [?!]... and she's a college graduate). In short order, she is snapped up by a \\"Dom\\" who fulfills all that an impressionable reader's expectationsof what a charming \\"real man\\" should be. She's easily terrified of him (and given his scary attitude, no wonder), by turns pathetic and pedantic in her 'journey' through this book, and her subconscious and 'inner goddess' (apparently two different things) act in a retch-inducing manner to match the character they're part of. I can only assume that the 'love' she develops for him, after his creepy behavior, his constant stalking, and jerk-tastic behavior is similar to how hostages and prisoners develop Stockholm Syndrome and feel 'love' for their captors.    And so what is so grand about this epitome of arsehattery? Christian Grey is rich, handsome, well-made... and a completely unloveable pathetic turd, an execrable excuse for a human being. His temper flares at the slightest provocation, his behavior--composed of random over-the-top gift-giving, displays of extravagance, emotional ups and downs, and creepy pursuit behavior--is very much reminiscent of psychological and emotional traits found by actors in abusive relationships. The fact that he's apparently kinky because of his mental issues makes a mockery of anyone who's in the lifestyles of leather, kink, or BDSM, thus furthering the stereotype of what TVTropes might call the Depraved Dominant if they had such an entry on that trope.    As it is, I did a little research on mental disorders, and according to the DSM (the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the book by which psychologists study and define various mental illnesses), Christian Grey fits virtually ALL of the criteria for someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder, ranging from invariably angry reactions to criticism, and constant needs for attention, to becoming (VERY) easily jealous and having (Obviously) trouble keeping healthy relationships.    As an aside, his constant referral to the female dominant who initiated him into BDSM as a teen: This would not only count as statutory rape and molestation on a continued, intentional basis (aswell as her own unfaithfulness to her husband who was unaware and unconsenting of such a relationship), but yet again paints BDSM types as depraved freaks. To me, I find this deeply insulting and badly stereotyped, and his protestations to the reader and to Ana about how \\"It wasn't like that!\\" ring hollow in and out of the story.    As an aside to the aside, the reversal of this sort of thing, wherein a teenaged female were taken into the 'care' of a much older man (especially the sexual and sadomasochistic portions), would be reviled as incredibly disgusting and horrific (as it should be).    Or, it would be Twilight.    (Which is what this was, originally: Twilight fan-fiction with the serial numbers filed off.)    Overall, EL James has essentially written a book about an abusive relationship, under the guise of kink. I can't think of a single sane individual with a kinky side to them who would find this sort of 'relationship' acceptable. This book promotes multiple bad stereotypes. The first, of course, of people being kinky as a consequence or parallel to being screwed up in the head: Grey was abused as a child, and Mrs. Robinson, his domme, was okay with breaking the law and having sex with a minor. The second being that abusive relationships are okay, because they're not REALLY abusive, they're just different (I don't call living in constant fear of your partner a healthy D/s relationship at all, no matter their 'charms). And possibly the third being that one can redeem someone simply by loving them.    Sorry kids, none of this tripe works that way in the real world unless you find yourself part of a very unhealthy relationship.    I realize that there are readers out there who think this book is the greatest thing since Lady Chatterley's Lover. I realize that there are no shortage of people out there who have various kinks, and may not realize it until they have an enlightening experience or exposure to something that triggers those feelings. I realize that these two traits may intersect. But really, I find it deplorable beyond belief that the two had to intersect here, with this travesty. There are so many other good pieces of writing, and film, and other media that promote and explore kink in the context of healthy relationships, or even ones that change over time in a more believable manner.    I won't be reading the next two in the series. I hear they get better. I also hear that they shift from first to third person (which in a book series counts as a poor thing to do in my opinion, unless your intent was to shift between a large cast of characters constantly). I hear they have a happy ending. I also hear they have helicopter crashes, psycho submissives with knives, and other 'plot' points you'd see in the most pedantic of daytime soap operas.    Essentially, this book is just that: A terrible, ridiculous, pathetic, time-and-money-and-sanity-wasting, badly-portrayed-BDSM-laced soap opera. I will not give it a letter grade, and I only assign it 1 star because Amazon won't let me rate it in the negatives. This book insults the grading system itself. I will only say that I am glad never to read it again, because if they make this into a film I'll end up feeling like Sam Neill at the conclusion of \\"In The Mouth Of Madness\\" as the world collapses into insanity and chaos. I pray to Odin, Osiris, Amaterasu, Ogoun, and any other deity out there that they don't actually go that far.    But I know they will. In England, this prat EL James and her publishers are laughing all the way to the bank, and I hate every single one of them for it.
0345472322|3.0|The topic on mindset can be written in very practical and interesting manner. However, this book does not define what exactly mindset is at the beginning of the book. It simply relates mindset to beliefs, and classifies mindset as either a \\"fixed mindset\\" or \\"growth mindset\\", and seems to imply that there is no \\"middle ground\\" for that.<br /><br />It is kind of shocking to learn that a professor from Stanford (also holds professorships at Harvard and Columbia) can have such poor English writing style and skill, and many of the concepts discussed are purely common sense made complicated, and not many concepts are well substantiated by specific research sources. Some of them are simply generalities or platitude...<br /><br />Do understand that the author wants the book to be presented in an easy to understand manner in order to sell more copies as a self-help best-seller. This however dilutes the purpose of introducing the \\"mindset concepts and actionable ideas\\" clearly to the general readers. It be presented with simplicity in mind, but not shallowly simplified and presented without any real depth or substance!<br /><br />A classic by the name of \\"A Success System that Never Fails\\" written in the 60s by W. Clement Stone regarding a how a Positive Mental Attitude (Mindset in another words) can lift up one's life and career is far more practical, since it was written by someone who really tested the mindset theories in the real world and succeeded, very unlike this book which only includes many real life examples from the author's teaching job or campus life, or simply quoting from secondary sources,like best-selling or sometimes cliche business books, about the consequences of taking a \\"fixed versus growth mindset\\".<br /><br />I got really worried about the quality of both professorship and authorship, especially those claim to be professors and authors graduated from top schools. These professionals certainly need more real life work experiences or solid academic research findings to back up what they write. Or else, an un-examined life (or un-examined book knowledge) is not really worth living (or buying).<br /><br />To me, this book is 6-7 out of 10. It is simply over-rated by many, who are psychologically inclined to worship Ivey Leagues graduated authors....who are not necessarily good or solid book authors. It really depends...!<br /><br />Try \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" by a solid Nobel Prize Economist, Daniel Kahneman. The book is practical, filled with solid research findings that will also change your mindset and skills-sets about thinking. By the way, he teaches at Princeton, but his writing and the book quality can really back up his impressive academic credentials, since he has a lot of solid research materials to back up his thesis for the book.<br /><br /> You probably get more from reading that book, which is certainly not a light reading, but a very solid one.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Addicting great app with tons of upgrade options.  Dont need to spend real money, easy to get tons of coins.
B0067TGSOK|2.0|Overly simplistic take on the reality of entrepreneurship.  This is basically a book chronicling a number of successful startups and their shared theme of \\"hobby to business\\".  The author then blends anecdotal ingredients to create a very general secret sauce for success.  If you are looking for a guide, this isn't it.  If you are looking for inspiration, perhaps, but only if you have a hobby or like to write about traveling.

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Miss.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is one of the best adaptations from a comic book I've run across.<br />I don't believe in zombies, but if I did, this is how I'd imagine it. I like the fact that the entire series was shot with 16mm and shot in the south, Grantville, GA. The police chief says to beware if you visit between now and Sept. 20.<br />\\"Please plan your routes accordingly.  In addition, you may hear gun fire associated with the filming so don't be alarmed,\\" Interim Chief Jordan said.<br />In season two, our reluctant leader Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is taking the group of survivors to Fort Benning. They come across a traffic jam. While trying to clear the road to get the vehicles moving, a large group of walkers (what they call the zombies) approaches.<br />One of the small girls in the group, Sophia, is chased out from under the relative safety of the vehicle and becomes lost in the woods. Rick and Daryl Dixon, one of the tougher survivors, organize a search party.<br />Rick has a constant fight with other survivors about his decisions, plus his wife, Lori, is pregnant, but he doesn't know it. Thinking he was dead, she had an affair with his best friend and fellow officer, Shane Walsh.<br />While Rick, his son Carl and Shane are looking for Sophia, they come across a deer. The boy goes to pet the animal, when a shot from the opposite direction kills the deer, the bullet goes through and is lodged in Carl. They end up on a large isolated farm run by veterinarian, Hershel Greene.<br />Greene patches up the boy, but clearly doesn't want this new group staying. More conflict arrises when it's discovered he's locked several walkers in the barn, not wanting to kill them because some were family. This series never lets up.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|So far I have not been disappointed in any of Kathy's books This book is just as good as the last. I enjoy reading her books during my breaks at work when I am out eating or just having to waiting for an appointment but there are times I just can't put it down. I have 1 more book in her series and then I will be waiting for the next book and also the Viral:code series in March. Kathy keep up the excellent writing and Amazon thank you for the quick download on the Kindle.
B007V508CC|2.0|I've tried listening to Overexposed many, many times.  Each and every time, I completely lose interest in it.  Maroon 5 have put out some pretty good music in the past, but this album is so insipid!  Many songs sound exactly the same...which isn't helped by Adam Levine's over-dependence on his \\"Whoa-oh-oh-oh\\" over and over again.  Overexposed showcases a band who no longer know who they are, and I use the word \\"band\\" lightly, as anyone other than Levine is buried under heavy production.  They found success with \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" (an afterthought on Hands All Over), and just ran with it.  Going pure pop isn't a problem, but glittery production is only part of the equation.  This album sounds rushed.<br /><br />Buy their other albums...skip this one.
B007SGM084|5.0|I do not normally read books but everyone at work was reading the series so decided to give it a whirl and read it.  The book is very hard to put down.  I have not finished the whole series yet but know I will not be disappointed.  If this could be rated 100 stars I would rate it that high.  A must READ!!!!
0345803507|1.0|I borrowed these books from a friend after hearing raves from female friends that these were HOT.<br />NOT.<br />These books were the worst pieces of flotsam I've ever wasted my time with. I am glad I didn't pay for these.<br />Nothing was erotic. The two main characters, Ana and Grey, are so effed in the head that I couldn't really enjoy any interchange between them, social, emotional, or sexual.<br />I kept thinking this was a doormat Bella who fell in love with her killer/lover Edward.<br />Notice that both Edward and Grey have the same mussed-up copper colored hair?<br />Yeah, I don't think it's hot when a guy says he wants to beat you because you remind him of his mother.<br />This is where a normal, red-blooded, female would go screaming into the hills, AWAY from the emotional wreck, after putting a restraining order in place and getting a pistol permit and carrying a loaded Glock.<br />I love a good smut novel. And this couldn't even qualify. They're both messed up, have some sex, and argue, have some more sex.<br />I skip whole pages because I can't stand the pacing. It's so redundant.<br />And please, what person in the world would ever think to use the \\"inner-goddess\\" crap over and over again. I'd like to see Anastasia put a bullet to the inner-goddess's head. Seriously, I'd put these novels out in the out-house so that people can use them as TP. Not worth the cheap paper they're printed on.

B008B0QH5S|5.0|UPDATE: 9-24-2012 - OK, I have officially changed my review from FOUR stars to FIVE stars: again, this song matures with every listen: I'm loving 'Memory of the Future' now (I listed it as a 'miss' below), and the only song that seems to be the 'miss' for me is 'Hold On' at this point....This album is PERFECTION!...Give it a try and a few listens - it really ranks among their best!<br /><br />I remember first listening to this album and thought to my self 'this is the worst PSB album to date' - this happens to me quite often on many of their albums, but I know better because I'm pretty much a die-hard Pet-head, so I remembered the initial fave songs that got my attention on first listen ('Leaving' & 'Ego Music') and it grew on me pretty fast from there...<br /><br />Initially, the album sounded pretty 'tuneless' to me: it seemed as though it was pretty quiet most of the time, but then after those first couple of listens, you realize more and more sounds you didn't hear initially and the songs grow on you like a habit...Not only that, the 'meanings' of the songs and the Boys' classic writing in their music just showed up out of nowhere - I'm certain about third or fourth listen...I rated this one of their lowest for the first listen, but I'm now rating it VERY high on the list of best albums they've released - and their discography is a difficult one to rank every album because they are like individual kids - hard to rank and choose a favorite...<br /><br />The misses: 'Hold On' and 'Give it A Go' - I'm certain I will eventually like those songs, but not really loving them at the moment...<br /><br />The in-betweens: 'Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin', 'Winner' & 'Breathing Space' - 'Breathing Space' has grown on me, but not much while the other two are ok in their own right, the songwriting is incredible and meaningful...<br /><br />The hits (in current fave order): 'Leaving', 'Face Like That', 'Ego Music', 'Invisible', 'Your Early Stuff', 'Memory of the Future' - These songs are BAD-@SS!!!...I feel ashamed ranking them because sometimes 'Ego Music' I love more than 'Leaving', and 'Invisible' sometimes is better than 'Face Like That', but it goes with my mood...<br /><br />HOPES OF RELEASES: I hope they release 'Ego Music' and 'Face Like That' as I'm certain they could move the dancefloors with those songs and remixes of them - 'Face Like That' is THAT powerful to earn them another #1 Dance/Club hit and 'Ego Music' has that potential too...<br /><br />My mom passed away from ovarian cancer exactly one year ago tomorrow (September 13, 2011) and 'Leaving's' 2nd hook is powerful to me: the closing of that hook states 'and if our love is dead, it won't be dead for long'...It's one of my all-time faves from them and I can see mixed meanings for the song ('I know enough's enough and you're leaving, you've had enough time to decide on your freedom': this could mean a relationship to the masses, but for me it reminds me of pain my mom went through and how she 'decided to leave' this world, so I've kinda made my own definition, and it means a lot...<br /><br />Anyway, as with most PSB albums, this is a hard listen at first, but continuous listens will DEFINITELY make it one of the best albums you've heard all year - maybe even the last couple of years...I agree with many of the critics out there currently - this album is one of their finest!<br /><br />I'd give FOUR-AND-A-HALF STARS if I could, but I can't, so keep that in mind : )hese songs are BAD-@SS!!!...I feel ashamed ranking them because sometimes 'Ego Music' I love more than 'Leaving', and 'Invisible' sometimes is better than 'Face Like That', but it goes with my mood...<br /><br />HOPES OF RELEASES: I hope they release 'Ego Music' and 'Face Like That' as I'm certain they could move the dancefloors with those songs and remixes of them - 'Face Like That' is THAT powerful to earn them another #1 Dance/Club hit and 'Ego Music' has that potential too...<br /><br />My mom passed away from ovarian cancer exactly one year ago tomorrow (September 13, 2011) and 'Leaving's' 2nd hook is powerful to me: the closing of that hook states 'and if our love is dead, it won't be dead for long'...It's one of my all-time faves from them and I can see mixed meanings for the song ('I know enough's enough and you're leaving, you've had enough time to decide on your freedom': this could mean a relationship to the masses, but for me it reminds me of pain my mom went through and how she 'decided to leave' this world, so I've kinda made my own definition, and it means a lot...<br /><br />Anyway, as with most PSB albums, this is a hard listen at first, but continuous listens will DEFINITELY make it one of the best albums you've heard all year - maybe even the last couple of years...I agree with many of the critics out there currently - this album is one of their finest!<br /><br />I'd give FOUR-AND-A-HALF STARS if I could, but I can't, so keep that in mind : )

B000IFQLSW|5.0|I read a review which tells it all,<br /><br />\\"Kenny Wayne Shepherd's reverence for his musical roots are center-stage on Ten Days Out...Blues From The Backroads, an album that features the guitar slinger and Double Trouble rhythm section of bassist Tommy Shannon and drummer Chris Layton performing with some of the greatest blues players of our time as well as lesser-known but historically significant bluesmen. Traveling to their hometowns to record everywhere from juke joints to front porches, from New Orleans to Kansas, Shepherd celebrates and becomes part of blues history with Ten Days Out...Blues From The Backroads.\\"<br /><br />Shepherd took home the 1998 and 2001 Orville H.

An assembling of Shepherd's heroes. \\"But never before has Shepherd sounded so at home amongst his unlikely peers as on \\"10 Days Out: Blues From the Backroads\\". From initial concept to choice of artists and songs to production and final performances, Shepherd and his collaborators are cast in a most flattering light.\\"<br /><br />Shepherd selfishly supports his idols, history in the making.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Package arrived sooner than was estimated(1st Awesome!)the item came in its eye catching display case begging to be veiwed right away, so I did. Popping the disc in was like taking a trip back in time to when I first watched the movie only 1000 times better the enhancements to blu-ray were quite wonderful and welcomed,which caused me to see parts of the movie I must have missed before. I was thrilled that the story still held my intrest, almost had a feeling as though I was watching it for the first time. I am fully satisfied with this collection and the captains summit was the icing on the cake. I will now add this to my Star Trek:Next Generation movie collection.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This series certainly held my interest.  Gave insight to a whole different side of relationships that I have not been familiar with, up until now.  Thought the biting of the lower lip and the cocking of ones head to the side was over done.  Loved the e-mail portions and looked forward to each of the responses. Now getting ready to read the third book and will see if the outocme is as I expect.  Hard to guess where it will go.  This series, while informative, is certainly not for anyone that is shy or sexually suppressed.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|Been using it for about a week now with SanDisk SD cards.  As others wrote, this thing is really really fast.  It makes all my SanDisk SD cards come to life!  Until now, I've been using USB 2.0 based card readers.  And I've never seen the transfer speed that the card manufacturer claimed.  Now, with this Transcend reader, ALL my SanDisk SD cards EXCEED their claimed transfer speed!  WOW!  For instance, on my 64GB SanDisk card claiming 30MB/s transfer speed, the read speed is coming out to (if I remember correctly) at about 40MB/s.  Write speed is less (don't remember right now ... but I think that's to do with the card not the reader) ... but still significantly higher than with the USB based card readers.<br /><br />As for installation, downloading and installing the driver was pretty straight forward.  No issues there.<br /><br />I'm loving this thing.  Using it with a Dell laptop.  Now, I want to make sure all my laptops in the future has express card slots so I can install this reader!

The problem is you read book one and it is OK, so you then read book 2, and you realize there is not much there, sort of a filler,so you need to read book 3 thinking the story will get  better, but it just doesn't!

B0042RJWTC|5.0|I have just finished watching the entire series in about two weeks. \\"The Tudors\\" is an extraordinary piece of televison. There have been many films and shows about the topic but I think this one wins the award as the most addictive. It is action packed and incredibly beautiful to look at. The art direction and camera work are flawless. The writers clearly take literary licence with some of the historical facts in the narrative--as well as the time frames but that does not deflect in any way in \\"The Tudors\\" as this is a glossy TV soap opera not The History Channel.<br /><br />On top of the slick production is the acting most notably the star, who by the end of the four seasons has aged considerably leaving a lmost never to be forgotten climax. I didn't want it to end and when it did it was hard to forget it. I will surely watch it again.
630289915X|5.0|Here I am, just another reviewer acknowledging the immortal significance of this gritty but sentimental, sometimes harsh but more often joyous, deliberate but life-affirming treasure that is \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" (hereafter \\"Wonderful Life\\").  Do I have a new perspective on \\"Wonderful Life\\"?  Maybe, but I doubt it, but here goes:  It has often struck me how \\"Wonderful Life\\" is sort of the inversion and distorted reflection of \\"A Christmas Carol\\".<br /><br />  George Bailey and Ebenezer Scrooge - can any two characters be more diametrically opposed? George is kind-hearted, thoughtful of others, beloved by the citizenry; Ebenezer is uncaring, misanthropic, and treated with fearful disregard.  The only thing they seem to have in common is that both are industrious and, surprisingly, both dissatisfied with their lots.  However, although rich with public esteem, George admits his despondent dissatisfaction with his relatively \\"poor\\" financial status. Conversely, although rich with material goods, Ebenezer harbors dissatisfaction with his relatively poor social/human status, that is, his alienation, though he will hardly admit this.  In a subtle, distorted way, George and Ebenezer kinda want what the other has - the only difference is, ironically, what Ebenezer subconsciously wants is better than what George wants.<br /><br />  Of course, both men receive spiritual intervention and of course, get a glimpse of their futures.  Only difference is, George receives a vision of what the future would be if he did not continue his altruistic ways, while Scrooge receives a vision of what the future would be if he DID continue his selfish, parsimonious ways.  For both men, both visions promise stark oblivion (in different ways, of course).  Both men's future visions, for different reasons, convince them that selfless interaction with society is the path to bliss; George just needed to be reminded of it, while Ebenezer needed a remedial course.<br /><br />  Therefore, in my opinion, many parallelisms and common themes exist between \\"Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Christmas Carol\\" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.n, many parallelisms and common themes exist between \\"Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Christmas Carol\\" besides the obvious fact that both tales are Christmas (and universal) classics.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I never review, but this series was recommended to me by so many people and I found myself struggling to get through it and questing their taste in literature. Now I love a good romance novel, but it has to have a story and some substance, these have neither. It some dialogue then sex, and that's about it. I found the main characters obnoxious and very hard to like. I kept finding myself buying the next book hoping it would get better and being disappointed!
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I gave this a bad review but I've changed my mind. The energy on this recording is toned down a lot but play this loud and you will hear the tracks better and Billy doing a lot of cool, funky things (like the background boogie line in \\"I gotsta get paid\\"). \\"Have a little Mercy\\" sounds like a great old, standard rhythm/blues tune. I think if tracks were mixed better (guitar more up front to accent the guitar tone) it could have been a very cool album but Billy is still as colorful as ever and the coolest guitarist alive. Guitar tone (and other tracks) are not super defined in the mix as they usually are on \\"Antenna\\", \\"Eliminator\\", \\"Deguello\\", etc. Sounds almost like a live studio recording which is what Rick Rubin wanted to achieve I guess and the songs are very simple and not a ton of production went into it.
B00846REIS|3.0|I did not like this book as much as 50 Shades of Grey. It seems like a \\"copy cat\\" novel even though I am not sure who wrote theirs first. Lots of sex but not as sentual as I would have prefered.
B0086449YA|4.0|Mark Knopfler's seventh solo album is his first double-CD release, but the quality and diversity of its 20 original songs amply justify issuing two discs. He toured Europe with Bob Dylan last year and will tour with him in North America this fall, so it's tempting to speculate that working alongside the world's most eminent living songwriter may have sharpened Mark's game and made him more prolific. (They've been playing and recording together off and on since 1979.)<br /><br />In interviews, Knopfler likens traveling with a band to sailing the world with a crew of brigands, which is what privateers once did during times of war. They were authorized by governments to attack foreign cargo ships, plundering them for booty in order to weaken the enemy. They didn't sink vessels, only commandeered them, and this is akin to what Mark and his band do when they play, capturing new fans who who join those that have followed him since the days of Dire Straits.<br /><br />The songs on \\"Privateering\\" are consistently low-key, character-driven, beautifully written stories of scoundrels on the run and people on the down-and-out, including the opening track, \\"Redbud Tree\\": \\"I crouch in dread / Discovery my certain death / Her leaves reaching for my head / As I suspend my breath / Redbud tree shelter me, shelter me.\\"<br /><br />The song \\"Haul Away\\" introduces a nautical sound, complete with a Celtic penny whistle, fiddle, and accordion, and a theme of lost love. The album then shifts to a great blues tune, \\"Don't Forget Your Hat,\\" featuring steel slide guitar and harmonica: \\"Look out the window / Never saw so much rain / You better get down to the station / If you wanna catch that train / So long, I guess that's that / Hey hey, don't forget your hat.\\"<br /><br />From trains, Knopfler returns to a song of the sea on the title track, which makes it clear that privateers were little better than pirates. The charmingly simple \\"Miss You Blues\\" follows (though it's not actually a blues), as does the gently rocking \\"Corn Beef City,\\" a truck-driving song that reflects the hard economic times we're living through: \\"You don't ask questions when there's nothing in the bank / You gotta feed the kids and put the diesel in the tank.\\"<br /><br />As one might expect, \\"Go, Love\\" is a sad song of farewell, while \\"Hot or What\\" switches back to the blues for some amusing first-person braggin' and harmonica blowin' from a lucky gambler. The first CD closes with \\"Yon Two Crows,\\" the tale of a muddy shepherd, and the touching, evocative \\"Seattle,\\" about a pair of disillusioned dreamers in my rainy hometown: \\"I still believe that there's somewhere for us / But now it's something that we don't discuss / You're the best thing I ever knew / Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to / Seattle.\\"<br /><br />Opening disc two is a second Celtic melody entitled \\"Kingdom of Gold.\\" Its lyrics describe the dire fate of buccaneers who attack a powerful medieval king: \\"His axes and armor will conquer these devils / The turbulent raiders will falter and fall / Their leaders be taken, their camps burned and leveled / They'll hang in the wind from his citadel walls.\\"<br /><br />Next up is \\"Got to Have Something,\\" a basic blues tune about whiskey and guns, succeeded by the wistful, jazz-tinged \\"Radio City Serenade,\\" a nostalgic love song to New York City, and \\"I Used to Could,\\" a lively honky-tonk number about a bad boy and his GMC Cannonball truck. \\"Gator Blood\\" is Southern-fried roots music with wailing pedal steel guitar, while \\"Bluebird\\" is another melancholy blues about a farmer who's run out of luck. The beautiful gloom continues with \\"Dream of the Drowned Submariner\\" and \\"Blood and Water,\\" but Knopfler finally allows us a bit of happiness on the blues shuffle \\"Today Is OK,\\" in which a boxer addresses his girlfriend:<br /><br />\\"Baby, you can read my mind / I'll be home just after nine<br />You're the best medicine I know / Tonight we're gonna let it all go<br />Put on that pretty silk shirt / Put on that tight black skirt<br />Put on those heels so black / We can party on when I get back\\"<br /><br />The album ends with a cute bit of Americana that looks at Jack \\"After the Bean Stalk.\\" Like much of \\"Privateering,\\" it's country and bluesy, warm and wry. Nothing flashy, just good, comfortable music you can relax into.ty silk shirt / Put on that tight black skirt<br />Put on those heels so black / We can party on when I get back\\"<br /><br />The album ends with a cute bit of Americana that looks at Jack \\"After the Bean Stalk.\\" Like much of \\"Privateering,\\" it's country and bluesy, warm and wry.

You may want to watch only after the kiddies are down for the night as themes are very mature and there is graphic violence of a particularly creepy twisted type and LOTS of blood.<br /><br />If this is your idea of fun, this is most definitely a must see series. A serial killer you can love, the ultimate bad boy.<br /><br />All good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|First of all this book was EXCELLENT! Yes, the beginning leads you to believe the sex will be a little on the S&M side but dig deeper. Look past the actual sex acts to what sex means to the characters. The story is not about the sex, it's about love changing people. Christian goes from a self centered, pervert and control freak to someone that begins to grow out of that phase. He begins to trust and do things because he loves not because he wants. And, yes, the sex is at an extreme level but please look at your own promiscuity in your 20's before you judge. I was skeptical at first but am very glad I decided to read it because it wasn't what people had been talking about.
0345529057|5.0|This Box Set was a gift for my Son who is incarcerated . He didn't waste any time letting me know how pleased he was with this order. RR Martain being on top of his reading list for a long time is anxious for the next Book of the series. I order all reading material through Amazon for him, It's easy, convenient and gets to him without any problems, every time. Amazon Rocks. And about this set, I'm sure it will get thumbs up from all who order.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great story line with lots of action and plenty of plot twists.  I've always been a Baldacci fan and this book is one more reason to keep reading.
B008JAGG38|2.0|The first 2 American Pie movies were hilarious. They brought an age old joke to the films.  But with this sequel we see the same old story line from most of those \\"Reunion\\" movies, where old characters reunite in older age.<br />This film had its good moments, but not worth multiple watches and I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a funny night.

0061730335|5.0|William's story of faith, perseverence and his quest to follow his dreams is amazing. At the young age of 14, his trials have been more difficult than many of us will face our whole lives. After famine in his village of Malawi Africa forces him to drop out of school, he still hungers for knowledge. He begins studying at the library. There he comes across a book on electricity generated by windmills and decides to build one hiimself. He dreams of producing enough power to light his whole village and irrigate his father's farm. He later tells others, \\"I try and I made it\\" a motto for all of us to live by. His hope for an educated, independent Africa is truly inspiring. \\"Africans bend what little they have to their will every day. Using creativity, they overcome Africa's challenges. Where the world sees trash, Africa recycles. Where the world sees junk, Africa sees rebirth.\\"
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Read the first 2 books couldn't resist reading the last one.  Enjoyed all 3 of them and not quite finished the 3rd book but so far so good
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I really like this movie. It's a quirky fantasy story about a boy on his journey of discovery to become a man. This is a very fun movie to watch. I'd very much liken it to The Princess Bride.<br /><br />There is some violence, so you may want to give it a quick review before allowing children to watch. However, I think in all the content is handled gracefully, and doesn't go over the top just to have done so.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version of this movie is not as high quality as it should be. But still well worth the upgrade from DVD if you have the devices to play it on.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|ok so ive been into this band since the first album and enjoyed every album they have made since...but dear god what happened...this new album is ear raped at best...every song is pure shit...i wanted to like this album but jesus ther is only so much a real metal fan can take...i agree with another reviewer on amazon here go get testaments new album dark roots of the earth or anthrax new album worship musik both are albums of the year for metal records and you would like them much better then this abourtion of an album...please maria get it together and put out something better then this crap...looks can only go so far
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Just picked up the CD 6 days ago and haven't stopped listening to it.  I loved Rush in the 70's and 80's.  I loved many of their songs in the 90's and 00's, but Clockwork Angels is something truly special.  In my humble opinion, it's their best yet.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that state this album is some kind of return to glory.  I don't agree.  This is something altogether new.  Just like we're observing them through a looking glass on the galapagos islands, they have clearly evolved.<br /><br />I spent Saturday pressure cleaning, but it would be my first couple hours spent with Clockwork Angels.  The first couple of times through the album, I envisioned this Steampunk world and the kid that longed for (and got) more.  Then, as happens so many times with Rush, I started thinking back on my life through the lyrics and themes of the songs.  So, while my neighbors 'thought' I was working, I was running through the nooks and crannies of my life, one song at a time.<br /><br />Caravan just might make you go back to your own beginning, before all of the choices that would bring your lifetime of adventure.  BU2B made me think of the belief systems I naturally learned from my parents, and how they changed through my life. (BU2B2)  I defy you not to let Halo Effect send you down some time passages to some girlfriends/boyfriends that you saw through rose colored glasses.  You'll be surprised about your own Seven Cities of Gold, and how all of those places made you who you are.  The Wreckers reminded me of the times I needed to have my guard up, but didn't.  The experiences brought wisdom, but something was lost, too.  Wish them well hits home with a reminder that I need to keep the past just where it is, and be long on mercy with people.  Wrapping up with the Garden...I'm reminded that I tend it daily, and I'm always planting, watering or destroying (If I'm not careful) something.<br /><br />A pedlar approached me and asked, \\"What do you lack?\\"  I responded, \\"Musically, nothing at all.\\"ly, nothing at all.\\"
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This was my first Kindle book purchase. I am now hooked.<br />I bought the book because of the low price on the kindle store and good reviews. I was not disappointed.<br />Great Character development, interesting plot, and original setting.<br />It is very hard to find originality in Fantasy books anymore, it has all been done it seems.<br />Definitely worth the read. I only regret was i did not pick a series that was fully released and I have to wait for the next book.<br />This is a very engaging book and it will be hard to wait for the next one.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Having read every \\"Reacher\\" novel and even having turned my wife and her mother (and several friends) into fans, I am extremely disappointed.  It starts out fine but in a short period it becomes less interesting than watching grass grow.<br /><br />Given the outrageous, and illegal, price and the poor, slow as molasses story to boot, I give it a one star minus.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so good I didn't want to put it down!  It's the kind of book that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I really enjoyed the read. Very suspenseful. Instantly loved the characters, felt like I really knew them. Only down side is that I had to remind myself that it was actually written for young people. Sad that violence is so acceptable with our youth. Lets hope that our world doesn't turn into this type of scenario.
0307474275|5.0|(Disclaimer: Before I submit my review, I must state on record that I do not believe Dan Brown's premise that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and that they had children.)<br /><br />Now,onto the review. I came across this book in the library (after having it on hold for a very long time). I had just finished reading [[ASIN:0440508274 How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day]] , so I was intrigued by another book that said there was something more to Leonardo Da Vinci. This book definitely added to that suspicion!<br /><br />Overall, the book has all of the elements of a Hollywood thriller-exotic locations, car chases, controversial topics, mystery race against time, intrigue plot twists and turns. It is also a guaranteed page turner (454 pages). Once you start reading and really delve into the book , you will not be able to put it down. This is not the key to the book, rather the key is the author's ability to turn some of history's greatest unanswered questions (What is Mona Lisa really smiling at? What is the Holy Grail?) and turning into a fast-paced thriller that questions the basis of several widely held assumptions. This creates a puzzle and that's what keep you reading<br /><br />This is my second time reading this book, so a lot more is clearer than the first time. On that note, here are my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros-As mentioned above, it is a fast-paced thriller with plot twists and intelligent characters (especially the lead characters  Harvard Professor Langdon Brown and the cryptographer Sophie). The research in this book, which would normally be a detriment to other books, is a strength because it fuels the whole book and leaves you wondering questions like \\"Was there something to that?\\" As you read, you will take an interesting journey through history, art and literature that is not discussed in the history book (partly because some of it hasn't been proven).<br /><br />Cons-One of the (minor) downsides to this book is that the characters and plot elements are nearly identical to two other Robert Langdon books I have read: [[ASIN:B003A02WR6 Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]] and [[ASIN:0307950689 The Lost Symbol]]- Langdon is called into action, a young, attractive lady who has some relation to the murdered individual in question helps him the quest, police don't have a clue, secret society that is seeking to grow its power, fringe group within that secret society uses an individual to conduct symbolic murder. Another minor downside is the fact that Robert Langdon seems to know an awful lot (almost too much at times!) Going through the book, I was like \\"How did he know that?\\")<br /><br />Additional Guidance<br />The premise of the book is the most contentious part of the book. If you can get past that, you are actually get to a well-written story.<br /><br />The ending was a little weak. I still don't know exactly where the Holy Grail was kept and why they fought so hard to hide it, when they apparently were still looking in the wrong place.That being said, I also believed that it wrapped up too neatly. At the end, Robert Langdon walks off to the sunset, with another adventure under his belt. All of the bad guys are put away and life goes on.. Too clichethis book is that the characters and plot elements are nearly identical to two other Robert Langdon books I have read: [[ASIN:B003A02WR6 Angels & Demons: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]] and [[ASIN:0307950689 The Lost Symbol]]- Langdon is called into action, a young, attractive lady who has some relation to the murdered individual in question helps him the quest, police don't have a clue, secret society that is seeking to grow its power, fringe group within that secret society uses an individual to conduct symbolic murder.

B0035JRUZQ|5.0|The Duke at his best. Robert Mitchum as a likeable drunk. James Cann as a kid with a funny hat that can't shoot straight.Great ensamble. Lots of humor as well as shoot-em-up drama. Excellent western!
B000TGCR3I|5.0|There are already a wealth of reviews on this anime movie so I'll put it simply: If you are looking for an anime movie with something different, amazing, and out of the ordinary, then you will want to buy this movie. Especially with such a great price. Dubbing is also well done.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Very different plot. Rich shiek likes to fish, so he hires an English engineer to build him a dam and stock the river with salmon. Involves a love triangle that has a happy ending. Beautiful photography. Just a nice, warm, happy story, with, of course, a few twists to keep it interesting. Missed it on the big screen. Glad I bought it to watch at home in Blue Ray.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|This is worth the buy when it makes it to the 5-7 dollar bargain bluray bin, so if it gets there pick it up. The previews before the movie should have been a clue this is a B-movie, nothing more. To be fair I watched the extended cut, the shorter version may be less painful...lol
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Some quick thoughts on \\"Paul\\":<br /><br />It's a film that I feel had a chance to do something really funny but fell short of a parody of science fiction and comic book fans.<br /><br />Two British guys come to the USA and want to see San Diego's Comicon. I've been there and crossing the street should be a major crowd experience, but not this one. A bit unreal. The run-in with the bored attendee who is signing autographs for money was pretty realistic. I could name a couple of celebrities here in this review who seem to care more about money than about their fans, but I won't go there. Let's say that was fairly accurate.<br /><br />Rather than lampoon the largest comic book convention in North America, we jump into an RV and head out to the Area 51, home of Roswell stories and such - in between gay jokes and a confusion to a Latino man what is meant by \\"alien.\\"<br /><br />When Paul is picked up he turns out to be an alien who has escaped abduction. The boys' reactions are not typical and was the source of some fun moments.<br /><br />The kidnapping of the woman who was a Bible believer was somewhat insulting: the writers' apparent confusion between Evangelicalism and Christian Science was odd as well as their take on people who believe in Creationism are somehow crazy. I don't believe that, but the writer's take on religion was off-putting and not at all what I was expecting - a story of an alien and his boys traveling to The Devil's Tower (thanks Steven Spielberg).<br /><br />Fun moments with the idea that Spielberg got his ideas for E.T. and Close Encounters through an alien, that we have the Star Wars Cantina music playing in a redneck bar, and poking fun at redneck Arizona cops, but the film was all over the place and really was not that funny.<br /><br />Recommended for comics and sci-fi fans, but for religious people, not so much.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|...ok industry standard is the boss tuner,costs alot,they break,look on ebay youll find inop ones for more than the behringer costs new,I play out regularly use the tuner all night,stomp it pretty hard still works great,the true line thru off mode when tuning is noiseless and allows you to change instruments without \\"banging\\" the pa or your amp when you unplug at the guitar end.Available behringer power supply is compact and saves on buying 9v batteries(adapter is as cheap as a 2-pack of 9vs!)buy a boss and dont stomp it cause it can break without the metal case cracking,or buy the behringer and stomp it within reason and you can buy and break 3 or 4 of them and still be ahead!

B003VANOFY|4.0|I work from home. I write for a living. I spend ALL day every day at the computer writing -- and my favorite way to relax at home is playing games. While I cringe to admit it, it's fair to say that I might spend more time with these headphones on my head on a given day than I spend with them off. If anybody has stress-tested these things...it's me.<br /><br />This is my second pair of G930s, and before I bought the G930s, I had the G35s, which are essentially just the wired version.<br /><br />They aren't without problems. My first pair went into the trash when the plastic fitting at the top of the ear cup on the left side -- into which the metal size adjustment rail is slotted -- simply broke. The plastic had gotten tired with time (and my taking the headphones on and off), and shattered in such a way that it would have been impossible to fix it without a lot of tape. Tape + proximity to my hair = no thanks. Aside from that structural failure, the headphones were fine; they still sounded great, and the mic worked perfectly. (Prior to buying logitech headphones, I had a pair of Razer headphones, and they also broke at the top of the ear cup, so I don't think that this is a problem exclusive to the G930s -- I think anything you take on and off of your head repeatedly, with swiveling plastic parts that can be torqued, is at some risk of breaking eventually.)<br /><br />This second pair of headphones has lost tension on the microphone arm -- whatever mechanism inside allowed it to have tension to raise and lower in different positions is no longer situated properly, so the mic sags. I've rigged it by tucking a bit of folded paper behind the 'elbow' of the mic where it joins the cup, but needless to say, it isn't ideal. Aside from that, the headphones work properly.<br /><br />Both headphones have had some weird issues with turning on and off when plugged in. This is an issue mainly when used with windows, as the headphones will automatically turn off after a certain length of time if they receive no incoming sounds (or possibly any input on the mic). When that happens, I find it easiest to unplug the headset, turn it back on, and then plug it back in.<br /><br />Obviously, I liked these enough to buy a second pair despite the price tag and minor issues. For my purposes, they're a great fit: they're comfortable to wear for long periods of time; they sit comfortably around my ears rather than pressing on them. They're a little bit heavy, but most headphones of this size will have some weight -- and whatever battery these have in them usually gives me eight or more continuous hours of use before I have to plug them in (which isn't a huge inconvenience, because the charging station and cord are fairly lengthy). The 7.1 is really well done, with a what feels to me like an expansive soundstage that's *great* for gaming -- I never have trouble pinpointing where in the 3D space a certain sound is coming from. The mic is good...almost too sensitive, as sometimes the people I'm in vent with will tell me that the sound of my sink running sounds like a garbage disposal! Generally, though, they say the quality of output is clear and solid.<br /><br />The programmable keys on the side are pretty useful, though I wouldn't mind if the driver software were updated to include other programs like Skype or Mumble.<br /><br />A few last points: sometimes, USB headphones, particularly surround sound USB headphones, do not get along with certain game titles. There can be weird static, dropped sounds, or other shenanigans, and though this is really rare, it's pretty frustrating if, like me, you rely on the headphones entirely for sound (living as I do in an apartment with neighbors who probably wouldn't appreciate listening to virtual gunfire late in the evening). Occasionally, the driver software will decrease the mic volume on its own, or scroll the headset volume downward, without being told to. Little problems like this are usually easily fixed by unplugging the USB receiver and plugging it back in to refresh the device (and then turning the headset on fresh afterward).<br /><br />None of these are dealbreakers. I'll admit I've done a little bit of research on other wireless gaming headsets in light of these little nagging issues, but I have yet to find one that offered me the same utility and sound quality as this pair of headphones does. If you're willing to deal with a wired connection, I think there are probably better deals out there...but if you're looking for a set of excellent wireless headphones, I think as of the writing of this review, you can't really do any better than the G930s.nplugging the USB receiver and plugging it back in to refresh the device (and then turning the headset on fresh afterward).<br /><br />None of these are dealbreakers.

B008Y2IU12|4.0|I thought about watching the movie several times but passed it by because of the two reviews with three stars I'd read. Now I'm glad I went ahead and rented it. I wanted to give it five stars and why I didn't in a bit. First, Charlize Theron...amazing. I enjoyed her more in this movie than any other I've seen her in, especially after \\"Young Adult\\"-I swore I'd dislike her forever due to the character she played (yeah, dumb) and the lousy acting. But in this film, she shined! Her acting and the beautiful and sometimes haunting special effects were mesmerizing. Chris Helmsworth did a stellar job and the dwarves had me rooting for them. Now the reason for the four stars and not five: Kristen Stewart. Her performance was lackluster, boring, phoned-in. She wasn't quite as insipid as she is in the Twilight movies but I had to work up enthusiasm for a character that should have easily inspired me. I agree with that much of the other reviews: Should have gotten someone, ANYone else, to play the part of the princess.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|I first heard about this film after purchasing human centipede 1 and 2,it was reccomended as being sicker than those films. That was an understatment. This film is so vile netflix took it off its service. Having said that I must say if you are a fan of horror/porn this is for you. It was as disturbing as it was disgusting but I couldn't stop watching. When it was over I felt what the hell did I just see and how could someone make this. The only thing I didn't like was that it was subtitled but don't let that stop you from buying what is probably the sickest film ever made
B003XVYLDU|1.0|If you actually liked reading \\"Cat's Cradle\\", then here's another gem especially for you!<br />This is a book designed to torture honors English students in high school!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Like all good science fiction, Wool uses the future setting to focus on the human element.  A particular plus of this book is it is really several people's stories tied together by a common thread.  Howey does a great job of creating compelling characters in which the reader becomes emotionally invested.  Through the five stories the reader gets to meet several diferent people all worth getting to know.  I would easily recommend Wool.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|Most definetly one of the best novels I've read, this along with its 2 accompanying novels are by far the best written I've read. Such an original plot and the storyline is amazing. I wish there were more than 3 books!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I could not put in down. Every character is perfect and the story just makes you want more, so far I'm on the 3rd book and I can't put it down. Love it!!
B006H5120E|5.0|My wife and I already love this film, but really wanted the 3d blu ray edition.  I was a little surprised the movie was split over 2 disks.  I thought there was room for a movie this size even in 3d on a single disk.  Anyway, it's not that big of a problem for me.<br /><br />The bluray 3d picture is beautiful.  It shows how James Cameron had his hand in the tranfer to blu ray and 3d.  The sound is also very good.  I find though a lot of DTS blu ray movies have the dialogue very low, and the sound effects very high. This movie is the same.<br /><br />I have probably watched this movie 20 times in the theatre and dvd since it first was released.  I never really get tired of it.  This release really makes it better.<br /><br />One comment on the 3d.  I find most 3d movies on TV provide a great deal of depth, but very little in the way of protruding things coming at you.  This movie showed an amazing amount of depth and clarity which is appropriate for this type of movie.  Absolutely great.  If you liked this movie before, you will love it on blu ray and 3d.  James Cameron is responsible for so many of my favorite movies. Cameron and Spielberg. Cameron's Avatar, Aliens, anf Terminator 2 plus Titanic makes him a great director, creator and technician.  ENJOY!
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|A \\"must\\" for Andre Rieu fans!  Recorded and filmed  \\"live\\", in the Maestro's hometown in the Netherlands. A beautiful concert, and almost as good as being there, but of course, not quite!<br />However, this is a very close \\"second\\" place.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|...is the credit George Martin said should be on Let It Be and that is one of many amazingly candid comments Sir George Martin reveals to the viewer in this stunning film. It would be easy to come up with more questions than they got to about this or that but truly ...this is a watershed documentary. One of my favorite things of this documentary is that the subject is still alive and participates actively in the process which is great, and so many legends he produced participated. Both of these things are far too rare and lend not only an authenticity to the proceedings but glimpses into the true admiration these artists have for George and him to their work...and so much fun to know that George Martin was playing the little piano part on America's song Tin Man and so many other fun anecdotes. Only Barry Gibb comes close to matching George Martin's record of producing #1 hits.  And lets not forget that besides all the recording stuff which is considerable and great...this documentary is so well rounded that it gives us many glimpses into Sir George's personal life even beginning with the love of his life and the story of them meeting at the start of his career with EMI! This is something I will watch over and over and besides the 1 and 1/2 hour doc there is another hour of bonus interview footage with things like current legendary producers (Rick Rubin among others)discussing how Sir George changed the rules for producing and other topics they couldn't squeeze into the proper film ...just the kind of special feature DVDs and Blu Rays should have!
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I would not recommend this one, especially not for youth. The story line was ok.  But I did not like the incestuous or homosexual aspects of the story. (I know they were not really related, but they still acted on emotions when they thought they were related) Even omitting that, it was ok, not captivating.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|I've been a fan of Woody Allen's movies since before the Annie Hall and Sleeper days and have seen this same story and characters before.  Actually, a few times before.  Midnight in Paris makes you feel as if your watching snippets of much of his previous work stiched together and put on screen.  This film feels like an Annie Hall/Manhattan/Stardust Memories/Radio Days retread which is sad because I really wanted to like it.  Sorry, not this time.

The only issue I have with this game is the background colors don't change thus making it hard to see some of the pieces shape. The puzzles are pretty and have some challenge. I totally enjoy this app.

B0094OLFUW|2.0|One of the few albums I actually looked forward to this year and knew the release date for.  Instead this is too minimal, too slow, and just overall very average. With all the really cool remixes out there I was really hoping for a mix of sounds like the last album with some aggressive songs as well as this slow, very sad sounding album. I realize this has been said more or less in previous reviews, but wanted to restate it in hopes that people will actually reconsider buying this album.  Stream it and preview it somewhere before buying as its not for everyone.

1451629192|5.0|I dont think I took a breath for the first 3 chapters. I had such a vivid picture of what jaycee was describing. I was absolutly in a state of shock that she went through that and was so brave. This story and her words stay with me and I found myself praying and thanking god for her safety, As horrible as it was three miracles happened: her two daughters and Jaycee survived, no one died. Now they can thrive. God Bless you Jaycee.

Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were sent away to a professor's house in England during a time of war.  One day a simple game of hide and go seek found them in an adventure in a world called Narnia where through an evil queen (Satan like) made it always winter. However through the union of the children (Sons and Daughters of Eve) and Aslan (a portrayal of GOD and Jesus), they have the ability to conquer evil,and restore peace to Narnia.  To find out more, read to see what trials and tribulations the children face throughout their journey to save Narnia and restore peace.
B007BZM30M|5.0|It's not maybe,it's a definite yes from me.Sounds similar to Britney Spears in some ways.I've heard this song played at stadiums,resorts,shopping malls,grocery stores and wherever else I happened to run into it and just had to have it.The video for this song featuring members of the US olympic team is one of the best I've ever seen.Very catchy and fun song to listen to with an infectious beat.Feels like 1999 all over again.A feel good tune that will lift your spirits up.Definitely belongs in the bubble gum pop category but if that's your thing,I highly recommend this.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Jiro's philosophy on work cracked me up!!! One of his rules: Don't complain. He's a wise man (and a little bit of a hard ass) but such a hard-working human being. Great film for food lovers, great film about perseverance and the strength of the human spirit!
8862931921|5.0|I love these sketchbooks. I used to try and buy the cheaper Canson sketchbooks but continually found big problems with them from bleeding to just falling apart. I finally realized there wasn't that much cost difference per page between this and a cheaper sketchbook, even at my local art store, so I bought one and I've never looked back. The paper texture is wonderful to draw on, it holds everything from ink to sharpies and Prismacolor marker well. Even Watercolor can go on it. Watercolor acts a bit weird on the pages but creates very pretty drips that you can't get on regular paper and doesn't buckle badly at all.<br /><br />My only complaint, and the reason I've come to favor their watercolor sketchbook, is the slight cream tint that the paper has and the way  it turns white if you erase on it.

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Reading a book upon which a movie is based is a two-edged sword. I read the excellent trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but had lowered my expectations based on lukewarm reviews of the movie.<br /><br />So, I entered the movie thinking of the compromises I'd be willing to accept. What little I did end up enjoying was mainly because of a few performances by A-list actors, and none of them was fully developed. These teaser roles, which ultimately disappointed, include:  Effie Trinket, Haymitch, Caesar, Cinna, and others. Katniss' mother, the great Paula Malcomson from Deadwood fame, had about two brief scenes. The great Woody Harrelson as Haymitch never really got off the ground.<br /><br />Key gripe: Jennifer Lawrence is fetching, but not that believable as this incredible archer, hunter and woodsman. Lawrence was not in physical shape for such a stellar role and if she can really handle a bow and arrow I'd be surprised. If you want to see someone handle a bow and arrow, watch Sly Stallone in the final chapter of the Rambo series. Lawrence has no body definition, she couldn't run worth a lick and her chubby baby face may be suited for the Pom Pon squad at a local high school, but she was no Linda Hamilton in the Terminator series, or Natalie Portman in Black Swan.<br /><br />In this era of super believable action movies - Sylvester Stallone's physicality in the Rocky series, DeNiro playing Jake Lamotta, Will Smith's unbelievable boxing skill and conditioning in \\"Ali\\" biop, Matt Damon in the Bourne series, Mark Wahlberg in the football movie \\"Invincible\\" - the HG action was pedestrian at best.<br /><br />The action scenes in general were VERY POORLY done, more like the \\"action\\" in the original Batman and Superman TV shows 40 years ago.<br /><br />The stunts and action were very brief, I guess, to cover up how unrealistic they were. The costuming of all the tributes was lame, one almost undistinguishable from another - more like cheap Halloween costumes. After the spectacular costumes, makeup, stunts, sets and music in movies like Batman, Superman, Dick Tracy and others, Hunger Games was a huge disappointment, IMHO.<br /><br />The only sets that were semi-impressive were in Panem's capital and that had a lot of CGI I'm sure.<br /><br />But the early scenes in District 12, Katniss and Peeta's district, were totally unremarkable, looking more like Appalachian coal mining country in Coal Miner's Daughter. The arena, the focus of the entire series, had a cornucopia that looked as if it had been constructed in an afteroon out of cardboard painted metallic, and sitting in a field that looked like a summer camp softball diamond.<br /><br />And music? I don't even remember the music, so \\"Hoosiers\\" it ain't.<br /><br />Here's the thing; people really really wanted to like this movie. But, to be honest, I can only give it two stars, 2.5 at most.<br /><br />NOTE: I also entered the movie anticipating something good because the director, Gary Ross, made my favorite movie of the decade, \\"Seabiscuit\\".r costumes, makeup, stunts, sets and music in movies like Batman, Superman, Dick Tracy and others, Hunger Games was a huge disappointment, IMHO.<br /><br />The only sets that were semi-impressive were in Panem's capital and that had a lot of CGI I'm sure.<br /><br />But the early scenes in District 12, Katniss and Peeta's district, were totally unremarkable, looking more like Appalachian coal mining country in Coal Miner's Daughter.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book and I think Gillian Flynn could easily become one of my favorite writers.  This is not my usual genre but I think she is very witty and I loved the way this book was written.  This is certainly a page-turner!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I had seen the movie \\"A Good Year\\" before and loved it so much I wanted to own it.  It is the type of movie you can watch over and over.  Although it could be considered a \\"chick flick\\", both my teenage sons watched and enjoyed it, as does my husband.  Just a feel good movie, with pretty scenery.

B0014WSWTY|3.0|Another original-instrument performance of Beethoven's symphonies.  What makes these different from the many other such cycles currently available on disc centers around three points, as set forth in a fascinating explanatory essay by Immerseel found in the booklet: 1)  These not only use \\"original instruments,\\" but instruments specific to the Vienna of Beethoven's time, allegedly different-sounding from and pitched higher than those used in other cities in Europe.  2)  Extensive research into musical performances in the Vienna of that time, leading to an orchestra size ranging from the high thirties to the low forties (as opposed to the sixty or so players used in other original-instrument cycles).  3) Eschewing the idea of creative \\"interpretation\\" of the music, in favor of the \\"declamation\\" practices of the time, based on a strictly literal following of the composer's tempi and dynamics.<br /><br />So, does it succeed?  On the first two points, quite well indeed.  Under Immerseel's direction, Anima Eterna produce a \\"big\\" sound that belies the small number of players -- in terms of sonic impact, what we hear on this set is every bit the equal of the \\"big orchestra\\" sound of Beethoven cycles from leading orchestras such as the Berlin Philharmonic or Chicago Symphony.  The sound of the Viennese \\"instrumentarium\\" is also mostly a smashing success, with richly colored woodwinds and quicksilver strings.  Only the brass disappoints a bit; granted, all Classical-era brass instruments pale somewhat when compared to their modern equivalents, but the horns in Anima Eterna, in particular, don't quite hit a smooth pitch at far too many moments in this cycle, the solo passage in the third movement of the Ninth being a prime example.  Overall, though, there is much to admire in the sound of the instrumental blend.<br /><br />As to the performances, unfortunately, they're somewhat more hit-or-miss.  On the good side, Immerseel and his forces turn in an excellent Eroica, full offire and passion.  Likewise, their readings of the Seventh and Eighth symphonies are first-rate, as are the overtures included in the set, with the Second and Fourth not too far behind.  The Ninth receives a good-if-not-great reading, although a bit brusque and superficial in the slow movement.  In the finale, the soloists and \\"Turkish band\\" are world-class, but the twenty-four-voice chorus, although fine when singing together in full voice, sounds rather anemic when only two sections at a time are singing, such as the men in the first statement of the \\"Ode to Joy.\\"  The First, on the other hand, seemed to have a rather characterless, if inoffensive, performance.<br /><br />It is in the remaining two major mid-period works, the Fifth and Pastoral, where things go seriously off-the-rails.  The famed opening movement of the Fifth is simply taken far too fast; instead of sounding thrilling (as with Norrington's just-teetering-on-the-edge-of-control version), this rendition just makes one of the most important creations in classical music sound rushed and superficial.  Things improve in the final three movements, but here the playing is not at its best, with far too many mushy attacks, particularly in the final two movements, marring much of the drama.  The Pastoral also suffers from a too-fast opening movement (which, as far as I can tell, is even faster than Beethoven's specified 66-per-half-note tempo), moments of surprising torpor (in particular, a lack of incisiveness in crucial instrumental accents) in the admittedly-loud storm, and a general lack of the \\"expression of feeling\\" in the presence of nature which was Beethoven's whole point in this work.  If, as one commentator observed, Karajan's view of nature in his much-maligned 1963 Pastoral was less that of strolling through the forest so much as speeding along a country road in his Porsche, Immerseel's view seems to be that of zooming over the treetops at Mach 2 in a fighter jet.  One may well wonder how much these shortcomings related to Immerseel's dedication to \\"declamation\\" over \\"interpretation\\" -- that he does a good job of getting the tempo and dynamics right, and thus gets fine results with works where \\"everything is on the page\\" and can be gleaned from the composer's explicit directions, but, when it comes to more-subjective matters involved in getting to the heart of pieces when said essence is found \\"between the lines\\" in the score, rather than clearly marked out in terms of tempo and dynamics, he can get a bit lost at sea.<br /><br />The orchestral sound captured by producer/engineer Bert van der Wolf is rich and glowing, if growing somewhat congested at loud climaxes.  (If you're an audiophile looking purely for the original-instrument cycle with the best sound quality, this is your easy choice.)  According to the booklet, this was an \\"Original High Resolution Surround Recording\\" (I'm assuming on SACD), and may have sounded even better in surround-sound; however, I'm not aware of any place where this cycle is available in anything above Redbook stereo.<br /><br />So, in summary, a mixed bag.  If the symphonies in this set were available separately, several of them (particularly the Eroica, Seventh, and Eighth) would be an easy recommendation.  As a complete set, though, it falls short in too many key works to be anything other than an \\"interesting\\" supplement to other, more-satisfying cycles.  My personal recommendations would be for the original-instrument Gardiner/OR&R set, Barenboim's \\"big orchestra\\" version with the Staatskapelle Berlin or, if you can only pick one set, Haitink's cycle with the London Symphony, which balances the use of a modern orchestra with \\"historically-informed\\" performance practice in a satisfying combination, and which culminates in one of the finest Ninths of all time.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|It seems that the worse Bob Dylan's voice gets the better he sounds. This album starts out with a country swing song and progresses to blues.<br /> I once read that Dylan scans the newspapers and reads magazines to develop the ideas and lyrics for his songs thus you get relevant, meaningful songs that are worth listening to. His 35th album is no exception. At 71 years of age, he still has his mojo. Listening to Bob Dylan is like sipping aged wine while sharing memories with an old friend.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I absolutely love a book that makes me feel as if I know the characters personally.  Although, with these two, I'm not so sure I'd be proud of that. :) It's hard to say much about the story itself without giving anything away.  Precisely why it is a good, simple read. Enjoy!
B001R10BEG|4.0|I am a big fan of Hoagy Carmichael's \\"Heart and Soul\\" and when I saw a brief clip of Tom Hanks playing this song on the step piano, I had to watch this movie. I tried to find it on Netflix to no avail. I tried Amazon Instant Video, but I decided to jump in and spend the extra $8 to have the Blu Ray copy. I am glad I did. This movie is a instant classic. I had no idea what I was in for. I don't want to ruin the movie, but it is a very funny movie in which Tom Hanks becomes BIG basically. Hanks does an amazing job acting like a 13 year old living as a 30 year old. The most memorable part was when Hanks and his boss were playing Heart and Soul as well as the Chopstick March on the step piano.<br /><br />Never once did the movie slow down or became boring. I was craving for more and fell in to the entire setting and the plot of the movie. The acting was great and the entire cast did an superb job. Overall, the movie deserves 5 stars for it's clever laughs, amazing acting, magnitude of imagination and nostalgia. Nonetheless, when the ending came along, I was left in shock wondering what just happened. Is that it? What happens next? There has to be additional footage. It cannot end like this. It called for a sequel perhaps, but I don't know if it ever came out. If someone knows, please inform me! If you never watched this movie and would like to experience 80's nostalgia, it is highly recommended.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Excellent Acting<br />+ Great Plot and Story<br />+ Worth the $10 to belong in my collection<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Ending left more to be desired<br />- Slightly grainy picture (not a big deal)
B00866H7SS|5.0|Absolutely enjoyed this book - can't wait for the next instalment (if there's going to be one).  Similar to but not the same as the 50 Shades trilogy.  Provocative and sensual!
0451205766|5.0|I've never heard anyone complain about first two Godfather movies (now the third is another story). I saw both when they were just coming out, but at age 5, I was too young to read this book, which was published in 1969. When I was older, I read it in one night. While some parts are nearly the same as the movie, there is a deeper resonation vis-a-vis the characters, thanks to the individual points-of-view offered by Puzo: Luca Brasi is a far more menacing character, Johnny Fontane is far more pathetic, and Kate is more complex and naive then she was in the movie.<br />It's also interesting to note that the flashbacks of \\"The Godfather Part II\\" were first written in this book.<br />It would be easy to go over more territory and characters, but Puzo already wrote the novel. The only relevant question one should ask is, \\"Should I buy it?\\" The answer is absolutely.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Although I am not that big of a fan of medieval type of films or tv shows, I simply fell in love with this series. The first episode was ok, and was a bit too complex for me at first. A few days later, I gave it another try, and I couldn't stop watching after that. I really got involved with the characters, especially, and the story as well. It's like a roller coaster ride, it plays so well with your emotions.<br /><br />This is not your conventional TV show where you kinda know what is going to happen next. This show keeps you on your toes, and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Also the attention to the detail of the costumes, scenery, and even plot really makes this show into something special.<br /><br />If I could recommend any show in the world, I would recommend anyone to watch this.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|I am not much into fantasy films.  Personally, I find films such as \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to be unwatchable (sorry to you fans out there but the truth is the truth).  Usually, I just find that these types of films are problematic in many ways, mostly that I just can't connect with the characters and therefore can't have empathy for them.  Not so with \\"Snow White and the Huntsman.\\"  Most of the characters I could relate to, but surely the star of the show - be it a dark star - would be Charlize Theron.<br /><br />One of the only complaints that I might have about the film is that Ms. Theron nearly disappears midstream, but luckily she reappears to bring back her madness and mayhem in the third act.  Another complaint would be:  a little too much exposition by some of our characters.  Not to give too much away - you already know most of the story since naturally this is a take on the original fairy tale - but when someone wants to kiss our protagonist, Kristen Stewart, our knight in shining armor (or maybe make that \\"knight in shining pewter\\" perhaps) - decides to first discuss, to no one in particular, his life story.  But of course, it is easier to explain background information in a novel than it is in film.  Too bad, but often screenwriters must bite the bullet and use exposition to explain things, which comes across in a klunky fashion.  Just kiss her already!<br /><br />But besides these complaints, the cinematography and costume design are fantastic.  Same goes for the special effects.  And the acting is even mostly good, even Ms. Stewart is better in this role than the \\"Twilight\\" series.<br /><br />But the acting by our antagonist is superb.  A fairly big recommendation by someone who usually does not like fantasy.

Brody(Damian Lewis, Band of Brothers) the hero that he appears to be or is the lovely, somewhat obsessed CIA Agent (Claire Danes) on to something very sinister? Very well written and superbly acted. Mandy Patinkin has never been better. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Even though its simple you still find yourself slamming in to trees and being turned on to barbeque.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|This is one of those movies where everyone talks really quiet, BUT THEN THE MUSIC'S SO LOUD!  I don't get why people always have to whisper in movies.  The magic mirror's not really a mirror, it's a gong.  I kept telling her, \\"Bitch, that ain't no mirror!\\"  The queen's brother is seriously the biggest creeper I've ever seen in a movie.  There's one scene where Kristen Stewart's running away, and she happens to find a magically convenient horse, and she's like, \\"Hey, can I ride you?\\" and the horse is like, \\"Sure.\\"  In another scene, she staves off a troll attack by batting her eyes at it.  The fairy forest is pretty awesome, I'd like to live there.  Oh, and there's ass-kicking dwarves.  No really, the dwarves are in this movie!<br /><br />Anyway.....it's a good movie.  The way it's advertised, you'd think it's just for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the case.  The romance is mostly a minor plot point, it's not overly sappy or anything.  A lot of people will immediately hate this movie just cause it has the Twilight chick in it.  They'll say, \\"Oh my God, that person's existence is so untrendy!\\"  To them, I say grow up, it's not that big of a deal.  Basically, it's a spookier, more adult-ish version of the story.  If you're into that kind of imagery(I am), then you should like this movie.  If not, then you might like it anyway.  Give it a chance.  Don't just say, \\"Oh, it's too gothic, it has Twilight lady in it!\\" cause then you're attacking your own intelligence.  My only real complaint is that it's maybe a bit too long.  There's nothing mind-blowing about this movie, but it's all good fun.  Worth a rental at least.<br /><br />Of course, this movie begs the question...if you were friends with Snow White, what would you call her?  Snow?  Whitey?  I would call her Whitey.

B008Z9YLV2|5.0|There are usually so many differences between the book and the movie they share little more than the title. Not with this one! I loved the special effects and the characters they closely related their \\"book\\" personas. I was really impressed with how well the scenes were brought to life on the screen very little of import was left out. The actors chosen did amazing jobs and I loved the scenes between Katniss and Peeta very much like in the book! Can't wait for the sequels :-)

B0090EHVMC|5.0|My girls (13-9) loved this movie and watched many times in the 24 hours that we rented it! The songs are modern and catchy. The characters are lovable when their supposed to be and there is no question who the bad guys are. It also teaches a great lesson about making mistakes and finding a way to redeem them. Along with the message of taking care of the Earth and all it has to offer. This is a movie I would own and watch again with my girls!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was written well.  The subject was one i knew little about although i have read numerous novels of the Elizabethan era.  Ann Neville was someone i was not familiar with and she was drawn very well by Ms. Gregory.
B003AO1SVS|1.0|First up - I am not an expert on the Black Keys.  This album is my first exposure to the duo.  I bought it after sampling some of it, and I enjoyed the brief 30 second snippets that I heard.  Good hooks.  Also, I admit the humor of the album design was appealing.  Anyway, I really need to quit taking hooks as an indicator of quality songs.  My bad.<br /><br />Having made the purchase, I did really want to like this album.  But two things kept that from happening.<br /><br />1.  The recording gives me a headache!  I understand distortion as artistry, but the pumped up bass/drum riffs on this really get to me after only a few minutes.  I tried and tried again and the only way I could give this thing a fair shot was to keep the volume down.  By the way, I love garage rock, but this album is hard to listen to on a decent audio setup.<br /><br />2.  These guys seem like they want to stay in one groove, at one pace and not go anywhere else with it.  Track after track seemed to work off the same time.  Fine for a song or two, but lets have some variety.  Also, I think I only came across two tracks that actually had key changes of any sort.  Where's the melody?  They hit a riff and would stay on it the full 3 minutes or so for almost every song.  I think the only song with any meaningful attempt at melody is \\"Too Afraid to Love You\\". Kind of reminds me of Daniel Ash of Love and Rockets - \\"I'm Alive\\" - nice hook but no chord changes and no attempt to stretch it - all his stuff sounds the same too.<br /><br />I gave it a full listen four times.  That's enough.  It was neat for two minutes, and then it was boring.  This is a lame recording.
1451627297|4.0|Stephen King at his best.  i am not a fan of his more horror-like books, but I found that this was more along the lines of \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" in that it was more psychological thriller than horror.  Really long, but totally worth it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There's nothing left to say that prior one-star reviewers have not said.  My mistake was in believing the hype and the success of this \\"literary\\" garbage, and buying it on impulse at a store.  Bit mistake.  Life is too precious, and sex is too interesting to have whole hours and an entire human endeavor \\"crapped\\" on with this drivel.  Walk -- no, run -- from this bestseller (how depressing that is...)

There is no way to back up, restore or redo... You will just have to start over...<br /><br />No thanks, I've wasted enough time on this un-reliable game.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|The avengers was a weak movie that had pot holes everywhere. it was too long and needed another rewrite. I enjoyed John Carter, Men In Black 3 and American Reunion far more. Out of the super hero movies connected to this film, Iron Man was really good but had a crappy sequel and The Incredible Hulk was well done, Captain America was Okay and Thor was just there. The only one I saw at the box office before Avengers was the incredible hulk. other then Iron Man I was glad I waited for home viewing. Only reason I saw The Avengers at the box office was to see all the super heroes on the big screen in 3D, but the film was one film in a long time that I wish I stayed home.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian is the \\"Queen of Disturbance\\"--I could not put this novel down. As with Sharp Objects and Gone Girl, scenes are painted with such detail and imagery that I still can't get some of them out of my head. She is a phenomenal author. I can't wait until she writes again.
B004EARTN8|1.0|people should get pay to see this movie, i mean cheesy  all the way, the dialogue is the worst, i mean its real terrible, you can't get back your time

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I was so happy they cleared up the loose ends about Christian's past. I liked the fact that they actually married and had children. I learned a lot of things from this series that I did not know even existed. Would the book still be so much fun if Christian were poor? I think not.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Quite a bit of action in the movie, with a surprise ending.  A good Jason Statham movie, a must see movie.
0738711500|4.0|Simply love this. packaging was nice and delivery was less very fast. Cards were slightly smaller but it does not matter to me. The colors on the deck was simply breath taking.
B002ZG994U|5.0|This is not your original A-Team.  This one has more of a comedy tilt to it.  The cast is great.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok. it is sort of fun but lots and lots of adds there. J's lots of games that are fin
B003O86FMW|5.0|As the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire keeps the reader engrossed in the world of Panem for another thrill ride!  Catching Fire carries the story forward in a dynamic way, once again keeping the reader on their toes.  I enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot and couldn't wait to read Mockingjay once I finished this book.  Must read if you loved the Hunger Games!
B007TML4EI|5.0|This is a logic game revolving around violence and mayhem, but hey, it's just a dummy. There are a lot of levels, the puzzles are very clever, and many of them are very challenging -- some, you'll swear can't have a solution, but they do. Very well done, and very addictive if you enjoy logic games. I bought this after downloading Simple Physics when it was the daily free app, and I've thoroughly enjoyed both.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|He is way too controlling, no matter how good the sex is. Why would any woman put up with a man who would pay to help out his ex-lovers and continue hiding those important facts from his wife.  He thought he could control her all the time with sex. She still needs her friends. I am not sure what all the craze is about over these books.

B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I'm a fan of Cate Blanchard, so I enjoyed this movie.  I like her acting and it was great in this movie and in the lst Elizabeth movie she did.  I bought both movies.
B001F6TXME|5.0|The Nikon 25395 MC-DC2 Remote Release Cord works very nicely, out-of-the-box. I'm using it with my D5100 and had no issues. It also has a nice 'lock' position. It is a must if you're interested in taking tack sharp photographs, especially in low light situations such as shooting at night.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is great!! I love to run!!!! It is all free!!!!!!!!!!! You can buy new people for free!!!!!!! Get this!!!!! Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
0446401307|4.0|I am relatively new to Michael Connelly, coming by way of the movie The Lincoln Lawyer and my primo Michael's recommendation. When I read a free sample of the The Drop on my Kindle Fire I was hooked. Enter Harry Bosch and a new world was unveiled. As a newbie I found The Overlook to be a fast paced thriller with many twists and turns and good characters;not too many and just enough. The storyline is quite interesting considering the times we live in and the threat of terrorism, both doemestic and international always looming,the story than becomes quite poignant. The Los Angeles setting is a perfect backdrop for the story to develop and the conflicts between agencies coupled with Bosch meeting his former lover who is now in an adversary agency only adds to the the drama. Connnelly is a master and his descriptions of L.A. are flawless and right on track. Having grown up in Los Angeles the places brought back many memories with his decriptions of places. This book is one you can read relatively quickly and that is why I chose it. I wanted to be sure that I liked the author and Harry Bosch character without investing alot of time. Suspenful, intriquing and fast-paced this book is perfect for someone like me who is new to the Harry Bosch series and character. A detective that is a man's man it is quite easy for me to relate to Bosch in his quest to solve a crime and save Los Angeles in the process. Good stuff and highly recommmended especially for newbies to Harry Bosch.
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|I love Doctor Who. I love the sometimes campy, sometimes serious, and sometimes totally off the wall Doctor. And, who doesn't love Rose? Christopher Eccleston doesn't get the love he deserves as the 9th doctor.
B00846REIS|3.0|I bought this since I had read all of the 50 Shades books. Both characters seemed too damaged to be where they were to be realistic. The breaks in scenes were too choppy though the genre of the book is what is interesting.
B00246VKFM|5.0|DVD in great condition and delivery was very quick. I work at a high school library and bought this to donate to the school for classroom use. This is a wonderful film. I was so glad the condition of the DVD is excellent, so it can be watched by the students. I know it will hold up well.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app makes it to where i can c that my kindle is charging when my battery thing in the top corner dont.. i would tell everyone to get this app
B0087HT36U|5.0|Love this game. Only wish there were more levels....  Better than any bird game (if you know what I MEAN).
030758836X|1.0|Simply terrible!  The story is so pathetic and poorly written.  I had to read almost half the book before it got a little interesting. PLEASE don't waste your time reading this book.
B00122BEPA|5.0|I grew up with Van Halen so I was very excited about the Best of Both Worlds release.  All of their hits in one compilation.  It doesn't get any better than that.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderful read.  Kept my attention, hard to put down once I started reading the first book. Was glad I purchased this Trilogy.  Liked it so much that after I finished reading the last hard cover book, I purchased it for my eReader.
0385360177|5.0|I ordered Book Two of Shades with 16 CDs and they are perfect!  I wish I had ordered the third set at the same time!  This book is addicting!  Audio is the way to go, especially with this book!!  Who cares if I'm caught in traffic???  ha! ha!
B008XG1X18|2.0|this app never works on my kindle fire.  always freezing up.  app icon doesnt show up either, just a grey box.  hoping they fix it!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is by far the best gaming experience I've had so far on Android. Quell is beautiful, challenging, and somehow kind of relaxing all at once. I like that I can play it for 5minutes or an hour. well with the gaming dollar.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a good calculator ap. works well on my kindle fire. I actually downloaded a few calculators before landing on this one.
030758836X|1.0|I agree with just about everything written by all of the one-star reviewers above and only want to add one additional point:  the book was a disgustingly second-rate imitation of Scott Turow's excellent novel, \\"Presumed Innocent.\\"  It's all about the psychotic wife who will do ANYTHING to keep her man.  Scott did it much better.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I always like Jane Austen style, the way she tells her stories.It's an easy and pleasant reading.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I didn't purchase this from Amazon but this is a great workout.  It gets you sweating and your heart pumping. The workouts aren't too long that you get bored.  I lost 40 lbs. with this work out combined with Zumba.
0545128285|4.0|I've always liked the Harry Potter supplementary materials, mostly because I love reading things that the characters could have read. I was an especially big fan of the little book about all the beasts in the Harry Potter world, and when I was younger, I had a running list of which ones I wanted. With names. I'm dorky like that, so I had to read the `Tales of Beedle the Bard' after it came out.<br /><br />\\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is an enjoyable read for Potter fans but don't expect deep literary wonders from this book. It's just like the title says: a book of stories, which I think is awesome. They're simple little fables and legends supposedly told to kids from magical families in the Harry Potter world, and there is commentary and analysis from Dumbledore, who Harry Potter readers are very familiar with. Also, the tales were apparently translated by Hermione Granger, so there's another direct tie-in to the popular series. My favorite tale out of them all is \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump,\\" probably because I really like Animagi and one appears in this tale.<br /><br />There is an appeal for both juvenile readers, who will probably like the stories more than the commentary, and YA readers, who will probably be more interested in the commentary and the `Tales' relevance to the other Harry Potter books. If the reader is older and hasn't read Harry Potter, they might not be so interested in these little tales. They're not very weighty and they really are geared towards kids. However, Harry Potter readers will eat this up and enjoy what may be Rowling's last literary foray into the Wizarding World! I guess there's always Pottermore...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very addictive.  Just wish it had the bonus games and survival modes.  But even without, it's very handy to kill a little time wherever you go.
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|Creative and incredibly imaginative cannot stop watching. So well written and perfectly cast! If you are into crime, mystery, and really great acting this is a woderful show. It is not however for the \\"squeamish\\".
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I tried out several apps of this kind and this one is the best by far. Easy to use. Tons of puzzles for all levels. Love it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|im over the sex, this series is horrifically repeatative and considering how much money this author is getting for them i would hope they would be better. come up with a plot before the end of the second book, and we get it they like to have sex and he likes a different kind of sex.... move on. it feels so much like twilight for adults. the only reason i read the second and third book is because i bought them all at once and dont believe in wasting the money.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great entertainment and actually, as you progress with the plot in volumes two and three, one finds that the relation of power changes from the older, dominant male to the younger, insecure female character. Of course it's all one big romatic/sexual fairy tale ala Cinderella goes BDSM but sometimes, this is just what one needs. I had tons of fun.
B00136Q6DA|4.0|This album was very easy to listen to.  Her singing isn't amazing but its well placed within the lyrics.  No vocal histrionics (ie. Beyonce, Mariah, Celine, etc.) The lyrics are well thought out and not overly sappy like some of her contemporaries.
0307949508|5.0|For someone who admitted in a previous review that he isn't a devotee of mysteries, I am completely taken in by this series. \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" was a more than satisfying sequel to \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\". I read this in practically no time. Whereas I gave four stars to the first book because I felt it could use some editing, not a page, not a word was wasted in this sequel. From the tropical tornado to the final encounter, I was taken for a great ride. Larsson created some of the most intriguing characters in Salander and Blomkvist. Their long-distance, practically non-communicative relationship here is just as tense as their claustrophobic one in the first book. And their new nemeses (and one in particular--you'll see) are truly frightening.<br /><br />I would have to agree with other reviewers that, while it is not necessary, it is a VERY GOOD idea to read \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' first, then this. And now, I am getting ready to read \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\". I almost want to put it off because I know I will feel depressed when I finish it, knowing that there will be no more to come from Stieg Larsson. No more Blomkvist and, painfully, no more Salander.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app is great most of the time but every once in a while it doesn't work on the kindle fire. I just have to back out then reenter the app and it works so that is a little annoying hence the good not quite great 4 stars.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The acting and selection of actors is flawless. The movie is superb I would recommend that anyone that loves sci-fi see this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the character development, plots and costumes.  It is a soap opera set in the early 1900's but speaks of class distinction, love, loss and loyalty.  Great insight into British society of that era.  Highly recommend seeing the entire series!
B008B11R1Q|5.0|The xx have followed up their debut album with an album that will be considered on many album of the year awards. The biggest hits off the album are Angels, Missing, and Fiction (at least for me). This album wasn't about reinventing the wheel for this band, but to really hone in and fine tune their sound. The xx have accomplished this in spades. As of the time of this writing, this is my favorite album this year.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|This is a great story, it's action packed, and like Jason Bourne the haroine, Hanna, masterfully played by Saoirse Ronan is on a quest to find out what her life and identity are about. Raised by her father (Eric Bana)in the wild Hanna has decided it is time for her to go forth in the world and find out her secret.  This movie has some quirky twists in it but the action is great and Hanna is as great combatant that kicks some major butt throughout this movie.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will have trouble putting it down until finished.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Once I started reading this trilogy, it could have become my reason for getting up in the morning and even going to bed as it was the last thing I did was read this book.  Catching Fire really brought me a better understanding of who the character Katniss Everdeen was and how she started to come to the understanding of the fact she was being used and how.  It was also about her coming into her female strength and weaknesses trying to decipher what love is for her in the midst of terror and repression.  I very seldom could predict what would/could happen next because Katniss really had no clue as well.  Very intriguing and I found myself having to think about breathing once in a while.  Once started, I could hardly put any one of these books down.
B001JRB16U|5.0|The Disney film 'Mary Poppins' still retains all of its magic and entrancement for kids of all ages, and their parents, after all these years. Made in the sixties, it has lost none of its appeal.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|There are very few albums that actually deserve the hype, and even fewer in my experience that people raved about and that I actually agreed with once I listened to - the list includes Guns and Roses \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" Def Leppard's \\"Pyromania,\\" and Adele's \\"21,\\" where everybody says how great it is, and it turns out it actually IS great.<br /><br />\\"Cold Fact\\" was so much better than I expected it took me completely by surprise. I heard about the movie \\"Searching for Sugarman,\\" did some curious research, heard the samples here, was just intrigued enough to give the album a try.<br /><br />Track for track, it is outstanding work. It's a nearly perfect '70s-style album, and while the jazz-rock arrangements of that era might seem dated at first listen, I think it's as current as any Dave Matthews track dreams of being. Rodriguez' voice is like maple syrup...like a Mexican-American Jim Croce. It's amazing.<br /><br />Of 12 tracks, only one (Gomorrah) never gets out of the '70s. The others - especially \\"Sugar Man\\" stand the test of time, and feel perfectly at home with any recent rock. One song - \\"I Wonder\\" - is a bit misogynistic at first, and it's so blunt (one line, sung to a woman, is \\"I wonder how many times you had sex\\"). But, that blunt honesty, so rare in current music that hides behind metaphor and overwriting (or more graphic detail) makes the song's narrator suddenly seem much more soulful yet insecure, while the woman is the powerful and independent character of the song.<br /><br />Great album...strange how such good music could have disappeared. Destiny turns on a dime. But this artist is worth the hype, 45 years after his first album or not.
B008PE9GSA|2.0|Never thought I'd see the day, but the Top has turned into a lounge act. Rubin should give back whatever monies he was paid for this travesty.
B00104W8T6|5.0|Not many soundtracks are as good as the movie.  Usually the soundtrack is a collection of hits used in the movie.  This soundtrack only has a couple of familier to me songs on it like \\"A Well Respected Man\\" by the Kinks and a rare Buddy Holly song \\"Dearest is a gem.  The rest of the music is just fun to listen to.  I especialy enjoyed \\"All I Want Is You\\", a catchy song with gtreat learicks and a great remake of the Phil Philips clasic \\"Sea of Love\\" by Cat Power.  It's a great collection of songs I'm sure you will enjoy if you give it a chance to grow on you.  If you haven't seen the movie you should watch it's great too....
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth Brooks is the founder of modern country music and this CD shows off his talent pretty well. I would deffinitley recommend this CD to any Garth fan, or country music fan! I'm thoroughly satisfied with the CD. Hats off to Mr. Garth Brooks !
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Upon the first couple of spins, it is clear that Tempest does fit in well with Dylan's string of late 90s to present run of bluesy gems. As for the opener \\"Duquene Whistle\\", doesn't anyone notice how Bob's \\"shot\\" voice resembles legendary jazzman Louis \\"Satchmo\\" Armstrong? Dylan never could sing, (in the manner of guys like Art Garfunkel, etc). But he has always used the voice he does have to wonderful effect--that's what you get here. Dylan is Dylan--deal with it--he will never be loved for his vocals. But look at all the guys making a career of aping Bob's voice and style--Tom Petty, Neil Young (at times), Ronnie Wood, Axl Rose, etc. And of course EVERYONE covers Dylan sometime.
B00130EVSS|3.0|Expected a bit more from this film, despite its having Naomi Watts in it. But I would say it was worth it if only for Viggo Mortenson's nude knife fight in the Turkish bath. Wholly original, that one. The villainry were largely cliches.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I only gave this four stars because it is kind of slow to load on the Kindle Fire. But the color and graphics are really clear when they do load.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Both my husband and I have read all three books.  We've enjoyed all of them.  We hope that the Author E.L.James, continues the story with future books about the Grays.  It could become another series like Harry Potter only for adults.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Compared to his other books, this one is relatively low key.  Despite this though, there was enough happening in the way of plot and character development that less action really didn't matter.  After the events of the last book, a respite was probably inevitable and very nice.  As befits a book like this, it is shorter (only 852 pages, kindle edition), which is nice, but it never bored me.  Overall I am very happy (note ***** rating)and the content and size of the book was not detrimental or consequential in any way, shape, or form.  Just do not go into it expecting huge events to take place.
031603438X|4.0|Fantastic, nostalgic read for anyone who was one of the 60's teen generation. The man is a legend. The heart of 1960's rhythm and blues.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This new version is much better. Makes it just as simple to view and repin, as if you were a desktop.
1607053551|5.0|Easy and enjoyable to read. Step by step instructions are very clear. Has taught me some great little tricks to increase my productivity at work.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a lot of medical issuses which makes it hard to falls sleep, with this app I'm able to relax,  it keeps my mind from racing, so the result is a relaxed me !
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the trilogy in 5 days via my iPhone. Could not put it down. Well written and gives the reader plenty to think about afterward.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Many of the the professional critics did not like this movie but, judging by box office takings, the public appears to love it. Are we surprised? Most professional critics appear to despise the country that nurtured them in the utmost comfort. I imagine that most of those critics would be either cheering for the terrorists or wanting to sit down with them and ask them why they hate us so much. I say \\"us\\" because the Australian armed services, and in particular, the elite Special Air Services Regiment (SAS), work closely with the US armed services in combat and we are equally hated by the jihadists. Ignore the claimed absence of adequate character development. This movie is not primarily about character development, although we learn enough about the main characters to feel for their hurt and the hurt to their families when we lose them. There is a great deal of heart-stopping action and we are placed right in the middle of it. We learn that there is a special bond between those in our armed services who risk their lives on our behalf. Many civilians must find it difficult to understand how soldiers could sacrifice their own lives by throwing themselves on a hand grenade to protect their comrades from certain death, but I can assure them that it has happened. It is not a concoction of the film-makers. Highly recommended to all who enjoy a top action film
1401322786|5.0|We all seem to need more time in a day....but why?  Time to do more required tasks?  What if time was of no consequence and every moment was, in itself, appreciated?  Mitch Albom points out the foibles of our society that is so incredibly rushed for time and makes one wonder if \\"time\\" is its' own enemy.  [[ASIN:1401322786 The Time Keeper]]
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|I agree with so many of the other reviewers in their opinions of Kristen Stewart. She's not the best actress. I'm well beyond the age of the Twilight movies' target demographic, so I have never seen her in anything until this movie. I can think of a dozen other young actresses who would have brought more to this role and had more chemistry with both \\"William\\" and the \\"Huntsman.\\"<br /><br />Other than her performance, I thought the movie wasn't that bad. I would have ranked it higher if there was a better \\"leading lady.\\" Though to be honest, I think the \\"Queen\\" was more of a leading lady than \\"Snow White\\" with how the movie was written. Charlize Theron was FANTASTIC.<br /><br />All that said, I'm glad I didn't buy the movie on Blu-ray like I had thought about and did the on demand option instead with my cable company (it wasn't available to rent through Amazon). If you haven't seen it yet and are like me and haven't seen Kristen Stewart in anything before, you may want to go this same route before dropping the money to buy the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a cool game I just wish that everything wasn't energy based and that it takes 3:00 mins for you to get only 1 thing of energy. at least give us 5 energy points for waiting 3 mins
B005V4X8JA|2.0|It's hard to believe, in this day and age of digital (re)mastering, that a CD would sound as bad as this one. It's like a trip back to the past when CDs had a bad reputation for sound quality. It's hard to believe Steve Hoffman had anything to do with this CD, other than copying and pasting what Rhino Records provided. I do appreciate everyone's comment on sound quality, but this CD, finding tape hiss noise, is far from anything to applaud.
B001NAZWA4|5.0|This is one of the best live albums in Rock. It's old, it's brilliant, and you'll swear you've never heard these songs before. If you love early U2 (pre- Unforgettable Fire,) than you can't NOT own this album. It wouldn't hurt to watch this concert at Red Rocks, either. Such a different feel than the post- massive fame moment. Utterly captivating to watch.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Not many mystery writers can surprise me, she did. I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I highly recommend this one.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game...the people who cant get out of it go to stuff on the bottom right side there is a door ta da...people complain about there kids buying stuff they shouldn't should check the games out before allowing them to play. If you think there is a chance they could buy something on accident don't get it simple. That's your bad not the games. Now I got to 60 without using real money...4 stars cuz  after getting there it restarted and I had to start over :(

B009329ZF2|4.0|liam neeson is the wrong character for the Admiralty part.  The plots is lame in parts and the movie itself could use a story line.  I believe this movie works because it is an off shoot of Transformers and just for mindless entertainment.  Actually, I'd buy the DVD just for my collection.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|It was an excellent movie! I was hesitant to watch it at first but it was really great. I think i will buy it soon.
B002SR3T10|5.0|If you love Jethro Tull you will love this album.  The Tull twist on the traditional songs is engaging.  The original songs are surprising and wonderful.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I'm a 45 year career Air Force photographer. The unit seems to work well,especially for the price. The written instructions were terrible, you're pretty much on your own to figure it out. Once you understand how it works, copying moves quickly, but you do need needle nose pliers to remove the slides. The digital age has made photography so much easier and the products are definitely better.

B0053O89WY|3.0|I awaited this product with much anticipation for almost a year. Whn it arrived the DVD case was damaged (Bent). The DVD's themselves don't appear to be damaged. However, I do feel that the damage occured because the product was not packaged properly. If the CD's are fine it won't be a big deal, but when you are waiting so long for a brand new product it is disappointing to receive something damaged because of improper packaging.
0545403359|4.0|War Horse just recently became a favorite book of mine. It is a story that connects generations of readers together. The simple writing style about the war is beautifully done.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of Joey, a horse who grows up on the farm with his favorite boy, Albert, living each day peacefully as it breezes by. Later, Joey is forced to perform the grueling and crippling work of a war horse. In some ways, this book could be compared to Black Beauty, also told through the eyes of a horse. But this story focuses on terrible war, and the predicaments that no human or animal should ever have to endure. Yes, there is much bloodshed and conflict in the book, but it is still fit to be a good children's story, especially for young adventurous readers.<br /><br />Ah! I do believe I've read the first page at least half a dozen times. My favorite sentences from the first page are quoted below:<br /><br />\\"My earliest memories are a confusion of hilly fields and dark, damp stables, and rats that scampered along the beams above my head.\\" .... \\"I was not yet six months old, a gangling, leggy colt who had never been farther than a few feet from his mother.\\"<br /><br />Horses were an important deciding factor of who would win the battles during World War I. Without horses, the soldiers couldn't move machinery, gather the dead, or charge the enemy. Horses were a must-have, no matter which side of the battle you were on. That is why Joey was such an important horse.<br /><br />\\"No horse, no guns. No horse, no ammunition. No horse, no cavalry. No horse, no ambulances. No horse, no water for the troops at the front.\\"<br /><br />This is a very enjoyable book! I think I may have to read it again someday.
B00846REIS|5.0|Looooved this book. I almost loved 50shades of grey & liked how they were similar but also different.<br />I couldn't put any of these books down & can't wait for the next book to come out!!!
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this cd. I especially enjoyed the songs they sang in English but the others were simply beautiful. After hearing this one, I am looking forward to seeking the other albums they have produced.
B0090SI3DY|1.0|I had the recent misfortune of watching William Friedkin's filmed version of \\"Killer Joe\\". The storytelling is shrill, adolescent, and contrived. The plotting is creakier than the creakiest B-movie Film Noir plot. There is not one likeable, intelligent, or interesting character in the play. The Killer character is directly borrowed(or stolen) from Jim Thompson, but has none of that grand existential menace that Thompson could so effortlessly put into his sleazy psycho characters. The sexual shaming scene with the \\"K-Fry-C\\" just doesn't work, not even with A-list actors giving it their all. It's just ugly and stupid and goes on too long. It's unfortunate that a fine actress like Gina Gershon can't find better work opportunities. This story is like something a mixed-up 18 year old kid wrote for his first playwriting workshop at a state college. I don't know any of Letts's other work, and I probably shouldn't have started here. But I can't believe that anyone who wrote something this awful, small, and cheap could ever have written anything that won national awards for literature and theatre. The worst crime here is the way the author condescends to his characters. These are not real people. They're boutique white trash, deliberately drawn to be as stupid and petty as possible. If these characters were black, latino, or native indian, the author would be branded a racist. I want my time back! I want someone to whack that plummy pedantic douche Friedkin across the face with a dead bluefish, or a sack of wet horseS#!t. Seriously, folks. It is that bad.

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Twilight on steroids for Kristen !! James bitting Bella was very dynamic drama ! Well as Snow White her reactions were almost continuous in her escape through the forest to her fight with the evil Queen !! The emotional roller coaster was really screaming as she pulled me through each episode !! The burnout from retakes she must experience must be beyond belief ! Kristen sure has my vote, and what ever she gets for playing these parts she deserves and should get more !! Now I'm a total fan !!!! She is a Super Star !!!!  A mild shock set in on Snow White's second run on the Big Screen(first time on computer) the next day !! The world's most beautiful victim getting hammered right to end !! LOVE This version of Snow White !!!!

I can see and feel the changes in my body and attitude.<br /><br />This book is EXCELLENT it will change your relationship with food and help you gain control of your dietary health. For me it's not a diet it's a lifestyle change... I'll never go back to eating the way i did before.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|We had heard so much about Homeland we were thrilled when our Blu-ray edition arrived. We are fans of Lewis (Life TV series) and Claire Danes and watched every episode of the `24'. Unfortunately, this series is nothing like `24'.<br /><br />Minutes into the series the assault with gratuitous nudity began. The language is shocking at times. For example, a teenage daughter in mixed company with her family and guest uses the \\"c--\\" word. A wife is basically raped by her husband in one episode and then later used as a live pinup while the husband masturbates in another episode. A woman standing topless being interviewed for a job is asked if she likes anal sex. The camera angle shows prolonged views of her breasts while she is interviewed about such things, then a close up of her panties while a main touches her crotch. The list could go on and on.  . . The pace seemed very slow - and not in the same universe as `24'. No argument with the acting - it is great. When all is said and done though, we just gave up after the 3rd episode.<br /><br />The onslaught of unnecessary nudity and prolonged visuals are clearly designed to push the envelope further than other cable shows.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a quick, easy read and I enjoyed the twists and turns throughout the book. But I had a problem with the ending. It seems like the author didn't know how to wrap things up so it just kind of finishes abruptly. The ending was a disappointment.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I devoured the trilogy in 3 days! It is certainly not highly sophisticated literary work, but excellent entertainment with tension, emotion, romance, and comedy, and a real page turner. I laughed out loud when reading the the e-mails of the main characters! Strangely enough, I don't think that the erotic content is not too much, contrary to some reviews.<br /><br />For a time-out from real life and just exciting entertainment, this is a clear recommendation. In my opinion, a unique \\"women's book\\" ;) with mature content.
1936608898|5.0|I've been following Dallas and Melissa's website/blog/tweets for a while now, but I have to admit that I found them kind of scary. What they said made sense, but they're so...intense. Fear aside, I bought 'It Starts With Food' because I'd heard lots of good feedback, and I LOVE Melissa Joulwan.<br /><br />I've now purchased three copies because I keep giving them away to family and friends. This book rocks. Their information is presented clearly and concisely. It doesn't bring in any evolutionary stuff (I'm not opposed to it, but I find talking about human evolution alienating to some people), just a frank discussion of what good and bad foods are and how there are studies that show their effects on the human body. Lots of analogies (Cat Math being my personal favorite) and Melissa Joulwan's meal map. Love.<br />I realized that what I'd been intimidated by in their other outlets was their incredible knowledge of their subject matter. The bibliography is phenomenal. Dallas and Melissa Hartwig really know their stuff, and they want you to know it too.<br /><br />Prior to ISWF, I'd held Robb Wolf's book as the standard for paleo nutrition information. His is still an excellent book, and one that I absolutely recommend, but I find Robb's narration a little exhausting. The Hartwigs don't sugarcoat any of this, nor do they try to beat you over the head with their opinions.  ISWF just gives you the facts and lets you decide for yourself.<br /><br />Oh yeah the most important part: after my Whole30, my skin cleared up, I lost a dress size, and stopped taking my three daily allergy medications cold turkey. Been treated for those allergies for 17 years and 30 days fixed it.<br /><br />So buy the book, and plan on loaning it out a lot. Heck, just go ahead and buy 3 and save on shipping.

0393088774|1.0|\\"In time this overhang will be worked off. Meanwhile, economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment. Low interest rates, which promote spending on housing and other durable goods, are the main answer.\\" - Paul Krugman October 7, 2001<br /><br />If you're listening to Paul Krugman for economic advice then you've already got bigger problems. How would someone who not only failed to see the depression coming but even worse, called for the very actions that resulted in its creation possibly know how to end this depression now?
B0019TY084|3.0|. . . years ago as a VHS rental and I had caught some of it here and there on cable television over the years.  I remember really liking this film when I saw it as a younger man.  It was supposedly cutting edge and \\"gritty\\" with a \\"based on a true story\\" aspect to it.  However- the major emotion upon seeing this film in its entirety a second time years later- was one of embarrassment.<br /><br />The main character, Billy Hayes, along with the rest of the Westerners come off as nauseating egotists that I found myself having a hard time feeling much sympathy for.  The court room speech Billy Hayes delivers at his sentencing is so over the top that it is laughable.  And a later scene when his girl friend comes to visit is moronically uncomfortable to watch. And the film is quite dated.  Frankly- compared to just about any US prison- the Turkish prison presented in that film looks downright comfy and cozy with an anarchic freedom on the inside that one would never see in just about any antiseptic rigidly controlled US slam.<br /><br />That being said the film is shot well and the story is capably told.  It just doesn't stand up to the test of time very well.  I'd recommend it to someone who hadn't seen it- but with heavy caveats.
0739375970|1.0|*AUDIOBOOK* QUALITY REVIEW - READ BY ROY DOTRICE:  Few months ago thought I would, instead of re-read the series, listen to it.  So I duly got all 5 books on audio and loaded them on my iPod.  They were great companions for long walks and hikes and fishing ventures and what have you.  Good quality, no complaints, transported me to Westeros as well as can be expected.<br /><br />At least the first 4 books, where I had the good fortune to get the versions read by Roy Avers and John Lee, did.  Then I got to audiobook 5, A Dance With Dragons, read by Roy Dotrice, and... I don't know what genius decided to change readers, but it was a ginormous brain f*rt.  All the characters sound like they're the age of Aemon Targeyan, if he had a thick Scottish accent.  All.<br /><br />16 year old Daenarys?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott with throat cancer imitating what he misremembers women to have sounded like.<br /><br />Pre-teen Bran?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott whining.<br /><br />Cercei?  Sounds like a 90 year old Scott male in one sentence, then a 90 year old Scott drag queen the next, and back and forth between the two in that vein.<br /><br />And conversations between characters?  Forget about it!  Audio doesn't have quotation marks, and G.RR Martin doesn't do a lot of \\"then Bran said '...'\\" or \\"'...' said Jon\\".  In prior books the readers got around that by changing tone and pitch when switching from character to character.  This book? No change in tone or pitch or anything to let you know that the speaker changed.  It's just one jumble of an old gravelly voiced Scott, and most of the time the listener has to guess from context who is talking.<br /><br />I hope there's another audio version coming out, read by either Roy Avers or John Lee - or anybody else for that matter.  If you're buying the audiobook, do yourself a favor and avoid the version read by Roy Dotrice.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Having come late to the reading of this series, I first surveyed my friends who had been reading them for years. Their enthusiasm prompted me to order the first 3 books. Before reading AFFC, I read many online negative reviews and wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to continue. Again, my friends said, \\"Read it,\\" so I did and am glad I did.<br /><br />While reading the first 3 books I wondered about the world outside the North and the South. AFFC filled me in nicely. I even printed and somehow put together all the maps I could find so I had a better feel for what was going on where.<br /><br />Upon finishing AFFC, and thinking about all those negative reviews, I've come to the conclusion that those reviews may have been written by people who feel GRRM did not write the book they wanted him to write. I don't think GRRM slacked off or didn't give AFFC his best. He wrote what he felt he needed to write.<br /><br />I'm 61 and have been an avid (and I do mean avid) reader since I first learned to read. I know a good read from a bad read and AFFC definitely rates with the Good Reads. So, if anybody is reading this, I say to you, \\"Ignore those negative reviews and read AFFC. You'll be glad you did.\\"
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one was a lot of setup for two and three. Very good books and well worth the time to read. Both my wife and I enjoyed them.
0812993292|5.0|I really loved this book.  The writing is exceptional, descriptive and fluid, with so many threads woven into the story you are really drawn in.  The very idea that a meek retired Englishman unaccustomed to doing anything of consequence and who's never walked further than the post box taking off spontaneously on a journey across England seems bizarre. We question his motivations just as his wife does.  His need to reach his dying friend to say goodbye makes perfect sense, but to walk?  And walk so ill-equipped? The story is about his journey from both the physical aspect of what he sees, who he meets and how he holds up, and about his inner journey which unfolds as he walks.  There are parts of himself just as distant as the city to which he is headed. The miles of slow steps allow plenty of time for thinking.  He can talk freely about his trek to strangers, but seems unable to face the depths inside himself.<br /><br />The loveliness of the English countryside comes alive, the goodness of strangers and the resilience of the human body, but what is most touching is how deeply we hide things from ourselves in an effort to live freely, never knowing the cocoon we wrap around ourselves limits our every breath.  Harold starts out appearing as peaceful as one can be, but has to travel all the way across England to learn what real peace is, and all the time he's traveling, his wife, left waiting at home, struggles through her own issues.<br /><br />The story is laid out beautifully, although being near Harold's age (older) and equally limited in conditioning, the distances he travels in a day seems awfully short as even I could do better (although some days I couldn't move).  Some of those types of details (the physical consequences of that effort) are hard to pin down realistically, but don't detract from the reader's need to believe Harold is actually doing it.<br /><br />I often start a book slowly, but if the book is compelling enough, at some point I find myself drawn so deeply into the story I read on till I'm done--sometimes for hours.  This is one of those books.  It's about as far from being a page-turning thriller as you can get, and yet I found myself turning those pages with the same need Harold felt to reach his friend.  Highly recommended.n so deeply into the story I read on till I'm done--sometimes for hours.  This is one of those books.

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I love this album, I think it is one of the best albums from Linkin Park, it's different and I listen to it everyday since I bought it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I purchased \\"Gone Girl\\" for my kindle for what I thought would be a good read. After all, it is #1 on the bestseller list! I was truly disappointed. The writer's style is good, but the story was ridiculous. Each plot development was more unbelievable than the last- and not in a fun way. The characters and storyline seemed to have been stolen from every bad episode of \\"Law and Order SVU\\". You may ask- \\"Why did you read the whole thing?\\". I guess I was waiting for it to get better. Don't waste your money.
B008BDZOZY|5.0|quirk meets quirk and produces gem. This album builds to a solid set of pieces from track 5 onwards. A real statement.The brass writing is fun and groovey and St. Vincent rises to excel and really makes this album special. Byrne was smart for teaming with her. I'm sure she was inspired and in awe of the opportunity.HIGHLY RECCOMENDED. Great Stuff!!
0143119680|4.0|I picked up the book hoping it would not be a series. Of course it is. I was relieved that the 2nd book came out within 6 mo. of completing the Discovery of Witches. I just assumed that the 3rd book would follow. Not so. am disappointed. Especially, since the movie will probably come out before the final book. If you like to finish a series in a resonable time. I don't recommend reading these yet. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the books.

This fan/heatsink was a snap to install, and even includes a tube of thermal paste, should you wish to avoid purchasing it separately. Was able to comfortably overclock to 4.3-4.4 GHz with this fan and still keep the cores around 70 C. The fan still runs whisper quiet at these levels, as well. Definitely an excellent value for anyone looking to squeeze a bit of extra power out of their machine without a big investment.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|It might be a movie for teenagers, but by weaving themes of love,loyalty,generosity and heroism into the story the writers have made it entertainment for all ages.<br />Some of the ideas are borrowed from real history. Region 12 could be Appalachia in the early 1900's, it's for all the world like West Virginia. The children as tribute angle is very similar to the story of the Athenian children being sent in prehistoric times to Crete's Minotaur and the fighting harks back to Rome's Coliseum.<br />It's a good idea to read the book first as you will be then so much more aware of important background to the story, at which the movie only hints by flashbacks.<br />My 12 year old grand-daughter says that it's the best movie ever made, and I loved it too.<br />For me,Catness Everdeen is right up there with True Grit's Mattie Ross, and that's saying something.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Finally viewed this a week or two ago.  The only reason I didn't give it five is that this movie would have more impact if all the scary stuff on the package were removed, so that you knew nothing of what it is about.  This starts out very realistically.  The reporter is very cute and personable, her cameraman sort of clutzy (although we never see him), the firemen are sweet.  The whole situation is mundane, then things slowly begin to go wrong, and then rapidly get out of control.  This is the best one of this kind of movie I've seen.  Also, the people speak very clear Spanish, which is good for me as a learner of Spanish.
0525953728|5.0|The real story of the hunt for Osama Bin Laden (UBL)  can only be understood in the context of the life of sacrifice that is lived by the men of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), otherwise known as the SEAL's elite Team 6. This book delivers both stories in a terse, no nonsense style that is as exciting and gut wrenching as fast roping into harms way. This is the raw first hand account of a man who walked the walk. The prose is not sugar coated, and neither is his story. Any man with testosterone, anyone who considers themselves a patriot and anyone who respects valor needs to read this book. It cuts through the crap, dispenses with political correctness and slices through the posturing and posing of those who would take credit. At great personal risk, the author tells this story without seeking glory, in hopes of inspiring the next generation of American hero's and supporting our wounded warriors.

B000FCKPHG|5.0|I have read and agreed with many books, and then put them down only to forget what I learned days or weeks later.  I first read this book four years ago and it was the spark that changed my whole outlook on life. I totally identified with what Dweck describes as the 'fixed' mindset.  My conscious effort to shift to the 'growth' mindset made all the difference in my life. I finally started my masters degree, I started working out again, I changed the way I speak to my children, and as a teacher I integrate the mindset theory into my classes at the start of the year. I have recommended it to dozens of people, and I frequently 'gift' copies to my friends and family members.

B0011Z5IXC|4.0|I am not a zeppelin devotee, but I think they are one of the greatest and most influential bands in rock and roll history.  I have listened and loved their songs for decades, but never bought an album.  For me, this album fulfills my desire for hearing some of those songs I remember fondly and still love.  I would not recommend Mothership for anyone other than someone who is interested in a few highlights of their outstanding career.  Its missing some great tracks that can be found in other more comprehensive collections.  This would be a great beginner's album for young person who is getting their first taste of zeppelin.  I think the sound quality is great, but honestly I listen to the album on my iPhone and could probably not tell the difference between this and other remastered or original tracks.
0786856297|4.0|First off, everyone who says _Lightning Thief_ takes inspiration from Harry Potter is spot on.  Percy Jackson isn't too much like Harry (black hair and green eyes aside), but their circumstances are quite, quite similar even before Percy learns he's a special, magical person and gets whisked off to a special, magical place of learning.  By the time he starts off on his quest for a stolen artifact--after forming a trio with a clever girl and a boy who's a bit of a good-hearted bumbler--the resemblance is uncanny.  If you've read _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ and liked it, you may enjoy this too, as it puts some of the same magic in different clothing.  On the other hand, if you didn't like _Sorcerer's Stone_ I doubt you'd care for Percy's exploits either--unless you're a fan of Greek myth, in which case they're worth a look.<br /><br />Even though it could stand to be more original, the story is pretty fun.  Percy Jackson starts out as a boy whose luck seems uniformly bad, who gets the wrong sort of attention wherever he goes but never quite knows why.  Finding out he's the son of an ancient god tells him 'why' but doesn't do anything to end his problems!  His quest to set out on the path of a hero--never mind rescue Zeus's thunderbolt--involves a lot of action and danger, moments when his courage and caring shine, and times when Percy and his two friends have to face their weaknesses.  The pacing isn't perfect; the quest section of the book has an episodic feel and eventually starts to drag.  But things are still fast-moving and engaging overall.<br /><br />Best yet, Percy's world makes for a pretty good introduction to the Greek gods, goddesses, and heroic figures.  Enough interesting stuff from the myths either gets hinted at or appears outright to intrigue a newcomer to the subject without bogging the story down in details it just doesn't need.<br /><br />I wouldn't say, though, that Percy Jackson has Harry Potter's kind of age-crossover potential.  I didn't find the same charm and wit here that I do in Rowling's work.  Actually, in style it reminded me more of a pre-teen movie than Potter.  There's almost too much action and the lines are often more snappy than clever.  Although I liked it, I would have liked it a lot more when I was Percy's age, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it to adults at all unless they regularly enjoy stuff from the young adult shelves.

Even a stylus can be clipped to it to make a good pair.  I KNOW I found the right case.

A travesty that they'd even try and make a movie out of this. I waited years to watch it just because this book was so amazing that I knew it could never live upto it.<br /><br />I don't often read serious books but you just have to read this!

B004FA8NOQ|5.0|+s: This CPU is packed with power and possibilities. I'm really amazed with how much Intel packed into this CPU for only $295.00.<br />Built in GPU on the CPU. If you use an H67 or Z68 MB you can use the CPU as your GPU w/o having to purchase a dedicated graphics card. This feature is disabled on the P67.<br /><br />The K version gives you HD Graphics 3000 instead of HD Graphics 2000.<br /><br />The K version is unlocked to give you full OC capabilites when using a MB with the P67 or Z68 chipset. I have been up to 4.8GHz using the pre-programmed OC settings on my MB w/ just large air cooling.<br /><br />-'s: The K version does not support Intel TXT, VT-d, or vPro.<br />As with all CPU's, the included stock heatsink/fan and thermal paste are terrible. If you are going to OC you need to get a better cooler. Even if you don't OC you will get much lower temperatures and (depending on the cooler) much less noise using a better cooler. A high quality thermal paste will drop the temps another few degrees Celsius as well.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: To really get the full potential of this CPU I recommend using a MB w/ the Z68 chipset. When I made my purchase months ago only the H67 and P67 were available. The H67 gives you access to the onboard GPU, but no OC capabilities. The P67 gives full OC capabilities, but turns off the onboard GPU. The Z68 gives you full OC capabilites, access to the onboard GPU, and additional features.<br /><br />System Information:<br />ASRock Fatal1ty P67 Pro<br />Intel i7-2600K<br />ASUS Royal Knight CPU cooler<br />2 x EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti<br />4 x 4GB Kingston HyperX DDR3 1866<br />Thermaltake Black Widow 850W PSU<br />4 x Seagate Constellation ES 2TB SATA3 in RAID 1<br />3 x Lite-On DVD-RW burners<br />Cooler Master HAF X full tower<br />Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
B008OHV5HS|5.0|I had reservations about the next album (even if there would be one) because of the untimely death of Mac.  When I heard Damian would be singing lead again I was even more hesitant as I'm more of a fan of Mac's voice and feel Mac brought them more of their success.  But, bands move on so I waited like everyone else to see what the band would deliver.  I will be the first to admit that I am pleasantly surprised by the outcome of this album.  To be honest, it's KILLER.  I was afraid Damian would over sing his parts and lose some of what the band has establish since 1999's 'Clone' with Mac at the helm.  Damian delivers as does the band.  This is the first cd that they've done that actually clocks in at 75:45 minutes with the additional bonus track.  Mac was very firm in producing albums that ran no more than an hour in length.  So, for fans this is a treat.  Stand out songs, there are none.  They're all at the top of the game.  If you love Threshold, whether with Damian, Glynn or Mac singing you'll be very much impressed with this release and deem it well worth the wait.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|In actuality, this is a pretty cool app.  You can read or listen to the Bible.  The audiobook is smooth and well done.<br /><br />The search feature is handy as it doesn't come with a reference guide for looking up verses dealing with a given subject, but like all search features, you have to ask the right question.<br /><br />The biggest down side for me is the apps inability to function unless you have your wifi enabled (and are in range of a wifi hot spot).  Lacking a connection you just get an error message stating the app is unable to connect with the server and you have no offline versions.<br /><br />I tried looking for an \\"offline version\\", but haven't found one yet.<br /><br />Thus, the app is useless for truly mobile functionality.
B003LZ5B7S|4.0|I was part of the way through the first season when this was pulled from prime.  Now I won't get to see how it turns out.  Very disappointed.
