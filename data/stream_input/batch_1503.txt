1594744769|2.0|Based on the cover photo, this novel would provide a goth/noir take on childhood. Something weird, off beat, interesting.<br /><br />Not even close. In fact, the predictable plot and linear characters were such a disappointment. There was nothing new here. No clever twist of words or imagery. Nothing but same old \\"hidden world\\" adolescent discovery.<br /><br />Too bad. The photos and graphics that accompany the novel are really great. I simply wish they were truly representative of the writing.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I finally had to see what all the fuss was about.  So was I happy when The Hunger Games (yes, all 3) were available to rent for FREE on my Kindle in conjunction with my Prime membership.  Read the first book and was thoroughly entertained that the read was finished in a weekend.  The following weekend I convinced the wife to sit through the movie with me.  I'm not sure what the critics are seeing here, but many people in our theatre cried at appropriate times, gasped in horror at appropriate times and perhaps even see the faintest plausibility of this actually happening somewhere in the world.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, start with the book so you will be able to see what the movie left out.  And if you have a Prime membership and Kindle, you get to enjoy the books for free!

038533348X|5.0|\\"Now I will destroy the whole world.\\"<br />- What Bokonists say when they commit suicide, Cat's Cradle, Chapter 106<br /><br />You'd think a story about the end of the world - not just the world of one person, or human civilization, but all life on the planet - would be a grim affair, but Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle is replete with wit, wry humour, and a touching compassion for human frailty.<br /><br />Vonnegut's book is no bright dystopia, like the one portrayed in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, nor is it as unrelentingly dark as George Orwell's 1984. It's our world that Vonnegut so amusingly satirizes, a world in which human beings are awfully good at creating doomsday devices (atomic bombs, religions), and lying to themselves.<br /><br />Many have said this is a story about the insanity of the Cold War, but I think it's a short history of human stupidity. And it is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1963. The plot follows a narrator who is writing a book about one of the creators of the atomic bomb and in the process discovers the scientist has also made Ice-9, a substance with the potential to turn all water into solid ice. Why invent such a dangerous thing? Come on, science can't be held back by such existential worries - it's progress, baby.<br /><br />Our world is beset with climate change caused by our technologies. As a species, we're on the cusp of massive changes that could exceed the pace of evolution - whether from genetic engineering or through fusing our biology with information technology - and this is precisely the kind of book that everyone needs to read.<br /><br />We need to think about what we are doing with our scientific power, not just proceed blindly.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle is the book that helped me find a way I could be a writer: it's literary, but it plays with science fictional tropes; it's funny, but there's a point to it all. In it he invents a religion, Bokonism, that is both humane and ironic, and that puts the lie to all other human religions. He spoofs geopolitics as easily as he skewers human egocentrism. And he does it all with humour and prose that's accessible and well crafted. It's deceptively simple, in fact. You can't help but be moved, and then you think, \\"How did he do that?\\"<br /><br />The short chapters are perfect for today's attention-deficit-disordered readers (at least, until we have our concentration chips implanted), so it works as a book that everyone at university could read.<br /><br />Not to mention all the great ideas (foma: a harmless untruth) and kickass existential \\"Calypso\\" lyrics from the Book of Bokonon:<br /><br />Tiger got to hunt,<br />Bird got to fly;<br />Man got to wonder, \\"Why, why, why?\\"<br />Tiger got to sleep,<br />Bird got to land;<br />Man got to tell himself, he understand.ts the lie to all other human religions.

000614182X|2.0|As a fan of the movie (Am I supposed to admit something like that?), I was curious about the novel. So I picked this up.<br /><br />A handful of parts were well done, but overall I found much of the writing to be lacking in so many ways. It seemed unfocused, with the characters and plot sort of hodgepodge - do I really care about the intrigue of the captain's promotion or the division of the war spoils? The additional pages of ship-sailing explanation made the whole mess come to a grinding halt. Extremely disappointing.
0451232577|5.0|Fall of Giants is a wonderful book in the grand tradition of Pillars of the Earth.  I am excited that this book is part of a trilogy and eagerly await the next two installments.<br /><br />Ken Follett's Century Trilogy will follow families from England, Wales, Germany, Russia and America through the events of the 20th century.  The characters in this book are so well-developed and sympathetic that I will be sorry to see them go in the next book, but I know Ken Follett has even more excitement in store.<br /><br />After you read this book, you will never see 20th century history the same way.  Hopefully these events will not repeat themselves, but Ken Follett shows us what can happen when there is a huge disparity between rich and poor, leaders are corrupt and complacent, and young people are sacrificed in a seemingly pointless war.  He shows us what happens when a war goes on and on because the parties are so deeply in debt that their only way out is to impose reparations.  There is a cautionary tale here.<br /><br />Be sure to visit Ken Follett's website and read his Master Class writing tips.  They are excellent advice from a master storyteller.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book kept me reading, however, at the end I wasn't compelled to go to book 2 or 3.  It seemed redundant in many places.
0307594777|5.0|I thought these books were very well written and were great mysteries. I was pretty much starting the next book the second I finished the one before.<br /><br />Book 1- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo- was probably my least favorite of the three. I still liked it and it kept me interested enough to read the next two, but I found it to be a little too crude and graphic for my liking. (They all are, but this one especially....either that, or I just got used to it as I went along :) )<br /><br />Book 2- The Girl Who Played With Fire- I liked the best- I thought it had the best story line.<br /><br />Book 3- The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest- I also liked, but, for me, it didn't quite have the thrilling story that the first two had. I have to give the author so much credit though for wrapping up the overall story and characters so nicely in the third book. A lot of authors don't do that, and it drives me crazy! ...cough, cough, The Hunger Games...  :)<br /><br />All in all, I liked this trilogy! (Although I did tell my 16 year old sister that she needed to wait until she's at least 21 to read them- lol!)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|THIS is what's passing for a good, sexy read? Oh, ladies.<br /><br />Fifty Shades is a horribly written piece of fanfic straight out of an overweight, insecure girl's diary. And I know what's in that diary, because I wrote one in highschool.<br /><br />I was so disappointed - in the book, in society, and in the copy editor that missed SLEWS of typos.<br /><br />  Actual Excerpts from the book:<br /><br />  \\"How could anyone look this good and still be legal\\"<br />(This is a pick up line spouted from drunk illiterates in bars in Queens.)<br /><br />  \\"He's going to kiss me there! I know it. And part of my is glorying in the anticipation\\"<br />Kiss me there? Homegirl, if you can't figure out names for your ladyparts, then you shouldn't be writing about it.<br /><br />  \\"He really is a fine specimen of a man, looking at him is very, very, arousing.\\"<br />Looking at him is arousing? Did an ESL student with a thesaurus write this?<br /><br />What I finally realized is the secret to Fifty Shades' success isn't about the (poorly written) sex at all, it's all about the the fantasy. It's about an untouchable, wealthy, gorgeous man that sets his sights on a plain jane that hypnotizes him as much as he does to her. It's about this mysterious, beautiful stranger that protects and lavishes gifts on an innocent woman, and happens to give her dozens of orgasms, all in the first week of losing her virginity.<br /><br />I'm just making a guess here, but I'm pretty sure the majority of ladies that lost their virginity wasn't in the bedroom of a sexy mogul after he had bought her rare, first edition, priceless books, with the act ending in multiple orgasms. Unless by \\"bedroom\\" I mean \\"an '83 Camaro\\" and by \\"mogul\\" I mean \\"that older kid with beer on his breath\\" and by \\"first edition of rare books\\" I mean \\"Bud Light\\" and by \\"mulitple orgasms\\" i mean \\"stabbing pain\\".<br /><br />TL;DR - God what crap. Seriously, it's a poorly written fat teenage girl fantasy.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|I always had a fair amount of interest in both ICO and Shadow of the Colossus, both from their constant classification under the \\"video games as art\\" label and the general positive reviews I've heard through the years.  This HD rerelease of the games in a single collection provided the perfect opportunity to go back and check out both majestic adventures.  However 3D platforming is one of my least favorite genres, as I often have trouble navigating them and most games of this ilk cause me headaches, etc if played for any real length of time.  But there have been a couple of exceptions so decided to plunge in and see what happened.<br /><br />As it turns out I didn't get very far in either.  I tried them weeks apart to minimize the effect of my bias and issues, as well as my impression of one game affecting the other, but by the third save point in ICO and the second colossus in Shadow I'd had too much motion sickness, 3D jumping puzzles and falling off of things.  It was a shame too, as I really did want to see more of each universe, find out what happened to Ico and his companion, and see more of the amazing colossi.  But in the end as interested as I was and lovely the games looked, I didn't want to play any farther.<br /><br />Although you don't always have to enjoy something to recognize it's brilliance.  Both games are amazing achievements in minimalist storytelling, atmosphere, and design.  The graphics are astounding for games that began their lives on the PS2, and if 3D platforming is more to your liking than mine each game will be a distinct treasure.<br /><br />My rating is a balance of the easily recognizable outstanding quality of the games and my not as exceptional personal experience playing them.  If you're intrigued and 3D platformers are your friends, pick this collection up without hesitation.  If not, despite being classics, ICO and Shadow are unlikely to change your mind.
B007WFR1MQ|3.0|I already listen to all tracks off youtube, and yes I bought the CD as i support the band.  So here what I think.  All music guide sums up the album as I think. [...].  I think Fear Factory is trying to win the hard core metal fans by doing the same **** over again.  Mechanize was good, this album is like Mechanize part II in style.  Fear Campaign kicked ass because of its killer guitar solo.  When Dino left and Xtian came in, he made some killer solos.  And Transgression is an album I like because it's different while alienating the hard core fans.  I love bands that do different things after each album, but the Industrialist is a step back to Mechanize.  And Burton's vocals is bland, all he does now is scream and clean.  I know he has more wonderful eclectic range vocal to do like circa Demanufacture..  Don't hate me, he has a good voice, all he does now is making noise.  If FF doesn't do something different, I may give up on them.  The concept of the album is the only thing I say that is good, Burton has mad writing skills.

B004132I20|5.0|I watched the three episodes of this first \\"Sherlock\\" series on PBS (produced by BBC America) and enjoyed them so much that I purchased the Blu-Ray.  I love the integration of 21st century London into the original tomes.  The characters of Sherlock Holmes, John Watson, Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft Holmes and Lt. Detective Lestrade are perfectly cast, and the development of their ongoing relationships is well done.  The episode in which \\"Lestrade\\" did not appear was disappointing.  The Blu-Ray is a two disk set with interesting additional features. I am thrilled that Series Two has now been released.  I initially watched it on PBS also, and intend to order that DVD as well.  I was pleased to learn that Series Three is currently being filmed.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies...just can't get any better.  Every bit of dialogue is quotable.  Have watched dozens of times, will watch dozens more.  Can't say enough good things about this movie.  There, I think that's gotta be at least 20 words.
1603427244|5.0|This was a pre-purchase before the publication date.  BEST BOOK EVER.  The illustrations and pictures are great. This book tells you how stretchy the cast on or bind off is. It tells me what the particular cast off/bind off are for.  It includes colorwork cast ons. It has decorative cast ons /bind offs. I think it is a must for every knitters library. And the price-what a bang for your buck.
0802136834|5.0|I enjoyed this book, though it is very long.  The Tudors have fascinated me for years, and Anne Bolyen in particular.  I was impressed by the research the author did and the many sources she used.  History is always so facinating because there are so few clear heroes.  I loved the humanness she brought to the story.  No fairy tale can capture true life.<br />Imagine the king in all his glory, yearning for the son to extend his dynasty.  The aging queen, deeply religious and determined to keep her throne, and the younger woman.  You can't beat the plot!  The initial reluctance of Anne to defy the kingdom, and the eventual hatred she bore a woman who only tried to retain the love of a man not worth having is priceless.<br />The author is the first one I have ever read that painted Jane Seymore as anything but a timid, submissive creature.  Bravo!  She knew what she was doing!<br />My only complaint about Anne of Cleves was the postulation that Henry could have possibly been rejected by Anne first was not explored.<br />I think she did a good job with all his wives, and the history is far better and clearer than say \\"The Tudors\\".  Who needs to embellish when you have the real thing?

Heck Neil and The Shocking Pinks is better than this by a long shot. As a fan of many many years I just beg you to quit soiling your legendary status. I know some NY fans would give five stars to Neil Breaking wind on Vinyl. Really this is not a lot better than that. I can't think of a worse NY record honestly.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I love scary movies. The problem is hardly any scary movies are made any more. Slasher flicks, torture flicks, gross flicks, stupid moronic flicks, yes. Genuinely creepy, scary flicks, no. The Woman in Black is a genuinely creepy movie. It has great atmosphere and subtle creeps that build into a goosepimple-inducing conclusion. I love that some of the scares are so subtle that, if you're not paying attention, you may miss them. I'm 48 and, if I think about this movie too much before going to bed, I have to leave the light on for awhile until I quit thinking about it because it creeps me out. I know some people don't like the limited dialogue but, since Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe's character)spends much of his time at Eel Marsh House alone, limited dialogue is logical. I'd think it strange if he wandered around spewing  a constant monologue (just because I talk to MYself, doesn't mean NORMAL people do.) Also the dialogue isn't needed or missed, as everything is explained if you pay attention. Even without the extensive dialogue, Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job of projecting his character's loneliness, heartbreak, and growing worry that he's losing his grip on his sanity. The very last shot before the credits gave me the shivers. I LOVE the shivers! Great, great movie.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Some people are very very sensitive, romantic, and very very impulsive.  You can be a brilliant passionate person, and still be the sort of person who makes the absolute most insane decisions.<br /><br />He fixated on one thing, this one thing that would make his life magically better... and he clung to the fantasy too long.<br /><br />Caring about someone who's that capricious can be absolutely terrifying and very stressful.<br /><br />The movie itself is fascinating, and it really draws you in. I recommend reading more about Christopher Mccandless if you want to know more bits and pieces of information that you may have missed or were left as little plot-holes. The wikipedia article is lovely and concise, but if you don't trust wikipedia, there are other resources.<br /><br />I didn't really like the way it skips around time periods, but I could follow it well enough.<br /><br />I also didn't like how they portrayed him as so wise, and that inexperience seemed to be the only thing that killed him. There's a lot of information about him out there, and it would appear that he was willfully ignorant of a lot of things that could have each saved his life.  I even read that some people think he had a map, but threw it away so he could be the trailblazer.<br /><br />All in all, you'll probably cry. It'll absolutely break your heart if you know someone like him.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.
B000063IPX|5.0|Sabotage is an eclectic album that shows Sabbath almost warring with themselves over how to sound.  The mixture of styles results in some of the most stunning moments in their discography, and even though the second half of the album falters to some extent, it all adds up to a unique masterpiece, one of eight recorded by the original line-up.<br /><br />The previous release, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, took the band to new places.  Arena rock, prominent synthesizers, and orchestral arrangements all made their debuts on a Sabbath album, although the band retained some darkness with the title track and the anti-religious Who Are You?  Still, most everything about the album had a lighter touch than anything before it.<br /><br />In some ways, Sabotage is a push back, and in others it's a continuation of SBS's progression.  The hard-hitting guitars in opener Hole in the Sky seem reminiscent of Vol. 4's Supernaut, but with more attitude, more of the 70's hard rock bad-a** sound.  Ozzy's vocals are more aggressive than usual, often sounding angry.<br /><br />After the brief, delicate instrumental interlude, Don't Start (Too Late), the aggression kicks into overdrive with the ultra-heavy Symptom of the Universe.  This song, with its chugging guitars and snarling vocals, has been named by many as the first thrash metal song ever written.  The mellow acoustic jam at the end of the song only makes its heaviness more apparent, and Ozzy's singing on that part has never been better in his entire career.  It's one of Sabbath's best songs, bar none.<br /><br />The next song, Megalomania, is like a marriage of SBS and older Sabbath.  It combines the old and the new for a nearly ten-minute epic that intertwines all of the band's styles.  It's complex structure and seamless meshing of sounds shows the band at its most versatile and innovative.<br /><br />Then things get a little inconsistent.  The Thrill of it All starts with great riffs and vocals, then shifts into arena rock mode for the second half of the song.  Supertzar is not exactly the best of the Sabbath instrumentals, with a riff that repeats over and over and a chorus chanting along with the guitar.  What was surely meant to sound ambitious seems more like filler.  Speaking of which, Am I Going Insane (Radio) is a synth-reliant tune with a Mary Poppins melody that just has never quite worked for me.  Geezer's bass is really about the only thing that sounds interesting in this song.<br /><br />The album finishes strongly with The Writ, which features more awesome riffs and vocals, and another upbeat rock ending similar to the style incorporated on SBS.  The reason I give Sabotage five stars is because, even though it has some weaknesses, it's every bit as strong as SBS, and in some ways is better.  For one, Iommi's heavy riffs are far more abundant, and many are up there with the best of his career.  And Ozzy was completely on top of his game, turning in arguably his best vocal performance on a Sabbath album.  And, of course, it has Symptom of the Universe.<br /><br />Even though Black Sabbath has stronger overall albums, Sabotage is important and incredible in its own ways.  Its strengths make it a must-have for anyone interested in either this band or style of music.

It combines the old and the new for a nearly ten-minute epic that intertwines all of the band's styles.  It's complex structure and seamless meshing of sounds shows the band at its most versatile and innovative.<br /><br />Then things get a little inconsistent.  The Thrill of it All starts with great riffs and vocals, then shifts into arena rock mode for the second half of the song.  Supertzar is not exactly the best of the Sabbath instrumentals, with a riff that repeats over and over and a chorus chanting along with the guitar.  What was surely meant to sound ambitious seems more like filler.  Speaking of which, Am I Going Insane (Radio) is a synth-reliant tune with a Mary Poppins melody that just has never quite worked for me.  Geezer's bass is really about the only thing that sounds interesting in this song.<br /><br />The album finishes strongly with The Writ, which features more awesome riffs and vocals, and another upbeat rock ending similar to the style incorporated on SBS.  The reason I give Sabotage five stars is because, even though it has some weaknesses, it's every bit as strong as SBS, and in some ways it's better.  For one, Iommi's heavy riffs are far more abundant, and many are up there with the best of his career.  And Ozzy was completely on top of his game, turning in arguably his best vocal performance on a Sabbath album.  And, of course, it has Symptom of the Universe.<br /><br />Even though Black Sabbath has stronger overall albums, Sabotage is important and incredible in its own ways.  Its strengths make it a must-have for anyone interested in either this band or style of music.

B004GJDQT8|4.0|I really like this app. If you know what you want, search and buy. You can even track your orders. The only reason 4/5 stars is because missing (a) sort by price (b) needs input field to apply promos.  Otherwise if you shop on Amazon, this is must have app.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Cool book. This the fifth best book I've ever read. Hope it is cheaper. Overall it is a good book. Okay, this book give me night mares.
B0086700CM|4.0|The game is fun but it should have more bioms. Maybe something like a lake with no trees around it but that's up to the creator. Also try not to get adictid to it that can be a problem. Also what is nice that it is free. But there are power ups you can get also more charecters to play with. (Highly priced tho no cash) Your mane goal is to get away from the man eater monkeys with a artifact or something. also wen your doing that you try to collecet coins that are around the trail. you use the coins to buy stuff. But you should give it a try its free remember that.

B005LAZIRY|5.0|This album is nothing short of a stunning masterpiece. I am not a long standing Opeth fan so I don't have much history apart from Watershed to base my opinion on some of their older music. So to disappointed Opeth fans who complain about the sound changing too drastically or no more growls and super heavy parts in Heritage, I am not going to speak to all that discontentment. All I wish to do is bring to people's attention this unprecedented masterpiece in the world of metal. I have not heard an album like this which so very tastefully blends so many sounds and influences while staying true to metal. The nylon strings playing over groovy drum parts is just crazy in songs like Nepenthe and Folklore! This sort of sound is nothing like I have ever heard before. There is so much thought and SOUL put into each song that you laugh at other bands who put such an insincere effort into creating songs just because of contracts obligations. Bands such as Dream Theater need to learn a lot from bands like Opeth and Meshuggah.<br /><br />Anyway I digress... this album is a MUST LISTEN. To some this may be acquired taste but believe me if you listen to this entire album patiently from the 1st song to the last without ipod shuffle or any other distractions, you will realize the enormity of complexity and beauty in this album. This is a sort of an album that comes every once in a long while and then blows every one away. Please listen to it...patiently...about a couple of times. And then you will be addicted and mesmerized by the trippiness of their sound and music quality.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I first found this on instant watch on Netflix since I am into watching British mini series.  This series turns out to be really long but honestly one of my favorite movies to watch when I'm feeling Austen-ie but don't feel like a stuffy old movie.  This has such a fresh and fun prospective on Austen's Pride and Prejudice you'll find yourself sucked right in wishing you could trade places with the heroine Amanda Price.  My husband pokes fun at me because I've been know to watch this movie back to back in one night!  You can say I'm a bit of a fan!  I bought the DVD so that I can always have it ready on hand!

B005HSG3VK|4.0|I purchased this product approximately one month ago and am very pleased with it.  It is lightweight yet durable.  It fits perfectly to the Kindle, and is not as clunky as some of the other cases/covers I have seen.  I have dropped my kindle a couple times, and the hardness of the outer shell protected it from any damage.  I can carry my Kindle around with me in my purse and not worry about it getting scratched.  The strap provides additional security when not in use.  Also, it is green friendly.  The package it is shipped in is recyclable!  It's a great alternative to all the leather options out there if you aren't into that sort of thing.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is I wish the cover came in more colors.  I ordered pink, and it is definitely bright.  Maybe in due time there will be more options.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to Kindle users.  :)

0307594165|3.0|I think that Toni Morrison represents the best state of American literature: Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, Beloved, A Mercy.  There are passages from this book that live up to her craft.  However, the book reads like a first draft of a greater novel.  One wonders if she could have fleshed out this draft into a fuller work.  I would have time to wait, and I hope she has the time as well.<br /><br />I wonder if she has ever considered the form of the short story.

B007JRUCGO|5.0|Okay, I don't normally comment on movies although our family watches many varied types of them through Amazon Prime by streaming them at home. We've passed Happy Feet 2 over several times even though the family enjoyed the first one very much. We did this simply because we were looking at the star ratings at a glance and didn't want to spend hard earned money on a movie that was apparently sub-par as many times sequels can be. How wrong this assumption was! We fully agree with the other raters of 4 and 5 stars! This movie was very enjoyable and entertaining both in content meaning and through the musical themes. For those of you that are hesitant because of the ratings of 1 star, disregard them. This movie is very enjoyable and has meaning along with entertainment value for the whole family. Perhaps a few feel that the movie theme is repetitive, and in some aspects, perhaps it is. But it is a sequel after all, that by nature will follow certain themes. However, if you give it a chance, you and your family will likely also find it is underrated by those person(s) that for whatever reason have negatively targeted this movie. Good luck and enjoy the show!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Firstly, you can fix the issue with the purchases by simply putting parental controls, I also don't have to shut the kindle down in order to exit the game? love the game, it doesn't revolve around in-app purchases as most games like this do.
B0059XTV7Q|5.0|The movie itself was very good and took me by a surprise. A true fairy tale brought to life by Madonna. She did an excellent job! A prince falling in love with a commoner has its limits. A having an affair with a married woman that already had a divorce is problem. Being the third husband and next in line for the throne is another. Being American is another obstacle they faced. Many details about the two were left out of the movie, but that was because it was a love story. STILL AMAZING!<br /><br />The shipment and packaging was on time, and this was everything I asked for

B007URVZJ6|3.0|It is really not fair to actually rate any sort of manual-type book or booklet.  There are so many writers who will use this information, each with varying degrees of expertise on a computer.  I gave this three stars because I had several problems with it; however, I am not advanced in using the computer.  What I found difficult might be quite simple to others.  My saving grace is that there are surely others who know less than I.<br /><br />In the section \\"Tips On Formatting,\\" it states:  \\"Insert indents at the beginning of paragraphs.\\"<br /><br />Does this mean that each time you begin a new paragraph it will be necessary to use the Word-default Paragraph Formatting?  Or does it mean that once you set the indentation correctly, each paragraph throughout your book will be automatically indented according to your original settings?<br /><br />Under this same heading, is there a recommended value for spacing between paragraphs?  When spacing between paragraphs, it states, \\"Word will allow a 10 point space ---\\"  I have Word 2003 and it allows a spacing of \\"6\\" and the next value shown is \\"12.\\"  The \\"6\\" looks a little crowded but the \\"10\\" seems too wide.  I used the \\"6\\" setting, judging by the visual shown.  Does this matter?<br /><br />As a help to writers, I would like to see instructions for deleting a page break.  It is so easy to get an unwanted page break and wind up with blank pages and I cannot find out how to get rid of the unwanted pages.  Since there is a requirement to use this function frequently both in creating Front Matter and Back Matter, it would be helpful to know how to get rid of those extra pages.<br /><br />Also \\"Heading One\\".  There was just not enough information on that.  Will the use of Heading 1 allow you to center your \\"Chapter 1\\" and each succeeding chapter?  Is it necessary to include a brief description of what the chapter is about?<br /><br />Also, do writers add the Table of Contents on a new page, at the end of the Front Material or on the same page with the first chapter.  This was very confusing.<br /><br />Would it be acceptable to use the Ctrl E to center Chapter 1, etc?<br /><br />I am starting my third book.

1451608659|5.0|As I watch the Olympics on TV, a certain name will be reflected upon, after reading this thought-provoking, touching Memoir. The story of Dominque Moceanu will tug at the heartstrings, long after this book is closed. The winner of a Gold Medal, who gave so much of herself, but also faced many challenges along the way. Among the Glory also came the hardships, and memories that may be difficult for her to erase. One woman, filled with inspiration and courage goes the extra mile to achieve a lifetime honor many can only dream of. Dominique is a Hero that will indeed be remembered. Highly recommended for all Memoir lovers, who enjoy inspirational stories!

0743298039|5.0|LOVED The Thirteenth Tale and this is why: I became lost in it.<br /><br />I don't care to break books down and debate character development, plot devices, relation to previously penned literature, because what I inevitably end up asking is, \\"yes, but did you ENJOY it? Did you sit down to read at 8 and realize suddenly that it was past midnight?\\" Sometimes I think we get so caught up in the intellectual pursuits of \\"literature\\" that we forget to just enjoy the feast someone has taken the time to prepare for us.<br /><br />I was entranced by page 17 by someone who clearly loves a story as much as I do. I stole 15 minutes here and 10 minutes there just so that I could again sit at the feet of Ms Winters while she wove her tale. By the end, I had been kicked in the stomach, made to laugh out loud, and had a broken heart. What did I do about it? I sent a copy of the book to mom's Kindle, then another copy to older sis (who in turn had two copies sent to friends of hers), and one to younger sis. I BOUGHT THE BOOK FOUR TIMES! Is there any greater compliment to an author?

Lee beats Catherine to an inch of her life and leaves her for dead.<br /><br />Lee is sent to prison. Catherine starts a new life and changes her name to Cathy. Cathy gets a new tenant in her building. His name is Stuart and he is a doctor. Stuart is trying to help Cathy with her disorder. In the meantime, Stuart would like to start a relationship with Cathy. This will be hard as Lee has been released from prison and is coming for Cathy.<br /><br />I have seen this book making its way across the world wide web. I knew I had to check it out. The opening scenes with the court room script was good. I thought with this that the story was going to so somewhere good. Unfortunately for me the characters did not do much for me. I felt the story was slow to get going in the beginning and the flashing back and forth was not as smooth as I would have liked. It read kind of like little snippts or dreams of Catherine's. Now, this may have been what the author was going after, which in this case, it worked. My problem was that I was suppose to like Lee in tbe beginning and understand how Catherine could fall for him but I did not see this. All I could see was the signs that he was bad news for her. Of course, this can be blamed on the fact that she was in love, which the saying goes \\" Love is blind\\".<br /><br />Catherine did not have much of a personality for me. She was kind of bland. I don't think it was her compulsive disorder that can be faulted for why she felt the need to check all her locks double and triple times. Or why she had the feeling that someone was watching her. Catherine was right that someone was watching her...Lee. I can not blame Catherine for having her guard up. If I went through what Catherine did with Lee, then I would have my guard up too and it would be protected by my two friends...Smith and Wesson.<br /><br />The relationship between Catherine and Stuart seemed one sided in the beginneding with Stuart taking the lead. The psychological thriller aspect that I thought I was going to get with Lee stalking Catherine was more on the quiet side until the last half of the book. Overall, a galant effort for Elizabeth Haynes and her first novel..Smith and Wesson.<br /><br />The relationship between Catherine and Stuart seemed one sided in the beginneding with Stuart taking the lead.

0385738773|4.0|The Death Cure by James Dashner opens at the headquarters of WICKED.  The subjects have been rescued from the Scorch and it's finally over.  The Trials have ended at last - at least, that's what WICKED keeps telling Thomas and the other \\"subjects\\" who made it through the Scorch.  But Thomas isn't so sure, and he can't find it in himself to trust WICKED or anything they say.  They've lied about having a cure for the Flare.  Some of the subjects are immune to the disease, but a few of them are not, and those that are not were surely infected as they traveled across the Scorch.  Those infected will turn into Cranks unless WICKED is able to find a cure, and fast.<br /><br />WICKED has told them that once they get their memories back, everything will make sense.  They've been mapping a particular part of the subjects' brains, called the Kill Zone, and recording their reactions to certain variables as they experienced the Trials both in the Maze and in the Scorch.  Once the subjects memories are restored, WICKED will be very close to completing the cure for the Flare.  But Thomas, Newt and Minho have had enough, and the three have plans to escape from WICKED.<br /><br />The final book definitely carries much of the same tone of despair and internal conflict of the other two novels in the trilogy.  While the plot of this book wasn't as tightly woven as the other two, I felt it was definitely worth the read and a good ending to the series.  There were some really great unpredictable moments in the story, and the author did a great job of tying up all the loose ends - some of which I didn't realize were still dangling.  I did tire a little bit of all the characters running around and escaping, but knowing how it all ended was definitely worth pushing through some of the more tedious moments.  If you've read the other two you should definitely read the last book so you know how it all ends.

0385738765|4.0|Escaping the Maze was supposed to be the end of the Trials, at least that's what Thomas thought.  His hopes were even higher as a group of people came and helped the Gladers escape from WICKED, the people who had put them in the Maze.  But his world crumbles around him as he and the rest of his group wake to find their rescuers dead and even worse, Theresa is missing.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials, by James Dasher begins where the first book in the series, The Maze Runner, leaves off.  Our hero, Thomas, along with Minho, Newt, Frypan and the other surviving Gladers are now forced into a new trial.  They are all infected with a deadly disease called the Flare that is now ravaging the world.  In order to receive a cure they must cross through 100 miles of the Scorch, a vast expanse of earth that has been turned to desert by the sun flares, and reach the safe haven within two weeks. The Scorch is full of Cranks, people who have been infected with the Flare and are slowly going insane, among other dangers, and Thomas and the Gladers are again forced through peril after peril as they fight to make it to the safe haven in time.<br /><br />As sequels go, I thought the book was really well done.  There is a heavy feeling of despair as Thomas is forced through the worst part of the surviving world, which really mirrors Thomas's internal struggle as he tries to face his own responsibility for the Trials and the Maze in particular.  I found the Cranks and the idea of the Flare to be fairly terrifying, as these infected people seem to be going slowly insane and ultimately reduced to zombie-like beings feasting on human flesh.  The author is very adept at creating vivid environments, and his descriptions of the Scorch feel almost tangible.  Again, the complexity of the characters was shown through many unexpected twists and turns in the plot - all of which kept me turning pages until the wee hours of the morning. If you liked The Maze Runner, you'll love this sequel.  In fact, Isuggest buying all three books (or if you have an expensive reading habit like me, check out all three from the library) at the same time so you don't have to wait to delve into the next book.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I picked this book because of all the positive reviews.  I was very dissapointed.  I have never not finished a book that I started but was sorely tempted with this one.  Maybe it was written for teenagers, I don't know.  But if that is the case, it certainly did not send a good message.  The whole idea of drinking the number of shots to match your age on your birthday is ridiculous and dangerous.  In this book one person points out that it might be dangerous however the boyfriend is the hero because he takes 5 of her shots and holds her hair out of the toilet when she is sick!?!  I can't begin to tell you how bored I was with \\"I love him\\", \\"I don't love him\\", \\"I love him\\" ughh! I didn't like a single character in the story.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|I don't know what this was, it was soulless, heartless Hollywood fluff at best, Colin Farrell was not sexy and was horrible in this, I was glad when Chris Sarandon made his cameo appearance because it reminded me to praise him for how much better he was was in the 80s original,half a star goes to the special effects b/c they were ok, but the writing was awful b/c they felt the need to explain everything that was obvious in the film, the cinematography was poor,there were severe developmental issues, zero suspense, and it seemed rushed, I tried to watch it as a stand alone movie and it didn't work, this movie was a travesty. Stick to the original.

B007P06DOK|2.0|Note: This is a review of the remastered sound quality on the 25th Anniversary CD release.<br /><br />About the only good reason to remaster a classic album for CD these days is to improve upon errors made on past remasters, since most classic albums have now been released on CD multiple times already.  The best a remastering can do is to faithfully reproduce the sound of the original album, as it was intended by the creative forces that produced it, and possibly improve on it with a superior higher-resolution transfer of the original tape.  More often than not, however, remasters are just used as a justification by the record companies for the umpteenth dip into our wallets, doing nothing to improve the sound, and going a good distance toward making it worse.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what we have with this latest version of Graceland.  Rather than giving us something noticeably better than the previous 2004 remaster, Sony has just given us more of the same.  Because the company has its eye on the deluxe package market, with all the bonus tracks, luxury-grade packaging, DVD concert, and an $85 price tag, the album itself has become almost an afterthought.  That is unfortunate, because this classic album deserves better.<br /><br />A bit of a history lesson for the unaware: Graceland was first issued in 1986.  Mastered by Greg Calbi, the CD at that time presented the album very well - with an appropriate level of gain that left breathing room for the dynamics, and a natural, mellow EQ that allowed the music to speak for itself.  Indeed, comparisons to vintage vinyl reveal that the 1986 CD was very similar in sound and dynamic range to initial vinyl pressings of the album.  In 2004, Warner reissued the album with (non-essential) bonus tracks.  The remastering by Dan Hersch and Bill Inglot was louder, and was underscored by a V-shaped, in-your-face EQ that pushed both the low and high frequencies.  In 2011, Sony released a newly mastered disc featuring the sametrack listing as the 2004 Warner version.  It was again mastered by Greg Calbi.  Now, in 2012, Sony has come out with this latest version, also mastered by Calbi.  To my ears both the 2011 and 2012 releases sound identical to each other, but the 2012 version has a different selection of bonus tracks, and is dubbed the 25th Anniversary edition.  (Why the 25th Anniversary edition should come out 26 years after the album's release, I have no idea, but that really is the least of this version's problems.)  So, for the purposes of evaluating sound quality, this review serves to evaluate both the 2011 and 2012 releases.<br /><br />So, how did Sony screw this up?  In a word: loudness.  Amazingly, it's even louder and more compressed than the 2004 remaster, and that's saying something.  Consider these stats, which show the peak level and average volume of \\"You Can Call Me Al,\\" from the 1986, 2004 and 2012 CD masterings, respectively (units are the percentage of a CD's maximum gain):<br /><br />1986: peak = 98.38; average = 39.63<br /><br />2004: peak = 98.85; average = 74.22<br /><br />2012: peak = 96.69; average = 80.65<br /><br />Even with a lower overall peak volume, the 2012 remaster still has a significantly higher average volume than even the 2004 remaster, and it is actually more than twice as loud, on average, as the original 1986 master. Although the tracks do not appear to be clipped, peaks are still maxed out, with no breathing room for transients.  The compressed dynamics really rob the music of a certain amount of punch - something African rhythms should have in spades.  Everything sounds the same, and nothing pops or jumps out as it should.<br /><br />What's really too bad is that the EQ on this release is actually very nice.  It strikes a good balance between the neutrality of the 1986 release and the over-emphasized highs and lows of the 2004 remaster, adding a bit more character to the 1986 sound, without going over the top.  Had Sony coupled this sound signature with the dynamics of the original mastering, I think this could have been a very good release.  However, as it stands, I cannot give this a positive recommendation.  If you're not a critical listener, it will probably sound OK to you, because the EQ is pleasing enough; I wouldn't go so far as to call this \\"unlistenable.\\"  However, the bottom line is that this not an improvement over what has come before; rather, it is yet another step backwards.  If you already have the original CD, you've got the best CD version available, by a considerable margin; this remaster does not warrant a re-purchase.  And that's really where this version ends up failing.  Although Sony evidently expects us to pony up the cash for a triple dip, the company has not given us something worthy of the expenditure.  Nor have they given newcomers to this perennial favorite the definitive sound a remaster ideally should provide.  What we are left with, then, is a commercial afterthought and a wasted opportunity.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|When Caravan and BU2B were released last year I wasnt thoroughly blown away. But starting with the title track this CD put it into overdrive and is just an unbelievably enjoyable listen.  I do agree with other reviewers that it is alot to take in initially but after the third listen, at least for me, this is a CD you cant wait to listen to again and again. It is like any concept album... you really have to listen from beginning to end. I also dont understand the bashing of the production value. It is in no way the trainwreck Vapor Trails was. Just go and get it already and enjoy

B007P06DJK|5.0|I had not purchased the original Graceland CD.  I saw the 25th anniversary video on TV so I decided to buy the \\"anniversary edition.\\"  What you should know is that the \\"anniversary edition\\" is nearly identical to the original CD.  The songs are exactly the same as the Original with four exceptions: There are three additional cuts and my version of the new release includes a DVD of the fascinating story that I saw on TV.  On one of the addition cuts Paul Simon gives a 9 minute description of the music in Graceland which is very interesting.  If you buy one version, buy the Anniversary Edition which is available with or without the DVD.  Paul Simon fans should find the DVD worth the time and money.  However, I should not have purchased the original Graceland CD.  When I ripped the two CDS to my desktop, Windows Media Player did not automatically generate metadata(album information).  After importing it manually, WMP changed it, removing most of the information.  This occurred with both CDs.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|What's with everyone saying you need internet connection to watch your digital copy? This is false! Highest rated commented is a blatant lie; what a joke. The only requirement is that you need to use their software \\"Flixster Collections\\" to access and watch your movie.<br /><br />After you redeem your movie using the code, and installing \\"Flixster Collections\\", you can download the movie to your machine, which is probably going to be placed in your \\"Videos\\" folder. You then must launch Flixster Collections to view the movie. You can't use any other player to watch it.<br /><br />You're welcome
0061537969|2.0|This book was not that great. I bought it because I am a dog lover, it is a novel about dogs, and it has gotten mostly really good reviews. I thought it was overrated. The author wants to write in the first person as a wise old dog complaining about the stupid things humans do because, it seems, the author himself wants to complain about the stupid things humans do. Not really the best forum for these types of complaints, in my opinion. The lessons that can be learned from Enzo (dog) are good ones, but they're lessons that most sensible people ought to know anyway. I can't say I'd recommend this to any of my friends. If you like reading, and you like dogs, go pick up a copy of [[ASIN:1416583432 Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know]] by Alexandra Horowitz, and your time will be much better (and much more enjoyably) spent.
B000PUQTWS|1.0|The new soundtrack by The Silent Orchestra completely ruins this version of the film (Amazon Instant Video). Maybe it's because I'm a classical musician, but the score renders this otherwise great film unwatchable. It's jarringly modern and busy and often doesn't fit what is happening on the screen. I've seen many silent films both on tv, online and in person as we're lucky to have an original silent movie house in town that still plays them with the original organ and sound effects, nothing has been as bad as this reworking.<br /><br />If you want to see a great classic vampire movie with a proper score, check out [[ASIN:B000W3YLH8 Vampyr]].

B007MDB71O|5.0|I've been an avid ERB fan since the 1960's.  This movie captures the spirit of Princess of Mars.  A mad mix of cowboys & Indians with a liberal dose of the Roman Empire.  We loved it.  True, the technology is \\"dated\\"; but the original story was penned a century ago.  Suspend your techno-cynicism and open your mind to a heart warming inperplanetary swashbuckler adventure.

You will  perceive your own problems as minor when reading all that Adam overcame and accomplished. I will tell you I cried over his letters and laughed at his antics.

It is a beautiful story full of surprises, hurt, love, family, strength and sacrafice.<br /><br />There is no way I could not read the second book that followed, which equally did not disappoint!  I really loved this book and feel that it is well worth the time and emotion, that I hope to repeat again soon.
B002ZG981E|5.0|An amazing movie with a great cast, story, and effects. Along with these is great video and sound quality. This movie delivers on all fronts. The story is gripping and the acting is solid. Confusing so don't watch this movie if your tired bc you WILL get lost.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I recently read and hated the popular erotic novel \\"Shades of Grey\\" and have no urge to finish the trilogy. In fact, I'm ashamed I read the first one. I should have done more research before buying it to see what it was all about, but I really wanted to see why it has become so popular. I figured it couldn't be that bad if the books were ranked first, second, and third on the New York Times' Bestsellers List. The main reason I disliked the book was the romanticized view the author gave to what I believe was an abusive relationship. I'm sorry, but even between consensual adults, sex should not be something one has to sign a contract for so that the man can dominate you, punish you as he sees fit, and control and abuse you. Not sexy! I know some women are attracted to the idea of \\"fixing\\" a damaged man, but I think it's completely ridiculous. Any relationship where you have to hide the way the man treats you from your friends and family is not a healthy relationship. And the plot had some major holes. I'm supposed to believe that a girl who is still a virgin because she has very high standards in men would then decide to lose her virginity to a completely messed up, mentally damaged sex addict just because he's handsome? Not believable! The other reason I hate it is because it has very little plot and what little plot it has is so obvious that I guessed the secret behind Mr. Grey's traumatic childhood in the first half of the book. Why read two more novels? Plus, I started just skipping the sex scenes because they were so frequent and repetitive. If you want to read a good sex scene, read any of J.D. Robb's In Death books. Finally, the writing itself is terrible. How many times is the author going to repeat the same phrases? If I had to hear about Ana's \\"inner goddess\\" or read about her biting her lip one more time, I was going to throw the book across the room. Anyway, that's my take on the book. Read at your own risk.
B000AL730O|2.0|I like the CD and would normally rate it with 4 stars.<br /><br />However, what Amazon.com doesn't tell you is: this CD is content protected - hence I cannot put a lossless copy onto my NAS which makes hearing this CD a hassle.<br /><br />Thus, I cannot rate it with more than 2 stars.

B007V693YK|4.0|Great app. I mean, a little off tempo, but still a good app. Device used: Kindle Fire. I enjoy that you can slow it down, and the favorites feture. NOTE: NOT EMPLOYEE OF GUITAR TABS LLC.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I know I've heard all of these songs before or at least these types of songs but . . . something's different. It's like all the best elements of music from the likes of the Rolling Stones, Etta James, Janis Joplin, the Beatles, Sonic Youth and many more were somehow transmogrified (sorry, I had to use that word) into new songs in an entirely new way. Brittany Howard brings a raw emotion along with the talent to lift each song up like a wave rising out of the ocean and expressing every high and low with genuine feeling and unbelievable rhythm. The band ain't too shabby either. They do a heck of a job integrating their instruments into Howard's vocals. Without them Howard would still sound pretty good but the band adds a ton of dynamics to the songs. The sound of the guitars on this release are classic and simple. I can imagine the amps used were some type of throwback variety. The drums sound very raw but clear and especially outstanding during the verse/bridge of Rise to the Sun. The bass sounds great and the organ is a perfect addition.<br /><br />I listen to every song, over and over with the exception of Heartbreaker. For some reason it sounds like meandering circus music. It'd be all right if was about half as long but for what it is I can't get through the whole thing.<br /><br />If you're thinking of getting Boys and Girls, get it. It's pretty transcendent stuff.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really do not understand the hype about this very stupid book.  I only read it because it was part of my bookclub's picks.  I was a bit curious with all the talk about it and I was very disappointed.  I guess it is for bored housewives who are into s and m.  Definitely not for me.  I knew it was going to be soft porn and I was okay with that but it was just plain boring and stupid. Yuck!

B004X75RK4|1.0|I like Sandra Bullock and I like romantic comedies--so I ordered this movie.  Big waste of money for me.  Sandra Bullock had no charm for me whatsoever--it's like she delivered her lines deadpan.  Not a trace of electricity between the two at any point.  When they had their first \\"serious\\" kiss I was almost embarrassed for them, it was so perfunctory.  On the same flight I watched Midnight in Paris (where we were flying to).  It was awesomely beautifully filmed.  Got the taste of The Proposal out of my mind.

Also, guys in the 60's and 70's shouldn't be singing the same kind of songs they were doing 50 years ago.

That being said, though, I can honestly and without bias say that I LOVED this book.  I think that others have summed up what makes this book great much more eloquently than I could, so I won't try.  I will say, though, that I started reading and couldn't get my mind off the story until I had finished it.  I've already recommended it to every science-fiction reader I know.  It's more than worth the price.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I think the problem is they have abandoned the keyboards all together. They are way too guitar heavy.  Alex may like it, but they sound like they did on their real early albums (Fly by Night; Caress of Steel; 2112). After going too far with the keys on Grace Under Pressure, they were achieving a perfect mix of keys & guitar (Presto; Hold Your Fire; Counterparts).  Now, the last 3 albums have completely abandoned the keys.<br /><br />IMO they were best when they just started to introduce keyboards (Permanent Waves; Moving Pictures; Signals).  They need some songs where keys are again the primary melodic instrument).  Sorry Alex.

It was pretty obvious that it was all about counterfeit money as soon as he mentioned that Jack's brother worked in the treasury department.  And when the great cop, Roscoe, winked at a strange man who was behind bars in her jail, that was pretty much as far as my suspension of disbelief was able to go.<br />The most amusing part of this to me is that Tom Cruise grabbed this as a vehicle for himself.  Nicole Kidman would make a better Jack Reacher, since he is about 6' 4\\".  Dream on, Tom.
B00514HDNW|1.0|I wasn't a big fan of the movie, which I saw first, but this book was even less noteworthy. Some broad themes were used by the film but it ended there. Mostly a vampire book so if you are into that, perhaps it is worth a look. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Not science fiction by any stretch of the imagination. I found the writing tedious, the pacing glacial and ending a disappointment.  Thank goodness I got this as a Kindle book for 99 cents. Even that may have been too much.

You want even more vindication that Joss Whedon's (Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) film, The Avengers, is worthy of your hard-earned dollars.<br /><br />I give it five out of five stars.<br /><br />If you keep up with my reviews, you know this is not a rating that I hand out lightly.  So I will give you some reasoning.  First, and most impressively, every single actor is given an equal amount of screen time in this film.  Did you love Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in his brief cameos from the other films?  You'll see plenty of him.  Did you think Robert Downey, Jr. was the perfect fit for Iron Man (as I do)?  You'll get your fix.  Were you impressed by Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye or Chris Evans as Captain America in previous appearances?  You won't be disappointed.  Each character is also provided an ample introduction for you to become quickly acquainted with them, or to jog your memory of their powers and origin.  And if you are already familiar with both, then these scenes compose a pleasant \\"calm before the storm\\".<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo has been cited as the best Hulk yet, better even than Bill Bixby, according to radio personality and \\"Hollywood Babble-On\\" co-host Ralph Garman.  While I first found this to be sacrilegious, I knew I had to see this film on opening weekend to see if I would agree (in addition to my adoration for Tony Stark).  I would have never chosen Ruffalo for Bruce Banner, and yet he was impeccable.  I was just as wrong about him as I was about Heath Ledger being the Joker in The Dark Knight.  Ruffalo masters a nervous tic so well that you find yourself feeling bad for him.  You hope he doesn't become the Hulk (even though you still hope he does) just so he doesn't have to experience the anger and pain that come with the transformation.  Ruffalo truly is the best Hulk.<br /><br />Loki, the villain of the film, is played by Tom Hiddleston and is sexy probably, in part, because he is so evil.  He is a great counterpart to Thor as his brother.  Thor is someone I was never personally interested in and to this day, I have yet to see the film.  However, I must eat crow and say that Hemsworth possesses a much finer acting ability than I initially believed he would.  I took him for an airhead; he is not even close.  I am now interested in seeing Thor based on Hemsworth's performance in this film.<br /><br />There are almost as many scenes of comic relief in The Avengers as there are action-packed scenes.  Believe it or not, the Hulk provides some of this much appreciated wit.  Some have said that the last third of the film is one long-running action scene.  I found the entire film to be.  Very few scenes were slowed down.  This was a film where you either kept up or got left in the dust.  It is two hours and twenty minutes of non-stop action.  The dialogue is witty and the acting is so well honed that I found myself scoffing at the Academy as I watched the scene between Loki and Thor at Stark Tower.  How can they continue to dismiss comic-book movies for a chance at the Oscar when great ones such as this are continuously churned out?<br /><br />Even if you haven't seen Captain America, Thor, or either of the Iron Man films, even if you know nothing at all about comics but love action films, I strongly suggest you see this film.  And if you are a fan of all of the above, then there is no reason why you shouldn't see this film.  It's even great for kids, as there isn't much profanity and there are few scenes of graphic violence.  RottenTomatoes.com gave this film a 93% rating and they know their stuff.  I give it five out of five and I like to think I know mine.f the film, is played by Tom Hiddleston and is sexy probably, in part, because he is so evil.

030758836X|5.0|If there's one thing I've learned, it's that you can never know what goes on between two people behind closed doors.  Certainly that idea is at the heart of Gillian Flynn's third thriller, Gone Girl.  It's the story Nick and Amy Dunne.  Amy has disappeared on the fifth anniversary of their marriage.  There are signs of a struggle at the house.  Nick is sick with worry.<br /><br />The tale of what happened is relayed in alternating first-person he said/she said chapters.  Additional interest and suspense are created by the fact that the two narratives are not on the same timeline.  Nick's narrative is taking place in the present day and describes the police investigation into Amy's disappearance and the many surprising details that come to light in the wake of that event.  Amy's narrative is in the form of a diary written during the course of their courtship and marriage.  As time passes and Amy remains missing, her narrative is steadily moving towards the day of her disappearance.  There are plenty of shocking revelations that will come from her as well.<br /><br />The twist is that these are both unreliable narrators--and absolutely fascinating characters!  Nick, Amy, and the many supporting characters are terrifically well-drawn.  But plot is king here, and Gillian Flynn has constructed a top-notch page-turner.  There were twists, turns, surprises, and out and out jaw-droppers all along the way.  I couldn't put it down.  More than anything, I was just delighted with a mystery that didn't follow the conventional formulas.  The structure added real interest to the reading experience, and Flynn kept me guessing until the bitter end.  Bravo!

B000UTZ510|5.0|I love Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's music, and cannot understand people who doesn't, but I respect their opinions. I loved the movie and the songs very much, and they are 2 of my favorite musicians ever. Even before, when Glen was in The Frames, later when they became The Swell Season and later when they started working on their own. I highly recommend this CD, it is great!!<br />And well, this was my first purchase in Amazon, and I gotta say I don't regret it at all. My package was i perfect conditions and I got too excited when I got it. For first-time buyers don't hesitate, it is great!

030758836X|5.0|I am one of those people who have to have a book that will keep my attention or I will NEVER finish.  THIS IS IT and so much more.  I loved how Flynn prepaired this masterpiece- two different individuals telling \\"their side\\"....  When book begins, it gives you just enough to crave more and before you know it, you CAN NOT put it down because you JUST HAVE to know, \\"where in the WORLD is this going??????\\"<br />The book has SO many twist, turns, shocks.  VERY clever, thrilling, suspenseful, unpredictable.  A MUST READ.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is some of the language - However, in the defense of the author, this was a definite character builder, and I looked over it and did not let that aspect ruin what I thought of the book.<br /><br />OVERALL - YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book in two days, I simply could not put it down! Each chapter is full of excitement and it leaves you wanting to know what happens next. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have trouble connecting to a book where I have little to no sympathy for the title characters. Nick and Amy Dunne were unlikeable to  me, continually whining their self-absorbed tale of woe. Even the author acknowledges this: \\" Now is the part where I have to tell you (spoiler deleted) and you stop liking me. If you liked me to begin with.\\"  I didn't.  You watch as their marriage decays in alternating chapters with Nick speaking in real time and Amy in flashbacks through her journal. One day Nick arrives home to find the door open, the living room in disarray, and Amy gone.  I was frequently bothered by the character's actions. Have you ever been to Missouri in the height of summer? Even Satan wouldn't sit in a garage with no air conditioning and read magazines.  My aggravation increased with the Law and Order type blueprint ripped from the headlines.  Oh, yeah here's Nancy Grace and Mark Garagos, hmmm, sounds like the obvious sociopath.  Can Ms. Allred be far behind?<br /><br />Then I hit a few pages shy of the halfway point...all is forgiven and forgotten.  What follows is darkly clever and absorbing, guaranteed to evoke the involuntary wince. There is no fork involved, but I think perhaps Gillian Flynn has created a character that just may be Dr. Lecter's mental match.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|The beginning starts out well and then the book takes a turn to awful. I kept waiting for the main character to redeem herself, act strong, and tell Travis to take a hike! What an awful message to send to women. All the book did was anger me in every way. Why on earth would it ever be okay for a man to be so controlling, aggressive, and domineering. And no.. There werent any redeeming qualities in him that made me like him in the least. No one, male or female, should ever be treated as property by another human being. Would never recommend this book to anyone. In no way are th actions in this book romantic. They are abusive and mentally ill.

B004P1JDJO|5.0|I think the author took great deal of thought to simplify the complex issue of human motivation. The result is a book with 3 simple concepts that just may change the way you think of human motivation.<br /><br />We are driven to be free (autonomous) to choose our own destiney and pursue life, liberty, and happiness. We know autonomy, especially at work, is not always present and often a precious commodity. Gaining it is a huge incentive and managers should seldom give away autonomy for nothing. Instead, managers should use the lure of autonomy to create more intrinsic motivation.<br /><br />But we also know we can't be free unless we gain mastery of our own circumstances. We want to be in control and become adept and competent in things that matter to us. Freedom is not free. It requires control over one's destiney and that requires mastery over the challenges and externalities that face us. Managers should use the lure of higher degree of mastery of skills to motivate people. It is important the challenge is not too difficult for the person involved, but just enough so the person will face difficulty and yet can overcome with sufficiently higher mastery of the skillset required.<br /><br />Finally, we are motivated by higher purpose other than mere self-interests. We want our lives to mean something better than everyday mundane matters. Managers should seek to motivate people by appealing to higher cause and ideals (Steve Jobs would often say \\"how would you like to change the world?\\").<br /><br />The book is short yet powerful. I recommend it.

0061353248|2.0|After reading this book, I asked myself \\"what was that about?\\". Not exactly the kind of question I would want to ask after reading a book.<br /><br />If the main theme was that people make irrational decisions, I thought the content, empirical research, and the argument was not the highest caliber. Yes, there were some content, research, and argument spread here and there, but they fall far short of the extensive research provided by famous decision theorists such as Daniel Kahneman (whose research all points to that humans are irrational decision makers).<br /><br />For that matter, I don't think any of the points of this book were all that well analyzed. More often than not, the author resorts to anecdotes to cover lack of substance in his argument. For example, we all suffer from procrastination. But what should we do about it? We should come to realization that we are procrastinators, and supposedly, that would make us less of procrastinators. I didn't think that was all that convincing nor epiphany-inducing.<br /><br />My view of the world hardly changed after reading this book.
0802136834|3.0|I am trying to muddle thru this book. It jumps around from one year to the next and back again then forward even further, then back again. Very confusing. I never could understand why authors do that. When I read a \\"history\\" book, I want to read from day 1 to the end. Not jump around and try to remember what was happening.

B0000VD04M|5.0|..what a fascinating film this was and Depp is fantastically entertaining and funny. I think mere words can't describe his character's childlike enthusiasm and willingness as a director to keep making films. The man who played Dracula was amazing and he said something which I will carry to grave as something that helps understand women so much. Old Dracula says, \\"The pure horror, it both repels, and attracts them, because in their collective unconsiousness, they have the agony of childbirth. The blood. The blood is horror.\\" BEST DIALOGUE EVER! I knew it was a fantastic film right then. I recommend being patient with this film.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have to say, I now own 4 of these babies. I have never been happier with a lav mic in my life. I have Shure and Nady wireless and wired lav mics that I paid a fortune for that sound more hollow and quiet. These mics pick up everything so wrap them in moleskin (if using them taped to clothing) or just clip them somewhat close (be sure to use the windscreen) and you will be golden. Just be sure to have a quiet room either way. Not sure what the complaint is about the volume or battery life. I actually have to lower my volume on the camera or recorder to stop it from clipping most of the time and when I do, I can easily hit that sweet spot. I eq it in post and it always comes out clean and full. The batteries have lasted me on multi-day shoots. Just be sure to carry a few extra (they are cheap batteries) and turn the barrel off when you're not recording and you will have no problem at all with battery life. I have an $800 shotgun that will go dead if I leave it on too so just use common sense!<br /><br />Ok, one complaint though... these should come with one or two replacement windscreens - they are just too easy to lose and you can't buy a direct replacement as far as I know. Other than that, I use them daily and professionally with no sound complaints. I will post an example in the near future.

B007SGM084|2.0|There's a term to which I would like to acquaint people: Mary Sue.  It refers to a protagonist who appears to be able to see everything and do everything perfectly within a story with little character development necessary.  The main character, Anastasia Steele, is a virginal 21 year old woman who literally stumbles into her love interest, Christian Grey.  She's slim, intelligent, witty, moral, humble, beautiful, capable, adventurous, sympathetic, empathetic, bold, brave, etc., etc., with a love for late-20th century British romantic literature.  To make us like her, she's a starving student living with her well-off bestie and doesn't even own a computer or smartphone (unheard of in this day and age!).  He's smooth, handsome, urbane, grossly wealthy, adventurous, moody, intimidating, capable, intelligent, generous, forward-thinking, etc., etc... oh, but he had a horrible early childhood and, as a result, has used BDSM to learn and maintain control over his world.  Nobody's perfect, right?<br /><br />Did I mention the main character is a virgin?  Oh, yes.  This goes back to her love of Victorian-era British literature.  Another theme in literature at that time was the 'virginal harlot': a young woman who, after being deflowered by her suitor, becomes so enamored of the experience that she transforms into a wanton woman who constantly desires intimacy with said suitor.  At the time, such writing was considered pornography.  This is what we have in the relationship between Steele and Grey (get it?  Get it?).  Her first coital experience is with a man so well-versed in physical intimacy that she becomes instantly addicted.  Of course he is addicted as well because this story wouldn't be nearly as appealing to most 'vanilla' readers if he had pursued more intense action from the beginning.<br /><br />This is where the story descends from 'potential' to 'derivative'.  He wants to control her, she refuses to be controlled; he attempts to spoil her, she is uncomfortable with said spoiling even though it's in her best interest since he's a hideously wealthy business tycoon (ie, walking target); they fight, he uses BDSM to attempt to 'tame' her and she, through her love and stubbornness, begins to reform his unhealthy Dom ways.  Apparently, all a troubled Dom needs to be able to leave his painful path is the love of a good (virgin) woman.<br /><br />These novels reminded me of the Twilight series and not in a good way.  The writing itself is terrible.  The constant email exchanges were cute at first but became tiresome by the end of the story.  The only character who showed any development was Grey and I would have enjoyed this more had he been written to keep his Dom persona as more than a roleplay trigger for the protagonist's lust.  The main character is Bella Swann in 3 years, possessing the same inability to communicate, identical clumsiness, even the same body and features!  By the end, every couple is tied neatly in a bow, every character who should be happy is happy, and everything is all hearts and roses with a little hardcore sex mixed in.  Grey carries a similar pathos to Edward (I can't fall in love because I'm a hideous person/vampire who will only hurt/kill the woman I love and I will be left alone, all alone, forever and ever and ever!), is rich, accomplished, and so on, and so on.<br /><br />The author comes off as a Bronte fan who was influenced by Twilight, replacing the supernatural elements with BDSM to spice things up whilst hurling herself down the well-tread hallways of Harlequin Romance to pick up some angst along the way.  The story is predictable, driven mainly by Grey's angst and Steele's stubbornness with scenes of light bondage and/or graphic sex every half chapter or so.  I would have been able to tolerate such predictability had the writing been better but in the end I was left wondering why I spent so much money on this hyped-up drivel.

B00130VLZ4|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He felt it was a great product because it protects the camera without the bulkiness of a bag. We just came back from a trip and he used it every time we went out. At first I was worried because some reviews said it didn't have a strap but then I read some that said that it had a place where the straps from the camera come out. It works perfectly that way. Why would you want to have another set of straps? This way it fits in there perfectly and it is great when you are going to be walking  a lot and  don't want to have to carry the larger camera bag but at the same time your camera is protected from any bangs and scratches.

0812993292|5.0|We all have a road to travel in this life. Thankfully, at some of the mileposts we get to choose the direction we would like to take. Sometimes the road we choose is for the better, sometimes it is not. We can't always tell when we take that first step where the road will truly lead. Harold Fry has come to one of those signposts. It appears as a letter he receives from an old friend, Queenie Hennessy, whom he worked with before his retirement. Harold hasn't had any contact with her since she left work after a heated argument with their boss many years ago. Harold retired not long after and has lived a lonely life with his estranged wife. Maureen seems to be only going through the motions of a marriage. The typewritten letter, signed by Queenie, states that she has been suffering from cancer for some time and is now confined to a hospice with little time left. She simply wanted to say goodbye. Harold is stunned by the news. Confused about how to reply,he writes a short note, tells his wife he is going to put it in the postbox, and walks out the door. Unable to part with the letter and the memory of Queenie, Harold goes to one postbox and then further to the next box and then the next. He finds himself in the center of town still holding the letter. Harold decides to call the hospice and tell Queenie not to give up. He has decided to walk the two hundred or so miles to the hospice to see her. In the back of his mind he thinks that as long as he continues to walk she will hold on and wait for him. Is this a selfless act? Is it more about Queenie continuing to live or about Harold not having to say goodbye? Is it about the journey or about reaching his goal? Harold meets a lot of interesting people on his pilgrimage. He also learns much about himself and the choices he has made in his life both right and wrong. There are many surprises along the road. This book is well worth the journey.

They went in-depth about how they made the scene where there are 7 Harrys, which was really cool and interesting. If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, this is worth adding to your Harry Potter movie collection for the sake of the extra disc of features!

B00802JMPO|4.0|Not literary art....but a fast read and entertaining none the less.  Heard the hype surrounding these books and thought I'd find out what all the hubbub was about.  Personally, I was less interested in the erotica (aka romantica), but rather more so in the main character's personalities and how they develop and grow together.  That being said, there was something very intriguing about the sexual \\"openness\\" the couple shared.
B001KTVVZS|5.0|Heartbreaking and inspiring story. Ishmael is a true survivor. I cried while reading this book, even putting it down a few times. To think of any child having to endure what Ishmael did is unbelievable. It's so horrifying to think these things happen to children. He tells this story in such an honest way. Everyone should read this.
B004UID2LC|3.0|this app really had me excited when I first downloaded it, it gave me all the vids and jams I could get my hands on, but yen it started giving me pop ups, and it became routine to press it, then have it fail, then press it again, which was annoying, then it wouldn't let me connect to the Internet, and it made me stay on the page that I was downloading stuff off, or it would only download half, and today, it just wouldn't open. But, since there is nothing better for kindle fire, I am re-downloading this app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|much more user friendly, radar comes up almost immediately.  weather channel app. I'd have to wait 15-20 sec for radar to fully download.  seems like more info from accuweather, but easier to digest then TWC.
B005JABSB6|5.0|I have been shopping around for 3d glasses for my new sharp 80\\" 3d tv. I bought this and could not wait to get it. They shipped it fast and they packaged it well. They are great. I love watching 3d tv, but I am hoping that uverse adds more 3d programming so I can use them more. I've used it for about 8 hours and have not charged them yet. The only problem, is I have a 4 yrs old, and they are way too big for her and keep falling off. I am hoping to figure out a way for them to work on her face. I tried replacing the nose piece, but still they still fall of. Otherwise, they work great for adults.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a very fun game. Whoever you are you shoud get it. now I am trying to beat my dad. I love it.you could get to really high levels.
0062183591|5.0|If we're honest with ourselves, we know we're not honest with ourselves, at least not always. Post-Enlightenment rationalism has a myth of humans as instruments of reason, and sees unreason as a failure of human nature. But behavioral economist Dan Ariely, who has studied the limits of human rationality for years, turns his attention to what those limits say about humans' ability to deceive. And his results are fascinating.<br /><br />Classical economics contends that most people weigh the rewards of breaking the rules against the risk of getting caught. Ariely demonstrates how that vision, called the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC), withers under scrutiny. Even as a thought experiment, it doesn't make sense, or nobody would carry their laptops and iPods in public. But Ariely isn't content with thought experiments, when he could apply very real science.<br /><br />Behavioral economics apparently combines the most ambitious aspects of developmental psychology with business administration. As such, Ariely buttresses his assertions with bold new research. He demonstrates, through clinically controlled experiments, the manners in which honesty waxes and wanes. And he shows the manner in which diligent leaders can encourage greater honesty without resorting to irrational moralism.<br /><br />Start with two seemingly contradictory facts. First, if we remove consequences, nearly everyone cheats at least a little bit. Second, almost nobody cheats as much as they could. Even if we kick the doors wide open and send all the guards home, few people would plunder the treasury. We can perform bizarre mental gymnastics to rationalize away small transgressions, but people will do what it takes to think of themselves as essentially good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, we often cannot see the subtle ways in which daily life undermines our honesty. We miss the conflicts of interest that plague virtually all of us--if I can recommend two choices of action for you, and one will make me a profit, what will stop me from putting your needs ahead of mine? And, strangely enough, common human altruism can justify dishonesty. If I can tell a lie that earns you a reward, my likelihood of dishonesty increases.<br /><br />But it's not enough that dishonesty just happens; it also spreads virally. When we see people who essentially resemble us get away with dishonesty, we are more likely to cheat ourselves. Anyone who remembers the business ethics failures of 2002 and 2008 recognizes this. The reassuring corollary of this, however, proves that, if we see others resist dishonesty, our likelihood of virtuous behavior increases. We seek role models, even as adults.<br /><br />Importantly, the most common suggestions for suppressing dishonesty don't work. While Ariely proves that supervision discourages cheating, regulation only works if regulators remain omnipresent yet emotionally distant, which is unfeasible. And harsh punishments only work if people perform cost-benefit analysis before cheating, which Ariely shows we do not. Thus both the traditional liberal and conservative solutions prove founded on empty air.<br /><br />Ariely's most notable solution to dishonesty is also his simplest: remind people that they have a moral code. If people signed contracts, tax returns, and other documents at the top rather than the bottom, people would fudge less. If we ask people to contemplate their ethical foundations, they act appropriately. Even self-avowed atheists cheat less after swearing on a Bible. These elegant solutions arise not from external scolding, but innate declarations of character.<br /><br />Rituals of purification also seem to make a difference. Research subjects cheated less right after Catholic confession, the rites of Ramadan and Yom Kippur, and other sacred \\"reset buttons.\\" Of course, today's plural society could not compel us to participate in religious rites; but Ariely speculates on the possibility of creating secular equivalents. Consideringe a profit, what will stop me from putting your needs ahead of mine? And, strangely enough, common human altruism can justify dishonesty.

Consideringhow many of us have something to confess, I heartily endorse this plan.<br /><br />I wish Ariely addressed how much our flexible honesty is innate, and how much is learned. In a late chapter, he describes performing his honesty experiments in multiple nations, finding that people demonstrate similar levels of honesty across borders. But since all societies rely on standards of trust, a dishonest society seems very unlikely. Perhaps Ariely could only test inherent honesty using children raised by wolves or something.<br /><br />Ariely demonstrates that, if we clear away the ideological rubbish, the systems currently in place to encourage honesty have not worked. If we claim to be rational people, we will stop clinging to our Enlightenment myths, and recognize the deeper truth: humans are complex and inconsistent, and deserve the respect that comes with addressing our issues with nuance. We can become honest. Here's hoping.
B007X16GFC|5.0|This movie is awsome!! Good story...Great acting...come on Markie Mark...how can you go wrong!! I will actally purchase this movie for my libary!
B000059HAI|5.0|This is an excellent, factual depiction of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. It has no accompanying romantic side stories to muddy up the facts.  It is told from both Japanese and American sides, and includes the work/intrigue in Washington DC leading up to the attack.  It is fascinating!
B001P3SA94|5.0|Cadillac Records is the based on a true story account of the beginning of Chess records, the man and the label that produced Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Little Walter and more!<br /><br />I don't know alot about the true history of that story, but Cadillac Records (named such b/c everyone who worked there got a Cadillac during a time when that was \\"WOW\\"), does a fantastic job of telling a great story.<br /><br />Adrien Brody and Beyonce deliver solid performances that really bring you into the story; as does Columbus Short (Lil' Walter) and Jeffrey Wright (Muddy).<br /><br />This movie is a must see!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a preety good and preoccupying app. not much to say a bout it since I really haven't completed the whole game but its pretty fun now and that's what counts
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addicting. This game has a veriety of players cheats and backgrounds. I just cant get enough.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Cant beat this knife for the money, its 1095 steel it came very sharp has a kraton handles that can be unscrewed and removed or replaced with wood or another material the sheath is well made with a pouch I put a fire kit and whistle in mine, its One big hunk of steel only 4 stars because its very heavy could of drilled some holes under the handle to lighten it up a bit. Great addition to my bug out bag...
B004J4RQIM|5.0|We're flabbergasted watching this concert on Blu-ray, everything seems to be perfect and it is, performances, stage present of every single performer, location at Mandalay Bay Las Vegas and last but not least the OUTSTANDING quality of this Blu-ray. Thank you David, hoping for another one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is porn for women.  Period.  End of story.  And frankly, it pretty much IS the story because there is no other plot beyond the sexually inexperienced young woman \\"changing\\" the damaged, sexually experienced, sexually aggressive great looking and wildly successful man.<br /><br />I gave the book two stars because it wasn't the author's fault I read a book that has no underlying plot other than sex (it was given to me by a friend) and because for what it was, it was well written.  But I couldn't bring myself to give it a higher rating because it was very unrealistic, the characters weren't particularly likeable and it lacked a real plot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game it is simple and fun and doesnt take hours to play!  i would definetly download it again!
1781161097|5.0|Couldn't agree more with the rest of the reviews! I reccomend this book to everyone who liked the movie - it will make you love it even more :) Also, the international shipping is extremely fast, at least in my experience - I'm from Republic of Macedonia, and although it said that it will be delivered on 15th ( I ordered it on 11th), I got a call from UPS on 13th.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I adored Season 1, and were really looking forward to the second season. We had heard some complaints that it was too dramatic and had become too much of a soap opera with its twists and turns, so weren't sure what to expect. Fortunately we loved it - this is television after all, and we are looking for entertainment. Some of the dramatic turns tiptoed right up to the line of cheesiness/soap opera, but in the end stayed just shy of it I felt. And the romances are all pitch perfect, almost operatic in their tension and drama.<br /><br />As for the actual events, I don't want to give too much away, but most of Season 2 takes place during World War I, and Downton Abbey is converted into a convalescence home. This provides for even more exploration of class relationships, tensions, and changes, as many of the usual social conventions are put aside in the chaos of wartime. All of the performances are once again pitch perfect, with grand dame Maggie Smith a joy every time she comes on screen. The sets and clothings are so much fun, and we get to see Downton decorated for both a wedding and Christmas. The Christmas finale is excellent - better than many top movies!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game and its finally here I love it and It took a long time for people to get it tor the kindle fire but that's ok
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love the music and all the funny things that happen in it. Its not to easy and its not to hard. Perfect for wasting time and having fun. You would like it plus its only a dollar.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|Movie was recommended by a friend.  Loved it, alittle quirky but great fun and a nice message. The Cafe still exists to this day.
030758836X|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time. Flynn has written an absolutely and wonderfully psychotic story with authentic characters originally created.  Hannibal, Missouri, is an unlikely, but unique Midwestern setting where life is usually so predictably hum-drum; but here, it is the perfect backdrop from the Dunne madly fueled marriage.<br /><br />The writing is so perfect, just genius.  I cannot wait until this novel is on the shortlist of the 2012 awards (hopefully, an Edgar).
B005HSL626|2.0|this game is OK but first the letters are cunfusing and the music is STUPID for all of you who have a KINDLE FIRE DO NOT GET THIE APP!!!

B005FITIDC|5.0|Yes, I knew going into this film that it was based on a true story, but simply watching all the REAL photos and videotape of the REAL Sam Childers in action (back in the day, and quite recently too) I was blown away that Butler had nailed this guy's unrelenting perseverance to a tee! This movie is incredible, you can never take your eyes off of it, and whilst all the time you are waiting for Childers to take a bullet (especially when Kony puts a bounty on his head), there is never really a time when you think he can't survive all that he is given.<br /><br />The film starts in Sudan in 2003 and shows a village being burnt to the ground, but not before the pilledging, and plundering, and raping, and killing of young and old - all brought about by (the now fugitive) warlord Joseph Kony. We then go back a \\"few years earlier\\" to Pennsylvania, where Childers (Butler) is getting out of jail. Met by his long-suffering wife, Michelle Monaghan, he soon gets back into his bad ways re: drink, drugs, whoring, and robbing and killing!<br /><br />She has found The Lord since he was last away, he thinks that's funny, until one night he nearly kills a hitchhiker on the side of the road. Soon he joins her in Church, becomes re-baptised and slowly, but surely Childers takes on a whole new God-empowered persona. He builds his own church across the street from their new house, as now he has his own building contractor company, and when a visiting Pastor comes over from Uganda to tell of the troubles over there too, it's then he knows what he has to do.<br /><br />And therein falls the last two thirds of this glorious film. Childers invests all his time and efforts into building an Orphanage in Uganda, one that gets burnt down the first time, but not the second. He tries to make the streets safe for the kids (that are everywhere, scattered after the Kony raids), and even joins in when it's time to fight the rebels - hence the term, Machine Gun Preacher.<br /><br />At the end of the fim,which I won't give away, the credits roll and reveal that Amnesty International estimates that Kony and the LRA are responsible for over 400,000 murders and 40,00 child abductions alone! And that, to this day, Sam Childers STILL fights for the children of the Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda.<br /><br />Russell A. Trunk (ExclusiveMagazine.com)
1572816112|4.0|This deck is a stunning ensemble of disturbing - or grotesquely comic - images, and the artwork is well above average for recently issued decks.  Indeed, the presentation is unique.  It will perhaps appeal primarily to those with a bit of the Goth in their blood.<br /><br />I would not use it for divination, I would not put it on display, but I think it is one of those decks that - if you let it slip past you because it makes you squirm a bit - you will regret it.
B008359JXI|4.0|Amazon's video player dropped the stream 5 times while I was watching the show - thanks amazon. The deficiencies in the video player are so detrimental to the experience that I regret having made the purchase, even though I really like the show itself.

0545305497|5.0|I was skeptical about these books because of the Twilight series. These are much better; the writing is more advanced and not so \\"angsty\\". I am looking forward to seeing the movies now.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is fun. Not a big challenge and a little time consuming. The grafics are okay. It is nice sometimes to play a game that is more laid back.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this becasue it was so popular, however, it seems like it was written for a teenager. I'm glad I didn't buy the trilogy since I only got 1/2 way thru the first book.
0345803485|5.0|E.L. James' account of a look into the lives of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey in \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" - Book one - was a wake up call of real life.  There really are high level executives living this way, and there really are inexperienced and naive women who, even though they may not ever have a chance with these men, WISH they did.  Everyone wants to be loved, and desires that ultimate, optimum feeling of peace and serenity in their lives. How they attain that is a matter of preference, choice, and opportunity.  Thanks, E.L. James.
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant stop playing. I am only taking the time to write this just so it will shop asking me to and I can play in peace.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|As a serious Rush fan of 35 years and 34 Rush concerts I have mixed reviews on this album. As musicians, Geddy, Alex & Neil are phenomenal, no doubt about that.<br />However, I think many times in their writing they are so good instrumentally and they challenge themselves so much, that they overwrite. Its like they put too many ideas into a blender and it came out scattered with little structure. Trying to hard. I mean too many changes in the FEEL of the song overall. Dont get me wrong there are a some masterpieces on this CD, but most of the songs just spin in circles not really locking on to a melody if you will. It leaves the listener feeling scattered, trying to piece together what they just heard. Ask yourself this.. Why do people like songs in the first place? The melody!I think as musicians, Rush has become so good, they are writing music to themselves if you will and not the listener.( I know it was for me,not you that I came to write this song). Rush can write some exceptional complicated music and thats good at times as long as the flow and structure of the song still sounds and feels good.There is definitly something wrong with the mixing. Overall I give this album a three-star. JA

1612130283|5.0|I needed a short time to get use to the way  it was written, being a Nora Robert fan. But it's really as addicting and interesting as any good Nora Robert but steemier, so better. I hope she doesn't stop there.
0321647440|3.0|For those who elect to buy the ebook (as I did) be aware that you have to download large lesson files as well.  I should have done so at the time of purchase instead of waiting.  My plan was to study the book while traveling -- a great idea until I found out I needed to download a substantial amount of lesson data on slow and inconsistent wifi.<br /><br />I'm still downloading so this review is based only on this warning!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This film blew my mind how good it was to watch! It is a must for any collection. I truly believe this is one of the most underrated film of all time. Great action, great scenery and great story! I watched this TWICE in the theatres and now I will add it to my collection for years to come.<br /><br />Great job Disney
B005GQ5IA0|5.0|No wonder this is at the top 10 list of several Horror book lists. I would say that this book is a must read for every one interested in this type of book, it's also only about 160 pages. Having seen the movie before reading it doesn't spoil anything.
0345803507|5.0|OMG!! This is a yummy set of books to read. You MUST buy all three at the same time. Make sure your male partner is ready to keep up!! When I finished the first one, I had to immediately start the second one. Thank goodness I didn't have to wait for it to ship. I read all three within a week and I hate to read!! This trilogy is more for women than men, sorry guys its a love story with no pics.
1603427244|5.0|Casting on and binding off can be very confusing to describe with just words.  This author does a good job of marrying short, clear text with very clear pictures to make these techniques easy.  Especially helpful is the categorization of CO/BO's by what they are best used for, i.e. stretchy, firm etc.  It is very handy to have to other \\"nicknames\\" that may be used for the various techniques included in the titles.  There are places where patterns are not written to any firm standardization and having these alternate names clarifies the directions. Spiral binding is a bonus, as the book doesn't try to change pages or jump off the lap!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I love playing the game, and think It's really cute.  However, there. are a few things I would change. One, from time to time, the information would overload the device and I'd have to back out and start again. Also, there are times that it is hard/near impossible to advance without buying some kind of package. For example, some things cant be bought with anything but &quot;acorns&quot;, but there is no way to earn them .... you have to buy them.
B0086700CM|5.0|really good, I've been waiting for this app to come on the kindle fire for weeks now. Not a waste of time or money!
1423113454|3.0|Since the death of their mother, under strange circumstances six years before, siblings Carter and Sadie Kane have been raised apart.  Carter spends his time in constant travel with their Egyptologist father, Dr. Julius Kane, while Sadie lives in England with their Grandparents.  Only, allowed to see Sadie two days a year Dr. Kane uses one of his visits to take the siblings to the British Museum where he plans to \\"right a wrong\\".  Unleashing forces beyond his control Dr. Kane is taken prisoner.  In order to save him Carter and Sadie must learn about their Egyptian heritage which includes magic, the blood of Pharaohs and communing with Egyptian gods.  Using the newly acquired knowledge they must quickly learn to master their new skills and challenge the god Set, to save not only their father, but all of Northern America.<br /><br />Told by both Carter and Sadie this story is a tale similar to Percy Jackson's with an Egyptian twist.  This, however, doesn't hurt it.  Riordan found a good formula with Percy Jackson and I can't fault him for applying it in another series.  He has fairly developed main characters in the Kane Chronicles and nicely incorporates Egyptian mythology into real life to create an interesting story.<br /><br />On the other hand, the format took a bit to get used to and this book was far less funny than Percy Jackson.  I did not care for Sadie's constant and unnecessary derogatory use of the term \\"God\\", nor did Riordan quite pull off her Britishness (calling some \\"thick\\" and eating \\"bangers and mash\\" does not make a Brit).  I also, while appreciated the glossary, would have liked it more in depth.<br /><br />Overall it was okay.  I don't regret the time reading it, but I do hope in the next one Riordan can find a better rhythm.<br /><br />For the full review and others visit whymsylikesbooks dot blogspot dot com
044024630X|3.0|This was my third Jack Reacher novel, and as with the other two that I had read, this fulfilled its basic purpose to entertain. This novel, though the latest of the series, almost acts as the prequel explaining the emergence of the now 'nomadic' Reacher that we know.<br /><br />Set in 1997, Reacher is still with the Army, and he gets deputed to a small town in Mississippi concerning mysterious killings of of some young women. The town has a huge Army establishment, and the Army wants to ascertain whether one of theirs was involved in the crime. Hence Reacher is given the job of passive reconnaissance. But, Reacher being Reacher, the protector of justice, ends up getting involved in murky world of high level politics. During the week that he spends in that town, he makes a couple of friends, including a local lady Sheriff, but it turns out that she herself is of a questionable past. Unlike the other novels in the series, Reacher gets into hand-to-combat only a few times, and there are no prizes for guessing who wins those bouts. Eventually, Reacher secures justice, but for himself he earns an unknown future. The fate of the relationship between Reacher and the Sheriff (Elizabeth) is left unanswered rather abruptly towards the end.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the story entertains, but does not exactly 'thrill'. This novel is a fast, 'masala' read, and to that extent it is enjoyable. If you are a Reacher fan and like macho, vigilante adventure with some suspense thrown in, go ahead and grab it. If you are rather looking for a high quality mystery, perhaps you are better off exploring other options.
1442973587|5.0|I am very particular about the books I buy. I don't have a lot of time so I select books very carefully to make sure my time is not wasted. This book is amazing and is perfect for where I am in my life. The laws are described very clearly and each law has a simple bullet point to follow on a daily basis. My appetite to live my best life is taking me to new levels and great, real, polished, effective and easy to use advice such as this book is a major guidance in my journey. Also I love the fact that is short and compact!

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I've never written a review on amazon before. Normally, I feel like the others reviews are adequate. But this movie was a surpise hit for me, and has become one of my all time favorites. I have a whole lot to say about it, but I will spare you much of my thoughts on how well this is filmed and character development, etc.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie deserves all 5 stars (which is why I'm even writing this), and those who gave it one star just don't \\"get it\\". For those of you with an appreciation for fine cinematography, perfect timing, perfect use of sound and music, and have the attention span of an adult, this movie should satisfy.<br /><br />On the other hand, I can see how some were disappointed, as it was marketed as an \\"action\\" movie. It is not. It is something entirely different, and it is my opinion that it defies any genre label that one might try to slap on it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Addictive story!  Very hard to put down.  I just wanted more with every page.  The description of emotions were pretty spot on.  I connected with the story more because I could remember feeling similar emotions at one point or another in life.  I hope she rights more stories, even if they have nothing to do with \\"Fifty\\".
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Grossly underated sci-fi romp that has all the classic adventure story requirements, including the whole rescue the princess scenario. Awesome SFX and cinematography in this foreunner to more modern classics such as Star Wars.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Guy Richie and crew have done it again. His approach to creating and or recreating the Sherlock Holmes world is what it should be.  The dark grayish scale, rough settings, and gritty dialogue. RDJ and Jude Law bring let get to know SH and Watson even more so. The thing with sequels it would seem that the idea (if they are planning on doing more than two features) is not to out do the first film but, rather BUILD upon it. Like a potter who works and works on a on their craft. Shaping each side of the pot till it is right. Looking forward to more Sherlock Holmes adventures!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I like the relaxing music. Add placements make it difficult to select a puzzle piece without clicking on the add, limited choices for puzzles, but it was free and I guess I got what I paid for :-)
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is hot and steamy. I can't elaborate much more on that, but it's a good one. I've read through it 2x and I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B007I2BYX0|5.0|The Pretty Reckless opened up for Evanescence back in a fall '11 show that I went to. Little did I know that the PR would become one of my new favorite bands. This is an awesome EP and she sounds great in the live tracks. It's just a snippet of what's going to be on the next album, can't wait! So turn the volume up, and enjoy!
B006RUJST6|4.0|To be honest I thought this book was going to be about something else based on the title so I didn't buy it until it was recommended by a friend. I really enjoyed this story. It's a true love story that's full of drama and lots of sweetness.
B007PAAO0Y|3.0|on the real real, this album is interesting in terms of creative concept and how you make a Bobby Womack in the 21rst century with a modern day flip.  now  Womack is one of the Greatest  Artists Ever a proven all around musical force, however this album ain't going to make anyone who is familiar with Womack's peak and prime work even put this in that mix. in other words this ain't touching the Poet 1 or 2 let alone \\"across 110nth\\" street or Communication, etc... Prime and Peak era Bobby Womack, however its a interesting format that allows Bobby Womack to rock a modern concept with some cool results in places and in others its stuff that is just kinda there.  no money tracks here, however some interesting concepts and its cool to hear Bobby Womack back in the mix again.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Buy the book.  Are there some editing issues?  Yep.  Didn't matter.  Great book, great story.  Anxiously awaiting the next.  Reading this genre for 25 of my 41 years now.  Loved it.  It's not Tolkein, its not Shannarra, its not like anything ive read before.  Similar in some ways to coming age stuff but just different.  Really enjoyed it.
B006JTIZGM|5.0|If you ever want to learn something in a funny way, you should consider every title of \\"Head First\\", this is the second book I read from them and I'm happy again.
0345803485|5.0|Definitely believe the hype it is an amazing book. The two main characters are very interesting and relatable. The adventures that they have are very descriptive which will the reader better understand. Overall, I was hooked from the first page and am currently on the third book.  Christian Grey reminds me of another character named Roarke in JD Robb's In Death series which I highly recommend if you like police procedural.

1612130283|1.0|I hated this book for all the reasons everyone else did.  Yes, it's poorly written,redundant and lacks a storyline.  But there are so many lines and scenes verbatum from \\"Pretty Women\\".  i.e. \\"I didn't know what you liked for breakfast, so I took the liberty of ordering everything off the menu.\\" or \\"Do people always do what you what you tell them?\\" How about scenes: he's waiting at the bar and she show's up in a dress or he flies her in his helicopter on a date while listening to opera music.  \\"Stop biting your lip!\\"...Richard Gere- \\"Stop fidgeting!\\" Grey... \\"stop emailing me...Gere... Stop answering the phone.  There are plenty more  even right up to the end.  The sexually deprived women out there are better off watching scrambled porn on cable!
0767827791|1.0|Beware of this 'Restored Print'. Picture quality of this print is terrible and impossible to watch on a high definition display. Furthermore, even though the film was done in widescreen format this is only full-screen. Why would a restored print in this day an age have a full-screen format?
B00018D44U|1.0|Great music, BAD CD! Returned one copy, second copy not any better. ALL the tracks are full of static. Unlistenable.  Total Drag.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I really liked this movie and i especially liked<br />that song that they played when the little boy<br />was dancing...I think it was called and I quote<br />\\"Tiptoe Through The Tulips\\" It was a very wierd<br />song but it suited the movie very well
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|i have all the movies in it's various states vhs singles, vhs boxset, vhs boxset widescreen , dvd set and dvd singles \\"special edition's.\\"<br />and yes i will buy the Indiana Jones cloection on bluray also, you can't beat the sound and picture quality of these movies!  the lush color and scenery in each film, the action and intrigue , the music by John Williams!!<br />All together this will be one of those film sets that stands alone as one of the best! i hope that the blurays will have all kinds extras on the bonus disc!.
0547569653|4.0|Like many people who read this book I first learned about Scott Jurek (and ultras for that matter) in the exceptional Born To Run. Eat & Run is his tale on how it all started and where he's come in his 30 something years on this planet. His beginning is humble and interesting as he learns he's capable of racing these long distances and has a knack really long distances. During this time he explores diet and becomes a vegan, which is something he really struggles to accept in the first half of the book. Scott does make the good point about you are what you eat and the amazing amount of crap we eat as a society is a big problem.  He does include quite a few of his favorite recipes throughout the book, which most sound really good, even for a committed meat eater like myself.  Scott spends most of the book discussing experiences and training surrounding different races. Toward the end he gets a little more personal as his life takes some unexpected turns and he's left to reevaluate things. In the end though it really becomes a book about what is possible in life and to concentrate on the journey rather than the end goal. Overall this was a fun book that only took a few nights to complete.
1603580557|5.0|When you enter the forest , what do you see?Do you see trees one after the other  coming your way? Or do you see the system called forest , with biodiversity , wildlife and an Eco- system?The former is a reductionist way of thinking while the latter is a systems way of thinking .Systems view is a broad overview and enables us to integrate things together.It is not possible to be a change agent(or a change leader)  without learning to think in systems.A system is more than the sum of its  its parts.System behavior reveals itself  as a series of events  over time.System structure is the source of system behavior.But  the word  system  has been used very loosely , and means different things to different people .It is very useful to understand systems and their dynamics in making correct decisions in work  as well as in  personal and community life .Between thinking in terms of persons and events(details) , and thinking in terms of systems(integration) , which one is the correct way ?\\"I do not think that the systems way of seeing is better than the reductionist way of thinking .I think , it's complementary, and therefore revealing\\", says Donella.<br />  Literature on change management makes a mention of  systems and subsystems.When we see an organization as a system  and  have a vision to transform it , its subsystems like its organizational structure  design subsystem, its Human Resource (HR) subsystem , its Information Flow subsystem and Strategic Planning Process subsystem  need to be studied and aligned with its vision for transformation.HR system comprises performance evaluation/appraisal subsystem ,compensation decision subsystem,promotion decision subsystem , and recruitment and hiring subsystems.Do all these subsystems support the transformations?  A change in a system may require  removal of organizational barriers(Leading Change : John P. Kotter; Harvard University Press, 1996.Page103).There are many ways  in which organizational structure acts as a barrier to improvement.Organizational structure may fragment resources and authority/responsibility in such a way that delivering well any new product is nearly impossible.Similarly , organizational arrangements may  dis-empower the people and undermine the vision .Independent silos may not communicate and thus slow everything down.Also , layers of middle level managers  may second guess and criticise the lower employees and huge staff groups at corporate head quarters are  expensive  and constantly initiate  costly procedures and  programmes.Organizational structure may be customer unfocused.All these reasons may call for a change in the design of the system or organization .<br />  \\"Thinking in systems , A Primer\\"  by Donella H. Meadows (1941-2001) was published posthumously  by sustainability Institute and edited by  Diana Wright.Donella completed the draft of the book in 1993 , died in 2001, but the book was published in 2008 only.The book  expands our mind and helps us to see, understand and interact with  our complex  world and take better decisions. Donella was one of  the world's foremost systems analysts and was the lead author of  the international bestseller \\"Limits to Growth\\".I became interested in systems dynamics and  analysis after reading  \\"The fifth discipline\\" by Peter M . Senge.\\"Thinking in Systems\\" is a very good book  for introducing us to the basics  systems analysis.It is different from self help books.While it can be useful in all areas of life , it can be especially useful in policy making , government , business, and ecology.Systems analysis is a subject based on mathematical equations  and  extensive use of computers to simulate systems  , but Donella has made it simple to understand.\\"Systems thinking transcends disciplines and cultures and,when it is done right, it overreaches history as well.. . . .There is much more to systems thinking than is presented here, for you to discover if you are interested.\\"<br />  Highly functional systems have threecharacteristics of resilience,self-organization and hierarchy. The most important part of the book relates  to discovering the  leverage points of a system and  using  these  to change the systems.Leverage points are places in the system  where a small change could lead to  a large shift in behavior.Donella has identified  12 such leverage points:<br />1.Transcend Paradigms:<br />Be and remain unattached to paradigms, stay flexible and realise that no paradigm is \\"true\\".There is no need to cling to any paradigm.<br />2.Change Paradigms:<br />To totally transform a system , intervene into it at the level of paradigm.Challenge the  old paradigm, as recommended by Thomas Kuhn in his book\\" Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\".Keep  pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm.Build a new paradigm, a new way of seeing , a new model of the system.Keep speaking and acting, loudly and with confidence from the new paradigm.Insert people with new paradigm  in places of public visibility and power.Work with active change agents and with vast middle ground of people with open mind.<br />3.Goals:<br />Look at the goals of the entire system as well as the goals of the parts of the system.What whole system goals are you pursuing?You may like to change the system's goal and take up a new direction and a new goal.Articulating , repeating , standing up for , insisting upon a new system goal , is one of the strongest leverage point to change the system.<br />4.Self organization of system's structure:<br />Any system that can not self-evolve, that scorns experimentation and wipes out innovation , is doomed and needs change.We can change such a system by encouraging experimentation , variability and diversity.<br />5.Rules:<br />Rules define the scope , boundaries and degrees of freedom of a system .They are high leverage points and have power .Find out who has the power to change or write or make  the rules, who  has the power to interpret the rules. in case of laws, such power is vested in  the Legislature and Courts respectively.Incentives, punishments and constraints are also rules , though these are progressively weaker rules.To change the system , we need to pay attention to the rules as well as to rule makers.We need to restructure the rules  and imagine what the behaviour of the system would be under the restructured rules.This can result in a fundamental change in the system .<br />6.Information flows:<br />Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction.Adding, restoring  information or delivering feedback to a place where it was not going before  , can be a powerful intervention.It is important that the missing feedback be restored to the right place and in compelling form.Missing feedback loops ensure accountability of decision makers.<br />7.Reinforcing feedback loops:<br />Reinforcing feedback loop is self-reinforcing.If allowed to go unchecked, a reinforcing loop drives system behavior in one direction and ultimately destroys itself if it runs its course.<br />Like soil will erode away to bedrock.Sooner or later , bed rock will crumble into new soil.This is a self-correcting balancing loop.An alternative is to have an intervention to reduce the self multiplying power of a reinforcing loop- slowing its growth.This  is a more powerful leverage point than strengthening  the balancing loops and far more preferable  than letting the reinforcing loop run, like people stop overgrazing, put up check dams, plant trees and stop the erosion .So reduce the gain around a reinforcing loop and slow the growth to change the system.<br />8.Balancing feedback loops:<br />Parts of system relating to information and control are the parts where more leverage can be found.For example, markets are the balancing feedback systems.Price is the central piece of information .To keep it accurate as per feedback power of market signals, you need anti-trust laws, truth in advertising law,the removal of perverse subsidies and other ways of levelling market playing field.This will ensure free, full unbiased flow of information.To improve a system's self- correcting abilities, we need to strengthen balancing feedback controls.For example , we need to provide protection for whistle blowers, we need to impose impact fees, pollution taxes and performance bonds to recapture the externalised public costs of private benefits.<br />9.Delays:<br />Delay length is a high leverage point, e.g. construction time of a major project.Also growth rates are high up on leverage points.Slowing down a growth rate  is a greater leverage point  than faster technological development.Changing delays or growth rates in the right direction  can change systems in a big way.<br />10.Physical Structures:<br />Physical structure is responsible for many distortions in the system .For example , road system is responsible for  air pollution and community delays .Rebuilding of physical structures  is slowest and most expensive kind of change in a system.So it is rarely a leverage point.But when it is , leverage point is in the design.<br />Another leverage is in understanding the  limitations and bottlenecks  of the physical structure , using it with maximum efficiency and refraining from  straining its capacity through fluctuations and expansions.<br />11.Buffers:<br />Stocks that are big relative to their flows are called Buffer.Buffers have stabilizing power.There is leverage , sometimes magical , in changing the size of buffers.But buffers are usually physical entities.(like storage capacity of a dam) and are not easy to change.Buffers are not very high on the list of leverage points.<br />12.Numbers , parameters and details:<br />Numbers , the size of flows, annual deficits,minimum wages, budget allocations, number of employees fired and other such details take away 99 percent of our attention  but there is not a lot of leverage in them .These numbers are important in the short term and to the individual who is standing directly in the flow.But changing them rarely changes the system.But critical parameters can be  leverage points.Like system goals are parameters that can make big differences. Mostly, the numbers are not  worth the sweat  put into them , like how much rent to charge or pay on a building .Most systems have evolved  or are designed to stay far out of range of critical parameters.Thought leaders across the globe  regard the systems- thinking skills  critical for  understanding and solving the problems of 21st- century life.<br />  Some system structures  produce common patterns of problematic behavior called archetypes.Such archetypal structures need to be changed.These archetypes are system traps.Theses can be escaped by suitable actions like reformulating the goals .Donella describes eight such traps and also the way out from each of them.<br />  The author seems to have a leftist political stance when she says:\\"The power of big industry calls for the power of big government to hold it in check;a global economy makes global regulators necessary.One of the weaknesses of the book  seems to be  that  some of the leverage points lean heavily towards justification of  pet liberal causes.<br />  The most important \\"systems wisdom\\" that I got from Donella is :\\"Defy the Disciplines\\".Learn from economists, chemists ,psychologists , theologians  , and so on .To see a systems whole , be more than \\"inter-disciplinary\\".Encourage the representatives from  different disciplines to be more committed to solving the problem  at hand than to being academically correct.They should be willing to be taught by each other and by the system.\\"It can be done.It's very exciting when it happens.\\"<br />  \\"One of my purposes is to make you interested (in systems thinking)\\", says Donella. As far as I am concerned , Donella has fully succeeded in achieving her purpose.You need to read this book , and I have a reason to believe that you will agree .h power is vested in  the Legislature and Courts respectively.Incentives, punishments and constraints are also rules , though these are progressively weaker rules.To change the system , we need to pay attention to the rules as well as to rule makers.We need to restructure the rules  and imagine what the behaviour of the system would be under the restructured rules.This can result in a fundamental change in the system .<br />6.Information flows:<br />Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction.Adding, restoring  information or delivering feedback to a place where it was not going before  , can be a powerful intervention.It is important that the missing feedback be restored to the right place and in compelling form.Missing feedback loops ensure accountability of decision makers.<br />7.Reinforcing feedback loops:<br />Reinforcing feedback loop is self-reinforcing.If allowed to go unchecked, a reinforcing loop drives system behavior in one direction and ultimately destroys itself if it runs its course.<br />Like soil will erode away to bedrock.Sooner or later , bed rock will crumble into new soil.This is a self-correcting balancing loop.An alternative is to have an intervention to reduce the self multiplying power of a reinforcing loop- slowing its growth.This  is a more powerful leverage point than strengthening  the balancing loops and far more preferable  than letting the reinforcing loop run, like people stop overgrazing, put up check dams, plant trees and stop the erosion .So reduce the gain around a reinforcing loop and slow the growth to change the system.<br />8.Balancing feedback loops:<br />Parts of system relating to information and control are the parts where more leverage can be found.For example, markets are the balancing feedback systems.Price is the central piece of information .To keep it accurate as per feedback power of market signals, you need anti-trust laws, truth in advertising law,the removal of perverse subsidies and other ways of levelling market playing field.This will ensure free, full unbiased flow of information.To improve a system's self- correcting abilities, we need to strengthen balancing feedback controls.For example , we need to provide protection for whistle blowers, we need to impose impact fees, pollution taxes and performance bonds to recapture the externalised public costs of private benefits.<br />9.Delays:<br />Delay length is a high leverage point, e.g. construction time of a major project.Also growth rates are high up on leverage points.Slowing down a growth rate  is a greater leverage point  than faster technological development.Changing delays or growth rates in the right direction  can change systems in a big way.<br />10.Physical Structures:<br />Physical structure is responsible for many distortions in the system .For example , road system is responsible for  air pollution and community delays .Rebuilding of physical structures  is slowest and most expensive kind of change in a system.So it is rarely a leverage point.But when it is , leverage point is in the design.<br />Another leverage is in understanding the  limitations and bottlenecks  of the physical structure , using it with maximum efficiency and refraining from  straining its capacity through fluctuations and expansions.<br />11.Buffers:<br />Stocks that are big relative to their flows are called Buffer.Buffers have stabilizing power.There is leverage , sometimes magical , in changing the size of buffers.But buffers are usually physical entities.(like storage capacity of a dam) and are not easy to change.Buffers are not very high on the list of leverage points.<br />12.Numbers , parameters and details:<br />Numbers , the size of flows, annual deficits,minimum wages, budget allocations, number of employees fired and other such details take away 99 percent of our attention  but there is not a lot of leverage in them .These numbers are important in the short term and to the individual whois standing directly in the flow.But changing them rarely changes the system.But critical parameters can be  leverage points.Like system goals are parameters that can make big differences.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />I wish there were negative stars available on Amazon. This book would rate at least a negative 3. I am very scared about our society of women that some ladies are going gaga over a mentally and physically abusive nutcase like Christian Grey! Many unfortunate REAL women go to shelters to get away from controlling men like this character. The only saving grace is that this character is fictional.<br /><br />I see the parallels to Twilight, but the story doesn't really hold up switching out vampirism for BDSM. Edward was at least protecting Bella from a very real threat to her life, and therefore some of his more domineering ways could be excused or at least understood. In Grey, there is no one trying to hurt Ana but Grey himself. He is the evil bloodsucker trying to destroy her life. Edward at least had good intentions trying to keep Bella away from other bloodsuckers who would literally kill her once he got over his own desires in that direction (very quickly I might add). There is a totally different dynamic going on here between the characters. So while there are similarities in the characters, the intentions are completely different and therefore cannot be compared side by side. Twilight had its moments of frustration, but at least Edward had some redeemable qualities and was less likely to become a serial killer (believe it or not) than this Grey headcase.<br /><br />I am just flabbergasted by the popularity of this book and all the swooning over this Christian Grey character. He is repulsive! Do so many women really dream about being doormats for a psycho to wipe his boots on? It gives me the willies.<br /><br />And Ana, wow. This girl is pathetic. So pathetic. She has no backbone whatsoever. This author wants me to believe that after the first couple sexual interludes these characters have, this moron is still flushing and staring at her feet all the time? I wanted to reach through the book and smack her silly.<br /><br />I don't knowwhat else to stay. This book was a huge dud for me. I feel like I wasted my time reading it, and now I am so disgusted with what I read I have to vent about it to get it out of my system. I actually think this is the worst book I have ever read for so many reasons. And that is saying a lot because I read all the time. I will read just about anything and I am not used to completely loathing a book like this. I read the sleeping beauty books by Anne Rice a few years back. They were pretty crappy books, which I have found most erotic fiction to be because the plot suffers and gets drowned under all the raunchy sex, but I can say in all honesty that the Anne Rice erotica was about 400 times better than Grey. Ewww, just e[...]

B0086700CM|4.0|my son has been playing for some time on his phone. It's nice to have it on the Kindle since I need more room.
B00884GR0W|5.0|If you are looking for an open ended rpg that includes building things, hunting, fishing, trading and exploring, then you MUST get this game! The visuals are stunning, especially the night sky. A zillion things to mine. Your character can remain the same including inventory as you travel from world to world, or you can start from scratch and make a new character. Creatures great and small, Oceans filled with sea life including mammals. Farm animals too. Birds and insects. At first the learning curve is about medium,  but just stick with this game and the rewards are great! Did I mention the live vendors who you trade with and receive quests from? There are a lot of those too. The worlds you create are ALIVE and there is no end to things to do. Replay value is therefore endless! The developers are very dedicated to fixing bugs, updating and getting to know the players in general..This game is a \\"gotta have\\" for the android. Runs great on my Kindle fire. You get true to life weather affects like rain and natural disasters like quakes also. Best $5.00 you can spend on a rpg for your android Device!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a settle in and really enjoy the story kind of book. It moves at its own pace, and at 849 pages (Kindle version), you might as well hunker down and get comfortable. Some kind of tear in the space/time continuum allows Jake Epping the opportunity to go back to the 1960's and affect the past. There are caveats - such as - once you've come back to present and then return again to the past - all is reset so then if you've made a change, you have to go back and re-do it all again. It's a delight to read about all the 60's slang and near naivete. King puts together an astounding timeline that all jibes. Nicely done and well worth the read!

B00006CXSS|5.0|Follow easy company from training all the way through WWII.  Ten 1 hour episodes with lots of action and fighting but also shows some different perspectives of the War.  I watched all the episodes more than once and I have found them to be just as entertaining if not more so the second time around.  If you find you enjoy these, check out The Pacific...another 6 disc set of the fierce fighting our marines had to endure with Japan in WWII.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|The Absence is wonderful ! Anyone who likes Melody Gardot should enjoy the cd . All tracks are in perfect harmony . I Love the sounds , lyrics and the voice . You can hear mixture of instruments . I'm very happy with it . Melody left her mark in each track . She's so unique and gives such beauty in what she does ! She's my greatest artist at the moment .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is a lot of fun and easy to use<br />. I would recommend this game to everyone.
0312641893|5.0|There are so many things I would like to say about this book! I just finished reading it and I feel like I must tell the whole world how amazing it is! The characters develop nicely, particularly the protagonist, Cinder as well as Prince Kai. Cinder is brave, modest, and selfless; she excels at what she does, but there is more to her. Although initially everyone around her seems to underestimate her, she is meant for greater things, for a better world and a solution to the conflicts of the Commonwealth. She is a badass Cinderella, if you think about it, and she has admirable strength and wit.<br />Prince Kai needs a little bit of more development, but he is kind and gentle, always with good intentions and strong will. Ultimately, he is a good character that you look forward to reading about.<br />The setting is spectacular and the creation of such a world is admirable! I love the idea of the cyborgs and the Lunars, as well as the situation the world seems to be facing, the harsh reality of Distopia.<br />I cannot wait for the sequel, as it leaves you hanging wonderfully! I recommend it to all those who like books that have to do with a little bit of action, romance, a strong female role, and a distopian society. Also, if you like Cinderella but thought it was too 'sweet', this will definitely give it a slight 'bitter sweet' sensation and inspire the strength of the story's starring Cinder.
B0086700CM|5.0|iv haf the app since may but i goy my kindle fire in December and as soon as i learned hkw to use this ivsearched for temple run and it was not there. :( Buy i in may i tried again and it was there.:) i love this game it is amazing get it.<br /><br />there is a bad thing if u get this app and u have lots of coin to buy every thing then h have every thing so it gets boring. but i have this on my phone.<br /><br />GET IT!

B004QK5N5W|5.0|Product was used as described and in good condition. I ran it from my ipad2 to a hdmi cable to my tv. Now I can watch Netflix and utube.
1936608898|5.0|The Hartwigs leave no stone unturned!  Every aspect of the why and the how is covered in perfect amount of detail to give you a thorough understanding of The Whole 30 and paleo nutrition without burying the less geeky amongst us in biochemistry and physiology.  There is nobody, new to this lifestyle or not, who does not need this book.  A bit of advice - buy two copies so you don't have to be torn between wanting your friends to read it and wanting to keep it close at hand.

B0083GPDBO|2.0|I did not like this movie because of the camera and it did seem like the Blair Witch Project movie. Also if there is anything that this movie showed me then it is that don't give an emo kid super powers. Nuff said.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|Well it looked real fun but my children will never know. Not only was it torn but it was torn right next to the plug where it drains. Due to that proximity I did not see it upon inspection and I could not patch it successfully. I contacted intex but thier return program is lenghty and retarded. I now have to return to amazon where my only option is a refund because it is out of stock. Oh well that is why I purchase from Amazon.

B004V2AWKG|4.0|The Giver is a pastiche of other books and stories,  highly derivative in most ways but overall a worthy contribution to the dystopian genre.  It's a good starter book on the subject.  It is instructive, as all dystopian books are, to warn the reader of the results of a totalitarian mindset, of the end result of Plato's Republic.<br /><br />Totalitarianism can take several forms -- today it exists chiefly in communism (e.g., Cuba), cult of personality (e.g., North Korea) and religious fanaticism (e.g., Iran; Saudi Arabia) -- but the basis is always the insatiable impulse of need to control others.*<br /><br />Books from which The Giver freely borrows its plot and theme are:<br /><br />Brave New World - manipulation of the very young to determine life course; use of drugs to control behavior<br /><br />We - the existence and structure of the totalitarian community<br /><br />1984 - monitoring and control of the community; systemic and systematic lies to maintain control<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye - perception by the adolescent that adult life is filled with phoniness and lies<br /><br />The Lottery - near-random determination by the community of who should live and who should die<br /><br />The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas - the rejection of unjust suffering<br /><br />Anthem - flight by those who reject totalitarianism<br /><br />Jonathan Livingston Seagull  - perception of being different, and rejection of the group<br /><br />*  Due to the constitutional structure and culture of liberty of the United States, the most that the totalitarian impulse has done so far is impose punitive taxes and heavy-handed regulations, and demonize non-conformity (i.e., political correctness).

B0079R8KXG|4.0|This cover looks really nice and is very light.  The hand strap on the back has kept my toddler from stealing it from me a few times now.  I just feel a little silly when I can't figure out which way to turn it to make it stand up.
0307387178|1.0|For all you crazy people out there read this.<br /><br />Into the Wild is a great book for you if you've ever thought about giving up all of your money and abandoning all of your good family and becoming a homeless hitchhiker.  If you did John Krakauer might be able to convince you that you're normal. But for the rest of us, this book is a big waste of three hours.<br />In this book Alex Supertramp (really Chris McCandless) gives away $24,000, all the money he had saved to pay for law school, and traveled into the dessert to find fulfillment and to challenge his inner self.  As wise man once said \\"it's not a challenge if there's no chance of failing.\\"  You and I would find that insane, but one journalist, John Krakauer,  doesn't.  He makes it his life mission to find out what makes Alex Supertramp tick.  And his conclusion; Alex wanted to find fulfillment and prove that he was really great. He wanted to do something that no other man could, and prove that he was a better man than his father.  He tries by attempting to take care of himself in the wilderness of Alaska with almost no gear.  He almost dies on many occasions.  On his journeys he meets many people and inspires them.  He might even inspire you.  I learned how far you can push yourself to do the right thing. I learned that it really is possible to get along without pleasures and to live a serious life.  I wouldn't say that Alex Supertramp's behavior was rational but, Jon Krauker thinks differently.  So much so, that instead of writing a  very inspiring ten page article in a magazine, he spent another one hundred and ninety pages trying to convince us, in a very meticulous and boring fashion, that we, all of his readers, should go \\"into the wild\\" and have our own little adventures.  He tells stories of many \\"smart\\" people who went \\"into the wild\\" but, there is one common denominator between them all.  All of those \\"smart\\" people, except of course for Jon, died \\"in the wild.\\"  He is still as crazy as ever, spending his whole life trying to justify himself.  As my mother once said \\"Irving, it's stupid to gamble and even stupider to gamble with your life. Now get back in your room and clean up this mess.\\"<br />I'm very sorry for ruining this book for all of those crazy lunatics who might actually want to read this book, so think of it as if I've done you all a favor. \\"Just another public service done for you by your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.\\"
B0084IG7KC|2.0|It's not a new thing for western artists to steal from eastern movies/books and pawn them off as their own, knowing that the larger audience will never know. HUNGER GAMES has just TOO MANY elements from the 2000 Japanese film(and book) BATTLE ROYALE. While HUNGER GAMES entertains and has been very popular, I just wish the larger public could see what I believe is the source material.BATTLE ROYALE is a classic- a metaphor for the cut throat, hyper-competitive state of Japanese education, and the state of today's youth casting off and rebelling against traditional Japanese culture. Make BATTLE ROYALE and HUNGER GAMES a double feature. Should make for great conversation after!

B003N0XDT4|5.0|I got the box in the mail,, I was so drunk,i didnt want to wreck it before i could listen to it,  so my wife plugged it Into the PC,and set it to charge.<br />  I begin to listen to some audio or audi/video and I was pleased. My reason to buy is simple, i couldnt hear either the laptop speakers,nor very well through the headphone jack and thought \\"there must be a way\\". There was. this simple device. i cant say from an audio experts standpoint the sound is great or junk,i can say 'sounds good nuf for me\\".<br />  it fixes all the issues i had,and if it sounds better as an extra?  cooool!<br /><br />I do own decent audio gear,, but mosstly for home theater/TV i never replaced my records and tapes after they were helped to find a new home. since headphones dont sound anything like mid-larger sized loudspeakers (or any others :)  ), who could compare? so ill leave all the techno talk to the \\"pros\\" and repeat,it does what i needed done,and it may improve the sound overall.<br /><br />great idea if you ask me,<br /><br />~R~
B0088TG252|4.0|An exciting \\"who done It\\" mystery with a lot of lead flying everywhere and bodies piling up.  But, the story is the standard plot of corruption in an USA secret government department.  Bad persons, employees of the US government, are trying to kill the heroes with a lot of collateral damage.  In this movie it is the CIA government spy agency which results in innocent good hearted employee being used and almost murdered by corrupt CIA persons trying to keep secret bad things that the New York Times and Hollywood types think is bad and \\"no-nos.\\"  What comes to the peoples rescue but the press.  What would we do without all the leaks the New York Times prints?  The USA and allies secret and spy organizations try to catch and find someone like the master mind behind the mass murder of Americans.  Are we not fortunate to have these leaks to the press even though it makes it more difficult for American secret government organizations to keep Americans safe?  An example harm done to those who help the US government keep Americans safe but are exposed by the Press is the Afghanistan doctor who helped the USA track down this mass murder, bin Ladden.  This doctor is now in an Afghanistan prison for 30 years.  This plot line of corrupt secret American government is so typical for American made movies.  The hero is working for the supposedly \\"good guys\\" secret government department meant to keep us safe from mass murderers who want to kill us in the name of Allah.  But, then suddenly we learn there is a corrupt element in the \\"good guys\\" secret department who is murdering others in order to keep secret their bad deeds.  Why do the typical American made in Hollywood movies have this plot line?  About half way through the movie I figured out that was the basic plot line.  I could have saved the rental fee.
1576875776|2.0|The book contains beautiful images, except on 14 or so of its pages that are blank. I returned the first one I purchased, thinking it was defective. I ordered a replacement and it had blank pages too. Turns out, it was done on purpose by the editor - maybe there was a note about the empty pages in the foreword. I was too disappointed to look for that after seeing all the randomly missing pages.

The first recipe I used was for pie crust, and it was excellent!  This is the second cookbook I have purchased used thru Amazon and I am very happy with both of them.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|I've been a Soundgarden and Audioslave fan for many years.  But, for whatever reason, I'd never gotten around to purchasing any of Chris Cornell's solo music.  Not really sure why, just never did.<br /><br />Well, the other day, while flipping through the options on XM, I stumbled upon Cornell's live acoustic version of \\"Like a Stone\\".  I was floored.  It literally stopped me in my tracks and gave me chills.  (It's been a LONG time since that has happened... maybe Jeff Buckley, back when \\"Grace\\" was released....?)<br /><br />Needless to say, I immediately purchased the \\"Songbook\\" CD, and I have to tell you:  EVERY single song on it is amazing.  He covers Led Zeppelin's \\"Thank You\\" with such emotion; really intensely beautiful.  And \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\"... a simple little melody... but, as with all his music, his haunting voice gives it such depth.<br /><br />I always loved his voice when he was with Soundgarden and Audioslave... but on this CD, his profound talent goes to a WHOLE new level.  His voice is powerful, gentle and soulful, all at the same time.  I just can't get ENOUGH of his music, and find myself wishing \\"Songbook\\" was a double CD.<br /><br />I'm hoping a live concert DVD will be released next.<br />AND I'm ALSO hoping he'll come back to play Atlanta again soon.<br />I'll be there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|good book read the trilogy was written well.  The purchase price was a little high but was worth the read.

You can download this copy onto to your computer, but then it will NOT be accessible in the cloud. You will not be able to view this on your iPhone or iPad. Because Rio is no longer carried on iTunes it is not available on the cloud.
B006ISJQ1W|4.0|I didn't watch this sooner because of all the negative reviews and I should know better than to listen to people.  Johnny Depp is excellent as always (he doesn't just play a Disney pirate).  Hunter S. Thompson was a real man with real problems and  drugs and alcohol play a major role in our society whether we want to act like they exist or not.  There are massive amounts of greed and corruption happening all around us (we like to call it \\"free market\\"), but people are asleep and they don't want to wake up (just like the movie says).  There is so much suffering in the world because of this.  One reviewer said \\"no action, no mystery, no nothing\\" which is funny because I picture the ignorant tourists from the movie.  It's so unfortunate.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think its a great app if you like music videos or lyrics. it has everything that you would find on normal youtube. I would recommend this to everyone. easy to use too!
B0013V2UU8|5.0|These tiles are no longer available from LEGO and we were very happy to find them at Amazon for our grandsons.  They are a great addition to their sets and enable them to complete their structures.  The only unfortunate thing about this order is the poor condition that the shipping box arrived in.  Fortunately there were no broken pieces.  That would have been a heart breaking incident for our grandsons.  Items were very fairly priced for out of production items.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't get me wrong...I really enjoy good erotica stories, but in order to actually get invested I still require a plot, character development and oh yes...WRITING SKILLS. It seems to me that the \\"writer\\" created this little 5 or 6 page repeat formula..4 pages of sex and insert different location and facial expression. I'm completely horrified how anyone can look at this series as good writing...<br />It is a complete shame because this could have been an interesting story if it was written by someone competent.<br /><br />If steamy sex is what you are looking for,I say seek elsewhere...you can find so much better than that.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|There is a certain subset of Rush fans who fancy themselves armchair producers with perfect pitch who know how to properly engineer a real album.  Is it because they think that being a fan of such an accomplished group of virtuosos they have a special understanding of music?  Is it because they get all Peter Klaven on the weekend?  These people need to crawl back into their basement conversions and keep pretending they're special while they mix their tired municipal club band's latest demo on garage band...I've always found it incredibly presumptuous when people think they could make a better guess than the band about producers, engineering, etc.  There was a time when a band went into the studio and you probably didn't even know it and you heard a new album was on its way a month before and that's it.  No internet speculation.  You just bought the record and listened.  That's what you need to do with Clockwork Angels.  If you take that advice then don't bother reading any further.<br /><br />That said, this is a wonderful album.  I've listened to it in mp3, wav, and FLAC in various settings (computer's 2.1 system, ear buds, studio monitors, closed ear headphones, and the car.)  It all sounds good.  Why?  The songs kick ass and are among the best of their career.  There's some awesome urgency and intensity in the tunes.  In previous albums (most from the late 80s/90s) the band would just hold back and let a safer, poppier arrangement rule. But with Clockwork Angels, they go for it in a rip-roaring fashion.  Some of the melodies are really catchy and the chorus from the title track is a real ear worm. The range of the album is impressive (grungy on BU2B, ethereal on The Garden, shades of By-Tor/Bastille on Headlong Flight...)  Everything fits together well.  I like that this album doesn't sound like Snakes & Arrows or Moving Pictures or Hemispheres.  Rush proves itself by progressing.  Progressive music doesn't mean noodling in weird tunings and times, it means moving beyond your last work and creating something new.<br /><br />Considering how long the band has been together, with only one personnel change (Rutsey RIP) at their very beginning, it's truly awesome that they can still put it together. Sure, there have been some ups and downs over the years and every fan has their best and worst songs list and I doubt we all agree.  IMHO this record stands out among their best.  I think the best \\"review\\" if heard is the interview Billy Corgan did with Geddy and Alex.<br /><br />To qualify myself: I love Rush from Fly by Night through Power Windows (including Caress of Steel!), they lost me after that but got me back with Vapour Trails to now (with a few cuts off of Counterparts and Test for Echo.)  There are three records I chose to ignore and will try to never listen to again and the first album is well, the first album.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was eager to read this book, as EVERYONE was talking about how fantastic it was.<br />Excitedly, I purchased the book for my kindle, curled up with a glass of wine....and started to read the worst piece of writing I have ever read! SO disappointing....I willed myself to read each word that seemed like it was written by a fourth grader, who had a little help from her grandma Barbara Cartland. The \\"oh my's\\" that punctuate almost every third sentence, to the cliches...\\"she put the pedal to the metal\\" are so ridiculous that I ended up skimming most of the book. Even the sex was not erotic...just makes me wonder what all these women who love this book so much do in the bedroom. I am glad that I did not purchase the Trilogy... E.L. James must be brilliant at finding the right publisher to print her book, she is not a great writer, just a great marketer.

B005P4PAZG|5.0|I'm a huge Star Trek fan, bit of computer geek, son is a WOW player....  This show fit right in with our family.  Its our new favorite.  I love the nerdy characters.  I ordered this episode to find out what happened after watching Season's 1-4 which I ordered as a set thru Amazon.  I can't wait till Season 5 is released in Sept.  I'll def. purchase the set.  Great show based on characters.  Extremely funny.  Even my kids 9, 12, 15 love it.  Some of the dialogue goes over their heads (thankfully) but they get enough of it to laugh out loud with the parents!
2839905809|5.0|A brilliant book leaving you with the framework, the process and inspiration for succesful Business Models. The book is the bible for practitioners of Business Model Innovation - after reading this book all you need is practice, practice, practice. Academics might find the format provoking and, I am happy to say, without excess name dropping, referrals and endless text - filling pages but leading nowhere. Well Done Alexander and Hub members.

B006JTS5OO|5.0|This movie was a fantastic comeback for the Muppets.  The producers and writers remained true to the original humor and tone of the Muppets and didn't try to make it crude or hip for today's times.  They even wove the tale of the Muppet's comeback into the story.  The Muppet humor, celebrity cameos and music were all terrific and made this a thoroughly enjoyable film, even if you didn't grow up with the Muppets
0596009208|5.0|It stays away from the usual formulas of other programming books, which mostly end up in you copying down code without much explanation. Instead, this book doesn't even ask you to write code. I mean, you are free to, and I do, but instead the book drills in your mind what everything means and how to use it. It uses great analogies, exercises, and examples to get you started messing around with it yourself.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone over any book and it has made learning Java a blast. Stay away from other books and buy this asap. I have learned more within the first 80 pages then I have within hundreds of pages in other books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book basically has no plot.  There's just alot of meaningless and poorly written fluff between sex scenes.  I tried to read the first book but had to stop due to the really annoying repetitive phases and the main characters CONSTANT and annoying referrals to her \\"inner goddess\\".  The author truly must have a very poor vocabularly as she continuously uses the same phases throughout the book.  I am kind of offended that this author is obviously making so much money off of one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.
1416596585|4.0|I just finished listening to \\"In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives\\". I liked it. While it may not be as good as Steve Jobs' biography or Steven Levy's other book, \\"Hackers\\", I still really enjoyed it. It really helped me put my experiences at Google into context. It's amazing how little Google has changed, how much it continues to work on, and how much Steven Levy was allowed to get an inside look at Google.

B00130VLZ4|2.0|Camera cases used to be made of stiff vinyl and fit tightly around the camera like a clam-shell. They fit very well, and they were easy to open and close. A screw held the case to the bottom of the camera. Snaps were used to keep the case closed..<br /><br />This case is basically a floppy nylon bag that encloses the camera. It is not physically attached to the camera at all. instead there is a hole in the case through which the camera's strap is threaded. When you undo the case and start shooting you now have this huge  extra floppy vinyl bag hanging in front of the camera. It is completely in your face while you are trying to concentrate taking pictures. It just gets in the way.<br /><br />When you are finished you must really concentrate to get the case fastened back around the camera just so or its huge velcro tabs won't close. The clumsiness of this system is made worse because it is so easy to get the camera in upside down or sideways such that it \\"looks\\" like it should fit but it doesn't.<br /><br />So, if you are expecting a camera case such as those sold for SLRs years ago--that really fit well and never got in your way--you will be disappointed. Honestly about all this case is good for is protecting your camera while it is in a backpack or suitcase. If you are actually serious about taking pictures you will want to leave it behind because it gets in the way and slows things down more than it helps. That sort of defeats the purpose doesn't it?

B00000K3D4|4.0|Once upon a time, there was a decade called the 1980s.  In that decade, a number of fantasy movies were released.  They were stylish and thrilling, with good humor and likable characters, and they delivered moods well.  The downside was that no matter how hard they tried, they could never seem to tell a story all the way through.  Time after time, they either launched too quickly into the main plot without giving the characters any chance to shine on their own, or resolved the main problem too quickly, or in a confusing or unsatisfying way.  Sometimes, the main villain would end the film with a speech that made no sense, and half the time, the entire premise of the film seemed to make very little sense until one spent about an hour pondering over it, and then, one had to wonder just why the director couldn't have been a little clearer about just what was really going on.<br /><br />Seriously, though.  Labrynth is clearly one such movie.  It's as much a metaphor as it is a story, and the characters and situations can get very confusing if you don't view them in that way.<br /><br />I kid 80s movies, though.  Some actually did take the time to explain why they ended the way they did, but not many (the Princess Bride and the Neverending Story being perhaps the best examples.)  Labrynth, in some ways, is midway between those films and the likes of \\"Legend,\\" one of the most head-scratching films I've ever seen in my life (though I do remember enjoying it somewhat.)<br /><br />Sarah is something that was very rare in the 80s; a girl who's utterly obsessed with other-world fantasy stories.  She even cosplays as an adventurer in a secluded section of her neighborhood.  However, every week, her parents force her to baby-sit her baby brother, who repeatedly gets on her nerves.  Eventually, she wishes that the goblins would come and take him away.  They do.<br /><br />The goblins, led by a tall, dashing goblin king named Jareth, seize the child and carry him back to the castlein the center of the Labrynth, and it's up to Sarah to solve the puzzles of the Labrynth, get into the castle, and face off against the goblin king for the fate of her baby brother.  Along the way, she makes friends, meets strange creatures, learns life lessons, etc...  Her journey, in fact, is so bizarre and episodic that it could be compared with Alice in Wonderland.<br /><br />The morals in the film come in two types; \\"minor,\\" and \\"major.\\"  The difference is that some moral lessons (minor) only last one or two scenes, while others (major) can be inferred from the movie as a whole.<br /><br />The minor lessons, on average, are a mixed bag, ranging from things that are -truly- moral, like forgiveness and faithfulness, to issues of mere good manners, like asking permission.  However, none of them, at least, -encourage- immorality, so on the whole, I'd say I was impressed.<br /><br />With regard to the major lessons of the film, I think some mistakes have been made on the part of certain past reviewers.  Some reviewers seem to assume that the point of the film was supposed to be; Sarah needs to recognize that her fantasies aren't as important as the real people she knows.  I don't believe that at all.  If they'd wanted that to be the moral of the story, it easily could have been.  My view of the major moral of the movie is this.<br /><br />\\"We all have things we don't need, which we could easily give up for the sake of others, and which we should, because mere possessions aren't as important as people.  However, don't worry.  Just because you sacrifice to help people doesn't mean you need to give up your dreams.  In fact, you may find them being fulfilled more often if you focus on helping others.\\"<br /><br />I think you'll find that if this -is- the moral of the movie, it fulfills it quite well, and for me, as a Christian, I consider this a better moral than \\"grow up and don't want odd or supernatural things anymore.\\"  We're -supposed- to want things to be different than they are in this life.  That's half of the point.  There's also something hauntingly-relevant about a movie where the main character is a female protagonist who initially doesn't want a baby, but eventually realizes what a mistake it is to get rid of him.<br /><br />Jareth is a charming villain, Sarah is a likable protagonist, and the other characters never really get annoying.  The sets, paintings, special effects and so on all look pretty nice, and the musical numbers are delightful; especially \\"magic dance.\\"<br /><br />I think the one exception to this generally-good graphics and sound quality is the \\"fire dance\\" segment, where the green screen effects are pretty terrible, and the song is somewhat ruined by the fact that you can barely hear what they're singing.  Still, even that's somewhat enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />The film itself is -very- high-fantasy, and in genre, is a bit of a cross between horror and comedy.  There are points where the imagery is truly grotesque and terrifying, and yet, there's just enough levity to keep things from being too intense.  Younger viewers will probably still be scared, though, because there's plenty to scare them.  Even I got a few chills at some points in the film, because it tickles so many of those little, irrational horrors we all still have from when we were kids, like suddenly falling into a hole, normal things coming to life and talking, creepy faces uttering menacing warnings from inside walls, and doors not leading where they're supposed to.  All of these things creep us out a little, even though we know they don't really happen.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this film.  It's not specifically-Christian, but neither is it evil or determined to tear away at our moral fiber, like so many modern movies.  It was an overall fun movie about a journey through a dark fantasy world where things don't make sense, with some good laughs, good visuals, good scares and good times, and I can't really ask for more than that.
B0076NKNLA|4.0|This movie wasn't even really on my radar, and it sounds weird to say this but I liked it, it only sounds weird because it really is just such a sad movie, and I have seen docs about Monroe before so I knew that her life had been less than ideal. Michelle Williams was so great in this role as was Ken Brannagh. I know that they show this time of her being happy and loving the escape but then you see that never lasted long. Great story and great cast.
B0015DROBO|2.0|I did not know what to expect before buying this book at the airport. I had a very long flight (13 hours, that is to say) so I needed simply a page turner that would not require thinking very deeply about the problems of our universe and such. When I finally started reading, I instantly approved my decision to buy it since it really was a page turner; well, until the last 100 pages anyway. I don't really see the point in filling those last HUNDRED pages with ridiculously detailed and absolutely unnecessary information AFTER making the upcoming turn of events totally clear to see. The ending definitely did not live up to my expectations especially after reading a wonderfully constructed beginning. In short: I would not recommend this book unless you have been obsessed with reading thrillers all your life and this was the only one left, because if you haven't, I am certain there is a better one that won't waste your time.
B007SSDS24|1.0|characters had no purpose and a storyline didn't exist. I can buy a lot in a sci-fi/action film, I'm not like some and complain about how things in action films couldn't really happen, I just watch and try to enjoy, it's created to entertain. This movie just didn't do that.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|I have never been effected by any books the way I have been by this series. I lose sleep to reading them, ignore projects, friends, family members... thank god I don't own a goldfish 'cause that sucker'd be DEAD thanks to Brandon Sanderson's perfect world crafting abilities. I want my life back, you monster!<br /><br />Anyway, this book once again gets a bit bogged down with a seige situation, but the meta story(?) I guess you'd call it, the paragraphs in italics that start each chapter, are by far the best of the three books, unloading morsel after juicy morcel of the &#34;science&#34; and consequences of Sanderson's fantastic magic system.<br /><br />And a heck of a lot of questions get answered in this book, stuff that might have barely registered as weird to you all the way back in the first book. There has been an amazingly consistent plan the whole way through, unlike some fantasy series where the magic is conveniently all made up and the points don't matter.<br /><br />So the technical, logical, world-building technique is impeccable. Unrivaled. Astounding. Yep. But what about the characters, the emotions, the bones of all stories?<br /><br />Why, they're pretty spiffy too.<br />You care about these people, you laugh when they laugh, you cry when they cry, you get frustrated with them when you know more about the mechanics of their world than they do, thanks to the paralel story lines.<br /><br />Speaking of which, all the seperate storylines were great, you really hate when every single chapter ends. You want to know what happens next!<br /><br />So its a good book, you should read it.<br /><br />Now I'm off to read everything Brandon Sanderson has ever written.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|I thought Underworld Awakening had some loops in it.  The movie was a little unrealistic and it ended with questions of part 2.
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|this is a PREQUEL??? while I was no fan of the john carpenter original, it's unavoidable for me to say that making a film with that one's identical plot, face-absorbing scene, some re-used archtypes (I won't grace them or anyone else in this movie by calling them \\"characters\\"), husky (also eaten in a cell), and even title does not a prequel make. ironically, one of the few real differences is the monster. it has the same abilities as the one in the original but looks different. credibility in relation to the first film aside, the movie is formulaic, thinly scripted, and ultimately forgettable. the characters' personalities are barely established, not that they show any personality traits in the film anyway, save for one bit where eric christian olsen says he \\"never believed in that &#!@\\", referring to aliens, and the guy next to him colorfully says \\"I always believed in aliens!\\". I will say that the special effects are quite good and the performances fine, especially when the actors have such little to work with. this is because of the afforementioned flaws in the Things's lazy script, which is strictly sci-fi channel original-level. even the generic \\"will you go on this mission\\" scene happens immediately after the prologue, with seven minutes passed, and not a single conversation taken place. come to think of it, I don't recall a single conversation in The Thing. by-the-numbers it may be, there still are a few scary scenes to be had. the movie finally hits a stride about halfway through, and delivers the goods for a while before slowing down again with the uninspired, ridiculous final scenes. winstead falls down feet by the dozens (you can hear her screaming for a good 7 seconds)and gets up miraculously unharmed. when she is subsequently being pursued by the monster, she comes whithin easy reach of its writhing tentacles while hiding around the corner... still unharmed! (of course in any other movie, the monster would have reached around the corner where she wouldbe waiting at the end of the hall) I call this questionable star treatment for someone I only know about because of Final Destination 3. the real star here needs to be eric christian olsen, a talented and underrated actor who has starred (consistently) in worse films than this. dude needs ambition. or maybe just a new agent. all in all, the thing is a film that will probably please horror fans, especially ones of the john carpenter original. but for everyone else, well, let's just say the people who say things along the lines of \\"oh great, another horror flick\\" while watching the trailers in theaters are not wrong about this one
B006RUJST6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was fantastic. I loved the characters and the story. One of the best reads in a long time! I'm having a hard time choosing if I liked the 2nd one more, or the first one! Stop thinking and just buy the book!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love this game so much right now!  Having tried out the PC version, I was worried that my phone screen would be too small for it, but I'm almost finished with the second chapter with no problems.<br />I love that so many of the puzzles have randomized solutions, allowing for repeat play.

B002MHTHQ2|5.0|I personally think this is one of the best albums around. My love for big band music such as this as well as anything to do with Ray Charles makes this album such a treasure. I find it hard to believe that so few know about it or have heard the albums it contains. Apparently they're less popular or \\"not as good\\". Ray has tons of \\"all-star\\" musicians in his bands and it makes for a great listen. Solos and arrangements are swinging. Never gets old. I can listen over and over.

B007V5CF5K|4.0|So I got this app because I love hidden object games and it has so far been a very good game.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Just as hot and steamy as the other three. The book tied up everything nicely. I'm looking forward to seeing the trilogy on the big screen.
B007R9MFPU|4.0|OK, let's start by laying some groundwork. I am a huge Ultravox fan, Systems of Romance is still my favourite album of all time after more than 30 years (bought it in 1979). When Foxx left I remained a fan of both. The Midge Ure fronted Ultravox made some great songs but I found their albums very patchy. Still, they remain an enduring favourite.<br /><br />Brilliant is a lot better than I thought it would be. Songs like Lie and Satellite are as good as their best work, with all the classic Ultravox elements present and correct, which makes it mystifying that they should be hidden away near the end of the album. Mind you, the first three songs are also good, with Midge using a sort of whispery vocal on the title track to give it a different slant. The synth sounds are also a good mix of the familiar and more up to date sounds that make this a distinctly more modern Ultravox. You know instantly who it is but songs like Rise make it more than just a rehash of past glories. Overall, I think this is a better album than Lament, or anything that followed it, and is right up there with Rage in Eden and Vienna (Quartet is my favourite Ure-era album). With a harder edge it could have been as good as either but songs like Change and Remembering are pretty soft and the production is a little too slick for my taste. It helps to turn it up but the guitars are mixed way too far back.<br /><br />I've read a lot of negative reviews of this album but I find them all ridiculous because what they are criticising is what Ultravox do, what they have always done. Its almost as if they expected Ultravox to make a U2 or a Pet Shop Boys album. They haven't, what they have made is a very solid Ultravox album and I really don't know how they can be criticised for that. It is exactly what anyone should expect from them and if you liked any of their hit singles or albums from the first half of the 1980s, you are almost certain to enjoy this welcome return.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I really liked this novel and really looking froward to the second book. The characters really captured my attention and I couldn't put the book down as soon as I started reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|simply addictive. I cannot stop playing it. I reccomend that everyone download this game. must download. cant say enough awesome things about this game.
B0015AARJI|1.0|As other have said I bought this controller with the idea that it was an official Sony product. Unfortunately, what I received was a clear counterfeit/knock-off controller. Buttons are stiff and unresponsive. Analogue sticks don't register inputs properly. The D-pad's down button doesn't work the majority of the time. Even the sticker on the back is pasted on poorly. I wish I had of read the reviews more carefully.
B0053O89JM|5.0|First off I want to stress that as the title says, I am a huge fan of Hugh Laurie. I have seen him pop up in things for years and have always been entertained.<br />Likewise I have been a fan of House since the Pilot. I own the first seven seasons on DVD and watch them off and on even still.<br /><br />Having said that I did not enjoy the slow death of House which is what Season eight seemed to be.<br />The final shot of Season seven, on the beach (is that a spoiler?) was, to my mind a perfect ending to this show. it is in the way I see the character. How Dr. House would have exited.<br />From the beginning of Season eight I was personally not entertained much. there were sections here and there but overall the shows seemed more stand alone than any other season.<br /><br />I felt the writing was poorer, like the writers either were new and didnt understand the core of the characters or just had no direction.<br />None of the characters seemed to be themselves. The prison shows being the worst, but in general House being a caricature of House rather than the character I had grown to know. I seriously missed Olivia Wilde. Her character had become so three dimensional in the preceding seasons.<br /><br />However, one caveat to that is the character of Chase. His personal arc thru this season was surprisingly deep. He seemed to mature as a person. And it seriously only just struck me now as i type this.<br /><br />Of the others; Foreman, Taub, and Wilson seemed wooden, like furniture on the set. Parks and Adams seemed to be mostly as people to play off of rather than develop.
B0086700CM|3.0|great it finally came out however it keeps freezing up and it will make me slide instead of makeing me jump or turn. harris out.
B007DJUO8O|4.0|Many will go on about either how great or how terrible and disappointing this album is. Simply put, some will like it and some won't.<br /><br />I found it intriguing, with some parts making me really sit back and think about things (Ljudet Innan being a notable track for that). At other points, I wasn't completely enthralled (Drag Ropes for example, or parts of Lock Howl).<br /><br />Overall though, I'm glad that these two put out something unexpected and new. If anything, it leaves me wondering (in a good way) about what will come next.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Hard to wrap your brain around certain things.<br /><br />It was hard to wrap my brain around Signals. So soon after the dark, solid rock perfection of Moving Pictures, Signals was another world completely -- a synthetic place of otherworldly sounds, synthesizers dominating the tone after their comparatively understated, supporting role in earlier Rush work.<br /><br />It's hard to wrap my brain around the fact that I'm no longer the guy in ripped jeans and a pentagram-painted jean jacket, half-buzzed and walking through the gate at Madison Square Garden to see these guys in the late 80s and early 90s -- with no responsibility at all and even less of a clue what the hell I was supposed to do with my life.<br /><br />Hey if you know Rush, you may have heard this one before: plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose. This has *always* been the point. Whoever we are, whatever reason we're on this quest, the only constant is change -- good or bad. Don't like it? Too bad, the world already moved on in the time you just spent railing against it.<br /><br />For some this particular change for Rush is good; for others, not so much. This album speaks to me very deeply, and I'm surprised more Rush fans aren't acknowledging \\"The Garden\\" as the most deeply considered, flat-out beautiful song from Rush in a long time. Maybe since \\"Bravado\\". Not musically perfect -- Rush has always been just slightly left of musical perfection -- but with a melody so perfectly suited to the thoughts behind it, and thoughts so far above what we see from other popular musicians. Why are we all here? What are we here to do?<br /><br />Who else is asking these questions?<br /><br />Well, I'm a Dad now, and now I know what I'm here to do. What else can I do? Live by example. Make things better for my children. Tend that garden, keep it as safe and beautiful a place as I can, a place for my son to play, to learn, and live. So that he can one day do the same for his children.<br /><br />And if I could give him one thing .... okay, let's make it ten things ... high on that list would be a love of Rush. Because they have been nothing but a positive, thoughtful influence in a world full of negative ones -- in a genre *filled* with negative ones.<br /><br />All of us get lost in the darkness ... dreamers learn to steer by the stars.ve him one thing .... okay, let's make it ten things ... high on that list would be a love of Rush.

B00005JLCI|4.0|I saw this film as part of a project  of viewing as many film versions as possible of a single Shakespearean play before moving on to another.  Branagh offers us the complete play.  He also offers us his signature array of actors who range from matinee idols to mass media favorites to serious Shakespeareans.<br /><br />More importantly, he offers us a masculine Polonius, portrayed by Richard Briers, the veteran actor who can be considered part of the Branagh repertory company who is best known to Americans for his television roles in The Good Life and Monarch of the Glen.  Usually portrayed as an old man in the first stages of senility, here Polonius is masculine, sexist, manipulative and political.  It is no wonder his daughter lost her mind.<br /><br />Kate Winslet plays Ophelia as a strong, sexually aware woman.  This is not a girl who would lose her maidenly mind over the slight from a boyfriend.  However, after Branagh as Hamlet slams Winslet as Ophelia against a series of mirrors, it becomes apparent that all men are liars, all men are untrustworthy and that all men will use her for anything.  Unable to trust both her lover and her father, Ophelia loses her mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the play also offers us Branagh as his egotistical worse as Hamlet.  While there is nothing wrong with his performance, the marginally attractive actor bleached his hair and spent hours in the gym in preparation for both the sword fight and the death scene in which, dressed in a \\"wife beater,\\" he is carried by his men, his arm pits exposed and his physique displayed, he is borne to his grave.

B0004Z33EG|4.0|A victim of post traumatic stress, Viet Nam War veteran John Rambo snaps, and applies his formidable fighting skills against law enforcement, in First Blood (1982), a film that would prove to be influential in how American soldiers from this conflict were then portrayed in film.  First Blood takes a simple storyline, and develops it to utilize Stallone's unique physically abilities.  Directed by Ted Kotcheff (Law and Order SVU), the film is stylishly violent, but also has some underlying messages.  The blockbuster sequel, Rambo: First Blood Part 2 (1985), further altered the perception of the Viet Nam vet from a shell-shocked dysfunctional individual in a failed war, to a mythical and heroic battle hardened fighting machine.  Among others, Chuck Norris' Missing in Action films were an offshoot of the Rambo phenomenon.<br /><br />Having already played a police detective in the crime thriller Nighthawks (1981), Sylvester Stallone continued to expand the range of his film roles.  Already an accomplished screenwriter for the Rocky films, Stallone's screenplay for First Blood is also tailored to feature his awesome physical skills.  Stallone is John Rambo, an ex-soldier, and Medal of Honor awardee, who comes to Washington state to look up an old army buddy, only to discover that he has died.  Passing through a small town, Rambo is hassled by Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy), and winds up in jail, where he has some flashbacks connected to his war experiences, and goes berserk.  After attacking some officers, and stealing a motorcycle, Rambo escapes into the woods, where he employs his combat skills to hold the police, and later the National Guard at bay.<br /><br />Matters intensify, as Rambo strikes back, and his former commanding officer Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) appears on the scene to provide advice to the authorities.  Events are a bit clich&eacute;d, as the story begins on pretty solid ground, and then gradually elevates to pure fantasy, as Rambo is trapped inside a mine, miraculously manages to find a way out, and then bent on revenge, makes his way back to town.  After all the mayhem, Rambo's rambling emotional breakdown in town's the police station, makes for an oddly anticlimactic finish, to what is otherwise a very engaging fast paced adventure, enlivened by Jerry Goldsmith's score.  Stallone excels in the physically challenging role, which like Rocky Balboa, would become one of several icons in his long career.  The trend toward fantasy and the remolding of history would become more pronounced in the sequel, [[ASIN:B0015XHP3G Rambo - First Blood Part II]], where John Rambo returns to Viet Nam to rescue prisoners of war.ped inside a mine, miraculously manages to find a way out, and then bent on revenge, makes his way back to town.

The book came in a timely fashion, something I appreciate.  Aside from that and after years of trying every diet plan under the sun, the Atkins plan seems to be working for me.  It makes more sense to me now than it did years ago, so I recommend reading this book to all those who continue struggling and trying to overcome the battle of the bulge!

James does a brilliant job dealing with it.  It could have been bizarre, it could have been perverted.  But with the beautiful damaged nature of Christian and the innocence of Anastasia, E. L. James has created amazing 3-dimensional people who rise right off the page.  I, for one, fell in love with Christian.  My only complaint?  The trilogy is over.  I hope E. L. has more coming.  This book is good for the soul.

0060555661|5.0|I went into reading this book knowing absolutely nothing about investing. I have never studied nor read anything about finance before so I felt I should read a book or two on it before trying my hand at investing. I was recommended this book by my cousin who manages a hedge fund so I figured this book must be the real deal. And it definitely is. The book starts out and provides good in-depth details about the fundamentals of investing before delving into more advanced stuff. It covers the majority of what amateur investors need to know about in pretty good detail. On top of that, it was also written after the Great Depression with the commentary written after the dot com financial disaster and while reading the similarities between those two situations and the financial crisis we are in now are very intriguing.<br /><br />What really made this book great in my opinion was the commentary. When the original author wrote it, investing (and writing) was clearly different then it is today, and that is reflected in the authors writing style and subject matter. The commentator does a particularly great job and taking the principals and expanding on them to make the applicable and useful in today's markets. While reading the book I checked on some of the predictions the commentator makes about some stocks and his predictions ended up invariably being true which is a testament to how well the method works when followed.<br /><br />In conclusion I would say that for any novice investors out there this is a great book to read to dive into investing.

B000L43AN4|5.0|I've seen the reviews here that say Tom's voice is \\"contrived\\"  And they are absolutely correct.  Contrived like a tightrope walker, or juggler.  When Tom was a one man act in piano bars, his voice was a lot different.  But, it didn't take long for him to realize there's only room enough for one Billy Joel.  Those who are inclined towards contemporary vocals shouldn't buy or listen to Tom.  Tom is an old time performer, the likes you'd see on the streets during the depression (the real one not the latest milk toast one).  He's an entertainer, not a singer.  He plays more instruments than I can count.  And he's written more music than anyone I can think of short of Paul McCartney.  I doubt there's a credible performer who hasn't covered a Tom Waits tune.  If you want mellow, canned sound, stick to Elton John. However if you want to be entertained in every way, then give Tom Waits the time of day and listen closely, you might hear yourself in his lyrics.
B000O63YWG|5.0|This book written in 1996 by Andrew S. Grove, founder and then CEO of Intel, addresses the issue of how to face and win the challenge of strategic change.<br /><br />Starting from a reworking of the \\"5 forces model\\" described by Michael E. Porter (competitors, customers, suppliers, potential entrants and substitute products), Grove describes how to approach \\"strategic inflection points\\", i.e. those moments when \\"something fundamental in the business world change\\".<br /><br />The author describes the history of Intel, the world leader in the microprocessor industry, from its origins in the mid '50s to mid '90s, retracing the steps and highlighting the critical strategic decisions that made <the company a winner.<br /><br />In particular, Grove identifies the causes of strategic inflection points describing real examples in different markets, explaining how to distinguish \\"signals\\" of change from \\"noise\\", the most common mistakes that winning companies should avoid in order to maintain their success.<br /><br />The author identifies two stages in the process of change, the first called \\"let the chaos reign\\" characterized by the overcome of paradigms and habits, the second \\"rein in chaos\\", characterized by active listening and the interaction of top and middle management, in order to develop and execute the most appropriate strategy.<br /><br />In conclusion, a well-written book on how to face and win the challenge of strategic change.

1469984202|5.0|I also stumbled upon the Wool-Omnibus by accident (I'm sure it showed up on my Amazon recommendations because I knit), but once inside the silo I couldn't leave; I didn't want to leave. The story grabbed me by both hands from the first chapter, and dragged me - gladly - through the levels. There was not a dull moment. The characters are well developed, the plot is three dimensional, and Howey is a talented story teller. Books 1-5 were all amazing, and I'm about half way through book 6 \\"First Shift,\\" which is shaping up to be another fantastic story.  I love Wool, and as an avid knitter I enjoyed how bits of the fiber arts were subtly woven into the omnibus. Nice play on words.

0307987647|5.0|I admit, I had never heard of GRRM until the television show \\"Game of Thrones\\" aired, and I fell in love. I don't read much lately because I'm a fairly busy and active person, but I have a 45 minute commute time that gets rather boring every day. So I decided to buy the audio books for this series to calm my nerves when interstate traffic struck, and I must say: I LOVE THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING EVER. The voice actor does an excellent job portraying so many different voices, and the story is much more in depth and in many ways different than the television show. I definitely recommend buying the entire audiobook series if you don't have time to read. I know it's kind of pricey, but the CDs contain about 40 hours worth of material. Compare that to a generic music CD's price of $15 with one hour of material, and this audio book would be $600. Not too shabby. Not too shabby at all.
B007MAETA8|4.0|[[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]],  Rock/Pop singer/songwriter John Mayer's sixth studio effort, follows-up 2009 somewhat under-the-radar [[ASIN:B002QEXN2K Battle Studies]].  Battle Studies, to its defense, followed the Grammy-winning juggernaut [[ASIN:B000H0MKGK Continuum]], arguably Mayer's `crowning achievement.'  Born and Raised has less pressure than Mayer's previous effort and ends being a stronger effort, comprised of solid songwriting with well crafted, thoughtful production. Born and Raised won't deliver many if any additional chart topping singles (\\"Shadow Days\\" dented the charts), but it marks a solid addition to the Mayer discography.<br /><br />\\"Queen of California\\" opens Born and Raised brilliantly, instantly unveiling the folk-rock sentiment of the album.  The vocal production is superb here, and the vocal harmonizations soulful and beautiful.  The songwriting is top-notch, matching the quality of Mayer's previous album openers easily.  \\"The Age of Worry\\" follows \\"Queen of California\\" capably, opening with acoustic guitar and breaking into a folk-rock driven sound that reminds one of Bruce Springsteen (think [[ASIN:B006ZCWTV0 Wrecking Ball]]).  Vocally Mayer sounds clear and polished and the ultra efficient length aids in making \\"The Age of Worry\\" another winner.  \\"Shadow Days,\\" the first single proceeds, featuring Greg Leisz on pedal steel (he also appeared on \\"Queen of California\\") aiding to the `roots' rock timbre.  The musicianship continues to allure even if \\"Shadow Days\\" does not captivate as much as the excellent opener.<br /><br />\\"Speak For Me\\" finds Mayer playing into an acoustic-based folk sound and delivering effortlessly.  The songwriting continues to impress and \\"Speak\\" is quite pleasant.  While it is path already tread by the singer/songwriter, the cut stands out amongst the rest of the album as one of the best. That said, \\"Something Like Olivia\\" is arguably the album's best cut, adding some `grit' and extra excitability to Born and Raised.  That isn't to underwrite the folk-rock rumination of earlier cuts including \\"Speak For Me,\\" but \\"Something Like Olivia\\" shakes up the formula adding an extra dimension of soul, courtesy of vocal harmonizations and use of organ.  \\"Something Like Olivia\\" sounds organic and bluesy, not unlike Mayer's critically acclaimed effort Continuum.<br /><br />Title track \\"Born and Raised\\" adds David Crosby and Graham Nash to the vocals, creating some stunning vocal harmonies with Mayer's lead.  The harmonic progression itself is solid and provides perfect underpinnings for the folk-rock cut.  The pace is relaxed which allows the title cut to breathe and impress.  \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\" is a bit long and lacks a bit of direction.  That said, the cut is pleasant and feels as natural as everything else.  \\"Love is a Verb\\" proceeds atoning with its two-and-a-half minute length. The sound is bluesy and lush, lyrics are simple yet `telling, and Mayer's vocals are clear and desirable.<br /><br />\\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\\" features jazz trumpeter Chris Botti.  Botti injects his smooth trumpet sound into the introduction, mixing with piano and rhythm guitar.  By the :40 mark, the groove solidifies.  \\"Walt Grace\\" features many positive facets including harmonized humming background vocals and solid songwriting.  The quibble might be that the cut is a bit `sleepy' despite being pleasant.  \\"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\\" has a slower pace with a country-folk feel.  Mayer's vocals are clear as a bell, though emotive enough to sell the cut.  Harmonica featured in tandem with rhythmic acoustic guitar and piano is a highlight.  The cut is a bit too static at times up until some punctuations by guitar around the 3:00 mark. \\"A Face To Call Home\\" features a more rock driven approach as the cut progresses, which contrasts the more folk aspects of Born & Raised.  Closing \\"Born and Raised (Reprise)\\" is a nice way to cap off a solid album.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007MAETA8 Born and Raised]] is a solid, well produced, and well written effort.  Born and Raised certainly has an elevated profile over Mayer's previous effort Battle Studies and even at times rivals the magic achieved by Mayer on Continuum.  Vocally, regardless of voice troubles, Mayer sounds top notch as if he never missed one beat.AETA8 Born and Raised]] is a solid, well produced, and well written effort.

B007PAAO0Y|4.0|Hearing that Gorillaz's Damon Albarn would be handling production duties on soul veteran Bobby Womack's comeback album was a bit shocking.  Not because Albarn isn't a talented producer or musician, but because the two seem to be in opposite worlds.  Despite the skepticism, the marriage between Womack and Albarn is actually a pretty strong one and manages to give Womack a different audience than he might experience had say Ahmir ?uestlove Thompson produced his album (?uestlove produced Al Green's [[ASIN:B0016A2FFG Lay It Down]]). For the most part, more often than not, [[ASIN:B007PAAO0Y The Bravest Man In The Universe]] is a strong and enjoyable effort.<br /><br />\\"The Bravest Man in the Universe\\" opens the effort with Womack singing in gruff, soulful voice supported only by cello.  Following the enigmatic intro, the cut transforms into a minimalist, electro hip-hop groove.  As the track progresses, instruments, layers, and pieces are continually added making the title-track a superb song.  Womack's voice is weathered from his peak, but his grittiness is laded with a mix of soul and gospel that would be desired by any singer.  Single \\"Please Forgive My Heart\\" was the first hint that Womack's comeback album would be experimental in nature.  Opening with drum programming and minimalist piano chords, the cut takes a evolutionary path much like the title track.  Womack's grit remains a selling point, particularly as he convincingly delivers the refrain: \\"Please forgive my heart/it's not that the problem/lies anywhere in there/I'm a liar, I'm in a dream/Going my own way/nothing to rely on...\\" Bravest gets off to a fast start.<br /><br />\\"Deep River,\\" an African-American spiritual follows.  While the cut could have derailed the momentum set by originals, Womack sells it fantastically, even quoting the oft-mispronunciation of \\"Jordan\\" (\\"Jurdan\\").  The acoustic guitar accompaniment is perfect, not to mention Womack's vocal nuances and vocal liberties. \\"Dayglo Reflection\\" is a truly special cut, featuring Lana Del Rey.  The cut opens with spoken words by Sam Cooke (\\"As the singer grows older, his conception goes a little deeper because he lives life and he understands what he is trying to say a little more...\\").  Acoustic piano and a soulful bass line buttresses the cut, followed by an unexpected, somewhat non-standard groove that accompanies Womack's soulful lead.  Del Rey's husky voice proves to be a solid match for Womack, another unexpected surprise.  Once Del Rey enters, she concludes the cut with Womack never reappearing.<br /><br />\\"Whatever Happened to the Times\\" opens with thudding drum programming and continuing to deliver with strong pacing.  Womack is not always perfectly in tune, but his raw nuances are grit are so magical the listener could care less.  Where Womack's voice may have been weathered ever so slightly with age (he's 68 after all), he makes up an impropriety with his soulful resolve and passion. \\"Stupid Introlude\\" proceeds, featuring the late, great Gil-Scott Heron foreshadowing \\"Stupid\\": \\"He came on television and told everyone he had seen God/So I stopped channel surfing immediately/he said that he had seen God and God told him to raise eight million dollars/God is broke...\\"  \\"Stupid\\" maintains the sentiment of Heron's passionate words with Womack opening singing: \\"Preacher is preaching, how you should live/instead of teaching with the love they give/they ask for money in the name of the Lord...\\" The laziness of the piano alongside Womack's gritty vocals only adds to the greatness of the cut.<br /><br />\\"If There Wasn't Something There\\" opens with strings before a dusty, soulful groove begins.  The vocals featured on the refrain have a `gospel' quality about them, once again finding Womack alluding to the church, even if it is more `understatement' than `overstatement.'  Interestingly, there is a change of sound/pace between the verses and refrain, helping to eliminate too much predictability.  \\"Love is GonnaLift You Up\\" is another solid cut, possessing an alt-gospel feel.  Again, `gospel' is referenced on the simplistic, yet effective refrain: \\"Love is Gonna Lift You Up...\\"<br /><br />Penultimate cut \\"Nothin' Can Save Ya\\" features Fatoumata Diawara filling the role of Womack's duet partner.  Less effective than \\"Dayglo Reflection,\\" \\"Nothin' Can Save Ya\\" is nonetheless strong and worthy of a couple of spins.  Closing cut \\"Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)\\" is a bit predictable only because of the tone that Braves Man in the Universe sets with its title and gospel references.  The singing has an overt gospel sound and the cut can be likened to an updated `tent revival meeting' sound.  Solid way to close this strong effort.<br /><br />Ultimately, Bobby Womack's comeback is nothing short of a triumph.  The question does lurk how will original Womack fans who were waiting for a more traditional soul album respond to something with such alternative rumination like [[ASIN:B007PAAO0Y The Bravest Man In The Universe]]? As an open-minded listener, this effort does something that most modern R&B fails to do. It is creative, blends the best of old and new, and manages to reinvent R&B in an alternative-minded fashioned. One of the year's best easily.Lift You Up\\" is another solid cut, possessing an alt-gospel feel.

B005SXTP9G|4.0|If you're reading this you already have esoteric tastes in music. Their musicianship has progressed on this album, especially guitar. The tracks are more rhythmic grooves than retro melodies, a different tack for the three. The intensity progresses nicely through the songs and really is \\"smoking\\"  at the end. This is the antithesis of computer generated music, which is what is so great about them. I can't wait to see what they do next.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|I downloaded the ESV Study Bible to my Kindle and have been so pleased.  It was quick & easy to download.  I highly recommend A+++++
B00863DOL0|1.0|It must be the first that I have written a review without actually viewing the product. However I have the advantage of being at the concert in York last year. The concert itself was excellent with the band playing for nearly 2 and a half hours and showcasing at least 20 songs..a good mix from all their studio releases. Great memories from a fantastic evening with Blackmore's Night.<br /><br />However...considering the above and their previous 2 live DVDs-Castles and Dreams and Paris Moon and the track listing and length of music on A Knight in York DVD, this new release is a disappointment. It has clearly been heavily edited and watered down to a mere 80mins or so of music ( at least half the concert!! ). At least 6 songs have been omitted and what we have are 14 songs, most of which ( 10 ) come from their last 2 studio cds..no variety whatsoever here. I know Blackmore's Night can do better and their fans at least deserve better and a better product...They have clearly slipped up here with this release in all formats. Castles and Dreams and Paris Moon DVDs are excellent, more so Castles and Dreams with the \\"whole concert\\" and an extra dvd of bonus material-Blackmore's Night obviously appreciated their fans back then. I clearly cannot recommend A Knight In York as it is a half heartedly produced product, why they even bothered filming the concert is anyone's guess...sad but true!<br /><br />Yeah it may look lovely on the screen or in magical blu-ray and the playing from the band top notch as always, but as a product and live document it is just not good enough I am afraid to say. Look after your fans and give them what they deserve not half a concert!!
B007ATNHLI|4.0|A little disappointed that blu-rays don't always come with dvd copies anymore. I got over it when I saw how much my ten year old daughter liked it .I wanted to watch 1&2 with her before seeing 3 in theater .Glad I did.
B000GYI32M|5.0|This show is so awesome. It's a great season with humor and heart and a very emotional last couple of episodes.
B008AG3PK8|5.0|The last two episodes, watched them back-to-back . . . just a world spinning out of control.  A feeling of chaos and disappointment in these people.  But it's a door, right?  A door into, oh my God, almost the '70s.  Those poor people!  I'm old enough to remember the tone of the late '60s, though I was under 7 years.  It doesn't really matter what the plot does, or if it's even realistic -- Pete and Beth in the hospital scene is about as far-out as it's gotten -- just as long as it gets the tone right, and it sure did get the tone right.<br /><br />Nobody seems to mention this, but the character who still has a \\"long way to go, baby\\" is Sally.  I'm very relieved that there is another season to come, because Sally is about to take center stage, and it's about time she did.  I thought I saw shades of \\"American Pastoral,\\" with the kid who blows up the local post office, but she's softening a bit.  This little actress, Kiernan Shipka, is going places if she masters the complexities of Sally.  I sort of envision a series finale where she buries her dad in about 1985 and tries to make sense of her life as an independent and insightful woman while finding out just who this man was.  (And as for that simple kid Glenn, he provided the one bright moment when he merely asked for what he wanted and, against all odds, got it.  I felt as if I were in that car with him, smiling inside.)<br /><br />If anyone misses the Don Draper Depression-era flashbacks, we have the return of Adam here. . . . We can only hope the flashbacks intensify, to tie up that loose end somehow.<br /><br />I confess to have fallen a little in love with Lane, poor guy.  He was so honestly in pain amid all the fakery, and even sexy in that moment where he kissed Joan.  He felt he had failed somehow to \\"be a man,\\" I suppose, but in truth he was a knight.  I'm going to miss him.  That picture of \\"Dolores\\" still in his wallet!  In his wife's ironic fantasy, he gets to be with Dolores.  At least there's that.<br/><br />Is Megan's cynical, so-very-French mother really played by Julia Ormond?  Did anyone else catch that?  Or Embeth Davidtz as such an excellent and lonely and completely subtext-less/literal Rebecca?  Give her an umbrella and call her Mary Poppins.  She hates advertising but is an empty shell with a brand name of \\"propriety\\" on it.  A brilliant performance.<br /><br />\\"Are you alone?\\"  The point here isn't whether Don will cheat again but that he is always alone anyway.  Aren't we all?  The whole point of this artful series is Alienation.  They're all going to end this thing ridiculously rich and successful . . . yet still alone.  Just another \\"broken hallelujah,\\" I suppose.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I received a bare-bones copy of the movie, a video rental copy with no extras at all. I was disappointed at this. However, the copy was flawless so from that point of view I was satisfied, I LOVE extras on a DVD, they are one of the main advantages over a VHS copy.
B000001A9P|4.0|Some excellent performances of a lot of great songs. The notes talk about the Tokyo Philharmonic but I'm guessing they were only used on the songs recorded in Osaka,Japan. 6 songs here don't use any orchestral players and I assume these were from the show recorded in Tel Aviv,Israel. It might have been interesting using the full orchestra on all the songs but as it is most of the songs here use either strings or horns. Only a few songs feature the full orchestra. The notes state that Village Ghetto Land does use the orchestra but oddly enough the orchestra sounds exactly like synthesizer strings on this song. A couple of songs do use synthesizer brass but most of the brass heard in this recording is real, presumably from the orchestra. Some people seem to really like the extended version of Ribbon In The Sky. Trying to jam on a ballad almost never works for me and it sounds like he's  rewriting the song. But most of the other songs stick very close to the originals with maybe a little extended jamming at the end. Overall this is a great recording of a unique artist. Now this is a helpful review.

I love that it's easy enough to play when you first pick it up, but it has some steps challenging enough to make you feel stupid. Worth the money.

B00422LESO|4.0|All of us have our favorite leading fictional man (or men as the case my be). They are often perfect in a variety of ways. They may be funny or sensitive or supportive, but they always make their leading ladies feel like the most beautiful woman in the world. Sometimes this fictional perfection is seen as preferable to real life relationships. And suddenly, real guys become unsatisfying and we become cynical. Such is the case for Jane, the main character of Shannon Hale's Austenland.    Ms. Hale has really done her homework in making the setting believably realistic. In essence, she has created a world where a Jane Austen three week LARP (Live Action Role Play, and thus I confirmed my geek status to the world ;) not only believable but also fun. Who wouldn't enjoy being wooed by a hot actor in Regency breeches? As a self-proclaimed Austenite, I can only get behind that. Plus, the actors are such a pleasure to read, especially as the wooing of Jane and Mr. Nobly progresses, that they become the highlight of this book.

B000PMLFRA|2.0|We all know that the first three films of the Star Wars legacy were nothing short of fantastic, so that is not why I have rated this collection a mere 2 stars.  This lackluster review is for the Blu-Ray \\"Original Trilogy\\" as well as any DVD's which only offer the \\"Special Release\\" of episodes IV -VI. Lucas again disappoints fans like me who won't settle for anything less than inclusion of the theatrical releases with the special editions.  Unfortunately, these \\"special editions\\" for the most part add little and sometimes even detract (i.e. the ending of the theatrical version of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" is so much better than the ending of the special release version).  If you don't care about the theatrical versions, then either of the existing blu-ray releases are fine.  The extras in the \\"Original Trilogy\\" are adequate, although for the die-hard fan, you'll want to get the release that has all six films along with 3 additional bonus discs.  As for me, I'm waiting, as I'm tired of buying first VHS, then DVD, then DVD with both versions (I hope you're getting my point).

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I debated and read a lot of reviews before I purchased this series for my Kindle.  I read one negatvie review that compared the books to Twilight. That bad review is actually what inspired me to purchase after all.  I am a fairly well read late 30's adult female and I adore the Twilight books.  There were several familiar themes in these books to the Twilight series...the male lead is self loathing, the female lead is a complete innocent in most ways, etc.  There is definitely repeptitive language and terminology that sounds more British than English, but if you don't let those things bother you and you like a steamy reading experience that won't leave you wanting to wash your brain afterwards, I would recommend this series.  Good dirty fun!

It's to give us gals a head's up on what guys are really thinking when they don't call- and it's spot on.  Don't call the date. Don't text him, don't email him...etc... and if he doesn't you- you get it..lot's of stars in it, Bradley Cooper as a jerk?? What?

014241493X|4.0|Finally, i got caught up with John Green's magic! You see, I had a hard time liking Looking for Alaska, i rated it 3 stars but somehow it was already a stretch for me. But Paper Towns changed my disgruntled attitude towards Mr. Green. It was entertaining (and heartfelt in the end) from start to finish. i like Quentin, but i worship Bloody Ben!<br /><br />I remembered what my high school was like while reading this book. I was fond on looking back and realized i wanted the same things Q/Margo/Ben/Radar/Lacey wanted: requited love, revenge, acceptance, normalcy, and friendship. The hilarious moments of Q and Margo while exacting revenge was such a high! But when Margo disappeared, fun exited and seriousness entered. But Ben and Radar took the boredom away, so it was still good.<br /><br />It was really awesome to experience Paper Towns. Solidly written and instantaneously funny, i know now what to expect from John Green when i read his novels soon.

0385737955|4.0|Days after reading The Maze Runner, i realized that there are a few things i didn't like. Stuff that i didn't notice while i was reading it. well, it was engrossing. and a quick read. i just couldn't stop reading. So yeah, I really liked The Maze Runner despite my nitpicking.<br /><br />I like Thomas, but i like Minho more. then i found Newt even more likeable than Minho. Eventually, Chuck stole the spotlight from all of them. overall, i had no problems with the characters. even if Thomas gets cranky lots of times. i mean, he does have a right to be cranky, right? living in the Glades without any idea of who you are. without a memory except your name.<br /><br />It was action packed and a page turner. Every chapter end made me want to continue to the next chapter immediately. It was a fun read!<br /><br />Now, for the not-so-good parts. The suspense was stretched too long. I felt what Thomas felt: frustrated to the core because no one will tell me something about what the Glades and the Maze were all about! Then, there are predictable moments, too. Also, I was expecting that the book will focus more on how to survive the Maze, but it was just averagely explored. I found Thomas' and Teresa's ability to be ludicrous. It gave a paranormal vibe to a dystopian setting that i normally don't like.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a gripping read. As long as you don't mind the roadblocks i've said here, then i'm sure you would enjoy it as much as i did. Don't think too much, and just let yourself be hooked.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|For parents who are expecting a child (whether their first or not), normally what would they fear at that stage?<br /><br />Me? When I was pregnant, my big worry is that my baby will be abnormal. deformed. I did not wish for a beautiful child, I only wish that he will be healthy when he's born. When I saw my son, not only is he perfectly healthy, but he is beautiful. whole. normal. so much more than the things i prayed for.<br /><br />Auggie's parents were not so lucky. But despite his facial deformity, Auggie is as normal as it gets. he's smart, witty, and hilarious. I love Auggie! His personality just leapt from the pages and tickled my fancy. I thought this is a depressing story. It's not. Just a lot of reflections from a boy who just want to be remembered (and loved) but not because of his horrible-looking face.<br /><br />I want to embrace his Dad! The most striking scene he has with Auggie is this. In two years, Auggie wore a helmet and never took it off. one day, the helmet has gone missing.<br /><br />Oh, Auggie, don't be mad. I'm sorry. I just couldn't stand see you wear that thing on your head anymore, you know? i didn't think it was good for you.<br /><br />Come on, Auggie, please try to understand, you were wearing that helmet all the time. and the real, real, real truth is: I missed seeing your face, Auggie. I know you don't always love it, but you have to understand... I love it. I love this face of yours, Auggie, completely and passionately. And it broke my heart that you were always covering it up.<br /><br />What a WONDERful father.<br /><br />You're gonna love all the characters here (well, except Julian, maybe). Wonder is heartwarming, heart-wrenching, heart-everything!<br /><br />People can be cruel to Auggie almost every time. But he found comfort, love and triumph in his family, and his new friends. He never expected the universe will be kind to him. but it did.

0062101897|5.0|This book is the quintessential Harry Potter coffee table book. It has a good binding, good quality pictures, the pages are of good quality, too, and the information packed inside gives detailed exposition on the adaptation of the books to film. It is a wonder!<br />The other Harry Potter book to film book by Brian Silby is of a more scrap book like style, and was filled with odd shaped pages and replicas and pictures of various props. This book still has a good amount of inserts, but is more dedicated to the relaying of information and a good deal of the book is writing about the certain aspects of the film process and the use of the books as the building block for the film franchise as a whole.

1936608898|5.0|Jennie at EasyPaleo.com:<br /><br />When I checked my mailbox on Friday evening, I found a package that contained Whole9`s new book, It Starts With Food. I have to admit that I shrieked [numerous times] in delight, and that I squealed to my husband [numerous times] over how excited I was to read it.<br /><br />I have a HUGE amount of respect for Dallas and Melissa Hartwig, and I am extremely indebted to them, as my own \\"Good Food\\" journey (and thus, this website) began with a Whole30 challenge almost one year ago... which was before I even knew what \\"Paleo\\" meant, by the way. When I heard that they were writing a book, I knew that it would be amazing. I actually pre-ordered my own copy as soon as it was available for pre-order. A few weeks later, I got an email from Melissa, asking if I would like a pre-view copy. Um... YES! How exciting!<br /><br />How did I know that the book would be amazing? Well, mainly because Dallas and Melissa do everything with excellence. They only make claims that are backed by extensive personal research, they stand firmly on their principles, and they don't take crap.<br /><br />I began reading that night (Friday), and I finished the book last night (Monday). I can sum up my thoughts in one bold statement... are you ready? Okay, here it is:<br /><br />This is, hands down, the best REAL FOOD book on the market today.<br /><br />Bold, right? I know. But I mean every word, and I'll tell you why below. But first, let me tell you that I have read almost all the Paleo books out there (cookbooks included), and I have enjoyed almost all of them. But It Starts With Food takes the gold medal for so many reasons!<br /><br />Top 15 Reasons I LOVE this Book:<br /><br />1. Dallas and Melissa left nothing out. Maybe you are like I was in the beginning, and you know that you feel better without dairy/grains/sugar/legumes/etc., but you aren't sure why you feel better. So you continue to avoid them, but you cannot explain your reasoning to those around you. If that is you, you must read this book. It covers all the \\"less healthy\\" foods, and provides plenty of reasons to stay away from them.<br /><br />2. They make everything easy to understand. There is a lot of \\"science-y stuff\\" that backs up the reasons we should eat this way... and I'm glad! This means that our food choices are not based on wild claims, government-sponsored programs, or personal agendas! But science is a tough subject for me, and I do not typically enjoy it. However, Dallas and Melissa did an outstanding job making sense of it all! I can confidently proclaim that I understood every sentence in the book, and that it all made perfect sense. They used a ton of useful analogies, included great illustrations, summarized the tough stuff at the end of each chapter, and described everything thoroughly. I cannot tell you how happy I was to have so many things suddenly \\"click\\" inside my head (\\"oh, so THAT'S how that works...\\"). I used 1.5 entire highlighters as I read.<br /><br />3. They answer your questions before you have to ask them. As I was reading, there were so many times I thought \\"Oh, someone is going to ask about _____.\\" And then, in the next sentence or paragraph, they'd say \\"Now, we know what you're thinking...,\\" and then address the issue. It's like they really do know what you're thinking! This is not just a basic \\"here are the basic facts\\" book. It delves deep into the issues, and covers all the related topics that you've been pondering for so long.<br /><br />4. They have not written it as \\"a Paleo book.\\" I absolutely LOVE that Dallas and Melissa have chosen not to brand themselves, or the book, with the \\"Paleo\\" name. They do mention that their ideas fall right in line with the Paleo diet, but they are not defined by it, and I appreciate that! So many people have suspicions that Paleo is just another fad diet (which is hilarious to me), and it is nice to have a book that is not standing on that platform as a base.<br /><br />5. They havenot written it as \\"Caveman Diet book.\\" This one is huge for me. I am a Creationist, so while I do believe that Paleo is the natural way that we should eat, I do not believe that it's because it is how our ancestors ate. I believe that God created the world, and that He put plants and animals on the earth for our food. I believe that the way human beings have altered and adjusted His good creation is shameful, and that God knew what was best for us when He created humans and placed them in the midst of plants and animals. I realize that this is a very different stance than most \\"Paleo people\\" take (including Dallas and Melissa), and I'm okay with that.<br /><br />I love that they based their book on the premise of \\"biology and the natural patterns of behavior.\\" They even have a section in the 2nd chapter that is entitled \\"Creationists Welcome.\\" When I read this section, I was so thrilled! Finally, a book that doesn't go on and on about our paleolithic ancestors! Finally, a book that doesn't make definitive claims about the origination of the human race! Finally, a book that gives Creationists the scientific facts that they have been craving, without clouding things up with talk of ancestors!<br /><br />Explaining the Paleo diet to friends and family has been tough for me because I do not believe in the idea behind the name \\"Paleo\\" itself (see how I've explained it here). This is a book that I will gladly pass along to everyone I know... whether they believe in evolution OR creation.<br /><br />6. They write beautifully. This may not be important to you, but I absolutely hate reading a book that still requires a red pen. I am an English major, and, unfortunately, my tendency is to edit everything I read. I typically find numerous \\"mistakes\\" in every book I read, but that was not the case with It Starts With Food. In fact, I was so excited that I could not find one thing to edit, that my heart dropped when I thought I'd found something. However, after re-reading the sentence in question, I realized that I was the one who had made the mistake. Kudos to Dallas and Melissa, and to their editors! The no-mistake streak continued to the end, and I enjoyed it immensely!<br /><br />7. They use some fantastic humor. This is not just science and facts... it is also REAL LIFE, and it is surrounded by humor. Dallas and Melissa tell some great stories in this book, and those stories related to me on so many hilarious levels! Just as an example, in the section where they describe how to \\"build your plate,\\" they describe measurements in terms of palms (like the palms of your hands). For protein, they suggest that you have 1-2 palm-sized servings with each meal. This is the quote that cracked me up: \\"Also, for the record, these are not your only options. You've also got 1.25 palms, 1.5 palms, 1.942 palms, and every possibility in between. This should not be overwhelming. You all have palms. Choose your protein, look at your meat, look at your palm, call it good.\\" HAHA! Love it.<br /><br />8. They inspire simplicity. As you know from the title of my website, I am all about helping people realize that whole-food-eating does not have to be difficult. Dallas and Melissa underline that fact over and over again throughout the book. If you come away from it thinking \\"well, that sounds so hard,\\" then you have not really read it. Prepare to have things simplified for you. This stuff is not hard.<br /><br />9. They tell it like it is. Yes, that famous Whole9 tough love is present in their book! I am a very \\"black-and-white\\" person. I hate excuses. I believe that you can do anything if you really want to do it. I don't respond well to wishy-washiness or weakness. If you have excuses (\\"but my kids need their goldfish!\\"), wishy-washiness (\\"maybe I'll try eating good food one of these days...\\"), or weakness (\\"but it's too hard!\\"), then get ready to get over it! I was basically shouting \\"AMEN!\\" during the entire tough love section. I have heard just about every excuse in the book, and apparently Dallas and Melissa have as well!<br /><br />10. They get it. Even though there is some tough love in the book, Dallas and Melissa write it from a perspective of understanding. They know that many of these ideas are [tragically] foreign to most of the modern world. They explain concepts in ways that are easy to grasp, they pre-empt your questions before you even have to ask, and they help you figure out how to get started and KEEP GOING!<br /><br />11. They give you a clear goal. Since I started eating this way, I have always encouraged everyone interested to start with a Whole30. It is the absolutely BEST way to detox your system and learn how specific foods affect you. This book clearly defines the Whole30 program, provides detailed instructions, and gets you excited to get on board! I have completed two Whole30`s in the last year, and I am beyond excited to start another one soon! If you want inspiration and motivation to get strict and healthier than ever, this book is exactly what you need!<br /><br />12. They tell you what happens next. One of the biggest problems I have seen from people who complete any 30-day challenge is that they don't know what to do when it's over. They will either be ultra-paranoid about testing their system with a few things they omitted, or they go hog-wild and binge on everything from pizza to cupcakes. It Starts With Food provides clear instructions on what to do next... how to re-introduce things and how quickly, and what to expect when you do. Dallas and Melissa leave you completely equipped to make the most of your 30 days, and beyond.<br /><br />13. They provide an abundance of resources. Aside from the fact that the book is dotted with numerous great, practical ideas, Dallas and Melissa compiled some amazing appendices. You will love their Meal Map (designed by the fabulous Melissa Joulwan), recipes, cooking conversions, cookbook and website recommendations, and suggestions on where to find sources of local meat and produce.<br /><br />14. They did their homework! They have 20 pages of master references at the end of the book. And I'm talking small-print, multiple listings, etc. This book was not written solely on the basis of opinion. They have backed it all up with research studies, journals, and well-known authors and scientists. Amazing.<br /><br />15. They have challenged me. I finished the book feeling more enthusiastic than ever about why I eat the way I do (and that's a big statement for me!). But the enthusiasm is different this time... Dallas and Melissa have made me more of a purist when it comes to food. This way of eating is simple, and even more so when you aren't trying to convert all your old, unhealthy choices into \\"paleo-friendly\\" treats. I am done with that phase of my Paleo life, and, in fact, I have some cleaning up to do on my website. A lot of the snacks, treats, desserts, etc., that I have too often enjoyed are about to disappear. Does this sound sad to you? Well, just wait until you've read the book, and you might be just as excited about it!<br /><br />Aside from my new purist mentality, Dallas and Melissa helped foster a greater appreciation of food itself than I have ever experienced. I am more eager than ever to find the best sources, prepare it purely and simply, and then give it the appreciation it deserves by enjoying it, undistracted, with those I love. Beautiful.<br /><br />.As you can tell, I really enjoyed the book, and I can hardly contain my enthusiasm and gratitude for the effort that Dallas and Melissa put into it (and it was obviously a lot). This will be a tool that I use in my kitchen, a gift that I give to friends and family, a motivational piece to which I will return, and a guidebook that I will treasure. This marks the beginning of my NEW Good Food journey, and I am crashing through the starting gate!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was a quick fun read and clearly targeted for a younger reader. Twilight fans will probably love it because it has the same feel. Even the heroine is very Bella-like. And if the story's hero were a vampire, he'd fit right in with Edward and his troop.<br /><br />As an avid reader who enjoys erotica, I much preferred a book called PATIENCE [[ASIN:0425210545 Patience (Passion, Book 2)]]. It's well written, fascinating and has complex characters. Not to mention that the hero is to die for!

Soccer Moms everywhere rejoice as someone has finally written a 'Twilight' series for them. If I would have turned in writing this bad when I was in High School my teacher would have wondered if I was joking. Rife with cliches, clumsy narration, unbelievable characters and prose that requires a machete to slog through, Fifty Shades of Grey is Fan Fiction at its worse.

0099579936|1.0|I don't think I can use the P***n word but this book is that in the most evil sense of the word focusing on sexually explicit acts of dominance and submissiveness in highly detailed explanation and extremely hard core. This is NOT literature, it delves into graphic detail, with occasional Cinderella story line added that is simply the worst writing, I have ever encountered and appears to be written by a teenager. I unfortunately purchased the ebook trilogy and am upset that I was not told that this book is P**n, not literature. I never would have purchased it. How any award would be offered for smutty trash like this is beyond me. It is inexcusable that the reviews do not provide more information. Additionally, it lightly addresses the atrocity of children raised in crack houses and suggests that a child exposed to this might become a multibillionaire running multiple companies at the age of 27 when these kids rarely survive to the age of 20 and if they do, are unable to live a productive life. Please don't waste your money or time and do not fund this horrible author. She should never write another published word in our lifetime.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I have been a huge fan of The Derek Trucks Band for more than a decade.  A fan of Susan too.<br />I was more than a little excited about the debut album of The Tedeschi Trucks Band.<br />I was more than a little disappointed.<br />Mostly because I was expecting to hear more of The Derek Trucks Band.<br /><br />But this is *not* The Derek Trucks Band (DTB), and that is not a bad thing.  It's not Susan Tedeschi either.  This is a bigger band, with a bigger sound.  Derek does not dominate like he does in DTB. He has matured and leads this 11 piece ensemble well.<br /><br />Their debut album is chock full of terrific songs, all written by the band and their friends.  From the \\"swore it was an old standard\\" sound of 'Midnight In Harlem' to the \\"talk softly and carry a big stick\\" rumble of 'Learn How to Love', The Tedeschi Trucks Band has something undeniably genuine.  They rock.  They swagger.  They command your attention.  Listen up!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good game . . . .  more powerups at one time would be better but good game other than that
B000008HZB|5.0|It really is a shame that this is OOP. Unlike a lot of albums late in an artist's career, you don't have to force yourself to like this album and overlook shortcomings just because you're a \\"big\\" fan of Lynne/ELO. It stands on its own and could have pretty much been released at any point during Lynne's career and it still would have been great. As a reviewer once pointed out for the ELO Zoom album, there isn't space on the radio for music like this, and it's a shame. Bottom line, if you're a fan of ELO/Lynne/Pop music, pick up a used copy of this. It might not be worth the $50 that some of the used vendors are asking, but if you're patient you can find a reasonably priced copy and that will be money well spent.
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Let me start out by saying I love hammy over-acting Nicholas Cage. The way he chews scenery and acts like a mental case in nearly all his films is my favorite thing about him. To most people this is why they don't like him, but I get a kick out of it. So because of him, and his acting exactly how I hoped he would I'm awarding 1 star. The rest of the movie...wow. Literally one of the worst things I've watched. Not even entertaining enough to elicit a mystery science theater response. The plot is confusing and the plot holes are about as massive as Nic's acting presence. I had a hard time following any of it. The effects weren't awful in some respects, but most of them were weirdly pointless and nausea inducing. The characters beyond Nic Cage were just awful, with some in particular acting as if they were trying to compete with Nic's hammy acting and they failed miserably. Look, I liked the first one, I'm one of the few who did. The plot was coherent, the actors were decent, and Nic's crazy persona was at the perfect level to fit the role. So it had its redeeming qualities. This film has none, even if you are a fan of Nic Cage like me, do not waste your money or your time. Go buy \\"Knowing\\", or \\"Vampires Kiss\\", or even \\"The Wicker Man\\" if you want to watch Nic Cage be hilariously crazed. You'd could probably get all three for the price of this film. Take heed! I wish i had someone to warn me like I'm doing for you. DO NOT BUY!

0345803507|1.0|My critique of the trilogy- Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed.<br />[[ASIN:0345803507 Fifty Shades Freed: Book Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />I've been reading quite a few books over the last few years due to my increase in traveling and having the time on planes to read.<br />I usually am quite picky on what I choose to pass the time with so that being said, I finished all three books in one week. I immediately was captivated by the first book and couldn't put it down until I started the second book. It held my attention to the fullest and had the perfect amount of sexual suspense leaving you wanting and yearning to know more and more.<br />But, once I got to the third book, Fifty Shades Freed, the only reason I finished it was because I wanted to get to the end already. The only thing that held my attention at this point was the conclusion, not at all the story line anymore. I was greatly disappointed in the ending of this trilogy. I wished I hadn't even read the third book because then I would still say I enjoyed the first two. But the way the author, E L James, concludes the story of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele was not at all realistic to me or made any sense. I had high expectations for the last book considering how the first two held my attention and sparked my interest to the fullest. Everywhere I have been over the past few weeks, I have heard women, girl's, coworkers, family, friends and acquaintances talk about these books and are in the process of reading them. I can't help but want to tell all of them not to bother finishing it and not to bother purchasing the last book.<br />Having had some background in BDSM and that lifestyle, and also having learned from personal experience, the character in the book, Christian Grey, drastically deviates from the BDSM lifestyle, more specifically, a true Dominant. Without giving away the ending, although I shouldn't care either way, I will say that as much as Ienjoyed the first two books, I equally as much was disappointed in the last book. I can't say enough how much of a let down the ending was for me and all I can do is post my review for others to read. If there was any way I could contact the author, E L James, I would in a heartbeat. So, for all you avid readers out there, don't waste your time on reading Fifty Shades Freed, stop after the second one, Fifty Shades Darker and put the books down.
0380729407|5.0|On the surface this would seem to be a fantasy story about a dark carnival and the even darker man that runs it.<br /><br />However, all the fantastical elements of this story are really just a springboard for discussing teenage Will Hollawy's relationship with his over the hill father, Charles, and something most decidedly not wicked at all but wonderful:  the redemptive power of love.<br /><br />It all starts in anytown USA circa 1930s when an otherwise common October is altered by the arrival of a carnival.  Young Will Holloway actually witnesses the arrival of that carnival with his friend Jim Nightshade when they're out adventuring one night.<br /><br />Even from the start the boys suspect that there is something very different about this carnival.  In stages their suspicions are confirmed when they play witness to a series of extraordinary things from a calliope that can alter one's age to the strange powers of the carnival's inhabitants up to and including the mysterious Mr. Dark, the carnival's operator.<br /><br />Perhaps more dark than even Mr. Dark are the quiet fears and unfulfilled desires of some of the town residents who Dark would prey on.  This includes the supposedly elderly Charles Halloway.  In that quaint way that authors sometimes betray the age in which they write (this book was published in 1962), Charles Halloway, though only 54 is still pre occupied with thoughts that his age makes him somehow impotent as a father.  (As an aside the screenplay for the 1983 movie on which this book was based most powerfully underscored Halloway's concern about his age by creating an incident where another younger man, had to be called in order to save Halloway's son from a drowning.)<br /><br />For his part young Will Halloway and his friend along with him soon find that they're in deep way over their heads and they need assistance.  It's in this way Bradbury cleverly uses his fantastical set up for an all too real story that allows both young Will Halloway to save his Dad and the older Charles Halloway to save his son, both using love's redemptive power.<br /><br />Will that redemptive power prevail over Dark's evil?  And if so how?  Those questions of course are best answered by reading this story which is, in my opinion, not just one of Bradbury's best but also one of the best stories of American fantasy and science fiction.to save his Dad and the older Charles Halloway to save his son, both using love's redemptive power.<br /><br />Will that redemptive power prevail over Dark's evil?

1612130283|2.0|I actually give this book 2.5 stars. But since the option is not available, I rounded down. Anywho, I broke down and read it. I had to know what all the fuss was about and though it was okay on some levels, it was highly irritating and I felt hoodwinked on other levels. So, where do I begin... I guess I'll start with its redeeming qualities since its non-redeeming qualities may take a while to summarize.<br /><br />Redeeming qualities:<br />* This was written by a Twilight Saga fan/shipper. For the record, I hate Twilight and I am not a fan in any way, shape or form. But fan fictions hold a dear place in my heart; they're what got me into TV writing. I had a faithful following on the X-Files and Alias message boards due to some of my fictions. I respect the author for that. Fan fictions can be as addicting (whether you're the writer or the reader) as the original that inspired them.<br />* Medium core porn written from a straight woman's POV? I'm all on that! No, really. It's terribly hard to find porn/erotica/whatever (with a decent story line) for straight women. Most porn (whether on film or in print) is either too soft, too harlequin novelish, too lesbiany, too gayish, or too much for straight men.<br />* Some of the sex scenes were hot. No explanation needed.<br />* The almost non existent story line, did have me intrigued.<br /><br />Non-Redeeming qualities:<br />* This was written by a Twilight Saga fan/shipper. It had emo Bella (Anastacia) and boo boo Edward (Christian) written all over it. Toss is a miserable Latino/Native American side kick named Jacob (Jose') and all the other uninteresting characters from Twilight and you've basically got a medium core porn w/ some soft BDSM, version of Twilight. Literally.<br />* This was porn written from a woman's POV, but it lost steam after the first 150 pages. Everything just became repetitive and dull. Honestly, who has full blown, earth moving, mind-blowing orgasms strictly from having their nipples pinched. Really?<br />* And did I mention repetitive? The writer must have wrote, \\"I flushed,\\" \\"Christian frowns,\\" \\"oh my,\\" like a thousand times each. Seriously. There's a thesaurus button on any word processing program for a reason.<br />* I also think the writer forgot to send her transcript to the editor before publishing. This story is supposed to be about Americans in the Portland and Seattle area. Being that I am an American I can assure you that none of us refer to our backpacks as \\"rucksacks\\", use \\"holiday\\" instead of vacation, or say \\"I'll fetch it straight away.\\"<br />* Then there's that non existent story line. I know this book falls under the \\"erotica\\" category and I'll admit, I'm not terribly familiar with the genre (perhaps this is a fundamental construct of erotica?) but why take 500 and some odd pages to say what could've been said in 200? Like I said before, after page 150 the sex is pretty much yawn (including the BDSM parts) and you can pretty much guess what happened to Fifty Shades of screwed up Christian when he was little. Why be verbose? Just shut it down.<br /><br />That being said, this book is sort of like watching Keeping Up with the Kardashians and the Flavor of Love. Terribly written but for some reason once you start reading, you'll probably read it all the way to the end.
0307887448|5.0|Read this book in barely more than a day, haven't enjoyed a book this much in years. 80's geek extravaganza!
0553801473|5.0|I went into Feast for Crows with the mindset that it was going to be terrible. I was thoroughly impressed, though how much of that was weighted against my expectations from reading reviews I guess I'll never know. I decided, since I disagreed with most of the criticism for AFFC, to go into ADWD blind, to see how I felt.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the entry. In fact, I do personally feel justified in giving it 5 stars. I understand that puts me in the minority, and I understand my review probably won't be tagged as too 'helpful,' but let me try to explain the best I can.<br /><br />I've read a bunch of fantasy, some bad, some great, some took a lot of slogging through, some had great payoff, others completely faltered. The thing about GRRM, is that the 'slogging' part didn't seem so bad to me. I ate it up! I'm a patient reader, especially when it comes to a story that I really emotionally invest myself into, and maybe it's part of me that doesn't want said story to end, but I think it's more than that. Let's break it down.<br /><br />I feel like there are 4 stages to creating a fantasy story and world on an epic scale.<br /><br />1. Establishing a central character or group of characters (or in this case, an army) and a few central storylines that grasp readers, or else you will not be able to keep an avid readership.<br />2. Worldbuilding, worldbuilding, worldbuilding... Make sure that your readers know and understand every part of the world, the cultures, the religions, the magic, the history, and anything at all that will be necessary for them to understand and enjoy the resolutions that are to come.<br />3. Take all your storylines, and start to turn them in on each other. Start knocking out some payoffs, and resolve some of the smaller arcs to pave the way for the impending finale.<br />4. End it with a bang.<br /><br />The problem I can understand most people having is that AFFC & ADWD seem to still be swimming in #2, though there are arguments to be made that many of the arcs are starting to clear up and collide.<br /><br />****SPOILERS TO FOLLOW****<br /><br />(Stannis/Jon/Theon/Asha/Iron bank of Braavos coming together for example, Arya becoming faceless and possibly having the opportunity to shorten her list soon, Jaime/Brienne/Lady Stoneheart colliding, Varys helping to set up Targaryen plots, Dany possibly teaming up with a Khalasar AND dragons, etc...)<br /><br />****END SPOILERS****<br /><br />Despite a few arcs inching forward, the payoffs are drastically down in these entries compared to the (most everyone agrees) fantastic ASOS, and the focus seems to be aimed at getting you familiar with places you don't know much about. Dorne, the Iron Islands, Braavos, all the slave cities, north of the wall... On top of that you learn more about R'hyllor, the drowned god, the Faith of the Seven, the Children of the Forest, culture of the wildlings, the mystery of the Faceless men, and more.<br /><br />These are all things that I have been craving to know more about. I know the story seemed to slow to a crawl, but I personally never felt cheated. It would have been nice to have the battle sequences originally planned for this entry to have been included, but I still loved jumping from the absolute paranoia of Cersei, to the calculating and militant Selmy, to Jon's insecurity and Tyrion's broken and confusing mix of revenge and sadness. I would have sorely missed Tyrion's journey and encounters with the stone men, Quentyn's sad and hopeless quest and demise, Jon's unsure negotiations with the wildlings, Cersei's fall, Wyman Manderly, every delicious bit of Theon's story, and Victarion's thirst for power.<br /><br />Here's hoping that with the Winds of Winter GRRM will push on through the 3rd step and we get the resolutions we have been craving. Maybe you didn't enjoy this entry, but if you are deeply interested in the world he's created, the cultures and religions, the immersion and the inner ramblings in the minds of thecharacters you love or hate, I feel like this book has plenty to offer. If you need tons of resolution, I wouldn't recommend skipping, but maybe you should wait for #6 and then start up here. Meanwhile, I'll be bundled up and ready for the Winds of Winter.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|Advanced Calibration saved this device for me. I ordered it when it first came out and while it was functional, the lack of deadzone and sensitivity calibration made it more annoying than helpful for me to use. The 3.0 firmware introduced the Advanced Calibration which allowed me to fix the deadzone issues I was having with games. For instance, on a PC if you move the mouse gently in any direction, you will move. That's just how it is. Without the calibration, on most of my games if I slightly moved the mouse, nothing would happen. Now you can change that so that it feels more like PC gaming. With sensitivity, unless you had a mouse where you had a lot of DPI and a button to change it, you were stuck with whatever your mouse could do. Now, you can change it so that even your non-fancy mouse can get you moving like a pro.<br /><br />WARNING: Extremely limited hardware compatibility. I highly suggest you visit the Penguin United Forums to see if your mouse/keyboard are compatible with the device.

B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Beach House's album \\"Bloom\\" really hits the spot for me. There is something vaguely familiar; a bit of eighty's synth like Berlin, the Motels, the Cure, and maybe even a bit of Siouxsi and the Banshees spread throughout and within the songs here. The album is very consistent, with hypnotizing vocals and lyrics melting into moments of sublime bliss. Once again, NPR's First Listen has allowed me to become helplessly addicted to an album, and Amazon is there to save the day with their wildly entertaining pricing volatility.  If this album hits your price point sweet spot for new music to take a chance on, put on a good set of cans and let this one grow on you.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm a sophomore in school, and I use this almost everyday to create documents. Great app! Has a ton of great features.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I love this thing. I use if for P90x and long distance bike riding.  When you download the data after working out, you get great information, charts, which makes it fun. It took me a long time to figure out how to work this thing. So plan on goofing it up a few times before you get the hang of it. It has a touch bezel that can be deactivated. So, my procedure is to get the thing going and then deactivate the bezel so I don't accidentally touch it in the middle of the workout. One thing to note on a GPS when biking. The distance you travel is actually more than the GPS says.  This is because when you go around a corner, it squares the corner off. So as long as you go straight, it's accurate, around curves you lose a little distance. No big deal. (I trust my wired bike computer when it comes to exact distance anyway.)  The Garmin estimates calories burned also, based on your height, age, weight, physically condition. The battery doesn't last very long, so you must keep it charging when not in use.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I was doubtful about John Carter after seeing the short snippets in the advertisements on TV.  I'd read the books 50 years ago, but I thought the movie was gonna be terrible.  However, I'm glad to say I was totally wrong. All in all a pleasant very happy surprise.<br /><br /> The beginning was disjointed, but being knowledgeable from the books I was able to follow.  Then the viewer is presented with one really poorly structured scene with terrible dialogue, where John Carter enters into a dimly lit ramshackle shack to buy supplies (so far so good, a Clint Eastwood look to things).  But then the snide patrons make hokey contrived comments about \\"the-evil-spider-cave-of-gold\\" and start laughing harsh, forced laughter.  Was I rolling my eyes as to why I bought a ticket?  Yep.<br />  But ... then the cavalry men come into the store searching for John Carter in and thereafter it was Saturday Morning MATINEE! Yee hah!  John Carter was off to the RACES!!<br />  2 hours and whatever minutes later the movie was done, the action was great, and I left the theater feeling great!  I loved Tars Tarkas with William Defoe.  I loved Sola.  Great acting/animation! To my mind better than Avatar, and I like Avatar.<br />  The ships were better than what I'd envisioned in the books.  The beasts were lively, well animated, and absolutely authentic to the works.<br />  Did I say I loved Deja Thoris?!  She was spot on! Fantastic actress as was her father.<br /> So Yeah, it was greatly enjoyable.  Noble virtues, lot of action.  And I can't wait for another JC movie.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|In the current realm of rock music today, Shinedown blends in perfectly with the radio-rock sound that has been done by Nickelback and Theory of a Deadman. But, unlike those bands, who incorporate lyrics regarding bashing women, mostly evident in TOAD, Shinedown has always written lyrics that are straight from the heart and more poetic. They've never really went too far with their lyrics, and that is a band that I can easily get into.<br /><br />\\"Leave a Whisper\\" is my favorite Shinedown album, hands down. It blended a lot of different styles of rock music together, such as nu-metal, radio rock, and even a little bit of classic rock. \\"Us and Them\\" portrayed a softer side of Shinedown, but in no way is this a bad sign. \\"The Sound of Madness\\" is what I like to call the band's breakthrough, displaying much more of the radio-rock sound than the previous two records combined.<br /><br />So, now we're up to \\"Amaryllis\\", and while this does not level up to \\"Leave a Whisper\\", it's another diverse offering from the band. Shinedown continue to set themselves apart from the several radio rock bands that are dominating the airwaves these days. The songwriting is absolutely flawless and much more thought-provoking than even the best material from LAW. The vocals are improved more than on the previous records. Overall, the album is in fact their most adventurous to date.<br /><br />Standout tracks on the record are as follows: \\"Nowhere Kids\\", \\"For My Sake\\", \\"Adrenaline\\", \\"Miracle\\", \\"I'll Follow You\\", lead-off single \\"Bully\\" and \\"Through the Ghost\\". \\"Nowhere Kids\\" is more of a political song, with lyrics such as, \\"Politicians, in condition dying for a curtain call\\", and \\"I know you're hanging onto zeros because you got nothing left.\\" \\"For My Sake\\", is arguably one of the bigger highlights of the album, and showcases Brent Smith's amazing songwriting skills. \\"Adrenaline,\\" the opening track, feels more like a song from \\"Sound of Madness\\", mostly similar to the song, \\"Devour\\", which happens to be the opening song from that album. And nearly every other song on this album is well-written and \\"epic\\".<br /><br />So, it really comes to show that Shinedown has worked much harder on their sound and their songwriting skills than Nickelback. With all of this being said, I hope Shinedown has another platinum record with this album, and will continue to be pushing out great and cohesive records in the time to come.<br /><br />TRACKS:<br />Adrenaline (5/5)<br />Bully (5/5)<br />Amaryllis (4/5)<br />Unity (4/5)<br />Enemies (4/5)<br />I'm Not Alright (4/5)<br />Nowhere Kids (5/5)<br />Miracle (5/5)<br />I'll Follow You (4/5)<br />For My Sake (5/5)<br />My Name (Wearing Me Out) (4/5)<br />Through The Ghost (5/5)<br />ALBUM SCORE: (54/60)<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 starshappens to be the opening song from that album.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|\\"Old Man's War\\" is a science fiction novel by John Scalzi, an author who happens to be internet-famous for taping bacon to his cat.  My boyfriend read \\"Old Man's War\\" first and couldn't put it down, and since we have similar taste in books, I decided to give it a go.  I'm so very glad that I did.<br /><br />The story begins when John Perry's wife dies and he decides to join the army on his 75th birthday.  Alien life has been discovered and Earth has begun colonies in outer space, but due to a strict quarantine, people aren't allowed to come back to Earth once they've left.  This means that Perry knows nothing but rumors of the Colonial Defense Force (CDF) and the war that they're fighting in outer space.  The CDF recruits old men from Earth who assume that the advanced technology and resources available to the army can make them young again.  That's about all that I can say about the plot, because if I talked much about the rest of the book then I'd quickly devolve into major plot spoilers.<br /><br />Scalzi's writing is very approachable, even if you don't read a lot of sci-fi.  He's also got a great sense of humor (the scene where all the old people in their young bodies start having sex with each other because they can comes to mind... it would totally happen), and I was amused that he named a minor character after Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />Perry finds a sense of camaraderie in the CDF, and quickly rises through the ranks.  I liked the way that Scalzi used Perry's character to examine the emotional implications of war, especially when the odds seem unbalanced.  In once scene, Perry feels bad about stomping on teeny tiny aliens, only to be continually reassured by his superiors that what he's doing is for the ultimate benefit of mankind.  We see the CDF being used in situations where politicians hadn't exhausted other options, and the troops do struggle morally with what they're told to do.  At the same time, they realize that they're fighting for their former friends and families back on Earth and that nothing is quite as simple as it seems.<br /><br />For those of you who have read the book, I'm a big fan of the ending, and the romance in the book was well-orchestrated.  This is one of those books where the love story enhances the story rather than detracts from it.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book a lot, and I'm planning on reading the sequels at some point in the future.  I'd definitely recommend it.ds and families back on Earth and that nothing is quite as simple as it seems.<br /><br />For those of you who have read the book, I'm a big fan of the ending, and the romance in the book was well-orchestrated.

Don't believe the cranky critics, they just don't know how to sit back and relax and watch a movie, all they know is to be picky.<br /><br />the story:<br /><br />A decade after perseus victory against the kraken, he lives a peaceful lives as a fisherman in a village with his son, Helius.

At the advice of a couple of reviewers, I did call customer service and sure enough, I was offered a free replacement! Since I was online already, the representative, Sarah, added a credit to my account and it appeared immediately so as I placed the order, the balance was zero dollars. I'm so pleased with the customer service and with Sarah's demeanor on the call. She was so positive and pleased to help me. It made this frustrating situation so much better.

1612130283|1.0|I have only myself to blame for buying this book which I got on the Kindle version.  I read the reviews and thought that it can't be all that bad if so many people are buying it.  I was wrong, this is a terribly boring book, probably the worst book that I have ever read and I don't mean because of the sex scenes.<br /><br />The two main characters is this book have to be the two most boring characters that I have ever read.  She is always blushing and biting her lip and he is always frowning and running his fingers through his hair.  And of course both of them are always smirking and rolling their eyes.  They act more like a couple of eight year olds than adults in their twenties. Except for having sex they don't seem to do much of anything else.  Other men come into Ana's life and I wonder why this is. What does anyone see in Ana, even an equally boring,(but at least he is rich), Christian?  Among other things, she doesn't care what she looks like, never wears makeup,and at twenty-two years old still wears pig tails. She wears terrible clothes and only shaves under her arms and her legs when her roommate strongly insists on it after she meets Christian. She must have been quite a sight when she put on a bathing suit with all of that hair showing.<br /><br />I have to admit that the so called \\"Romance Fiction\\" is not my favorite genre and I avoid it like the plague.  I love all of Jane Austen's novels and I liked many of Georgette Heyer's novels.  But this book is not only badly written, there is really just not much of a story, for me the characters are just so unbelievably boring.  While reading this book, I found it so boring that when I was halfway through the book I could take no more and went skipping through many pages to the sex scenes, but they also became boring after awhile. There really isn't much of a story in this book except for two boring people who are so hot for one another.  I wonder how long that would last in real life.<br /><br />I love to readand read books all of the time, however I like books with good stories and interesting characters.<br /><br />I think that I must have picked up some bad writing just from reading this book.  How many times did I say boring?  I guess that I will have to search my inner goddess and also my outer goddess for some better books.<br /><br />P.S.  Is the guy's name Christian or Christopher? lol
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I have been listening to this for a couple of weeks now, trying to decide what to say on a review.  Today it occured to me, that many of the songs bring me joy.

B006P3HXZG|5.0|My 18 month old son LOVES Puss in Boots. LOVES IT. We seriously have this on at least once a day for a part of the movie. I've probably seen this movie 15 times in the last month. My wife, double that easily.<br /><br />We can tolerate it because this movie is legitimately very good. Plot, voicing, animation, jokes - it's all there. This is definitely one of the better children's movies to come out in the last ten years.<br /><br />As a bonus, the extra features on the disc(s) are pretty cool too. The 'new adventure' is an animated short featuring Puss, with Antonio Banderes reprising his role as the voice of Puss.  The quality of the short is nowhere near the quality of the movie itself, but it's a fun little extra on par with a saturday morning cartoon. The rest of the features include the usual commentaries & such, deleted scenes (storyboarded, not fully animated), actor interviews, and a couple of neat interactive features like a keyboard that plays nursery rhymes while the main characters dance. While the audience for some of these special features is probably somewhat limited, there is a lot of material here. The bit on the cat-thief in California is actually from an Animal Planet show, and quite amusing.<br /><br />Anyway, give this movie a watch. It's worth it.  The 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD triple-pack is a good value as well, thanks to the extra features and the multiple disc copies.
B005G02RIC|5.0|This is my first Blu-ray opera.  I was very impressed with the video and audio recording.  The video production seemed very smooth and not frantic or choppy to me.  The audio seemed well focused, and immersive.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I'm a big Rush fan and it pains me a little to say this, but Clockwork Angels is a bit underwhelming.  Despite a few good tunes from it that we've already been hearing for two years (\\"Caravan\\", for one) the album has a few too many songs that sound almost exactly alike.<br /><br />It is well-produced sonically, but not terribly interesting melodically.  There are a number of songs that have the same structure, lyric/vocal meter, tempo, and key.  They don't stand apart from each other. As a whole the album sounds workmanlike instead of interesting.<br /><br />Every Rush fan has their favorite album or period of the band's history.  For me it was every album between \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Roll The Bones\\", so basically 1980/81 through 1991/92.  I think during that period Rush produced some of their most interesting, melodic, clever, and satisfying work.  But I think most of \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is inferior to any and every one of their albums during that decade-long span.<br /><br />I still believe that any Rush release is a welcome one, this one included.  But I can't rate it up there with their better work, although I did notice and appreciate the nod to Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" on the track \\"Garden\\".<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.
B001E45XT4|5.0|So I bought these headphones a while back when they were around $20. I guess a new version came out or something, not sure fully... But anyways, to describe them when they first arrived, I didn't think to much of them being plastic and having the negative remarks on build quality, although after wearing them in, I found quality improved quite a lot. From here I began tampering with the equalizer setting in I-tunes because I love a nice sounding headset, and these are not default for music at all. While some people said that buying an amp helped them out a lot, I noticed I could get the same sound just by tweaking frequencies. As it turns out, these headphones aren't made so well for low bass frequencies. After all this, the sound is quite more immersive, and I am very happy with the headphones for the cash I spent. :)<br /><br />Equalizer: 32+2,64+1,125+1.1/3,250+2/3,500=0,1k=0,2k=0,4k+1/2,8k+1,16k+1.1/3<br />Note: Preamp is set to -1, while all sets are rounded to thirds for specs and smoothing technicalities.<br /><br />=Pros and Cons=<br /><br />-Pros: Comfort, sound quality, 3D sounds, and the mic. Very clear mic, along with folding in. (Btw, I haven't noticed any wear on it yet.)<br /><br />-Cons: Not the best build quality; watch the bass. They take a while to ware in. (Around 5 hours of medium use, and 10-15 hours hard use.) (Just don't take it too hard on bass or the speakers will begin to rattle, if you want a base headphone go buy some Beats.)<br /><br />All and all I would definitely recommend these to a friend. They're worth the $50-$60, but I'd suggest waiting for a sale.
0062012339|5.0|Ceaselessly fascinating book. It's organized like an oral history of the band's career, each band member and various other pertinent personnel contributing chapters.  Mick Mars doesn't have as much to say as the rest of them, but when he does chime in he pulls his weight.<br /><br />That Nikki Sixx continues to draw breath after all he ingested, snorted, and shot up is a testimony to the resiliency of the human body.  They should write medical journals about him.<br /><br />Great book.  Eye-opening, shocking, and occasionally funny.  Best long-form anti-drug pamphlet ever published.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game play it on my ipod, my kindle fire,  nd my phone the Sanding Infuse but on my phone it freezes a lot that should be fixed ASAP but overall the game is great it would be better if maybe there were more power ups and more characters.
B007TBCTRK|3.0|Maybe it was the main theme.  Maybe it was the soaring French Horn.  Maybe it was because it sounded like it came from a different movie, like a Civil War film or a moment or two from \\"Apollo 13\\".  Whichever it was, the main theme was distractingly wrong for the tone of the film \\"Prometheus\\", or at least an ill-fitting melody for the scenes it played under.  Every time I heard that main theme played on the horn it took me completely out of the movie and made me squirm in my seat.  It even was oddly reminiscent of a phrase from John Williams' score for \\"Superman - The Movie\\", though less effective and suitable.<br /><br />It isn't a bad piece of music.  It's just the wrong music for this film.  God, do I miss Jerry Goldsmith!<br /><br />Any number of other composers could have come up with a viable main theme for this film and probably a better one:  Eliot Goldenthal, James Horner, maybe even Thomas Newman.  Given the work former \\"Saturday Night Live\\" musical director Howard Shore did for \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and David Cronenberg's 1996 film \\"Crash\\", I'd love to hear what he might have been able to come up with.<br /><br />It will be a long time before I can watch \\"Prometheus\\" again without being distracted by main theme.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|With its amateurish writing style and obvious borrowing from Twilight, this book seems to be directed to YA readers.  I find that scary, because the book glorifies an abusive relationship.  Ana frequently describes Christian's treatment of her as \\"assault,\\" both in her thoughts and when emailing him.  She tries to understand and excuse his behavior because he was previously involved with an evil older woman - she sees the woman as evil because she did to Sebastian what he is now doing to Ana, but somehow he's not evil or even responsible for what he does.  Ana consents to being harmed out of fear that he will be mad or break up with her if she says no.  Does this seem like an abusive relationship to anyone?  Ana's roommate, Kate, the only sensible character in the book, immediately pegs Christian as creepy, a stalker, and hurtful to Ana.  Ana agrees with the assessment, yet views these qualities as signs of Christian's great attraction to her, and she hopes some affection lurks behind that attraction.  She hopes, in fact, to cure Christian of his domineering ways and heal what she supposes to be his past trauma.  The book reads like a creepy training guide for a girl who wants to keep an abusive boyfriend happy.  Yuck.

B007RKPO84|5.0|This new release for 2012 from Kreator, sees the band expanding on their recent thrash sound by incorporating a lot more elaborate guitar work - with elements drawn from bands as diverse as Amon Amarth and Iron Maiden. A very consistent thrash album with some real catchy tunes to be found. The production is crisp - but not too polished. If you liked Violent Revolutions, Enemy of God and Hordes of Chaos, then this album is well worth checking out.

0880389052|5.0|This was the first serious Fantasy novel I read, at the age of 10 years. I was instantly drawn into this dark world full of fantastic monsters and dark elves, and the courageous nature of Drizzt, who's sterling character is a guiding beacon for me in my darkest times. I've reread this book at least 10 times over the past 15 years, and it never ceases to draw me in and strengthen my spirit, much like a church goer getting a sermon on Sunday.<br /><br />As far as the action in the book, it's well placed and exciting. The world really comes alive in Salvatore's hands, and the message is one of hope, that even in the darkest and corrupt society, we can shine through and find a better way if we want to.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't touched this genre before, this is the place to start, no questions asked! For any Drizzt fans who haven't read this book, you simply have to read this book!
159413586X|1.0|This, the third and final installment of The Hunger Games, was a drag. I managed to finish the story because I'm familiar with the characters and it was a pretty quick read, but the unholy amount of negative introspection and relating of dreams made the whole story just plod along like a wounded bear. What irks me most is that I could have been reading anything else and it would likely have been better.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I have now read all three of the hunger games books.  I felt the first and second books ended in a way that almost forced me to get the next one...the endings were unresolved.  I have enjoyed them all but by the third book I just wanted it all over with.  This is an interesting, easy read...a little too much killing for me.

1401235417|3.0|I really enjoy Scott Snyder's AMERICAN VAMPIRE comics. Those stories are fresh and original. I was first introduced to Snyder's non-AMERICAN VAMPIRE writing in BATMAN: THE BLACK MIRROR. That pre-new-52 story has been heralded by many as the best Batman story in the past five years. Unfortunately, I don't agree. I thought that the initial premise of the story was promising, but then it went to places it wasn't necessary to go (for instance, was it really necessary to make Jim Gordon's son a psychopath?) It reminds me of some of the extremes DC went to in the 1990s to increase readership, but that almost led to the complete destruction of the company. Despite not enjoying, THE BLACK MIRROR, I decided to give Snyder's Batman another chance and read BATMAN, VOL. 1: THE COURT OF OWLS.<br /><br />The basic storyline is that Batman discovers that an old rhyme that mothers in Gotham City used to tell their children to scare them into obedience, is actually true. For over a century, Gotham has been &#34;watched over&#34; by a secret group of individuals (like the Illuminati) that call themselves the Court of Owls. Nothing happens without the approval of the Court and if the Court doesn't like what you're doing, they send their assassin, named Talon, to kill you. Batman is the Court's next target and he finds himself racing against a clock as he struggles against enemies who seem to know his every move before he even makes them.<br /><br />I realize with the New 52, the entire DC universe has received a reboot. I don't agree with it, but I understand and accept it. But even with a reboot, with all the villains in Batman's rogues gallery, was it really necessary to create another evil group to pit against Batman? Aren't the League of Assassins, the Club of Villains, the Masters of Disaster, the Misfits, the Network, the New Olympians, Strike Force Kobra, and the more recent introduction of Dollmaker and his family enough?<br /><br />There's also the level of graphic violence. BATMAN, VOL. 1: THE COURT OF OWLS is the third most violent non-horror comic I've read in the past seven years. Batman comics always were a bit more violent and darker in nature than the rest of the DC universe, but until the late 1980s they weren't all that violent. When DC shifted to more graphically violent themed stories in the late 1980s, it turned me completely off of comics for nearly two decades. It seemed that DC had learned their lesson, but over the past year-and-a-half, the company seems to have forgotten the lessons they were taught and have returned to the type of stories that almost destroyed the company in the 1990s.<br /><br />The other criticism I have with BATMAN, VOL. 1: THE COURT OF OWLS is the artwork. At one point in the book, you have to rotate the book around in a circle to follow from panel to panel what is happening. This itself isn't new and is more of an annoyance than anything else. However, there are other times where the images are so dark and the lines so blurry that it's difficult to follow exactly what is happening in the story. It's as though the artists decided to copy the shaky-cam techniques from film making and put them into comic form. Shaky-cam usually doesn't work well in movies and is worse when viewed in comic book form.<br /><br />Therefore, because of the lack of originality, ultra violence, and poor artistry, BATMAN, VOL: 1: THE COURT OF OWLS is hereby, found guilty of being ho-hum.BATMAN, VOL. 1: THE COURT OF OWLS is the third most violent non-horror comic I've read in the past seven years.

B007SGM084|5.0|I have read a lot, before and since I got my Kindle.  This is one of the best books/series I have ever read.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|This film is a visual beauty, it really is, but that beauty is only skin deep when it comes to the story.  The plot has too many holes and gaps for the viewer to fill in.  There's no clear motivation for the actions of the characters, stretching the story way beyond any credible suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The film glosses over the philosophical questions it started off trying to answer, coming off as more of an existential mess.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, he's truly brilliant, so maybe my expectations for this film were too high.  Some of the Alien franchise movies are true classics, but that sadly won't be the case with this film.<br /><br />Something went terrible wrong with the story.  I'm sure I'll see this film again, it really is a visual joy, but sadly not as good of a story is it could have, and should have been.
030758836X|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this book.  Similar to a Jodi Picoult book, chapters were narrated by one of two different characters.  I like that approach.  Also, the characters are easy to like and hate as they make their different choices.  I usually listed to books using text to speech on my drive to work or back but with this book, I tried to find extra time in my day to read.  That's a sign of a good book to me.
B00005R62N|5.0|Despite the fact that this release has been claimed contrivial as to whether it is a \\"true\\" live recording(alot of people call this set Unleashed in the Studio), the fact of the matter is, by this point, Priest were an unstoppable live force and Unleashed in the East, for better or worse, is another apex for the band. Unfortunately, this would turn out to be Les Binks' last recording with the group, but he does an admirable job of delivering the goods(pun intended) ensuring the force of the group's ensemble work is consistent and driving all the same. Exciter opens the recording and features a performance that is a tad faster in tempo than its studio counterpart from 78's Stained Class. The same can be said for much of the rest of the album and the band dips back into Sad Wings of Destiny with 4 cuts featured in The Ripper, Genocide, Tyrant and Victim of Changes; again, all much speedier than the respective studio versions.<br /><br />The 2001 remaster features 4 more tracks, 3 of which are from Hell Bent for Leather in the forms of Delivering the Goods, Rock Forever and the title track, plus Starbreaker from sin After Sin. The inclusion of these tracks from the original 9 track lp are a suprise pleasure and make the experience of the recording even more enjoyable and justified in the assumption that Halford and Co. were at an early peak in their then 7 year career, and only more great music and success were to be in store for the longer haul. Unleashed in the East is another benchmark within Priest's catalogue and should be in any fans collection. 5 Classic stars
0156012197|5.0|This is such a wonderful book! I should've read it when I was younger but didn't give it a chance. I do remember that my father loved it so recently I read it and am so happy I did! Not only was it an amusing story but there are many lessons you can take away after reading it. I will be reading this book not once, but over and over again. It makes me feel closer to a special person I don't have contact with anymore. For that I am thankful!

B003JJ8LD2|2.0|I heard Mr. McDonald speak last year and bought his book. It had been sitting on the shelf since then, and I finally picked it up. The story starts out interestingly enough. It traces McDonald's humble beginnings as a bond trader and how he eventually founded an internet start-up. He then spends the second half of the book talking about the couple of years that he spent at Lehman Brothers in the distressed debt division.<br /><br />Many of the details in the book have been discussed before with better results - \\"The Big Short\\" by Michael Lewis and \\"Too Big to Fail\\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin. It talks about how the financial system was on \\"steroids\\" because of CDOs and other Wall Street financial instruments and how the management at Lehman was arrogant and just plain stupid.<br /><br />My real problem with the book is the tone and flavor. McDonald makes it sound like only the \\"smart people\\" inside Wall Street with their MBAs from NYU, Columbia and Wharton understood that the real estate market would collapse. That was not the case. My friends and I might not have had the technical data in 2005 and 2006, but we knew something was seriously wrong with the economy. The book has such an aura of arrogance about it. He laments the fact that all his Lehman co-workers lost millions in stock options when the company went bankrupt, but half the book is about how his unit shorted Delta Airlines, New Century and other companies, places where people lost livelihoods and fortunes.<br /><br />In addition, the book needs a serious editor. McDonald will start a story about visiting California to study the collapsing housing market and then spend half a page about his golf game and how he loved to golf at some particular golf course. Who cares! The book also gets lost in its own jargon and financial data. This is supposed to be a general interest book. Why would a general interest reader care about spreads on a particular trade? The book was supposed to be about the collapse of Lehman. McDonald really only spends a small section on the chaos of August and September of 2008 and repeats many of the stories that were already well reported in the press.

0345803485|5.0|I loved this book and both of the others! Everyone is saying that it is unbelievable, but that is why it is FANTASY people!! If you don't like it, fine, but a lot of people do so get over it! It's not for everyone.  I personally was enthralled by the storyline of the trilogy.  I have to say that book 1 got me interested in the plot and left me desiring more and more!  I devoured book 2 and 3 after that.  The storyline really develops.  Give E.L. James some credit. This is her first published book and she is a novice author.  Yes, the writing could be repetitive, but the storyline and ideas are more important that a few misplaced words or repeated ones.  I'm all for these books and plan on reading again! Go James, keep writing!

B003G8WI7G|4.0|This music is funky, retro, and new all at once. You can't help but move; you can't help but want to pick up your axe and join in.  If all you're doing is listening closely, some of the grooves can go on a little long, making you want to hear some more variation.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Very good app. I wasn't expecting to like it this much!! Magic puzzles keeps me and the kids very busy!  I recommend it.!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it!!! The best game app that I have downloaded on my phone. I recommend to anyone that loves playing games on your Kindle.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I enjoyed the action and the mind games.  I was laughing at the demonic pony, dead dog, naked brother, smoking while waiting, makeup, and the clothing being pulled off part.  I was also feeling sorry for Sherlock then felt bad when it looked as if he was being outsmarted.  In the end, Sherlock knew what was going on and he won the game.  Being invisible...priceless.  LOL!  It had everything I could possibly want.  And, the BBC Sherlock is great also.  The Game is On.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|After watching the epic-ness that was the first season, and previously reviewing it on Amazon, Season 2 earned 4 fours. Why? Mainly because they deviated from the book. As a long time book fan, it was quite surprising to see the writers of Game of Thrones remove themselves a little bit from the plot of the book; it was, at times, annoying, yet not all that unpleasant. The fact that George R. R. Martin continues to be consulted on his magnum-opus-turned-hit-TV show is a redeeming factor. I mean, who else would you ask for approval? Martin also wrote the last two episodes, which were arguably the best two episodes of the season.<br /><br />As with the first Season, the visuals were absolutely, positively stunning. Filming sets in Croatia and Ireland were extremely well done, and though I was never quite as enamored with TV Quarth's lack of book-inspired opulence, the shots of the surrounding landscape were magnificent. The HBO team certainly kept up with the great work they did on filming locations. I was also impressed in regards to the costumes and props incorporated into the show. The grit, dirt, and grime added an element of authenticity to the medieval feel of the books.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with the second season was the lack of characters that were introduced in the book but not the show. *SPOILERS* Where were Jojen and Meera, the crannogmen of Greywater Watch? Did the writers make a mistake by choosing to include them later? Wtf is going on with the girl from Volantis (Jeyne Westerling in disguise?) *SPOILERS*<br /><br />There are a plethora of things to love about Season 2, though, despite my petty complaints.<br /><br />Peter Dinklage can do no wrong - Because Peter Dinklage. He has made the role of Tyrion his own. If by some unfortunate, hypothetical incident Peter Dinklage is unable to act as Tyrion, no one, and I mean NO ONE, will be able to step into those shoes.<br /><br />Cersei, oh Cersei - I love how much I hate Cersei. Her vulnerability is expanded upon in this Season, and its actually beginning to grow on me. One of those liberties taken from the book that turned out pleasantly surprising. Best line of this season in response to Sansa's \\"But you were Robert's queen!\\" --> \\"And you will be Joffrey's, enjoy.\\" *drinks herself blind*<br /><br />Theon - For some odd reason, I can't latch on to Theon's humanization in this season as much as Cersei's. The writers tried to show a vaguely sympathetic side to Theon's story, but I wasn't as captured by Alfie Allen's performance. There's plenty of time to change that, though.<br /><br />Brienne the Badass - My flawless queen. That is all.<br /><br />Daenerys - I wasn't as interested in Daenarys this season because she had such limited screen time and because her character seemed kind of just... there. There were bouts of fierceness that really suck you in (for example, the Quartheen entreaty), but there were also scenes that seemed boring. To be fair, much of the action was focused on King's Landing in Westeros, and much more time was devoted to those scenes.<br /><br />Joffrey - Where is my fabulous Joffrey slap? Every episode requires a fabulous backhand across this little punk's baby-bottom smooth cheek. Very much looking forward to his death in Season 3. Hoping Bronn will say something snarky about him dying a virgin.<br /><br />Tywin and Arya - Personally, for me, the quadrumvirate of Arya, Tywin, Brienne, and Tyrion MADE this season. Hands down. There was such a fantastic chemistry between Maisie Williams and Charles Dance, and for the writers and directors to make use of that said something about the amazing quality of this show. My favorite scenes of the season, no question, were the interactions between Arya and Tywin. It reminded me a lot of that visceral scene in season 1 between Tywin and Jaime when he was gutting the deer (?). This is Emmy-winning material.<br /><br />Stannis and Melisandre - Just... ew.<br /><br />Jon Snow - One of the fan favorites of the show and book, Kit Harington has yet to live up to the vision of Jon Snow that the book has fleshed out. Make no mistake, I'm sure he will get there, but right now, rugged, dark-bearded Kit Harington is too naive a Jon Snow. There aren't enough scenes to show his growth (maybe in Season 3). He may know nothing, but at least his taste in women is immaculate. Ygritte is hot.<br /><br />Special mention: Roz - Because Roz has come so far. Roz was barely mentioned in the book, but if George Martin included her in the TV show, she's got to have a role in something. She's really, really enticing, and her role is one of those minor changes that actually surprised me in a good way.<br /><br />Season 1 set the standard. Season 2 didn't quite live up to that standard, but it was still pretty damn good. And it kept me at the edge of my seats with anticipation. This fan is certainly won over.
0345803493|1.0|I read the first few parts to it and my first thought was that this is crap. Did anyone even bother to look over this lady's work. And than i stopped reading it, it was that bad. But it does give me hope that i may one day be a best seller also. I had to give it a star because I cant review if i didn't.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The best I've read in this genre. I've recomended it to all my friends and family. Really enjoyed reading it, and its got some wonderful tips. Can't wait to apply them, and see if they work for me.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Plenty of action, clever, funny. And it's hard to go wrong with Robert & Jude. Rachel McAdams was nicely suited for a woman in London during that time.<br /><br />Be patient the first little while - but the plot development going on then is important.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]  What a treat!  I have been reading science fiction for a zillion (give or take a few) years, and Howey's Wool is a real find.  Hard SF becoming rare, it seems, in favor of fantasy/vampires/zombies etc., etc., and it was a delight to find this book.  Excellent, dystopian SF, AND Howey can not only tell a story that sucks you in and pulls you along, BUT he is literate -- he can spell, punctuate, and use words properly.  The Omnibus is well worth your digital bucks -- I can't imagine not having all the parts available to read together, because you are not going to want to stop to do another download!<br />  This guy is the real deal --if you cut your teeth on Heinlein, or really like Haldeman -- read Howey!
1466401885|5.0|I read this book after tons of recommendations on how to get over my Christian (Fifty) crush. All I have to say is that it worked. I couldn't put it down until I finished it and then I read the entire book again the next day! Travis is amazing and gives you butterflies every time he shows up. I can't wait for the release of BD from Travis' POV...coming this year hopefully! One recommendation though, if you haven't read Thoughtless or Fifty Shades of Grey series, read these first. They are just as amazing, but BD tops the cake and you'll be yearning for something to fill the void. Nothing compares, so save this one for last.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|\\"Ick\\" was my initial reaction to \\"Oh Susannah\\", the first song on Americana and the first song from the album released with an accompanying video on YouTube. I thought Oh Susannah sounded clunky, and that Neil's voice had gotten so creaky and snarly that it verged on being ugly. But the video was kind of intriguing, especially that dancing, smoking kid. I watched and listened to it again a couple of days later and found myself liking the way the song begins, sort of like an old diesel tractor sputtering and wheezing when it's first started, then all the parts of the motor get in synch and the next thing you know you've got a chugging locomotive barreling down the track. A few more listens and I'm finding myself humming Oh Susannah as I'm walking my dog or doing the dishes and, before I know it, I'm on board.<br /><br />The same thing happened when he released \\"Clementine.\\" Initially I thought some parts of the song were okay, but cringed whenever Neil would go into the chorus wailing like a rusty old band saw blade. But I gave it a couple more listens and now, when Neil howls out Clem-men-ti-i-i-i-ne, I'm right there howling along with him.<br /><br />And by the time I had listened to \\"Jesus Chariot\\" (She'll be Coming Around the Mountains) the third or fourth time, especially enjoying how in the accompanying video the ballroom dancers seem to jump to the rhythm of Crazy Horse, the Neil Young & Crazy Horse undertow had sucked me right in.<br /><br />Americana is not about polishing and varnishing some old campfire chestnuts. Others (Bruce Springsteen?) have done a better job of reworking the folk tunes. Neil Young has simply taken the shadows of these old songs and transformed them into genuine Neil Young & Crazy Horse stomps. I have a friend who's in his mid 20's and not very familiar with Neil Young. I had him listen to this album a couple times and he was really surprised when I told him afterwards that these songs are based on old folk tunes. He said that they somehow sounded familiar but he couldn't place them, even though he knew many of the original songs.<br /><br />This is not a good Neil Young album. But this is a great Neil Young & Crazy Horse album. Truthfully, I haven't really been able to get into any Neil Young album since Greendale (although megaphones do not music make), or maybe even the underrated Broken Arrow with its strikingly similar cover art to Americana. Americana works for me because of Crazy Horse who, in my opinion, are Neil's best backup band ever. Crazy Horse always seem to set Neil on the warpath and remind me why I often think of Neil Young as the master of the warpath guitar. Crazy Horse make me think of how the original Crazy Horse's people might have sounded romping and stomping up a storm around a bonfire if they had drums, guitars, and an electric bass.<br /><br />I especially like the way Crazy Horse back up Neil in \\"Tom Dula\\". I'm not sure who's singing the background vocals (Billy Talbot?), but whoever it is, he's really singing his heart out as hard as Neil is. The whole band is playing as if this is their last chance to prove to the world that they've got the real thing.<br /><br />And speaking of heart, this is what Americana is truly about. It's about raw, pure, beautiful and untarnished emotion. Yes it creaks and snarls and sputters, but it's also powerful and inspiring. It's not the \\"Twenty-four and so much more\\" Neil Young of forty years ago, but Neil Young in his sixties still going out in his blaze of glory.<br /><br />I bought the album and have listened to it now in my truck, on my iPod, and through my vintage stereo at least half a dozen times. It turns out that the album is great for running or working out to and even better for listening to while driving down the road. As a bonus, I already know most of the words so it's easy to sing along to. Even my wife, who hasn't liked anything by Neil Young since Rust Never Sleeps, is spending a lot of time with this album.<br /><br />I do have a question, however. I've searched high and low, but I have no idea what the portals are in the line \\"She'll take us to the portals\\" in Jesus' Chariot. It sounds like something almost mystical. I even think I want to go to those portals. But I also have a feeling that maybe Neil Young & Crazy Horse have already transported me there with this powerful, inspiring, and soul-rousing new album.>I do have a question, however.

B005T87QCI|5.0|it is so easy don't believe what anybody says about this app you have to have it.  I started today and I already have all of the robots unlocked.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is getting better and better by the book.<br /><br />In this part we will see the love story within the book sidetracked with the actual goal of the series. The author wishes to give the reader a message I think. You will have to have read part three as well to figure this message out. I also think that young adults will have difficulty with getting this message. I find it thus difficult why this book is rated as a young adult book.<br /><br />I will not spoil the book for you here but expect some unexpected plot twists.<br /><br />I enjoyed the whole series. Worth the purchase.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is a solid, fun game. A good way to spend a few minutes of downtime. The controls are responsive and the objectives give the game a fairly high replay value.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|fun game with challenging levels and tons of cool stuff<br />very fun game I do recommend it and Daniel loves jenn
B0086700CM|5.0|&quot;Why is everyone obsessed with this game?!&quot; That's what I thought when my newsfeed was littered with high score achievements of friends. It sounds pointless. Well, sometimes the best things are the simple things. This game is wildly addictive and I find myself playing for hours. Why? No idea. It's just plain fun :)
0670022705|4.0|Creating a history of the world as conveyed through only 100 objects is no small task.  Neil MacGregor set out to communicate how history, culture, language, and business have been impacted by 100 objects, and he has, for the most part, succeeded.  With items ranging from an early writing tablet from Iraq to a credit card, and a shadow puppet from Indonesia to the Sutton Hoo helmet, MacGregor has a vast array of objects which are able to convey so much of what makes us human.  As the Director of the British Museum, MacGregor has a wealth of knowledge, and that, I believe, is the only downfall of this book.  With maps, an extensive bibliography, and over 600 pages of information, it is a bit overwhelming for the average reader.  Because it is broken down by object, it is possible to jump from object to object, and thus from era to era, but it is a bit challenging to read through the book from cover to cover without feeling a bit overwhelmed.<br />Each item is highlighted in a single photograph, and while the images are beautiful, the paper on which the book is printed is not glossy as I had anticipated, and therefore, leaves the images occasionally looking dull or lackluster.  While the history that is interwoven is fascinating, and MacGregor provides a wealth of information to readers, this is not a visual history - this is a text-heavy book.  There is so much information and overall this book is vast in its expanse.  I recommend it, but not for people trying to connect to history visually. (shelfishness.blog.com)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Trilogy Fifty Shades is spell binding and sexually riveting. I could not put down the e-books until I finished this 3rd book. From the first trilogy/book, even an experienced sexually active person, begins to discover new information and begins to subconsciously explore own sexuality!!!! An exhilarating adult reading. Prepare to shower after reading. Fifty Shades of Grey is worth every dollar paid for it. I thoroughly enjoyed reading and re-reading all three books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can understand where other people are coming from in terms of the repetitiveness of the book, elements such as Ana biting her bottom lip, Christian cocking his head to the side, Ana's inner godness etc, but I actually enjoyed the constant references. I found it ironic that people don't believe that a girl could come to her age of 22 without masturbating, yet they don't find the rest of the book as unbelievable. It is a story, and that's all it's meant to be! Hence why we have a billionaire and a girl who's never had a boyfriend before or gone beyond first base falling in love.<br /><br />I personally really enjoyed the book! Christian is just so domineering and lost, it's very emotional to see his struggles as he tries to protect Ana all the time, by trying to control every aspect of her life. It has great character development as we see a lot of the struggles that both Ana and Christian face. Christian is overbearing, overprotective and suffocating, not to mention his style of sex where as Ana is 22, and very carefree with not much to worry about and has never engaged in any sexual behaviour. E.L James does a good job portraying the differences in both characters and how they come together or come apart in this book.<br /><br />The book wasn't just about sex, although that covers a majority of the book, but it also deals with relationships. Plus I think it's adorable that Ana names him her fifty shades.
B005LAIGP0|4.0|I really enjoyed The Woman in Black. It didn't use excessive gore or violence to scare me. Instead, The Woman in Black builds tension through creepy imagery and mixes it with jump-out scares. The scares are so well balanced! There is a segment in the film that will have scare after scare. The creepy atmosphere was also great. Acting was fine and so was the music. The only problem I had was the predictable third act/ending; I felt like I had seen it done many times before.<br /><br />Overall, this spooky film is highly recommended.
B00834R580|5.0|I'm going to have to disagree with the negative reviews, and say that I thought this episode was an amazing reinterpretation of Doyle's, The Hound of the Baskervilles. This was my favorite of the Sherlock books, so I was skeptical. I thought it was not only updated well, but was suspenseful and scary at times- the same feeling I had when I first read the book as a kid- I definitely recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book, almost as much as the first one. It's a book I would definitely recommend to EVERYONE!!  It has action, love, hate, and passion all in one. I hope to see more from this author.
B004FOA84A|5.0|this app is so cool u have to find your long lost grandpa that has dissapers. I love these kinds apps.I hope that every body will get this app and rate it a good review.

B0009P42S2|4.0|If you're reading this review, you have probably read others and know the plot and most things about this movie. So let me just zero in on my personal experience: I loved the animation, especially with all the mechanical parts moving in every direction, but thought the movie was a bit longer than it needed to be. The story line could have been shorter, and more things explained about the relationship between father and son. Character development was a bit lacking (I still don't really know who the good guy was, or if there even was a bad guy, and the girl who was so mean and stupid at the beginning never really redeemed herself). That being said, if you like the genre, it is pretty cool. Don't expect historical accuracy either, as there are many anachronistic elements.
1469984202|5.0|I stumbled on Wool by accident and didn't realize at the time that it was a short story... So the end caught me off guard and It took me several minutes to wrap my head around what had just happened. Once my brain caught up the first thing I did was to log on and purchase the Wool omnibus.<br /><br />Very well written, with engaging characters and a thought provoking story. I expect to add this to the list of books I re-read every few years.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next installment!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We love this story line, the production values, and the actors playing the parts.  We can't wait for season 3 and want to be notified when its available.  We're already watching seasons one and two for the second time.  Julian Fellowes-keep up the good work!
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl is the story of married couple Nick and Amy Dunne who had a fairly tale love that went terribly wrong and the revenge that follows. It's dark and sometimes very disturbing especially when Amy angrily and graphically refers to sexual situations (not the romantic kind) and when her bitterness & desperation escalates.<br /><br />The too long story starts out painfully slow with the two main characters each discussing their seemingly mundane lives beginning with their first meeting and the expectations they had. Once the initial crime is committed (as described in the Amazon Book description) the story takes on steam providing many twists, as well as, suspense, disbelief and absolute horror. This book gave me chills!<br /><br />Apparently the ending is highly debatable. I thought it was absolutely frightening. I think everyone involved got what they deserved.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|this was the best one yet i cant until the next one come out.the fight scenes were the best so far.
B000063UR2|1.0|Very disappointing, did not like the director's cut and Jerry Goldsmith's score, I preferred the original Tangerine Dream Score, much more feeling, and brought out the mystical side, darkness and beauty of movie.  The new version was too much like Peter Pan, I could not get thru the first part of the movie, without asking why I spent my money on this new version.  Sometimes it's better to let things stay the way they are, I would not recommend this version to anyone, especially those who have seen the original.  Again, very disappointing!!
0385738773|5.0|*WARNING: MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />...<br />DESPITE the reviews of 'a good book, but not up to par with the previous two books,' I stand firmly resolved that this is a WONDERFUL book that brings the trilogy to a wonderful, superb end.  Like The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials,this book has rising action (escaping from the compound), returning to the compound to save his friends and the attack by his so-called friends (they want his brain?!  That's not creepy at all!), and an ending that was not expected (at last, Thomas recognizes who he loves).<br />What is so unique abotu this book, unlike many other trilogies, is some things are not answered.  Thomas does not know the answers to everything, but that is alright.  The reader knows a little more, but we still have a seed of 'what happened?'  Thus, the new book (coming in August 2012) The Kill Order.<br />We know enough to make the book a wonderful read:<br />* Sun flares destroyed much of the ecosystem of the earth, making weather patterns unpredictable, large wastelands of nothing, and people wondering if things could get worse.<br />* As a means of fighting overpopulation (possibly due to lack of water? The reason in unknown...), governments released a disease known as The Flare.<br />* People with the Flare went crazy; basically, it took away what made them human.<br />* WICKED was created by the governments that remained to find a cure for the illness.  All the government's resources were put into this program, instead of protecting those who had not yet gotten the Flare.<br />* Thomas, Teresa, Aris, and Rebecca (among others) helped plan the trials. These would test many human emotion: trust, teamwork, persistence, strength, courage, betrayal...the list went on.<br />* For the trials to work, all participants had to have their brains 'cleared.' It would be impossible to test a person's reactions to some type of event if they knew they were being tested.<br />*And so The Maze Runner begins...<br /><br />As I said, this book is a wonderful read.  Thomas finally gets a girl that he will love, he is surrounded by people who will fight to keep themselves and the human race alive, and the story ends well.  Part of the uniqueness of this story is the not knowing.  We have enough information to fill in the holes and the story becomes a whole new world.  Enjoy!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Great product! Was just what we needed. Easy to clean and is made very durable!! Excellent quality!! Would Highly recommend!

B005L38QK2|5.0|I have enjoyed using the Diablo III Steel Series Mouse. Slick, nice design, it fits the hand ergonomically. The response is great, very precise. I have only two complaints: First, it gets stained very easily, specially near buttons. Second, the additional buttons are mapped like a keyboard, so you *need* to use the provider software to work with games. It did worked flawlessly with Diablo 3, Lord of the Rings Online, and all games I've tried.
1613820895|5.0|Chesterton, using only powerful logic and pleasant prose (not the \\"it's written in such corner of the Bible\\" kind of argument or appealing to emotion through images such as \\"the blood Christ was spilled because of your sins\\") makes Christianity intellectually defensible even in our days. This book is a must-read for anyone interested enough to be reading this review.
0792162803|5.0|Great movie to own because it has two halarious actors in it hehe...The product was brand new and still had wrapping on it!  Love it and fast shipping as well :)  Thanks much seller! I have been looking for this movie everywhere, only place you can find it is online and here it is a brand new one :)
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game with great graphics and very nice design. very addictive. I really enjoy the options in the gameplay. I would recommend to others
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was my best friend for three days and I have a feeling we will reunite sooner than later.  I felt myself gravitate towards Travis more than any other hero I have read to date.  Regardless of the fact that BD was written from Abby's POV (our heroine), I connected with Travis in a way that held me and wouldn't let me go. I was amazed at how much I felt his love and his pain even throughout the book.  I read the last chapter through tears of pure joy (and sadness for the fact that BD was over).  Reading about the changes in Abby and Travis' relationship kept me emotionally charged throughout the entire book.  Love and suspense dominated this book from start to finish. I highly recommend you read it and stay clear of any tattoo parlors because I assure you, you will want one - Anything to connect with Abby and Travis again. You will be hooked. Promise.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I kept hearing all the hype about this book and was unsure about it. I finished this book in one day. It consumed me and I didn't want to do anything else. Very well written!!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Works like it says it will.  I'm very happy with it. Would recommend to anyone trying to keep on top of bill paying.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Azada is one of my favorite games and the Android Version does not disappoint!  I definitely. would recommend this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book - I haven't read in ages, but received a kindle as a gift and downloaded the Hunger Games.  Price was right and easy to purchase by downloading.  Kindle is so much more convenient than the old paperbacks that I used to buy - lightweight and easy to read.  Great experience.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is UN-PUT-DOWNABLE. Set aside a day or two so that you don't have to tear yourself away to tend to anyone or anything. I don't read much fiction anymore because I'm an English teacher and I notice all the plot devices, character motivations, etc.  Not with this book. I was too busy reading to even care about all that.<br /><br />I won't go into any kind of \\"book report\\" reviews because I really hate those. I don't need any spoilers or story lines. But, I have to mention what I loved about how this author wrote and that is that the characters are speaking to the reader. They are talking to you and that's what pulls you in. You know these characters very well by the end of the book.<br /><br />As reviewer K. Cade wrote:  STOP reading reviews...get this, read it....don't ruin it for yourself by reading too much about it. Here's what you do need to know...if you can answer yes to any of these...then read it.<br /><br />1. love good writing?<br />2. love characters that are real?<br />3. love realistic suspense whereby you do not have to suspend disbelief to buy the story/plot line?<br />4. ever been confused by your spouse or significant other?<br /><br />SOLD<br /><br />.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|The review before this one is obviously written by someone who doesn't appreciate true storytelling nor the impact of raw emotion and admiration for an animal. Just because a movie makes you emotional does NOT make it a movie not worth seeing. Nowhere on the Amazon description of this film does it say it's a happy-go-lucky film with a fairytale ending. It's powerful and likely to bring you to tears. That's exactly what it did. If a movie brings you to tears, then it's obviously done its job flawlessly. You cannot fault a film for its ability to draw raw emotion out into the open. There's nothing wrong with watching the usual \\"aliens try to blow up the world\\" action films with paper thin plot development either. They're fun, they're simple, you have a good time watching them. That doesn't make them better or more worthy of your attention than a movie like Hachi.<br /><br />I've been a pet owner for nearly 30 years and no such movie has made even a guy like myself cry as much as I did when I watched the end of Hachi. Richard Gere plays an incredible role in this film and I really couldn't have imagined anyone more perfect for the part. As one other reviewer said before me, the focus really isn't on Richard Gere or his wife/daughter and their family. They all take a backseat to the deepness and loyalty of the relationship between a basically simple, but well educated man and his instant connection with an Akita. From the moment Hachi enters his life at the train station, the two form an inseparable bond that lasts long after Gere is gone. It's an amazingly powerful story that illustrates the undying devotion and loyalty a dog can have to his master. Obviously the most heart-wrenching scenes in the film occur at the very end when you realize that Hachi has spent the majority of his life living at a train station eagerly awaiting the return of Gere's character and is concerned with little to practically nothing else.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone else, but the movie strangely made me feel quite resentful towards Joan Allen's character, basically because she resented the relationship between her husband and Hachi. That seemed a bit overdone in my opinion. Also the whole \\"moving away following her husband's death\\" and the half-hearted attempts of their daugher and her husband to take Hachi in...it just leaves you with a rather bitter taste in your mouth. However again, the point of the film was to really illustrate the power behind the bond between Hachi and Gere. Everything else sort of fails in comparison. Perhaps the most tear jerking scene in the film is the couple minutes before the end credits where you're lead to believe Hachi is having one of his final dreams while sleeping on the tracks. I like to think of it as the soul of his departed master coming to collect him as they both reunite in the afterlife.<br /><br />Hachi is obviously not going to appeal to everyone, but it's probably the most emotional \\"animal\\" film I think I've ever seen. It doesn't have the earlier comedy routines that a movie like Marley & Me had, but that makes it softer and more emotional, and I even cried at the end of Marley & Me as well given that I've been through it with my own dogs.<br /><br />Just thinking about Hachi makes my eyes a bit glisteny and VERY few movies draw me to tears. That tells me that although it has incredibly sad moments, the movie was extremely powerful with an amazing message. The time one spends with their pet is a gift. You can learn things from that relationship that you may never learn from the relationship with another person. There's always some facade of PCness or veil of phoniness in human relationships (even in the purest sense) you often see in the movies and even in reality. With a dog like Hachi, there was no pretense. It's simply instinct, loyalty, and raw emotion. I don't think you could get much purer than that with respect to love and having an emotional bond like that. Hachi will forever remain one ofmy favorite films even though I expect it to bring me to tears at the end. It's an inevitable reward from watching the film.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The puzzles were nice to solve.  The scenery was beautiful.  The story line was a little undeveloped,  but I play more for the puzzles.  Didn't feel like I solved this too fast like some others.  I do recommend this game.

B008578PMU|1.0|I am SO glad I didn't go to the theater and watch this piece of crap movie.  What a slap in the face it is to not only the original Tuskegee Airmen who risked their lives fighting, but to the people of Alabama.  The story line was impossible to follow.  At no time did it give any of the history behind the \\"experiment\\" that was conducted.  The dialogue was pathetic.  The worst acting I've seen by Cuba and Terrence.<br /><br />George Lucas needs his butt kicked and this so called director would do better directing Sesame Street in Pakistan.  The air scenes were good but that's about it.  Keep your money in your pocket.

0765316994|3.0|Not really as great as I was led to believe reading earlier reviews. And no, I am not missing any nuance or subtlety (Scalzi is anything but subtle). Yes, its very meta, and yes, there is some of the usual humor and dialogue to be expected of a Scalzi book...but I'm really starting to think the author is a one trick pony.<br /><br />Old Mans War was great. A must read scifi novel. The sequel was also very good. The third one...pretty damn good but not quite as good. Agent to the Stars, the book about the \\"sheep\\", etc etc...Does this author have another OMW up his sleeve? We need something a little more substantial, Mr. Scalzi. This stuff is starting to seem lazy...

141690977X|4.0|This book is spot on on anlyzing men. Well, most men are hunters and they like... we all know what they like, don't we? To be honest, having read the book, I really don't believe in long term commitments with men any more. One day he's into you (especially before sex) another day he's out of your frame (before:) Well, you can call these creatures MEN.. And thinking of it, women still want them to commit. Commitments and men are two separate things. ..Men cannot commit period. Why??? Because they are just not so much into you in any case..
B0080CL0HM|3.0|The title of the review pretty much sums it up.  It's often difficult with movies like these to write reviews.  Unfortunately, I find myself separating it into separate pieces and averaging my rating between the acting versus the quality of the story.  I can easily give a five star thumbs up for the superb acting, setting, costumes, etc.  However, the story, makes me moan, frankly, and I cautiously hand over one star.  In the end, we're left with three.<br /><br />Let's face it, Duroy is not a character you really fall in love with. Oh, yes, he's attractive, sexy, dreamy-eyed, able to seduce women with a single sly grin, and is everything you want in bed from a tender lover to a rough aggressive bad boy.  You understand the following about the man, besides his inability to keep his manhood in check, that he grew up poor, isn't very bright, and isn't respected by other men.  You quickly learn as well that he doesn't possess much of a conscience or a heart, and uses the lives of others for his own gain.  I guess that's where the character type of \\"scoundrel\\" enters in Bel Ami.<br /><br />The one thing that struck me about the movie was the entire time you're watching it, you are really not privy to the inward thoughts of Duroy and his motivations.  You watch his dark brooding, drunken binges, his narrowing gaze, and outbursts of anger and make your own conclusion as to what makes him tick as a man.  Besides being a morally loose rake, with no conscience bedding three women at once, he comes across as a relatively ignorant and despised man in his social circle.<br /><br />Finally, at the end of the movie, you are suddenly given a glimpse into the deep musings and inward workings of his dark heart. It's here that he reveals it's not enough to be loved. He doesn't want to scrape through life, like his father in poverty while praying for a better life in the next world.  There is no next world.  We rot in the grave.  Better to grab it in the here and now rather than to hope for something that will never come.  Of course, as a scoundrel, that's the only way he knows how to gain what he wants in life. His next step is to marry a woman he doesn't love (and I seriously doubt the man has the capacity or ability to love), so he can live rich.  I probably should take lessons from this sod how to make male characters in my next book so despicable.<br /><br />Well, like millions of Parisians of that day, he probably would have contracted syphilis and died an early death never able to enjoy his gain.  Wealth he would have obtained, but no doubt respect and status never arrived alongside.<br /><br />In any event, the movie is a mixed bag because of the story and unlovable character you really don't want to romp in the sack with at all.pe for something that will never come.

1439127700|5.0|Great read and can highly recommend for those hunting for a good present for a political junkie.  Shame the only 1 star reviews were for reasons other than the writing.  This certainly deserves a 5 star rating based on a unique look at how the former and sitting presidents treated each other.  Lots of detail not found in other bios of these men.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is very adventurous and teaches the human mind to use its reflects in a more effective manner. This is a great game to play to keep anyone busy when you have nothing to do. On a scale of one to ten i would rate this game a ten.

0596007124|2.0|If you're a java man-child with ADD, looking to read a pretty cartoon book with plenty of personified design patterns, this book is for you!<br /><br />Seriously, this book gives me a headache. At the end of one of the first chapters, there is a stupid crossword puzzle with buzz words from the chapter. If you really hate the usual programming book, and need this sort of thing to stay interested, this book is definitely for you, but if you are that sort of person, I also wouldn't recommend programming.<br /><br />To it's credit, it does have a lot of detailed design patterns, but there was no way I could sit through reading this. If you just did \\"Hello World\\" in java, then you might use this to kick-start your programming, but I could not see anyone else reading this.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you enjoy reading romance novels, you'll probably enjoy this trilogy. Obviously not everything in the book is real or even believable, but it's not meant to be. These types of books are written to get you caught up in the fantasy, and EL James does that very well. If you can separate the hype (pro-feminist/anti-feminist/sexist/etc...) from your own reading experience, you'll find that this is a love story with well developed characters in a variety of interesting situations. Book One was mostly about the sex, Book Two developed the story line and Book Three was the 'happy ever after' wrap up. They three books do NOT all take place in bed - there is an actual story here and I enjoyed it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am a looooong time Rush fan and have NEVER review anything but leave it to Rush to inspire me to do something new. The message in this album is one that older Rush fans will get right away...no how matter how many bad things have happened to you, keep choosing to live. Who else could write that but Neil (world's greatest drummer)? Who else could sing that but Geddy (world's greatest basist)? Who else could put that to music but Rush? This is Alex's (world's greatest guitarist) best album.<br /><br />The band is vindicated and now without a doubt Rush fans are vindicated not that we did not know that already. All good things get better with age and Rush is one of those.<br /><br />Finally, to see that for yourself listen to Animate, a pinnacle song for Rush and one I think Neil said is the hardest to play, after listening to this album and you can see for yourself how the band has become better. 2112 and this album are bookends to a collection that has sooo many great short stories in between.<br /><br />Hall of Fame...Rush is too good for you. If you ask Rush to join I hope they \\"...turn their back and walk away...\\"<br /><br />SEE YOU ON TOUR!!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|You know it is interesting that so many complain about the grammar or misspelled words. It was not even remotely close to lots of books out there.  It happens in books whether they are published books or e-books. Seems to be the nature of the beast.  It is the story line that is important here to me.  I loved it.  Loved how the idea of \\"UNCONDITIONAL LOVE\\" can help us through so much in life.  It is true.  I enjoyed the emails between Christian and Anastasia, especially the signature changes.  Interesting in this day and age how some people find it so much easier to communicate behind a computer screen or in text messages rather than face to face.  However the key is that they do communicate to the best of their ability and that it improves over time.  The \\"KINKY &%^*@8%\\" in the book is just an added bonus for some.<br /><br />Bottom line I really really enjoyed this Trilogy of books by E. L James

B006J420UE|4.0|This little beast certainly is worth ever penny. The processor is quite fast, and having 4 cores makes it a pretty good gaming processor. This processor would make a great HTPC. It stays cool, and the integrated graphics is great for movies. The only problem is that the integrated graphics are not really all that great for gaming. It can play low-intensity games well (like Minecraft, or older Windows 98 games), but modern games (Borderlands 2, specifically) only get about 20FPS on low settings. This is easily remedied by getting a PCIe video card, but then you may as well grab a better FX or Phenom CPU, too.

0345803485|1.0|I don't know why I did it. I discarded my usual sense of judgement and bought this ridiculous piece of writing. I refuse to call it a book. And my apologies to all the Harlequin writers I giggled at because I thought their books were silly. I even tried to convince myself it'll get better and dragged onto Chapter 15. I just can't do it anymore!!! It is so BORING! The heroine makes me want to shake her and pour a bucket of arctic water on her to make her bearable. If she rolled her eyeballs as much as she did, they would fall off and if she bit her lip anymore it would tear off. Even a 19th century 21yr old would be less archaic than the heroine. I don't even know where to start with the hero, he's a young self-made \\"billionaire\\" that finds a boring shallow empty woman as the most fascinating person he ever met and she is so fantastic to this man that you can see she will \\"save\\" him from a past that made him twisted. Hah!!! I've read newspaper articles on valentines days that had more fizz. The whole BDSM thing is a joke. I found myself reading the torturous 15 chapters with probably less heat and enjoyment than I felt when looking at last night's dinner menu at a restaurant... at least the menu had something I wanted and enjoyed.<br /><br />Is it too much ask for these days, that someone with at least a 6th graders intelligence or writing skills for that matter be the author of a bestseller?? The book is not witty, not even close to original and not passionate at all. The weak and unbelievable characters along with a storyline, that has been ripped off from anywhere between 'Pretty Woman' to the lowliest Harlequin, could have been excused if the writing had some style or flair. But then again, if the writing had either of those. I would be calling this a book and not a ridiculous piece of writing. Next time before I buy a bestseller I will at least look at the reviews. My poor brain cells that I may have lost forever, please try and forget the pain I put you through.

B003UPPO2G|5.0|When the Bee Gees got on stage together, the results were magic.  Their perfect harmony, their hits that spanned the decades, and their obvious love for each other made them a one-of-a-kind group.  Of course, they perform their classic dance music from the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" years.  But, the Bee Gees also sing their songs from the '60's such as \\"Massachusetts,\\" \\"To Love Somebody,\\" and \\"Words.\\"  Some of the finest moments of the concert are when the band takes a break while the brothers gather around one microphone and sing unplugged versions of several songs.  They also sing songs that (when this concert was done in 1997) were new...showing that their songwriting talents had not diminished at all.  Speaking of the Bee Gees' songwriting, it is great to hear them perform songs which they wrote but became hits for other people, such as \\"Islands in the Stream,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"Grease.\\"<br />The Bee Gees said that \\"How Deep is Your Love\\" was a particular favorite of theirs, and as they perform that song, they show video of the brothers with their wives and children in the background.  That is touching.  The other touching moment is their tribute to youngest brother Andy, who died when he was only 30.<br />The interview included on the DVD is very interesting.<br />Of course, this concert is especially poignant now, knowing that only one Gibb brother remains.  Six years after this concert, Maurice would pass away suddenly at only 53, and nine years after that, his twin Robin would be gone at the age of 62.  How very sad for oldest brother Barry and the rest of the Gibb family.  But the music of the Bee Gees will live on.

Australian publisher - HarperCollins - has ceased publishing her books?
B007K3JCAE|5.0|As many other reviewers have already covered this fun film, I'm going to limit my review to the part played by Noomi Rapace. She soared in the \\"Dragon\\" trilogy and I was wondering what Ms. Rapace would bring to this film. Her striking beauty for a start and her perfect casting as Sim the gypsy girl. She helps the film bounce and tumble along playing well off Robert Downey Jr. who is quickly becoming a Holmes redefined.<br />The true holder of the best Holmes will remain for all time with the late Jeremy Brett but were Brett still alive, he'd have had great fun viewing this, \\"New\\" Holmes and would have, no doubt, been in a cameo role suited to his style and this adaptation.<br />So, more Holmes and more Noomi Rapace.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The President's Club offers the average reader all that one needs for an enjoyable reading experience - significant history, leadership challenges, family drama, and fascinating anecdotes about famous men and women.  I was captured from the first page.  The book is fun and easy to read while you learn something about the President's who have shaped our lives as adults, their unique relationships, and the events that have shaped the world we know and sometimes fear.  It's superlative!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Still riding high on the surprise success of \\"Time Out of Mind\\" some three and a half years after its release, Dylan continued his comeback with 2001's \\"Love and Theft,\\" a glowing tribute to music's past that still possesses a distinct modern edge. Dylan takes on the guises of Sinatra, Jolson, Robert Johnson and several other archetypes of early 20th century song with a style that is distinctly Dylan: wily, witty and utterly unpredictable.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the riveting \\"Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.\\" With a sly, venomous Dylan vocal and a pulsating arrangements that jumps around like a rabid jackal trying to bust loose of his chains, it gets the record off to a gripping start that doesn't let off. The second track, \\"Mississippi,\\" is maybe the best Dylan song of the last 25 years, a beautifully bittersweet reflection on past regrets and last chances.<br /><br />The rest of the record upholds the quality of these first two tracks beautifully. Among the cream of the crop are the cryptic old age musings of \\"Floater,\\" the spooky, apocalyptic \\"High Water,\\" the wild \\"Honest With Me,\\" the charming, Chaplin-esque \\"Po' Boy,\\" (the sweetest, happiest sounding Dylan song since 1970), and the moody closer, \\"Sugar Baby.\\" \\"Bye and Bye\\" is a lightweight but still substantial numbers about the joys of newfound love late in the game, while \\"Moonlight\\" is alternatively sweet and sinister.  Finally, \\"Lonesome Day Blues\\" is an absolute monster with Dylan snarling away like a man possessed. Dylan produced the record on his own, under the pseudonym Jack Frost, and he gives the song the punch and edge they need.<br /><br />\\"Love and Theft\\" is an absolute gem and an essential Dylan purchase.
B0061TQBRK|3.0|Ok, so I had just received my Lacuna Coil album.  There isn't a whole lot I wanted to rate on it.  I say the album has a good collection of tracks. But the reason why I made this rating, was because when I checked the album file and there was only 10 tracks on my CD which is really a disappointment.  On the product details it says there's 12 tracks on the CD as well as on the CD case.  So my question is,where are the last 2 songs. Fire and My Spirit were both missing.  I would ofgave this review a 4 out of 5 stars, but due to the lack of the last 2 tracks which I'll now have 2 spend another $2 to download the rest of the album.  I feel like I was ripped of on that note.  Now I'm afraid to take a chance on the new Spineshank album coming out this year.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0061TQBRK Dark Adrenaline]]

When you take an emotional injured child and that child carries all of the emotional scares with them to adulthood you have an adult who never experience anything other than pain. Then you bring a person whose life was the total opposite and they see that life is not always painful. There's a light at the end of the tunnel and the scares slowly heal.

B00006LLOG|4.0|There's an old saying that media exec's have been trotting around for decades, something along the lines of \\"any publicity's good publicity\\". I mention this following all of the negative responses 2011's Lulu the now infamous collabaration between Lou Reed and Thrash Metal demigods Metallica recieved last year. It's tempting to think the backlash was exactly what Lou had in mind, considering he's not enjoyed attention this widespread since the release of his 1989 opus \\"New York\\".<br /><br />If my theory is correct, it's interesting to remember there was once a time back in the early 70's, where Lou didn't have to resort to absurd gimmicks to get people listening (Metal Machine Music aside). He just hooked up with the most popular rock musician at the time David bowie (you might of heard of him ) who opted to produce \\"Transformer\\" purely on the strength of his groundbreaking work with the Velvet Underground. Lou took the oppurtunity to release a great record that rightfully earned him a new audience for his tales of NYC debauchery.<br /><br />The Albums two obvious highlights \\"Perfect Day\\" seen by some to be Reed's romantacization of his own heroin addiction and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" a more overt tale of gender bending prostitution hardly need any elaboration. These two songs are probably known by everybody with only a passing interest in rock music never mind Lou Reed and thats not because they've been arbitrarily over played since their release 40 years ago, they have effortlessly stood the test of time quite simply because they're brilliant songs. If they were the only higlights on Transformer than it would probably still be worth owning, fortunately there's also \\"Vicious\\" a rollicking opener, with an engaging pulse and sassy attitude that bears a passing resemblance to the VU classic \\"Sweet Jane\\". \\"Satelelite of Love\\" is another glam rock gem and still a popular favourite with it's alluringly unique melody and memorable coda of backing vocals courtesy of Mr Bowie.<br /><br />The album slightly falls short of masterpiece status for me though, mainly because of the more insouciant moments throughout it's 37 minutes. Like \\"Make Up\\" which is delightfully understated yet a touch too whimsical and \\"Goodnight Ladies\\" suffers from a similar problem despite it's charmingly vaudevillian New orleans instrumentation. It's pedantic to focus on some of the minor pitfalls on here though, as everything else sounds great including the two bonus tracks that come with this particular release of the album. If you don't yet have this in your collection you really should not only because it's massively influentual it's also one of the best collections of rock and roll songs you're likely to listen to.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've had Clockwork Angels now for a week and if it were possible to wear out a CD my copy might need replacing soon...<br /><br />Look, I'm not a music critic and I'm not going to give an overblown analysis of Clockwork Angels track by track.  It's all so subjective anyway...  What I cannot believe are the reviews that claim that Rush is sloppy, phoned this one in, or that they have collectively or individually lost the ability or desire to play at the highest levels.  All three charges (and similar ones) are patently and provably false, so I'm left to conclude that those making them are trolls.  It's one thing to not care for the music, but something else entirely to beclown yourself by making obviously false statements.<br /><br />I'm a long time Rush fan who has bought every one of their studio albums since Moving Pictures as soon as I could get my hands on them.  There have been a few disappointments (I'm looking at you Hold Your Fire and Vapor Trails...) over the years, but even they have their gems.  However, I've always had to listen at least three or four times to the latest offering before I could get past the \\"differentness\\" and start appreciating what was there.  To me this isn't a bug, it's a feature of Rush; it's what makes being a Rush fan a rewarding experience.  It's also what keeps Rush relevant when other bands have long since lapsed into self parody or passed into the dustbin of history.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is another stellar release from Rush.  Standout tracks include Caravan, Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, Carnies...oh heck, the only semi-weak tracks IMO are Halo Effect and BU2B2, and those are certainly listenable.  If pressed I might pick Headlong Flight as my favorite, but that's a really tough call.<br /><br />If you have ever been a Rush fan, do yourself a favor; pick up Clockwork Angels and give it at least four listens all the way through, by the third time I think you'll agree with me: this is an outstanding album.
B001UV4XIS|3.0|Finally, after seven books and eight movies, the richest women in England ends her series and stops slaming Harry.  Her constant sadistic attacks end with Harry safe from evil.  At least it seems that way.  A great many of Harry's friends and supporters were destroyed in this series but in the end he is allowed to lead as norman a life as a wizard can live.  Our dvd copy skips during the introduction and is defective but since we can get it to work it isn't worth the effort to return it to Amazon.

B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Great idea. BUT this game is exactly like all the others from this maker, just another plot. With the amount of money put into this game and others by Nevosoft you'd think their creativity team would be a bit stronger. I wont buy from them again.<br />Note to Nevo : If there is no zoom you need some seriously upgraded graphics. The game is extremely frustrating.
1410430103|4.0|There are sixteen Jack Reacher novels, but I decided to start with Vol. 1, the one that started it all. Lee Child had been on my list of authors to try and I'm happy to say I will soon add Vol. 2, Die Trying, to my reading list.<br /><br />I enjoyed the unique way this story began, with Reacher being arrested for murder and then introducing himself to the reader through his interactions with the police who, at least initially, wish he were guilty. Reacher starts the investigation from the suspect side of the equation, and then gradually moves to the private investigator side. It was an interesting and enjoyable twist of roles.<br /><br />I also enjoyed that Jack Reacher was not always correct in the assumptions he made about the bad guys and what the bad guys were doing. His imperfections in analysis contributed to the tension and suspense.<br /><br />There is violence in this story, but nothing I would consider usury. It is a story about violent people protecting their interests and how a trained individual would deal with violent people. In fact, I enjoyed the realism of Jack Reacher's methods - something that is often misrepresented in the movies and on TV when it is incorrectly suggested there is an unwritten code of chivalry inherent between the good guys and bad guys. There is no chivalry in the real world, and Reacher plays his part true to reality.<br /><br />I enjoyed the characters, especially the secondary ones for they seemed to have more personality.<br /><br />The only thing that bothered me was the lack of a response from the Treasury Department. They lost two of their agents, one of which was a living legend, and there isn't even a phone call to ask what might have happened. While this lack of authenticity bothered me more than a few times, it didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />I gave it 4-stars and would recommend it to anyone who would enjoy a whose-doing-it and what-are-they-doing type of story, with a rough-at-the-edges ex-military police hero, and with enough tension and violence to keep you turning the pages.
0061692042|5.0|Points North<br />`Canada,' by Richard Ford<br />By ANDRE DUBUS III<br />Published: June 7, 2012<br /><br />Willa Cather once wrote that \\"a creative writer can do his best only with what lies within the range and character of his deepest sympathies.\\" By that measure, and any other, Richard Ford is doing his very best in his extraordinary new novel, \\"Canada,\\" his first book since \\"The Lay of the Land\\" six years ago. Here, Ford is clearly writing within the range and character of his deepest sympathies -- in this case, from the point of view of an abandoned 15-year-old boy -- and he's doing it with a level of linguistic mastery that is rivaled by few, if any, in American letters today.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" opens in 1960 in Great Falls, Mont., a frontier town Ford has written about before, most notably in his affecting and largely underrated 1990 novel \\"Wildlife,\\" which begins with this: \\"In the fall of 1960, when I was 16 and my father was for a time not working, my mother met a man named Warren Miller and fell in love with him.\\" All that follows is told from the point of view of Joe Brinson, an older narrator looking back on the 16-year-old boy he'd been when the fragile equilibrium at his family's center was lost. This is an engaging voice: earnest without being morose; honest without being exhibitionistic; understated, humble and wise from years of trusting in questions more than in answers. But this voice, as successful as it is, pales in comparison to that of Dell Parsons, the protagonist of \\"Canada,\\" another older narrator looking back on when his life, too, went astray in 1960 in Great Falls, Mont. Here are its opening lines: \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later. The robbery is the more important part, since it served to set my and my sister's lives on the courses they eventually followed. Nothing would make complete sense without that being told first.\\"<br /><br />On a purely plot-hungry basis,turning the page seems the only thing to do, but -- as is so often the case with the fiction of Richard Ford -- what actually happens in the story feels secondary, or at best equal, to the language itself. In the hands of a lesser writer, this can create problems: the prose begins to feel self-indulgent, written not to illuminate any truths but to please the writer, and in the process, story itself is lost and the reader is left behind. But \\"Canada\\" is blessed with two essential strengths in equal measure -- a mesmerizing story driven by authentic and fully realized characters, and a prose style so accomplished it is tempting to read each sentence two or three times before being pulled to the next.<br /><br />The novel begins with the Parsons family moving to Great Falls in 1956, but the trouble begins in the spring of 1960 when Dell's father, Bev Parsons, leaves the Air Force at age 37. Bev sees Great Falls \\"as a place where he thought he could get ahead -- even without a social life. He said he hoped to join the Masons.\\"<br /><br />What he joins instead is a long line of men through the ages who are trying to find out just where they belong. He takes work as a new-car salesman, then a used-car salesman, then a real estate agent selling ranch land and farms, \\"something he admitted he knew nothing about but was signed up to take a course on in the basement of the Y.M.C.A.\\" Around this time Bev starts spearheading the local trade in stolen beef, which ultimately leads to the bank robbery we learn of in the first paragraph, a calamitous event that leads us ever deeper into the life of Dell Parsons: twin brother of Berner, son of Neeva Kamper, a boy interested in chess and keeping bees who is very much looking forward to starting high school in the fall. The Nixon and Kennedy debates are not far off, and the only real shadow here is that Dell and Berner and their mother don't feel they really belong in this town. That, and the fact that the twins can read the emotionalweather in their small house.<br /><br />\\"My sister and I could easily see why my mother would've been attracted to Bev Parsons: big, plank shouldered, talkative, funny, forever wanting to please anybody who came in range. But it was never completely obvious why he would take an interest in her -- tiny (barely five feet), inward and shy, alienated, artistic, pretty only when she smiled and witty only when she felt completely comfortable. He must've somehow just appreciated all that, sensed she had a subtler mind than his, but that he could please her, which made him happy. It was to his good credit that he looked beyond their physical differences to the heart of things human, which I admired even if it wasn't in our mother to notice.\\"<br /><br />Dell's voice here -- nonjudgmental, insightful, laconic and slightly melancholy but at ease with the language he's using to plumb his memory -- is the central strength of this remarkable novel. Its finely wrought sentences alone are worth the price of admission, but they are also in constant service to the story of the Parsons family.<br /><br />\\"The world doesn't usually think about bank robbers as having children -- though plenty must. But the children's story -- which mine and my sister's is -- is ours to weigh and apportion and judge as we see fit. . . . Ruskin wrote that composition is the arrangement of unequal things. Which means it's for the composer to determine what's equal to what, and what matters more and what can be set to the side of life's hurtling passage onward.\\"<br /><br />We are quite fortunate that the remembered story of Dell Parsons is composed, through Richard Ford, by Dell himself, now a teacher in his 60s. Not only are we served abstract gems (\\"the nervous American intensity for something else\\"), we are also anchored in young Dell's experience by concrete details like this description of the shack he comes to live in in Saskatchewan, the guest of a union-hating radical anti-authoritarian named Arthur Remlinger: \\"There was almost no room for me, only the iron cot I slept on and the one that had been reserved for Berner, and the `kitchen room,' with the bumpy red linoleum and a single fluorescent ceiling ring and a two-burner hot plate where I boiled tar-smelling pump water in a pan to make my bath at night.\\"<br /><br />It is Dell's boiling of pump water for a bath, his search for a school, his trying to make a normal life for himself among dangerous adult chaos that is so gratifyingly heart-rending about his story. \\"Canada\\" is a tale of what happens when we cross certain lines and can never go back. It is an examination of the redemptive power of articulated memory, and it is a masterwork by one of our finest writers working at the top of his form.<br /><br />Andre Dubus III is the author of five books, including the novel \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" and, most recently, the memoir \\"Townie.\\"
1451608659|5.0|as a longtime Domi fan,I was really excited to get this book. I finished it in 3 days. It's really interesting to get the actual stories of her life after reading about them in magazines and papers before. She's honest and her stories ring true to other gymnasts who worked with the Karolyi's. It's nice that it's not all about her time at the Karolyi's though. It's also nice to get the story behind her and her coach Luminito Miscenco and her time at the USOC. Things that hadn't really been discussed before. It's full of stories about her family now but also has enough gymnastics to make any gymnastic fan happy. I definitely recommend it!

B00867GHS8|5.0|As Father's Day approaches, I write my review of this fantastically crafted animated feature from Pixar--a very lifelike and original tale that can easily make a viewer forget he or she is watching an animated feature.<br />  Our tale begins somewhere in the South Pacific where a loving couple of clownfishes named Merlin and Coral (Albert Brooks and Elizabeth Perkins) are inspecting their formidable sized roe in a pocket of the sea anemone they call home. As they anticipate their impending parenthood, the worrywart Merlin wonders, \\"What if none of them like me?\\" His mate assures him that among their hundreds of progeny, at least one of them will.<br />  As they discuss names for their children,their happiness is soon disrupted by the arrival of a barracuda. Coral gallantly flees to defend her unborn offspring as her mate pleads with her. Knocked unsconscious by a smack of the tail of this predatory home invader, Marlin awakes to find the enclave empty and his beloved mate no where to be found. Easily deciphering what has happened, the grieving and devastated Merlin will take consolation in finding at least one remaining, but gashed egg knocked to the ocean floor by their home. He vows to protect his only child-to-be.<br />  The offspring is named Nemo, a name his mother had liked, and we meet the lively youngster as he enthusiastically prepares for his first day of school.One of his fins--known as his \\"lucky fin\\" is underdeveloped because of the pre-natal barracuda attack.<br />  School will be conducted by Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), a spotted eagle stingray who will conduct Nemo and his  school mates-- including Tad a yellow longnose(Jordy Ranft), Pearl, a flapjack octopus(Erica Beck), and Sheldon, a seahorse(Erik Per Sullivan) on various adventures.<br />  Marlin will have his slightly antagonistic encounter with their parents who try to reassure this overprotective father of a physically challenged child to give him some independance.<br />  But once when little Nemo and his friends venture out too far, and Nemo is rebuked by his father, he draws further away from his Dad, resulting in his being fishnapped  by a diver named Phillip Sherman (Bill Hunter)who will keep him in his dentist's office aquarium near Sydney Harbor, resulting in Marlin beginning an odyssey of his own to retrieve his son--a journey on which he will be greatly tested.<br />  As it begins, Marlin encounters a Pacific royal blue tang with a short-term memory named Dory(drawn quite accurately to look like Ellen DeGeneres), who will play a pivotal role in this story.<br />  This animated feature will become a tale of characters finding their own strength, facing their fears and overcoming minor challenges and seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The characters they encounter along the way include three sharks trying to wean themselves from eating other fish, as is their natural instinct, including a great white named Bruce(Barry Humphries),Ancor, a hammerhead shark( Eric Bana) and Chum, a Mako shark (Bruce Spence).<br /> Marlin and his new companion manage to get past them as they battle their way across the South Pacific to find Nemo, meeting many who will either help or hinder their efforts. Among those they must surpass are a school of jellyfish. Among those lending assistance as they reach their destination--the East Australian Current  are a comically clever school of moonfish(John Ratzenberger), and the cool, surfer turtle Crush(Andrew Stanton--one of my favorite characters in the story), who encourages Marlin to give his son more independance when the reunite, an example Crush sets with his own son Squirt (Nicholas Bird).<br />  Rove McManus plays a cocky crab who finds himself compelled to assist Dory and Marlin.One angler fish featured in the story can best be described as both helpful and as a potential hindrance.Also initially sketchy is the role of a huge whale.<br /> The story of Marlin's determination spreads across the ocean, and through crawlingcrabs and lobsters, leaping dolphins telling the story to seagulls flying overhead, creatures of the land and sea are made aware of this effort.<br /> In the meantime the little clownfish's new tankmates, including Bloat, a pufferfish(Brad Garrett), Peach a starfish(Allison Janney), Gurgle, a royal gamma(Austin Pendleton)Bubbles, a yellow tang (Stephen Root), Deb, a 4-striped damsel fish(Vicki Lewis), Jacques, a Pacific cleaner shrimp(Joe Ranft), and the dour Gill, a Moorish idol( Willem Dafoe)-- a breed who don't do well in small aquariums--who has been scarred physically by more than one attempt to escape, discover they must protect their new arrival from the dentist's niece, the heavy-handed and overzealous young Darla(LuLu Ebeling), who has an unfortunate habit of killing the fishes her uncle gives her as birthday presents by shaking the plastic back in which they are contained too much.<br />  Geoffrey Rush's seagull, Nigel, plays an unlikely role in the effort to reunite father and son.<br />  The tale has the same clever and ingenious resolutions audiences have seen in many a Pixar flick.But watching the growth of the characters in a story told in an unconventional setting is always fascinating, and the story ends on a gentle note of loving reassurance.Marlin discovers that he need not have worried about whether or not his offspring would like him; one does and it is quite enough.<br />  I add my name to the list of those who find this wonderful story highly recommendable!

B0088P2A7A|2.0|This app doesn't justify itself. Lacking a search-wiki standalone widget, there's no reason to launch an application to search and browse Wikipedia. Especially since the app is poorly-coded, clunky, nearly devoid of options (three font-size choices and redundant language-selection) and unsatisfying to navigate. A simple, small widget one could use to wiki-search-queries to the system default browser would be a much better option.

She had it lucky. Now imagine being stuck a hundred feet in the air in a small chair, a nasty winter storm is blowing in all around you, and right below you a pack of hungry wolves are waiting to make you their next meal.<br /><br />  That's the situation our three protagonists face when an idyllic weekend at a ski resort turns into a nightmare when they are abandoned midway up a mountain and the resort shuts down for the week. Directed by Adam Green (Hatchet) and starring Shawn Ashmore (X-Men, The Ruins), Kevin Zegers (Wrong Turn, Dawn of the Dead), and sexy newcomer Emma Bell (Final Destination 5, \\"The Walking Dead\\"), Frozen puts a very human face on a very slow and painful way to die.<br /><br />  When Hatchet became somewhat of an overnight cult success a few years back, it help establish Adam Green as a welcomed face to the horror genre and he has had a pretty good run in greasing some pretty iconic new names in the mix such as Victor Crowley. It was only a matter a time before he would expand his craft beyond the slasher movie. And what makes Frozen work is that it's a very believable situation that any one of us could one day face.  The casting of our three leads were pitch perfect. Ashmore and Bell really show the range of their talent as they carry the bulk of the last third of the movie on their shoulders. Bell, in one heart wrenching scene, brought me nearly to tears as she worried about the fate of her dog she left behind if she were to die. Add to it that neither her character nor Ashmore's particularly know or like one another (she's Zegers' new girlfriend tagging along on his and Ashmore's annual ski weekend and Ashmore is a bit jealous over the amount of time he rarely gets to spend with his best friend whom he's known since they were in kindergarten) helps add to the steadily mounting tension so that once Zegers is out of the picture, the film's overall emotional heart and drama really take center stage.<br /><br />  And then there are the wolves. Forget the somehow supernaturally gifted wolves of the past summer hit The Grey, these four legged hell hounds of the forest are the real deal. They circle, communicate with each other, and are a very force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />  Overall, Frozen is well worth the $10 - $15 asking price and packs a much stronger visceral punch than it's wider known and bigger budgeted successor.  A must see for any survival horror/ adventure fans.helps add to the steadily mounting tension so that once Zegers is out of the picture, the film's overall emotional heart and drama really take center stage.<br /><br />  And then there are the wolves.

0312641893|5.0|This book was a recommendation and absolutely loved the book. The main thing I didn't like was that the main character didn't get to have that much romance, but the twist was a nice change. I did wish that the main character would have stood up for herself more, but I understand why she couldn't. I loved that the book was a twist on the original Cinderella story. The setting of the book is futuristic and the main character is actually a cyborg and human. There are androids, netlinks, and hovers which make this book a Cinderella book along with a sci-fi book as well.<br /><br />I was completely hooked on the book and everything that I thought I wouldn't like, I actually enjoyed when reading the book. I read this book in one day and it was greatly entertaining. I can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />Recommend:Definitely, yes<br />Worth price:For such a great read yes<br />Read series:Definitely, yes
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Generally, 5 star reviews make me nervous.  I figure they are written mostly by shills, friends of the author, and that sort of thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no other rating I could give this book, or this author.  The book is extremely well-written AND entertaining.  Both are important.  Too many of the books I have purchased on Amazon have been crippled by flawed editing, poor grammar, and the like.  Blood Song does not have any of those problems.<br /><br />This guy can write, really, really well.  Famous, big-name author in their prime type of quality.<br /><br />After finishing Blood Song, I went looking for other work by the same author.  I found a novella, and bought it.  Then I found the author's blog, and some more of his work.  Sadly, the rest of the Raven's Shadow trilogy will not be Amazon ebooks, but published as legacy paper books.<br /><br />I generally don't buy paper books anymore (preferring the convenience and lower prices of ebooks), but I will make an exception for this author.

0385535139|3.0|John Grisham has once again proven himself a skilled storyteller, with a legal literary tale that is a cross between the lighthearted humor of \\"Boston Legal\\" and the legal finesse of \\"L.A. Law\\". The Litigators which draws heavily on legal drama weaves this otherwise humorous satire into a courtroom saga of litigation and the actual practice of law.<br /><br />The story features David Zinc, Wally Figg, and Oscar Finley of the F&F attorneys at law known as \\"a boutique law firm\\", then \\"The 3 Stooges\\" and as clients, cases and the partners crumbled around him, David finally became known as, a Litigator.<br /><br />Harvard Law graduate, David Zinc is the youngest and more financially successful of the F&F law firm trio, he literally stumbled into the Finley and Figg agency after he decided to \\"snap\\" in an elevator at Trust Tower one thousand feet upward into the clouds of Chicago. His dramatic exit from the prestigious Rogan Rothberg - 5th placed in hours billed per attorney - law firm, was followed by his decision to quit, go on a drunken binge, and then end up at the unfamiliar office of Finley & Figg with people he did not know.<br /><br />62 year old Oscar Finley is the senior partner, who won the building in a lawsuit. He carries a very large gun in his briefcase and does not hesitate to use it. His marriage isn't pleasant but he's too afraid to file for a divorce. His biggest disappointment with the firm's newest and only big case is that the FDA pulled the drug in question, Krayoxx off the market - Oscar was so hoping it would kill his wife so he wouldn't have to share the anticipated proceeds with her via the a messy costly divorce he wanted to avoid.<br /><br />And then there's Wally Figg, a pathetic always-recovering alcoholic, trying to score the big pay day client. He is flawed with endless defects, including four failed marriages. He advertises the firm's services, against Oscar's approval, any and everywhere he can - including on bingo cards.  His greed or perhaps need for that one big colossal win, single-handily threaten to professionally, morally, and financially bankrupt the firm, and perhaps cause physical devastation as well.<br /><br />To round off the colorful crew of misfits, is Rochelle Gibson the less than knowledgeable \\"legal\\" secretary - she lacks formal training but seems to made it up in experience.  Although vastly untrained, her qualifications are continually overlooked by the two partners, because years ago F&F mishandled her case(s), beginning with an auto crash case Wallis Figg acquired by impersonating a physician and having her sign a contract for legal representation -while she was bombed on Percocet - he promised her the moon, then proceeded to butcher her case, next was her divorce case which Oscar filled and then the bankruptcy case. Any foolish notion either had to fire her, merely dissipated with her ace-in-the-hole threat to sue them for malpractice.<br /><br />Basically, Oscar thought the firm should take every case that came through the door, while Wally was always searching for the big financial kill. After twenty plus years together, Oscar Finley and Wally Figg had succumb to being ambulance chasers. But now with David onboard there was an anticipation of successful profit.  And along the way, they may just learn to behalf like a real law firm.<br /><br />So, Wally decided to dive head first into a law suit against Varrick Labs, a major pharmaceutical company that manufactured a cholesterol reducing drug called Krayoxx - the claim was that the company knowingly and willing rushed the \\"bad\\" drug to market although it could/would cause severe health problems, heart attacks, and death. Wally Figg viciously suggested to his partners and potential clients that Varrick could face lawsuits similar to those against the tobacco industry, and the payoff would be enormous. Unfortunately, prior to the nationwide coverage of the Varrick-Krayoxx trial, Wally neglected to secure a key piece of evidence - the complete and final expert and FDA findings - once those findings were reviewed, he sought to withdraw the suit, yet the trial of the century commenced - and the proceedings were legendary Grisham.<br /><br />Only an attorney who is also a writer could craft this novel.  Let's face it, It's John Grisham, and besides being a skillful storytelling, rather consciously or unconsciously he is also a instructor on law  and it is with certainty readers will not only be entertain but will also walk away learning some interesting facts about the legal process.<br /><br />The law, litigation, and the professionals that practice it, mixed with just the right amount of humor is what readers will enjoy as they eagerly journey through the story of \\"The Litigators\\".<br /><br />Review copy provided by publisher.ce - the complete and final expert and FDA findings - once those findings were reviewed, he sought to withdraw the suit, yet the trial of the century commenced - and the proceedings were legendary Grisham.<br /><br />Only an attorney who is also a writer could craft this novel.

157421327X|1.0|Inside the cover of this 18 page booklet is the following notice: \\"The written instructions, photographs, DESIGNS, PATTERNS, and projects in this publication are intended for the personal use of the reader and may be reproduced for that purpose only. ...\\" (emphasis added)<br />And what are these precious designs and patterns which we dare not use anywhere but in the privacy of our own homes, having duly spent our $8.99 on the booklet? Well, they appear to be the most basic, primitive, designs and patterns imaginable. And yes, they are totally imaginable. I could imagine them, you could imagine them, my pet cat could imagine them. All this company has done is add its own names to the \\"designs\\" and \\"patterns\\" -- thus, a basic diamond pattern is called \\"Knightsbridge\\" & zap, magically it belongs to Design Originals (sic). A simple weave pattern is called \\"W2\\" - and don't you dare spread it around!<br />This would be hilarious if it weren't so disturbing.<br />My advice: Use your OWN imaginations, people. You're bound to come up with something more creative and original than the stuff in this book.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|What can I say, but just that Adam's sophomore album has not only met but exceeded all my expectations of it! It is simply BRILLIANT!!! :DDD<br /><br />It's impossible to keep still while listening to the first half of the album. The funkalicious, empowering & kick-ass numbers ('Trespassing', 'Shady', 'Kickin' In' & 'Pop That Lock') as well as catchy, fun & light-hearted tunes ('Cuckoo', 'Naked Love') make you wanna get up, dance & sing-a-long to them!<br /><br />Then you get to the other half of the album where Adam displays the honest, tender & vulnerable side of him through heartfelt ballads such as 'Outlaws of Love' and 'Underneath'. & I can't get enough of 'Chokehold'!<br /><br />Also, to the casual listeners, you need to get the deluxe album for the 3 AMAZING bonus tracks! I don't even understand why these are only bonus tracks in the first place (they're sooo good). :D 'Runnin'' is just terribly addictive & Adam's stunning vocals shine through the incredible 3-octave range! & 'Nirvana' is such a gentle, soothing & romantic tune that I could play on a loop & not get sick of it... :)<br /><br />Finally, I can't wait to attend a 'Trespassing World Tour' & listen to Adam perform these incredible songs live!!! :)

B0002234LS|5.0|Even if you don't enjoy this movie if you've never seen it before, the unbeatable price won't break the bank. I was already a fan of this movie, the stephen king short story it is based on, and all things Johnny depp. But the Amazon bargain price of eight dollars and change made this shopper one happy camper. Secret window is a fun movie to watch, and despite my bias, depp is great in his performance as an author with writer's block in a world where things are not always as they seem.....or are they?  More of a mystery/suspense film than actual horror, if you are like me you will find yourself reaching for secret window whenever in the mood for an engrossing, simply entertaining movie. And best of all, the price is more than worth it. Happy watching!
B000RW3VD4|5.0|Although oliver stone captured the mood of modern times with this expose of wall street life and the ethos of modern times we need to actually understand his view and see what to make of it? He wants viewers to know a seminal experience for him was vietnam,whatever that exactly was for him,and that's really where he learned about people...it is true that people who go to war are inextricably changed by it...and many cant cope and a reading of case studies elucidates this point of traumatized soldiers,...so to be fair that's his view at looking at modern life..of course he has the experience of new york and wall street and his view of one person and his effect and what he tries to do in this financial hub. This film i recall watching on tv when younger,and it had three of my favorite stars,which Stone surprisingly cast in this film,not really known for acting in these kinds of roles and he took a big risk in casting them...and while filming he had problems pruning their talents as they may have been going through personal issues. A business movie...not always the kind of movie people want to view...and for that reason he puts in the romance of Hannah to appeal to a larger audience...and i think its there for that reason only...and he was surprised she took the role. Since this is a serious role and since it fits in,are these characters,douglas' alter ego of gyetko well put together by him,typical of american conservatism...or are they solipist type characters?I always disliked ayn rand for propagating these kinds of characters and philosophies,and so called freedoms,and the Douglas character says you are not living really in democracy but in a cpitalist haven, for that reason i see this as an ayn rand type person,a controversial figure novelist whom even the conservative icon william f buckley was not that comfortable with and i was perusing after watching the film collected speeches by him,and the same thought crossed his mind solipsism,a business person who uses all his wiles and means,not always legally,to build up a huge fortune and at times leaving a destruction of bankrupt companies and interference in the free market system...which detrimentally effects too many lives..as the union capitalist debate in this film dovetails. The two sheen's also are involved in father -son,betrayal type relationships...which the Douglas character is also involved in. Stone does allow the Douglas character a long speech on american capitalism..in defense of it..but he like most solipsists care little about anything,family,friends...nation...but only the enlargement of their self...the 'grandiose self.'<br />Douglas does try to groom charlie to be a 'person' like him,not just to fulfill a job,...and he at film's end feels betrayed..and who else does the director want us to feel is being betrayed. The world of union politics versus capitalism,of the workers international,belongs in 'hard times' and charles dickens,the world we inhabit today is a globalized world...promoting capitalism is not enough...the countries moving ahead now are also internally restructuring in this complex world...a la the philosophy of bill gates the education guru...every nation today is capitalist..a modern economy is really needed and all that means to be successful...but a good film viewed many years later...with three of my favorite people many years ago surprisingly in this film,in which the author uses his war experiences to develop a fable..and i long hoped for a sequel and will watch it next as should all viewers of this film
6304613199|3.0|A great suspense movie for those who like monsters.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic, and the photography astounding. One does have to have a strong stomach to deal with the man-eating monsters. Also, one needs to put up with some romantic environmentalist preaching. Very suspenseful.

B007Z9R69M|4.0|Not sure why the reviews of this movie are so bad.  Imagine Soderberg directing a movie like 'Above The Law':  the fight scenes in this move are great, the pacing is good, and you can have a fun, no brainer evening without having your intelligence insulted repeatedly.<br /><br />All of the ridiculous dialog and macho posturing has been cut out- perhaps the people who gave this movie bad reviews enjoy Steven Seagal for his dialog.  We've all seen these caper movies before- Soderberg just cuts is down to its essentials.

Give yourself a few pages and I think you'll become a fan, too. It really is that good.

B0006Z2LCE|5.0|There are three reasons to get this:<br /><br />Firstly, the sound is remastered. It's like listening to a brand new release. The audio is incredible!<br /><br />Secondly and especially a lot of the songs on disc 1 are the longer versions with added instruments, vocals bits. Listen to Love To Love You Baby and MacArthur Park. These versions are definitely better than the shorter edits on Endless Summer - and they demonstrate why Summer ruled the 70s charts. Although Last Dance is the longer version, it's not my favourite Thank God It's Friday 8 minutes + version where Summer stops in the middle of the disco part to sing the ballad bit and then it escalates again.<br /><br />Summer's signature style is evident. A lot of songs start off slow and then jump starts to disco. Donna is also one of the pioneers of electronic dance music. Just listen to I Feel Love and Sunset People.<br /><br />Thirdly, Disc Two has a fair representation of her 80s work till 2005. I really love the new wave treatment of There Goes My Baby, her cover of Andrea Bocelli's and Sarah Brightman's Time To Say Goodbye, titled here as I Will Go With You and the SAW produced numbers. The last song You're So Beautiful closes on a hi energy note.<br /><br />A 2 Disc will ultimately have lots of omissions. Record companies will also artfully leave a few tracks that are unique to each greatest hits release. Still, Donna Summer Gold is a pretty good package with lots of songs that brings back memories. I'm sure sales must have been good as the retail price has gone up.<br /><br />RIP Donna, miss you much!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My coworkers had been raving about this book for months. I purchased to read while on a European cruise vacation. On day three of the vacation I had finished the first in the series and was hooked. I paid for Internet aboard the ship not once, but twice to download books two and three. I finished the series as I landed in JFK and was captivated the entire flight back to the US.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever read Brave New World or 1984 as there are several parallels through the series. Enjoy!
0345803493|1.0|I just started the book and so far it had not held my attention. Did not know what the book was even out until a I heard someone make a crack about it on TV make innuendo about sex. My husband and I were at Costco and my husband told me he had a book for me. So I thought yay a god book to read. Not knowing about the trilogy I had to get the other two books of course. After about three pages in I was very disappointed. I told my husband that it's a book that I would have liked as a teenager. I can't believe that it is such a best seller. The author throw's in a word here and there that the average person probably never even heard before. Which is something I would have at 15 years of age. I am going to finish the book. I probably will return the other two. Again I'm stunned that it's a best seller!

B0052VUNHC|2.0|This book reminded me of why the sexual revolution and feminism were so important.  The book is all about a \\"good-girl.\\"  I don't mean it's parodying the stereotype of a good girl.  I mean, it's portraying her as GOOD.  And that the girls who have sex are BAD, deserve to be ditched, and that men who ditch them are completely justified (and that it was OK to use someone who (ahem) \\"spread-eagles\\" themselves like that.  Her words, not mine.).  I would have given it 1 *, except that I didn't finish it.  I just didn't want to!

B006MVJ2L4|3.0|I have been a fan of Adam Lambert since American Idol. I am a 64 year old straight, married woman and I even voted for him every week. I bought his first album and it was OKish. As far as this new album, I must admit, I only listened to the preview of every song on this new album, Trespassing, so maybe I am not being completely fair. But again (like his first album), to me, it sounds like his pure beautiful voice is mostly drowned out by something. Maybe they recorded his voice a lot of times and they are playing all of them at the same time. Whatever it is, I don't like it. It's almost a fuzzy sound.<br /><br />Some people have said that if people do not like the album it is because they do not like pop or something. I love pop. I love disco. I love to wash dishes to dance music....(I used to be a disco queen in the 70's)...<br /><br />I am also a Michael Jackson fan. I have both CD's in my car, Adam Lambert's Entertainment album and Michael Jackson's Thriller. Michael did a wonderful job of integrating the purity of his voice, alone many times, and then adds mixtures into it. I wish Adam would do something like that in an album. His first album, except for a few songs  where his voice shines through, seemed fuzzy.  From what I hear of this album too,  it just sounds kind of fuzzy and like there are too many of the same voices at the same time, (except for a few songs). I wanted to buy it, but will not at this point. Too bad.<br /><br />Maybe he will put this album onto Pandora so I can hear more (I have an Adam Lambert track on Pandora). Then, if I like what I hear, I will buy, but not before. I don't freely spend my money like I used to, so not willing to risk it at this point.<br /><br />****Later: I did buy it and his #10 song on the CD is my favorite (I get teary when I hear it). However, the whole CD is not something I look forward to listening to while driving so it is around #4 on my CD choices in my car. I really wanted to love the whole thing. Maybe his clear, beautiful voice on American Idol just spoiled me. Maybe I do not like today's music that hides musicians voices. Don't know. I would love a CD by him that does not have the dance music on it that is so electronic. But, since he did who he is a a musician, I cannot fault him for doing that.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|For the last few albums, the innovators of Rush have fallen into their own rut, relying on too familiar melodic choices, too much noise, layering, and overdub, and often too many Geddy's backing Geddy.  Nothing was terrible in the last few tries, but nothing stood out.<br /><br />But that's changed now.<br /><br />With the exception of a few small low points, Angels brings the aggression and hardness of Counterparts, the driving story of 2112, and enough catchy licks to invoke Moving Pictures and the other radio hits of the 80's.  Every listen takes me a little deeper, and what music any more can really take you on a journey like that?<br /><br />This band has always been tight, but somehow they seem more together on this album, like everyone's heart is in the collaboration and on the same page.  There is enough risk in the musical styles and lyrics to take Rush's music to new places, all the while retaining enough of the familiar power to say, \\"yes, this is how Rush must sound.\\"<br /><br />The band has transcended... again...  and truly is better than ever.<br /><br />As the subject line of the review says, if this was to be their last album, it's the right one for Rush to go out on.

B005LAIGN2|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this movie and was really disappointed.  I had such high hopes for this movie that the let down was partly because the movie was so poorly directed.  I was most offended by the producer/director using 1940's jive talking and making these great air men look like idiots.  If it hasn't had subtitles, it would have been difficult to understand the actors. I am white and I respect the Tuskeegee air men who finally had their chance to make a difference during World War II.  I can't help but wonder how these good actors felt delivering these corny out dated lines; they must have been offended as well.  The Tuskeegee air men were a credit to our country, their race, all their awards earned and they deserved to be recognized as the excellent air men that they were.

B005ZUR724|5.0|For a tablet MMO this game is simply amazing! Great job Gameloft!<br /><br />Very surprised with this one. Very much like WoW.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|written in a most immature manner, about a very immature young woman and a sadist.  Most writers with any class would have chucked this out as a dirty draft (no pun intended)and forgotten about finishing it at all.<br /><br />Decided to stop reading it 1/2 way through. Kept thinking I would find some redeeming qualities in it, but didn't.<br /><br />There must be a lot of really depraved individuals out there buying this book and living vicariously through it's printed pages.  I feel sorry for them.<br /><br />Will not read the sequel(s)
1934997358|5.0|I really enjoy this collection of audiobooks. Jarvis has a masterful comedic timing, he really nails the tempo and musicality of the author's prose.<br />Question to fellow readers: is it me or Wodehouse writes blistering put-downs of the English upper crust disguised as airy send-ups?<br />His impeccable command of the English language, playful narrative arcs and colorful characters seem to build a horrible portrayal of the English class system.<br />Wodehouse's aristocrats, though harmless for the most part, appear as a bunch of in-bred, lazy, greedy, incurious, provincial, xenophobic, backstabbing, repressed, cowardly, frivolous, inept, bumbling snobs that would do anything to latch on to their life of privilege and wouldn't survive a week without their small armies of selfless working-class servants.<br />All they care about is \\"marrying well\\" and getting intoxicated.<br />Three words: the Drones Club.<br />Not saying that he is some kind of Orwell in disguise, but nobody seems to point this out in the literary world.<br />The man, Wodehouse that is, is always depicted as a sort of gifted lightweight that just happened to have superb talent to turn a phrase.<br />To judge by his life (as far as I know he lived most of his adult life in France & America, returning to England only sporadically) his homecountry was not necessarily his favorite place in the world.

0817439390|5.0|This book has really boosted my understanding of digital metering. I shot with film for the last 38 years. Recently switching to digital.<br />Bryan's book really helped to understand digital ISO, and white balance.<br /><br />I have been very disappointed in using digital because I am not very good at post processing shots with photoshop. But after reading Bryan's book. I am once again getting out of camera quality. Just like my film days.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|To my ears, this is the most exciting Rush album to come along in quite a while. It's better than their last one, SNAKES & ARROWS. Usually it takes me several listens to fully appreciate a new Rush album and for the songs to stand out on their own, but the impact of CLOCKWORK ANGELS was immediate. This is an incredible album and I'm looking forward to listening to it over and over.

0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown did this: he lived with all his might while he lived.  That is one thing that shines through Blehm's book Fearless.  It was refreshing to read of a man who knew his strength was from Another.  It seems Adam's life could be summed up in this, \\"not I, but Christ.\\"  Funerals are telling of a man's life and it was clear where Adam wanted the spotlight shined at his.  Going from crack addict to elite SEAL operator is humanly impossible.  There was a lot of brokenness in Adam's life and he wanted those things known so that His Savior's grace would shine.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a man alive.  He understood and lived what most of us just long for.  His life was marked with that rare sort of determined abandonment to mediocrity that looks to some like simple recklessness.  Recklessness it was not.  He understood that life was a gift and that every good and perfect gift was from above.  He treasured his wife and children.  He treasured the breath he was given and the tremendous giftedness he possessed.  Fearless tells of a man with a rare, deep maturity that blends together things that don't seem like they should go together.  Meek and bold; humble and tenacious; longing to show compassion and tenderness -how many shoes did he give away to Afghan children!? Yet, he was ready to deal lethal violence for those to whom it was due.  Chesterton's comment seems to capture well the warrior ethos that Adam possessed.  He fought not so much out of hatred for the enemy in \\"front\\" of him, but out of love for what was \\"behind\\" him- his family, his brothers in arms, his country.<br /><br />\\"No matter what my spirit is given to the Lord and I will finally be victorious,\\" wrote Adam.  He understood that death had lost its sting because Christ conquered sin and death once for all.  And so his funeral, where his body was laid to rest was not an act of closure.  Rather -as much of his life- it was an act of defiance.  Death will not have the final say for those like Adam Brown whose hope is in the Lord of Life.<br /><br />Note: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.  The opinions and review of this title are entirely my own.
B0009WFF7M|1.0|I bought this version thinking that since it was an SACD that it would be of superior quality. Taking a tip from an earlier reviewer I downloaded Foobar which has a dynamic rang meter. I also have a remastered version from about 1997. Comparing the two the SACD version is seriously compressed and clearly inferior. Compression squeezes the life out of the music and all so that it will sound as loud as the last compressed cut just played on the radio. The 1997 version also has some tracks with light compression. I am going to try to find a 1985 release version. The loudness wars are ruining most CD releases. Too bad manufactures aren't required to print the dynamic range on the package.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author creates a vivid post-apocalyptic world.  I don't want to give anything away, but I really enjoyed the unique world that the author created, as well as the engaging characters.  This should be a classic of science fiction. Hopefully the self-publishing won't doom this work to obscurity.
0618918248|1.0|As I finished TGD I felt so deprived. It grieves me greatly that so many have read such a superficial book as this and felt so enlightened from it. Are the masses really so unlearned? It wasn't nearly as deep, profound or informative as I anticipated. Maybe after reading so many books from Sagan, Hawking and the likes, I was expecting more than I should.<br /><br />To be sure, religion is a major problem and for the most part I agree with Mr. Dawkins on the horrors religion truly causes. But I've also learned to differentiate religion; the peace-loving, \\"inform-then-wipe-the-dust-off-your feet-and-quietly-move-on\\" teachings of the \\"Prince of Peace\\" from those other religions that claim to follow Christ, yet clearly don't.<br /><br />I was surprised when Mr Dawkins quotes 'Love thy neighbor' then adds; it \\"didn't mean what we now think it means, it meant only 'Love another Jew.'\\" His only endorsement on this is John Hartung an American physician and evolutionary anthropologist that wrote a \\"remarkable paper.\\" Most unimpressive really, especially when there is no hint of Hartung having any theological training at all. Ironically, \\"Love thy neighbor\\" is the lead-in line for the account of Jesus relating \\"The Good Samaritan\\" where the moral of the story is; even the people you don't like are your neighbors, in other words; everybody (certainly, not just Jews). Further, Jesus made it clear when he said \\"Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring\\" (John 10:16) or \\"Go ye therefore, and teach ALL nations, baptizing...\\" (Matthew 28:19 see also Matthew 10:18) and the list goes on..... And, of all things on love thy (Jewish) neighbor only, as Dawkins insists, he uses as an example of Jews loving Jews only \\"the Sanhedrin (the Jewish Supreme Court..)! What! This is the very same court that had a share in having 'Jew-loving' Jesus killed! What's that line of Mr. Dawkins?  ....\\"theologians are certainly no more qualified to answer [questions] than scientists themselves.\\" I must passionately disagree. He also makes literal interpretations of scriptures from the most symbolic book in the Bible, Revelation, then criticizes it \\"Well, that's the sort of thing we've come to expect.\\"  Maybe you wouldn't \\"come to expect\\" that \\"sort of thing\\" if you would read the Bible correctly. Mr. Dawkins (like many people) misinterprets the Bible, then faults it based on those misinterpretations. Yet, what book out there has more commentaries, expoundings, studies and critiques IN ITS DEFENSE than the Bible? Search those sources out too.<br /><br />Another sample is on our universe being perfectly tuned; Why does Mr. Dawkins insist God can't twiddle knobs to make the universe just so; \\"there are no knobs to twiddle\\" (page 173) yet there is still \\"a plethora of alternative sets of by-laws? If so many variants really exist, why insist God can't simply create the one(s) that is(are) needed?<br /><br />Another sample: Just before I came to chapter 3 \\"Arguments for God's existence,\\" I briefly paused to write (rather impulsively on the half-filled page 99) my own personal 'arguments.' There was room enough for eight of these, then I read on. There are 14 different arguments Mr. Dawkins has in the book yet none of them matched mine. It seems he picks among the more \\"lame\\" arguments and explains them away, but avoids the more legitimate and challenging ones. He did the very same approach later when 'arguing' on a christain's having an aversion to dying if they truly believe in a better 'here-after.' Again, none of his arguments matched up with mine. Why is that? Does he only pick the arguments he can easily refute? It seems so.<br /><br />Another sample: Mr Dawkins claims raising children in Amish communities is child abuse. Has he ever mingled among the Amish? I have friends of Amish. Please allow me to proceed on this in in the following manner, if I may.....<br />Mr. Dawkins' comments on the Amish.. \\"eschewing, to varying extents, electricity, internal combustion engines, zippers and other manifestations of life\\" Mr. Dawkins discusses particularly the \\"Amish children never volunteered to be Amish\\" and adds \\"The rest of us are happy with our cars and computers, our vaccines and antibiotics.\\" Well, I've lived in the \\"Keystone State,\\" Pennsylvania, since 1956, and plenty of the Amish are nearby. It's true, I don't agree with their religion, but it does appear Mr. Dawkins has never mingled with them. (Incidentally, these particular Amish have no problems with vaccines or antibiotics) Firstly, I know of many city, non-Amish \\"civilized\\" and educated kids with \\"cars and computers\\" that are clearly less advanced with know-how and day-to-day living than many younger Amish kids. There are many \\"happy,\\" \\"young people from the outside world\\" that can't even count change for a dollar without a cash register or calculator, can't spell without a spell checker, can't cook without a microwave oven, can't change a car tire or have trouble even lifting the hood of their car. Look at how fat, weak and out of shape today's overly medicated, majorly depressed, sugar-bloated, grease fed, spoiled couch potatoes are, that don't even know how to interact with other people! Now let's take a second look at these 'trapped children in a seventeenth century time warp' as Mr. Dawkins portrays. They eat healthy foods with no additives, preservatives from meat that has no chemicals, drugs or artificial fertilizers. They too are \\"happy\\" and well fed with few or no overweight kids. They are taught crafts, traits, develop mechanical abilities, industriousness, respect, responsibilities, politeness, forgiveness, can live off of the land, take excellent care of themselves and others, (they don't even send their grandparents off to 'old folks' homes), they play actively and interactively, including physically in sports and much more. They play and make musical instruments, entertain! They are overall better at writing, math, reading and comprehension, than most students from public schools. Also, Amish children grow up to be excellent businessmen. Their businesses rarely, if ever, close their doors for good! Any pollution they cause is organic not chemical. I can go on and on, but my point should be clear enough by now. Are they problem free? Of course not! They can and some do, freely leave, yet many of them still return! Yes, they are very different, but Mr. Dawkins must realize, he still may know nothing in contrast to what's really going on, and may have to admit there are many positive advantages of children being raised Amish to write about; he mentions none what-so-ever, thus presenting a very warped and inaccurate perspective. Not very scientific-like! (such is all too common in TGD) Again the Amish could be an easy target to shoot at, if not informed properly. Curiously, one form of religious child abuse that really has no justification, excuse and is among the most horrific of all, Mr. Dawkins never even discusses; the Castrati.<br /><br />I can understand Mr. Dawkin's point when he says Natural Selection is a third option (the first two are creation and 'accident'). He calls Natural Selection a force, it has power, proceeds merrily, is a one-way street to improvement, it abhors waste, shapes brains, programs urges, constructs and debugs, punishes, exerts pressure, has logic.. and the list goes on. But I haven't yet seen where Mr. Dawkins hints, explains or describes exactly how or what Natural Selection exists as. What kind of force is it? How does it interact with DNA or its programming. Why is it a one-way street to improving, How can we be sure it won't stop or even reverse? We know Natural Selection isn't conscious, but does it have it's own type of \\"life-form\\"....anything at all to inform us more on this thing called Natural Selection.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins presents many theories on why people have varying types of experiences said to be from God, and I must agree, these experiencescan't all be from God. Mr. Dawkins theories could very well be true and factual explanations, yet, they could be, just as validly, supplemental causes in addition to God. In other words, they don't rule God out of existence.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins is certainly ill-informed as far as Thomas Jefferson being atheist! Not only was he a Deist, but in his own words.... \\"To the corruptions of Christianity I am indeed opposed, but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself. I am a Christian in the only sense he wished any one to be, sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all others,...\\" and \\"The Christian religion, when divested of the rags in which they [clergy] have enveloped it, and brought to the original purity and simplicity of it's benevolent institutor [Jesus], is a religion of all others, most friendly to liberty, science and the freest expansion of the human mind.\\" again; When inquired of whether Justice is learned, Jefferson said, \\"it is instinct and innate, that the moral sense is as much a part of our constitution as that of feeling, seeing or hearing; as a wise Creator must have seen to be necessary in animal destined to live in society.\\" These are only a very few of the factual quotes Dawkins never reveals.<br /><br />I can't believe Mr. Dawkins says he doesn't know of any atheists that blew up buildings. Are British schools really worse than America's? We learned in High School Social Studies of Stalin destroying churches and other buildings. And it wasn't because they were Catholic churches while Stalin was Protestant. These were religious buildings and Stalin was ATHEIST and moved by ATHEISM! \\"Seeking to establish atheism as the Soviet Union's official creed, Stalin destroyed thousands of churches and sent tens of thousands of priests to the gulags and their deaths.\\" I happen to have Mr. Dawkins' second edition where he claims he made some corrections. Looks like he'll need to do more for his third edtition.<br /><br />I really could go on and on with many more examples not being very much in depth. I could even write a book on it, but, as I see, quite a few others already (understandably) have. TGD is primarily one-sided. A court judge or anyone desiring to make a fair evaluation or sound decision wouldn't or shouldn't make a conclusion on such an issue on just this book alone. On the other hand, it can, and rightfully so, motivate many believers to 'do their homework.' There is plenty of much more reasonable, sound and legitimate conclusions favoring God's existence to learn of. Just search it out and consider it. If TGD is among the ultimate in convincing people to become atheists, then many of us believers are indeed, very safe.mprehension, than most students from public schools.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|This film is something special.<br /><br />There's so many things I loved about this movie. But here's a summation of the most important bits.<br /><br />a) Great casting. Everyone makes the most of their part. Noomi Rapace and David Fassbender are particularly absorbing to watch.<br /><br />b) Visually stunning. It's just a really cool, unique and strange looking movie. Ridley Scott made some interesting choices.<br /><br />c) Grand themes. There's some deep questions and fascinating ideas in this film's DNA. Some answers are given, but many are not. The sense of mystery and unknown that made alien/aliens so engaging is still here.<br /><br />d) Thrilling. This film is intense. Once it gets going, it doesn't really let up. There's one scene in particular that is just twisted and there's several scenes that all but gave me a heart attack.<br /><br />For me, this film has everything that great sci-fi should have. Bring on the sequel!

B007JM4CWY|4.0|I downloaded this app when it was offered as amazon's free app of the day. about 80% of the free apps I download in this was are uninstalled within the same day because they're either boring or not very amusing. this game is great. at first I wasn't very good at it because I've never played this type of puzzle game and the instructions are pretty basic. they don't tell you any strategy, you learn that as you play, which I love. since my strategy gets better as I play, each difficulty level is just as challenging since I am playing them in order. I'm really impressed with this game. I play it on my kindle and I think on anything smaller it might be frustrating since the boxes would be so tiny. I do think it seems a little pricey at $5 for a puzzle app, although if they keep adding more puzzles regularly then it seems like a fair price. overall, this has become one of my favorite puzzle apps.

0743289692|5.0|Infidel is a very informative book about one who dares to buck tradition in the name of individuality and a sense of self.  It is based on their right to be themselves and to use their own common sense.  Freedom of expression is the key.  Without it, positive change would be difficult either within or outside of any place or organization, to occur.  All of life in nature seek to crystalize so that it can be the best that it can be.  Who or what would want to prevent that from happening? With all of the challenges in life, the road may not be easy. It depends on what you want and how badly you want it. One should also be open minded in order to grow, like a flower!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this app!!It's so much fun!!I hope that you guys think that it deserves five stars too!! This app is awesome so get it and play it!!!
B0067TGSOK|5.0|If you're tired of feeling like a slave to your current work's circumstances, pick up this book. I breezed through it in a week on my Kindle, which is refreshing given that some business how-to books can be boring and cumbersome. It's well-written, the examples are accessible (meaning, these are REAL people doing REAL things) and it's call to action is infectious, as was Chris' enthusiasm for the topic when I met him in person during the book tour.<br /><br />This book opened my eyes to the fact that businesses don't need ridiculously long business plans and investors in order to succeed. You need only continuously show up and do, and with that momentum the rest will figure itself out. Ultimately, this book is more than just a book. It's a community of readers who cheer on and care about each other, and you can find them on Chris' website. What other book gives you the tools to succeed and then the connections to make it happen?
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a great time passer if you want something to do. I love obstacle courses so of course I got this app. if you don't have it yet, get it! its free anyways :)
0307946711|2.0|A friend was raving about how good this book is on Facebook so I thought I would give it a try... I kept going even though it was depressing because I thought \\"it HAS to get better!\\"  When it finally started to get better they KILLED OFF one of the main characters - UGH!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really like the games. But one big problem is the ads. there's one like after every game. And it's not like anyone is gonna click on those ads, like seriously? Also a big problem is the amount of points you have to get to unlock a game.. it's way too much. One game only gives you 4,000-9,000 points and that definitely isn't enough. But overall, I like the mini games.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|Wasn't sure how anything could top the first one, but in my opinion, this one did. The cinematography was breathtaking, the locations stunning, the action quick and leaving one quite unable to even blink for fear of missing something. I will end up buying this movie on Blu-Ray so it can be watched repeatedly. Waiting breathlessly for Sherlock Holmes #3. Robert Downey, Jr., as usual, is brilliant and incredible. Highly recommended.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|My dad bought this album from Amazon, but I bought it from itunes.  Buy it here- they actually get the track names right.<br /><br />Before I get into the nitty gritty reasons for my rating, I'd like to say that I grew up listening to Rush.  I hated them through sixth grade because my dad thought it would be a good idea to listen to them on road trips, and he liked listening to the live albums.  As anyone who has seen Rush live knows, you can really only appreciate the live stuff if you've seen it.  Well, while I was learning guitar middle of sixth grade, all of it suddenly clicked.  I learned to love Geddy's voice and modeled my guitar playing after Alex.<br /><br />When I first heard Snakes and Arrows, I despised it.  Far Cry:  Where's the guitar solo? I ignored the song for a while, and then I heard the entire album.  It took me a good 10 listens to get, but after seeing snakes and arrows live twice it's among my favorite albums.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels clicked after just a few listens for me, probably because I love their new sound as much as I do. The first to absorb were the Anarchist, Carnies, and the Garden.  I had listened to Headlong Flight obsessively along with Caravan and BU2B, so I knew the tunes by heart and loved them already.  The Wreckers, Clockwork Angels, BU2B2 and Wish them Well have all grown on me after listening to it a good 10 more times.  Halo Effect and Seven Cities of Gold are far more challenging.  Halo effect bores me, but Seven Cities has been growing on me a bit.<br /><br />My dad doesn't get it as much, and I've found that most of the people I've forced Rush onto, people around age 20 love it.  They've continued to progress, and I think that older fans have trouble wrapping their heads around it.  I've never heard a bad thing said about the Garden from either age group, though.<br /><br />Another reason that people seem to hate this album is Geddy's voice.  Well, if you think about it, hasn't that been a reservation for people since the 70's?  It's definitely changed with age, but I don't think there's consensus about whether it's a bad thing.  Obviously, his high range has weakened.  The man is 59, give him a break. I've become accustomed to it.  His new high range is definitely an acquired taste, and I'm addicted to it. But his lower range sounds beautiful!  That's my opinion. To each his own. I love his voice now, but I'm also a very open minded young person who's a big fan of the group...<br /><br />If you're a Rush veteran that's been following them since the 70's and think they haven't released a good album since Grace under Pressure, you probably won't like this album either.  If you enjoyed Snakes and Arrows and Vapor Trails, you will adore this album.  If you think that they should QUIT because Geddy struggles with the high stuff from the 70's: it's better to be quiet and keep people in the dark about your stupidity than to open your trap and make it abundantly clear.  The man is 59 and plays bass better than the majority of the young folk, and a lot of us still enjoy the singing.<br /><br />I'm a younger fan, and I've enjoyed it.  I would give it 4 stars for the lyrics, the singles, and the beauty of the Garden alone, but there's more than that to appreciate. The wreckers, the anarchist, carnies, and wish them well easily win 5 stars from me.

B0076BOLDS|5.0|I have seen \\"The Iron Lady\\" two times and it was even more enjoyable the second time when viewed at home.  I think it would be a good idea for those who choose to watch the film to force themselves to approach the viewing experience with a completely open mind.  If you already hate and despise Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher but still want to watch this film; then you better find someway to stuff your hatred under a tree or somewhere because the style of this film definitely will not give your hatred blatant justification.  The same goes for anyone who has great respect and admiration for Margaret Thatcher and esteems her as one of the best Prime Ministers ever.  Well sorry Charlie; stuff all your high praise in some boxes and tuck them away somewhere safe because your high praise for her will not receive ample justification in this film either.  The film does not take sides. It doesn't offer an definitive or decisive opinion.  The story isn't told from the liberal perspective or the conservative.  The story is told as a memory from the fictional perspective of an old and ill of health Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  The style of the film is Dickensian in some ways in my opinion.  Meryl Streep is the main attraction here and she is magnificent.  Bravo!
0553801473|4.0|A most challenging but ultimately fruitful read, the high point of which is a jaw-dropping setpiece showcasing a towering humiliation wrought upon Cersei Lannister.  Any Game Of Thrones connoisseur who appreciates the occasional spurt of leaden brutality which suddenly takes a major protagonist from our panoply of characters has to wonder what Benioff and Weiss will do with that material.  Daenerys material somewhat sodden in places, but a late-in-the-novel revisiting from the ghosts of the men in her life (probably the example for the Khal Drogo reappearance in \\"Valar Morghulis\\") provides the sort of true narrative propulsion that the precursor material lacked.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I LOVED these books!!! Who gives a rip if the author was savvy enough to post this story in fanfiction under the guise of Bella and Edward. Just think of the ready-made fans she had when it was published. Genius! If you read these books and you know the Twilight story you know it has NOTHING to do with them. He is not like Edward and She is nothing like Bella. As they meet, it is clear he has never had a loving relationship. She soon teaches him what it is to love. She takes a hurt, abused man and gives him a glimpse of what real love is about. This is not a book about S&M, it is about learning the difference between love, sex and loving sexual expression. It is about two people who learn how to love one another and live life on their own terms. He opens her up and she fills his empty heart. You cannot get better than this. There was some slow places in the second book but I would not trade this reading experience for the world!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|App space on my tablet is 5 gigs. I have 100 megs worth of books in my hands.  So why would a serious reader care that the app takes 12 megs?  It seems to work well enough.  Slow on an Archos, but so is everything.  Lightning fast on a Razr, but what isn't?  Good on Acer A100, including Ice Cream Sandwich.  I don't remember ever seeing it crash, and I read a LOT of technical books.

1936608898|5.0|Someone at lunch said to me today \\"I wish there was a manual for how to eat and be healthy\\" to which I replied, there is.  This is the best health and nutrition book I have ever read.  It makes understanding how food effects your body both positively and negatively so simple it seems silly that it took a book to reveal it.  That's what I love about these guys, this is beautifully simple stuff that they don't make up, they're not trying to sell a gimmick, and they truly have your health in their interests.  Buy this book - you won't regret it.
1600242197|2.0|The audio book narrator was annoying.  To sound \\"folksy\\" and \\"genuine\\" he dropped every 'g' from the ing's.  It just sounds contrived and it gets quite old.<br /><br />Elements of the story can reasonably be questioned, but I suspect that is primarily the fault of the ghost writer who seems to have taken considerable liberties with detailed descriptions of events that it is hard to imagine Marcus would have been able absorb, process and recall.<br /><br />Then there are the long political rants, that point up the irony of fighting for a country and a system of government you don't really understand.<br /><br />Kudos to Marcus for his fortitude and service, but God save the US from ever having the military take over the government...that will be the end.

I did notice that it's recommended for ages 9-14 but I thought, \\"They're smart and resourceful, so they'll love it.\\" In reality, they were overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the pieces and the difficulty level. They soon lost interest in playing with it. I will put it away now until they are older and then bring it out in a few years. The suggested ages are on the box for a reason.
0738727326|5.0|The Shadowscapes Tarot is a spellbinding blend of Old World mysticism and beautiful art. The elegant fantasy paintings of Stephanie Pui-Mun Law whisk you away to an enchanted realm of fairies and woodland spirits. The subtle hues of the watercolor artwork make many of the details difficult to see at a glance, but the hidden realm comes to life upon close inspection, making the cards feel truly magical. Highly recommended for lovers of fairy art.
B000SEGCRS|4.0|This is a very good book for someone who knows the f-stop and appature settings. Mr. Kelby's humor leaves a lot to be desired but getting past that he has lots of good tips for taking great pictures. I didn't realize how much I don't know about the new cameras (having come over from the 35mm film crowd). While the tips are good, a beginner may get lost in some of the terms. But definately a good book to have. I've bookmarked and made notes of the relevent sections and since I have Kindle on my phone, I can just look them up as I'm out (no wife so I don't have to ask). You'll get that one when you read his book. Overall I like it and look forward to putting some of his techniques into practice as soon as I learn my camera better

B007U1FEJE|5.0|As others have correctly stated, this isn't The Beach Boys Today, Pet Sounds, or Sunflower, nor should that have been expected.  For one thing, Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys have over forty years more life under their belts than they did way back when.  Are you the same person you were that many years ago, if you were even alive then?  Yes, the album has some weaker moments, as do all albums.  Even Today, Pet Sounds, and Sunflower had their lesser tracks.  But even most of the \\"filler\\" on this album is much stronger than the weak links that were always a part of previous Beach Boys' (and everybody else's) albums.  Part of Brian's charm is that he takes chances, which means you are going to have some misses, but when he hits, boy does he hit like nobody else.<br /><br />And although it's far too early to reflect upon how this new music will last, it's possible that people will be enjoying it long into the future with the same passion they do when listening to the very best Beach Boys' albums of yesteryear.  The more I listen to it, the more I like the songs that didn't immediately bowl me over, and constant replaying hasn't dimmed any of the pleasures of the songs I was initially blown away by.<br /><br />One of my few quibbles is that I wish Brian, Al, and Bruce had played a few instruments here and there, but considering the results are so stunning as it is, it's barely worth mentioning, especially as studio musicians almost always figured into Brian's past glories.  But listening to Al's singing on \\"From There To Back Again\\" makes me wish that he, Bruce, and Mike had been featured a little more prominently in some of the mixes.  Although I have no quibbles with Brian taking the lead vocals on much of this album, if we should be lucky enough to get another album or two out of The Boys, I hope Al and the others are a little more in the forefront of some of the songs, provided their vocals can stand that spotlight.  Because I heard almost nothing but good from themin this album.<br /><br />While many people have pointed out that Brian is 70 and he doesn't sing like a 25-year-old anymore, have you actually listened to this record?  He sounds like a 35-year-old to me, and a 35-year-old who can sing as beautifully as anyone.  Yes, he slurs a few words here and there as he's done for a long time, but the tone and quality of his voice that set it apart from everyone else when he was barely a man is still present and immediately recognizable.  Heck, Jeff Foskett and his clarion \\"Carl Wilson\\" voice are 56, meaning he's twice as old as the Beach Boys were when they were already somewhat past their prime.  And as an aside, although David Marks doesn't sing, had he not been guitarist on this album, I don't think this \\"event\\" would have been quite as special.  Given that Carl and Dennis are gone, I think David definitely needed to be a part of the reunion, and I'm extremely happy for him.  I would love to know which guitar parts he played.<br /><br />If you give this album the repeated attention it deserves, you will hear some incredibly catchy music and arrangement/production touches that could only have come from Brian and those he's influenced.  No, not every song has that Brian Wilson production stamp on it that one might like, but enough of them do, and the consistency of professionalism that begins from track 1 and ends with track 12 is obvious on first listen.  And I don't think people should really obsess about how much the performances might or might not have been tweaked or enhanced in the studio, as studio magic was always one of the hallmarks of Brian's work.  It's the \\"record\\" that matters -- the final recording that Brian was always concerned with.  And from that standpoint alone, this album is classic Beach Boys all the way.<br /><br />My favorite part of the opening piano-and-voice dominated song, \\"Think About The Days,\\" is the French horn right at the very end.  This is the type of  attention to detail that helps makethis album so rewarding.<br /><br />While initially one of my least favorite songs, the title hit single \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" gets better with each listen, as you get more comfortable with Brian's chord and tempo changes, as well as subtle alterations in the repeats of the vocal parts.  Comparing a song like this to \\"Getcha Back\\" -- a similar-themed and similar-sounding piece -- reveals how much more musical this recording is despite any flaws in lyrics or musical conception (one being a rather obvious modulation on the second \\"a whole new generation\\" that is so atypical of the usually unpredictable Mr. Wilson).  However, the song ends on a high note with another of Brian's amazing vocal tags, the type he has written again and again throughout the years while always offering something different.<br /><br />\\"Isn't It Time\\" and \\"Spring Vacation\\" are basically sunshiney fluff, with typically-forgettable lyrics that hearken back to the earlier years.  But are they beautifully written and performed?  You betcha.  Mike, Al, and Bruce sound great, the harmonies are both exquisite and brilliantly arranged.  The first song has a bridge as good as the chorus (Jeff's beautiful \\"And as the Sun goes down\\"), and Brian's \\"Hall-e-lu-ooo-ooo-ooo-ya\\" in \\"Spring Vacation\\" is priceless.<br /><br />So many people seem to want to pounce on \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue,\\" but I think it's an absolute classic, similar in musical spirit to the great \\"South American\\" from Brian's solo album Imagination.  The lyrics aren't deep, but they aren't supposed to be.  And we don't listen to sunshine pop for the lyrics anyway, which are perfect for the lightness of the song.  Just listen to the music and enjoy.  The chorus is as catchy as anything Brian's written, and reminds me in its own way of \\"California Girls.\\"  It's that good.  Get over the subject matter and immerse yourself in the amazing vocal arrangement and incredible harmonies.  The instrumentation is light and frothy, withthe bridge being short, fun, and makes you want to revisit the song again and again.  Production-wise, the baritone sax that provides the brassy propulsion throughout the song (especially at the end of the bridge) makes this a Wilson classic.<br /><br />\\"Shelter\\" is not one of my favorites, but many people love it, and that's the strength of this album.  If you ask enough people, every song has its devoted fans, with no dogs that everyone wants to pounce on, like \\"Let's Put Our Hearts Together\\" or \\"The TM Song.\\"  The chorus of \\"Shelter\\" is an inversion of \\"Darlin\\" (\\"Don't know if words can say...\\"), with Jeff Foskett supplying his Carl Wilson imitation perfectly.  The other Beach Boys' voices are superb, with and while I feel this song pales compared to some of the others on this album, it would have been one of the best songs on any of the Beach Boys' albums from 1974 onward.  Listen to it and marvel at the fact that no other group has sung like the Beach Boys or offered such amazing vocal arrangements in the history of rock and roll.<br /><br />The weakest song is probably Mike's \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean,\\" but it's much better than many of his tunes, and its biggest faults are that it's too long and that Brian wasn't allowed to produce it all the way through.  If you remove about 1:30 of its over four-minute length, and if Brian could have produced the song from the bottom up, I think it could have been a mini-classic.  It needed a choral bridge rather than the basic instrumental version it received, but even though it's one of the lesser lights on the album, there's very little in it that anyone should be embarrassed about, other than the fact that Mike seems to be off the beat throughout a lot of the song.  The vocal fade is great, with more Carl Wilson sound-alike vocals.  Compare this with \\"Brian's Back\\" or some of the other Mike Love offerings from the past, and this song is miles ahead of most of them.<br /><br />\\"Beaches in Mind\\" needed some extra work, asit's too perfunctory for my ears.  The material we're presented with is superbly produced, and the chorus is definitely melodic, but it just sounds unfinished structurally.  The verse and \\"fun fun fun\\" bridge are not as memorable as what Brian usually composes, and you find yourself just waiting for the chorus to return, which is the best part.  The keyboards are great, and little vocal touches help it stand up to repeated listenings, but I think Brian didn't flesh this one out as well as he could have.<br /><br />\\"Strange World\\" captures everything that is brilliant about Brian Wilson and The Boys.  While it seems to be a simple song, listen to the amazing key change from the piano opening to the first verse.  It sounds wrong the first time you hear it, but right every time thereafter.  The bass playing is terrific, with fun organ stops, and the arrangement of the vocals is astounding.  The chorus is as catchy as anything Brian's ever written - as good as \\"I Get Around,\\" \\"Fun, Fun, Fun,\\" etc. The bridge (\\"Sunday morning\\") is a superb melody as memorable as anything on the album, with the gorgeous vocals after \\"pretty good company\\" being exquisite.  The throwaway line about \\"Yo Te Amo\\" is priceless, and the lyrics are as solid as almost any past Beach Boys song.  Driving strings that might remind one of \\"Cabinessence\\" help close out this amazing track.<br /><br />Obviously, \\"From There to Back Again\\" is the acknowledged classic, from Al Jardine's flawless vocals to the incredible song structure that I still haven't completely figured out.  The starts and stops and changes in mood are simply as good as anything from Pet Sounds, Smile, or Sunflower.  The guitars and drums are straight out of 1966 while still sounding contemporary.  Mike gets in some great vocal touches before Al's whistling, and the harmonies are memorable throughout.  This song definitely belongs in the pantheon of truly great Wilson creations like \\"This Whole World,\\" \\"Surf's Up,\\" etc. In a fair andjust world, it would win a Grammy for Best Song and Best Record, but you know that will never happen.  But I find it hard to believe that anybody else is going to write and produce a better song in all of 2012.<br /><br />The last two tracks on the album, \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summer's Gone,\\" continue the melancholy set by the previous piece, but nobody writes more achingly beautiful \\"sad\\" music than Brian Wilson.  Witness \\"Til I Die.\\"  These two closing songs use different types of harmonies than the sunshine pop ones heard earlier, with great string writing contributing to the effect.  The clip-cloppy percussion of \\"Summer's Gone\\" hearkens back to Pet Sounds, yet not seeming like a retread.  The lyrics of both songs are poetic and touching.  The perfect way to end the album.<br /><br />I cannot picture how anyone can give this album a one-, two-, or three-star rating unless they just like to rile people up by deliberately making stupid comments.  Just listen to this album as finished product rather than as a statement about who the Beach Boys were or still are.  This was music meant to move you emotionally or spiritually, or just to help bring some beauty and joy to your life.  On merely that last part, \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" delivers the goods, and for that reason alone it's a five-star CD.  Had it been made 10, 20, or even 40 years ago, it would be just as good.  It's not as wonderful as it is simply because we never thought we'd hear anything from The Beach Boys again, or because we thought that if we ever did, it would be as disappointing as MIU or Still Cruisin.<br /><br />This new album is as rewarding a listening experience as it is because the songs are mostly very solidly crafted, the vocal arrangements sparkle, and the production and performances are blemish-free.  While not every song is in the top tier of classic Brian Wilson productions, some of them are, and the rest are still as good or better than 95% of anything new you'll likelyhear on the radio from any other artists.  I simply can't remember the last time I listened to a record over and over and over and enjoyed it equally every time.  Oh, yes I do.  It was when Brian presented Smile to us about eight years ago.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I have no problem with unhappy endings. I have a problem with the lack of character development and the lack of meaningful character interaction.  Tragedy should have brought the characters closer together while alive. That it drove them apart (apart from Peeta's special circumstances) was inconsistent with the themes of the first two books.<br /><br />Furthermore, I found the first-person narration, which was used well in the first two books, became a crutch for Collins to become lazy. It's almost if Collins felt she was running out of paper, and had to squeeze everything into the last 75 pages or so.<br /><br />Katniss was told about Snow's death (Katniss said \\"no one cared\\" how Snow died, which is beyond all suspension of disbelief). Katniss was told about her own trial. Even in a kangaroo court, the defendant is present. But not in Mockingjay, because Collins didn't want to describe the trial.<br /><br />After two of the most engrossing books I've ever read, this was a huge letdown. It seems to me to be a lazily written book that was much more of a sermon than a novel. That sad part is, this would have been a better sermon if it were a better novel.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I downloaded this app for the reading programs. I knew I wanted to read the entire Bible but wasn't sure how to go about it in the best and most enjoyable way. I love that it gives me reminders and lets me catch up when I've missed a day.
0553582038|3.0|In this installment of the series, Martin for some reason decided to completely leave out several important characters, including Dany, Tyrion, and Bran. (Which nearly ruined the book for me; they're three of my favorite characters.) This had the effect of making the novel seem incomplete. Not only was there no mention of what was happening on and beyond the Wall and in Dany's burgeoning kingdom, there was also no true ending to the book. Things felt unfinished, or rather, nothing came to a climax. I didn't expect all loose ends to be wrapped up in the fourth book of a seven-book series, but this one lacked the sense of finality of the previous three.<br /><br />On top of that, a large chunk of the book was devoted to Cersei, who, when her thoughts were finally exposed, became an almost cartoonish villain. Every decision she made for \\"her\\" kingdom was ridiculously foolish, she connived to murder children and holy men, she hired a mad scientist serial killer. She was completely unrelatable; even her thoughts for her own children were self-centered. Every chapter from her point of view was torture (no pun intended).<br /><br />And then there was that chapter devoted to a new character who later on was killed. This character got only one chapter, and then died. Why this chapter was not told from the point of view of another person in the same chapter who lived to see another day, I have no clue.<br /><br />Overall, the book was unsatisfying and disappointing on several levels. Important characters were ignored, other characters were turned into boring caricatures, and nothing was resolved. By far the weakest of the four I've read so far, but still worth reading if you're a fan of the series.
0345803485|2.0|As a prospective writer, it is sad to think that this book made a best-seller's list.  The story lacked everything:  Realistic characters, originality, good writing (I've seen worse, but this is a close second).  This author did her research only by watching The Thomas Crown Affair (the one with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo), and reading and watching the Twilight Saga.  Even the glider scene was spot on from the movie (TTCA).  The reason I read this book (the whole book) was because of all the hype about it.  I wanted to know if it was that good.  When I started reading it I realized there wasn't much to this book, but I was hoping and waiting for a good part, something original, something that would make me want to read the Trilogy (two more books of this torture? really?); but at the end I was just as disappointed.  There have been cases of books and stories that you read, and it isn't until the end that you get to the creamy center, the juicy part and you want more.  Unlike Anastasia, I do not want more of this TORTURE.  I wish I could take the time (and the money) I spent reading that book back, but I guess I would just have to resign to at least learning how NOT to write a book.

030758836X|5.0|I literally could not put this down.  I loved the author's style, it was a fast, fun, and easy read.  Yes, it did get a bit \\"bawdy\\" in parts but I think it was necessary for character developement.  As I got near the end I was actually walking down a busy city street trying to finish it.  My family had to actually take my kindle away from me!  The ending sort of fizzled, maybe just a hair, but there was no way that the story could have kept on going at it's pace.  Loved it and reccommended to many friends!
B007IJDXFK|4.0|The music was very pretty. I never heard any other Anathema songs (was quite surprised they used to be doom metal), so I'm coming into this with fresh ears.<br /><br />I thought it was very refreshing to hear. Overall, I liked most of it. The melodies were very pretty, emotional, and ethereal. Each song leads into the next one. It's more folk-music than rock. The lyrics also are very pop-rock<br /><br />I would have given it an extra star, but the songs do get a little repetitive.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|It is rare to find a true horror picture without all the \\"slash-n-gash\\" of so many today.  It is ever rarer to find a horror picture that will give me goosebumps.  Add those two to Daniel Radcliffe and a sure fire winner has been made.<br /><br />This movie had my husband and myself spellbound from the get-go.  The spooky setting, the period piece, it was all well done.  The acting was superb.  The entire movie was very intense, but I advise you not to watch it alone.  We did a second viewing a week later, and it still gave us goosebumps, and we watch many horror/ghost stories.  The ending was wonderful, it....well, you'll just have to watch it and see for yourself.

B001OMJGD0|3.0|I was most worried at the time about the actor pulling it off. Considering the story given, Routh did a great job. I thought he was fantastic as Superman. The problem ended up being everything else! No super villain to fight, so it was Superman playing Captain Planet dealing with disasters in nature. Bosworth who could have been good if written differently was a Mom as Lois. I never bought the storyline or the way they wrote her. Spacey was too much like Hackman. I mean like a clone. There was corporate Lex like that of the animated series, Lois and Clark, or even Smallville.<br /><br />Routh=good<br /><br />Rest=mediocre
0345803485|5.0|I got this book after hearing about it from friends who liked it.  Boy, were they right.  Once starting to read it, I found myself not wanting to put it down.  I thought just one more page, then another, after another.  I read it anytime, I had free time to do so. I finshed it in no time.  I wanted to start the other book, Fifty Shades Darker.  Great book, a must read!
B003L77GG0|1.0|The show worked at its core when Jonathan Kent was still on and you had father and son moments. The dynamic of him with his parents made the show like you'd expect an early start of Clark's life to be. Somehow by season 10, they got wayyyyyy off track! The whole blue blur crap, and Clark looking like the only idiot alien who is afraid to fly... It just got bad.<br /><br />The finale was pretty pathetic in that you don't see him in the full suit. They just cgi (and bad cgi) him into a crappy costume that you get a glimpse as he helps a plane ala Reeve/Routh from the movies.<br /><br />EWWW stay away from this one folks and wait for the \\"Man of Steel\\" movie starring Henry Cavill.
0345529057|5.0|These books had been suggested to me by my adult son. I am a great fan of adventure, fantasy, and adventure books. I especially like to read series which maintains characters from book to book. These books are all of that and then some.  Enjoying authors Jim Clancy, Vince Flynn, David Eddings, Stephen Hunter, Frank Herbert, etc., I find George R.R. Martin equally a good story teller. If you enjoy the authors I mentioned, I believe you will enjoy these books. Be ready for a \\"long\\" read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard about the book my first thought was that even though it sounded interesting I most likely would not purchase it. The reason was that I thought there would be alot of violence in the book. Since my daughter fell in love with the series of the 3 books, and recommended them saying there was not much violence at all, I decided to buy it. Well, she was right. I was completely caught up in the story and it was very difficult to put the book down. Now I am also enjoying the second book, \\"Catching Fire\\".
B00881VLCE|5.0|It's fun to do these puzzles. They are colorful and you can find some that are beautiful too.A wide variety of subject matter. Very enjoyable.
B004BA4E4I|3.0|ok im a huge fan of shaun of the dead and all the movies with nick frost and simon pegg. and i still love this movie but honestly the special edition steel case is not really special at all. the only thing special about it is the case there are no extra special features and no cool bluray menu. the menu on this is really dumb the one on the dvd is wayyy cooler. but if you find a cheap used copy and you dont have the bluray then its worth it otherwise just get the regular bluray version.
B001L63JC8|5.0|Previous Gabriel-era Genesis albums, for me, have better singles in that they can stand on their own and bring you back to listen over and over again. The Lamb however achieves such a status not within any one sum of its parts but as a singular creation. The guys in Genesis have their complaints about this album due to the events transpiring at the time, but even they can't deny that the overall sound is wonderful and that the songs are genius.
B007NYODBS|3.0|After seeing this movie I was surprised to remember that the play had won a Tony Award. So I can't blame the writing.  And I can't blame the actors, they are all first rate.  I can only assume that Polanski, who did the impossible, got a bad performance from Jody Foster, is to blame for the bad timing and lack of funny.  I am guessing he did not trust his actors and didn't really get the material, particularly the American characters.  Just for one example, did he ever hear the expression passive aggressive?<br />Oh well, what a missed opportunity.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this game. im absolutely addicted. i even get my 3 yr old playing too. highly recommend, its great.
B00845PT18|1.0|Oh, this was dreadful. I'm a comic book movie fan (usually) and I have a really high threshold for \\"ouch,\\" but this really hurt. Nicholas Cage has had pretty much two roles I could recommend someone watch and this was neither of them. Every character in this movie feels like they're right about to laugh but saving us all from it.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't paid even the $3.99 to rent this. Ow.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I bought the book because of all the noise and advertising around it. Unfortunately, I realized pretty soon I had become a victim of advertising. It was very disappointing; very poorly written and honestly I wasn't able to finish it. It was the worst buying decision I ever made...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game. Just wish that the pachinko lever worked a lil better<br />I think that the levels are very difficult if you don't buy the in game credits so be prepared to spend a couple bucks
B0013AZLP0|4.0|For some unknown reason, this album downloaded at a much louder volume than any other download. The soundtrack itself is great. You don't even have to close your eye's to feel you are in the scenes of the movie. Wish me luck, for I am re-downloading the album as I speak.
B00005JLR2|5.0|The movie was a hit.  It was a replacement for a damaged dvd that we had so we knew what we were getting.  The biggest plus was the purchase price and shipping costs made it less expensive than going to the corner store and purchasing it.  Way to go Amazon!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|just bought immediately after opening it wants Four dollars and ninety-nine cents for a 'office compatibility' pack!!! misleading tell us.this b4 buying?? I hate misleading companies. hope u guys go under and u learn a lesson. I want my money back.
B004G6009K|5.0|I note that many reviewers give this 3 or 4 star rating and I am really mystified as this is as wonderful as Beauty and the Beast. It has 4 ( or more) songs all of which are top notch. If it had a eight songs or more, I imagine others might rate it a bit better. The song that is sung in the tavern will have you laughing outloud, absolutely guarenteed. This is one of the greatest animated films of all time and I never cease to be amazed with the wonderful 3D every time I view it. If you own Beauty and the Beast and love it, this is for you.  I find the horse, Maximus to be more comical with every viewing. They do place him on the cover and, rightfully so, because this is one of the great sidekicks in movie history. The life-like motion capture technique is masterful here and it shows in every scene, particularly with the expressions on the faces of the characters. If you are on the fence on this one, plunk down your money and get ready for some fabulous family entertainment. Little girls will love this. Five Stars for this humble viewer.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my sister. I really enjoyed it could not put it down waiting to see what would happen next and still not wanting it to end. I had never read anything by Jo Jo Moyes but will certainly research her in the very near future
B008AZZAT8|5.0|I love this app it is so fun for all ages you can choose any colorful and you get to make the color it is great
B004EPZ03Y|4.0|The film is a freshed update of the Muppets, but it ultimately falls to flat as it drifts from the core of Muppet Show look and feel. Still, a fun film, especially if you're jonesin' for some flackback Muppets and goofy humans.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game! Fun and adicting! I have used this app more than any other and have difficulties putting it down.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|While the first season frequently felt formulaic, the second seemed to find a groove. A small pool of recurring characters was established that made the show feel like a more complete universe and having established the show's concept the episodes took more chances in structure and storytelling.<br /><br />It helped perhaps that some of the underlying stories began to surface and demons particularly in the form of yellow eyes became the clear antagonists.<br /><br />But also killing off the brothers father gave the two actors some nice meaty emotions to chew on and gave their actions and decisions increased resonance.<br /><br />It got dark too at times. Particularly in _Heart_ where Sam is faced with an impossible choice and asked to do something he has resisted for two seasons.<br /><br />Supernatural is not a happy show. The moments of humor with the brother mask a tone of desperation and possible futility as the odds seem to stack up higher against them... even when they win.
B0051YGX6U|5.0|** Only Mildly Spoilery**<br /><br />Well, I've watched seasons 3 through 5 on Amazon Instant. This was just an amazing season, even though it was shorter than the previous. I'm looking forward to Season 7, and hopefully some redemption for Cas.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Vitor Cheng has a lot of experience on Case Interviews, and the book uses a very clear language, making the concepts very easy to understand. i recommend this book to anyone who is interested on getting a job on a top consulting firm.
0985114606|1.0|I can not believe they even allowed this book to be published. This author basically took fifty shaded of grey and changed very little about the book and called it her own. Anyone could do this and call themselves a Author!
B0079J28NC|5.0|It was silly when I was nine years old, but I loved it. It is still silly now that I'm 53 years old. I still love it. Not sure if this is about me or the movie...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This isn't the worst story I've ever read, but it is the worst published piece of work I've read. The characters are thinly-veiled versions of the series they were pulled from, every other line is full of repetitive adjectives, and Christian is a glorified stalker. This book needed to see a lot more red ink before it ever made it to the hands of the public. Like another reviewer said, this reads like it was written by a teenager. If we're to the point of publishing fanfiction, there are some brilliant stories out there that actually deserve to be sold.<br /><br />Additionally, I sincerely hope that the thousands of girls who read this book realize that, much like Twilight, the primary relationship in the book is unhealthy, abusive, and should be avoided at all costs. BDSM is one thing; being a stalker is another entirely.<br /><br />TL;DR: It's good for a laugh at what passes as literature these days, but that's about it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I like reading books about single women (like me) who achieve tremendous things. I guess this inspires me. This book seemed right up my alley because there was a time I really wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail, end to end.<br /><br />I DID like the book, although I don't think it was a blockbuster for me. Possibly because i found it a little hard to relate to some of her experiences, like cheating on what seemed like a pretty decent guy, shooting up heroin, hiking with so little money or enduring the excruciating pain of poorly fitting boots. I'm not sure I would have continued with my feet in that condition.<br /><br />I did like reading about the day to day stuff on the trail, and I liked her reaction and accounting of meeting some bad dudes on the trail, as well as the good ones.<br /><br />Really liked the cover art, too. It brought me back to my hardcore backpacking and hiking days.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|For those interested in the 3D, foremost, Prometheus 3D was filmed with 3D cameras, not converted from a 2D source. The filmmakers did a splendid job with the parallax (3D layers) in most scenes, but don't search for pop out of the screen moments, as this isn't designed as such. Depth reaches far into the screen as would be expected with any 3D film.<br /><br />The 3rd dimension surely gives this horror/sci fi film an extra layer of dimension, transporting you into the exploration of these scientists searching for the origin of the human species, as they so grimly discover. The plethora of gory horror moments are as real as they can get thanks to the well implemented and very effective 3D.<br /><br />Does the 3D look as good as Avatar 3D? No, but it's a very pleasant 3D experience for sure, and a few good notches above most average quality 3D movies. There are scenes that really highlight the 3D, and most of the film conveys impressive 3D layers.<br /><br />For the movie itself, if you enjoyed the original Alien, there is no reason you won't enjoy this patient but tense horror/sci fi film, fairly reminiscent of the original nightmare discovery of Weaver's crew in many aspects.<br /><br />3D: Strong 3D throughout.<br />3D Parallax: Nicely done.<br />3D Depth: Good depth.<br />3D Pop Outs: Few if any to remember.<br />Overall 3D: 9/10.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the 3D. Recommended? YES
B0088TG252|4.0|I liked it. I thought it was entertaining right to the bitter end. :-) I would recommend this movie if your an action pact kind of person. Is it worthy of an Oscar, probably not.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a gift but she said she liked it. It was a gift but she said she liked it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|When I found out this app was now on kindle fire I was so exited! I love this game and now I can play it anywhere and everywhere!!!!!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|The graffics are splendid, my only complaint would be that you can't zoom in but other than that its definitely worth the price!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is an insane game in my opinion! I like how you use your hand and then slide it to make your person move a way, you would have to be crazy not to get this game!
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|On my first few spins of this record, i was just like a kid: \\"Another new cd from Megadeth, woo hooo.\\" But the magic disappeared very quick. This release does have one or two really good songs like Sudden Death, Public Enemy, Deadly Nightshade, but that's it. Is great to have the original bassist back in the line up, but is always to go back and listen to Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction, Youthanasia (revisited), Peace sells,So far so good so what; those were the days.!
B001E45XT4|4.0|This headset is awesome quality for the price, high quality, only down fall is that i tend to overheat well wearing them
B0086700CM|5.0|me and my dad love this game so much my dad  plays it when ever he can  so if you' re reading this get it while its free
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is really fun to play because you get to use different ppl. and ect. so if you love games where you have to go threw a lot of obsiciles. you will love temple run alot.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for the app store to have this game. it's so much cooler on the kindle compared to an ipod. it force closes sometimes but not frequently, its a really enjoyable game. everyone should download it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|So glad I put this on my tbr list, now it's going onto my read again list!<br />I can't wait to read the next book!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is totally worth full price even though I paid 99&cent; for it. I got it for my kindle fire and it is like having Microsoft office onnit. this app has no issues. it is a must get. thanks amazon! :)
B0012GMWCU|5.0|This CD is a must own. Dixon delivers with power and feeling putting the listener right in a chair next to him.
B0086700CM|2.0|I didn't like it to motion sensative hate it don't get worst game ever its way better on the I pod
B000XR4OC0|1.0|i bought these three months ago and loved them! i wore it often and it went well with my outfits. they were super comfortable so i walked around in them quite a bit.<br /><br />HOWEVER.... both my shoes have holes in them now, what a waste of money!! i really like their cause, mission, the style of the shoes, the comfort but the durability and quality sucks.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|It's very low budget and there's only one well known (but now unrecognizable) actor in the movie but it was an interesting combination of vampire and zombie apocalypse.  The acting was quite good, the plot was interesting and they had a little plot twist that I found unique and fun.  If you like apocalyptic road movies with flesh/blood eating monsters, then this is worth viewing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was searching for the next book to pass my time.  Didn't expect to find a book that made my time irrelivent. Each \\"book\\" flys by and leaves you wanting to continue. Great premise. Fantastic tone and mood.  I have 5 people I read with now flipping through the omnibus.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it. Not only the sex but the story and the way the characters interacted with one another.  Unlike \\"the honor student\\" the story flowed and you could understand what the author was talking about.  This to me was not pornographic, it was a story being told about two people falling in love that happen to have a great sex life together.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|oh my goodness thisd was the best book I have EVER read and i am really picky about my books anyway Suzanne  describes every detail so descriptivly it feels like you are right there witnessing it or for me I fet like I was Katniss myself.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After reading some reviews about this book I decided to purchased to see what was the hopla about it. I just couldnt stop reading. The book was exciting and very sexual. I can see why people just couldnt stop reading. I only have wish that the author has put more sustance to the story for the main two characters. Sex is nice and exciting but too much.... well.... gets boring.
B0031RS542|4.0|This is more a series of interweaving stories than a novel, but it is still a vastly entertaining journey through the life of Ram Mohammad Thomas - a young, orphaned and poverty stricken waiter who wins a fortune on a game show and is then arrested when accused of cheating. When the lawyer, Smita Shah, rushes in to rescue him from torture, he ends up explaining how he managed to answer all the questions successfully and simply through good luck. Each chapter of the book corresponds to a question and explains how his life gave him the answer.<br /><br />The author weaves young Ram's life backwards and forwards, introducing us to a cast of characters that appear throughout the book - the kindly Father Timothy who took him in as a baby and gave him his religiously tolerant name, his best friend Salim, his beloved Nita and others. The cast of characters include hired assassins, out of work Bollywood actresses, Australian's with a mania for spying on people, voodoo priestesses and more. Overall this is a really fun read and you are really rooting for Ram to beat the system (for once) and emerge victorious. The author has since written another novel,[[ASIN:B0031RS8US Six Suspects]] , which I also look forward to reading.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|So many great tracks! I have been a fan of Melody for YEARS and this album is stellar. Its a bit more of a beach vibe jazz album, but I think that's why it sticks out to me and is pleasant to turn on at any time of day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the levels of points needed to unlock each game keeps you coming back for more, however a lot of the games are very slow
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I have not watched the DVDs yet but my wife (for whom they were purchased)has watched them several times and she seems to enjoy them.
B0086700CM|5.0|Consuming game. Plenty of fun and action. One really does not need to purchase extras since it is well designed.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I am using this miracle little thing with my Audio-Technica ATH-PRO700MK2 Professional DJ Monitor headphones.The diffrence is like day and night.I always love my headphone but I love my headphones 100 times more now.I can feel power and clearity of sound.Worth buying if you have power hunger headphones like mine,don`t wait longer.I don`t need more than that.Esy to use.HIGHLY RECOMENDED.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy  &amp; fun! I love that I can create my own card image w/my photos.  I would recommend getting this free app.
B006ZJJ6XW|5.0|I recently purchased this Beethoven set and I am very pleased with it. I own all four Karajan cycles, Furtwangler, Bohm, Walter, Toscanini, Szell and many more and think this is one of the best. The sound is weighty, rich and natural and without any glare, very lp like.  Leinsdorf's interpretations are generally measured in terms of tempi, are beautifully balanced with prominent winds, crystal clear bass lines and overall a beautiful balancing of orchestral voices. He conducts beethoven like a great architect. Rhythmically articulate, nothing is ever slurred, attacks of the orchestra have a wonderful unanimity, things are never brash or overbearing such as the finale of the 5th but still are powerfully projected. If any criticism is to be made it is from time to time there is a lack of exuberance and joy in certain movements such as the opening movement of the 7th which is taken at a very measured tempo and has somewhat reigned in quality and Leinsdorf's Eroica is somewhat prosaic compared to Karajan's Furtwangler's, or Toscanini's, wanting in ultimate fire and brio. The cycle is capped by a very fine 9th which is more in the Toscanini tradition with fiery attacks and fleet tempi and great singing in the finale.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It's a fun game just wished I knew how to delete someone, also more Colors needed to start off instead of just 4. Overall its a fun game.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|its average. you don't even fight pigs! hey I mean I know its Rio version but its very hard and the monkeys never die. I say only $0.99 why not. but just to tell you other angry birds are better.
0071762345|5.0|Solid book with some awesome concepts.  Really helped me to understand as someone who doesn't have a lot of experience with social media.  Easy to read
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I'm a huge angry bird fan. This app is really great. I love updates and since I got it its updated 2 times. watch the movie located on main menu. it tells how they got into space (pigs included)<br />  SPOILER ALERT<br /> new bird made out of ice. it can freeze anything it touches.
B000AP2ZDK|1.0|This isn't donuts at all, it's just some rap album. I guess the CD is kind of shaped like a donut, but that doesn't really count, does it? If I ate that I'd go to the hospital. Highly disappointed.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Well it was going just fine, but now it doesn't even come on anymore. It has a black screen and it just goes off of it and back to my home screen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I this game is awesome but sorda to hard and they need to change somethings about it like boy to get xp to lvl up
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app passes time easy and my two year old son can play some of them as well. I would suggest this to anyone looking for fun games to play.
030758836X|5.0|Just excellent.  I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.  Am buying her other two books right now . . .
B005LAIGNC|5.0|I was excited to see the movie when it first came out in the theaters, and even more excited when the bluray came in the mail.<br /><br />The story is a bit cheesy, and usually I have a very low threshold for cheese in my movies, but this movie handles it rather well. The characters, though a bit one dimensional at times, and very well acted and compelling. The story is straightforward and has a rather classic villain in a pilot with a large scar across his face, but the real villain is the racism and poor treatment from the other officers and pilots.<br /><br />The action sequences are gorgeous, and if you have a decent sound setup for your home theater (or decent headphones) the sound design for those gorgeous planes is amazing.<br /><br />If you can take a good helping of cheese with your movies this is a fun, light adventure tale that would make for a good evening.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|When this \\"New\\" Sherlock Holmes movie series was first announced, I thought old Doyle would be turning over in his grave, but I gave it a viewing and appreciated this new \\"style\\" of Sherlock Holmes obviously designed to appeal to a new younger generation. This second installment had the usual \\"Explosions and chases\\" of our modern movie system, where even the year 1891 can be made to look very fast paced with modern morals and Victorian style \\"warrior women\\", the fictional mythology of modern cinema.<br />These things being said, the movie is remarkably plotted, taking a new angle on the \\"Final Problem\\" of the original written account. Downey and Law work very well together and the supporting cast is excellent. This movie follows the first in visual effects of the dirt of London street life, the peculiar Zimmer music hinting at Bohemian melodies, and conveys a sense of class in scenes from Mozart's Don Giovanni drama (imitating Amadeus?) with the exact scene of King Leopold and subsequent dragging down to hell. Another scene seems to be stolen straight from \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" where Watson's former room has been converted into a \\"conspiracy map\\", similar to the garage scene in the Russel Crowe movie.<br />There are several curiousities in this work, one of which is the use of an 1889 Oswald Wirth Tarot Deck by Holmes when he consults a gypsy, and camoflauge techniques by Holmes that in the beginning are a reminder of \\"Robin and Marian\\" with apologies to Sean Connery. We are given a hint of the Diplomacy era prior to World War 1 (The Fall of Eagles?) The Arms of Krupp? As Holmes races across Europe trying to figure out the plan of the Evil mastermind. The result is a final encounter at a new and fashionable castle overlooking \\"Reichenbach Falls\\". A Chess match (late 1800s style pieces) between Holmes and the Professor transfers to a mental game and the end is , well if you had read the original work you know the ending!<br />There are a few interesting Bonus materialsincluded! Nicely done overall.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie is obviously a propaganda piece for the U.S. military, but it is an extremely well shot, paced, and written propaganda piece that I enjoyed immensely.<br /><br />The first thing you notice about this movie is that the cinematography is some of the best in any action movie in a long time. The way its shot gives the movie immediacy and a very stylish quality.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is that the story is actually well layered and written, and lacks the \\"GO AMURICA!\\" quality that I was expecting. The bad guys aren't stereotypes, and the settings range across the world.<br /><br />The acting from the SEALs is kind of weak, but they do try hard, and the Senior Chief is seriously awesome to watch.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fantastic action film about some seriously brave people, and can get past some of the overt patriotism. Its truly fantastic!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It looks great on my kindle and is spool easy to figure out-there's no guess work needed.<br /><br />I can see everything and am not lost.
0439023521|5.0|A strong \\"coming of age\\" female character is welcome. This is my favorite book of the trilogy. Being an older, Appalachian female, I can relate to many of the obstacles Katniss experienced, which later became her strengths.My father, too, was a coal miner and the bonds and commaraderie of miners are key in the independent-mindedness of this character. The political aspects of exploitation of District 12's natural resources is a familiar theme here in WV. This would be an excellent book to teach young adults how \\"the system\\" works; how leaders can spin events to their advantage; question who is really in control. I also was impressed that the romantic element was present, but not overplayed.Who wasn't confused at this age anyway? This book works on a number of levels that may not be obvious to the younger reader. I will have more to say about the following 2 books.
B005CFWL2S|5.0|My sister bought this super pair of CROCS, she's happy with the purchase so I want to buy these too but another colour inspite of the fact I've alredy bought 2 different models' crocs (I don't have any on the pump). My sister told she wore it more than any other shoes on her vocation in Turkey and she would highly recommended it:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and solo addiction. I play it for hours I cant put it down. I reccomend it to everyone. there's not one bad thong about this game.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I like to the game very much. !!wow angry bird. very very lovely to (angry bird) game I love you***@_@
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is a fun game to play.  The only thing I don't like are the ad's popping up after every game ending.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This B@W movie brings Ayn Rands novel to life. The screenplay written by Rand herself, has strong performances by everyone involved and directed by king Vidor. Great camera angles and fast paced script will keep you glued to the chair. The story of a man with conviction and principles and how almost everyone around him was trying to make him give in. The age old story of someone thinking outside of the box and pressure society puts on one to conform. Will the woman that loves him and the news paper magnet that admires him abandon him during his hour of need just when it seems that the entire city is against him ? Watch the movie and find out. The ending is said to have the longest speech ever made in a movie. A inspiring movie for anyone that doesn't fall for the propaganda that we are all one big happy family on mother earth and you must sacrifice for the rest of us. The World is still in a orgy of self sacrifice.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is amazing for everyone it really fun game get it now before it cost. and when you play thank the people that made it
B008469DGY|3.0|This would have been a great game if only it would have allowed you to actually play a course. You only shoot for hole in ones and never get to actually put the ball in the hole. For a game with such nice looking graphics, it lacked in the one place it should have excelled. I like playing courses and this game could have easily made that a reality. An almost great game.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Where do you go to get your money back? This game will not load. Just reloads and keeps doing that. Went through 3 times and still nothing. Is any one else having issues? It's a shame. Does anyone else have any ideas on how to get it to download right on your kindle fire.

B008469DGY|5.0|It is a seriously fun game. It reminds me of Angry Birds in a way - except you shoot with the ability to control your ball towards the target.
1469984202|5.0|This was a surprise to me. It's really something to find a new twist on post-apocalyptic fiction and right now especially not something geared to  \\"The Hunger Games\\" audience. This is an adult novel, incredibly crafted and well-written. I could feel the claustrophobia of the settlement in the silo, it was starting to make me a little nuts thinking about being confined in there with all those people and animals and life going on for a couple of hundred years as if that was the way it always was. It reminded me quite a bit of A Canticle for Leibowitz which is high praise since that is on of the best books I ever read.<br /><br />I have part five left to finish and I have been putting it off because I simply do not want it to end. I cannot believe that this book has not had a major release with a publisher and that movie rights have not been sold. It is probably the best book I have read all year maybe in the past five years.<br /><br />The writing is so polished it's like REAL writing, not the stuff that masquerades as writing these days. It is of the classic sci-fi genre. Makes me recall why I fell in love with books like this in the first place.
B0086HJW76|4.0|The CD is like only 37 minutes long.  Maybe he could have done a cover of Freedom To Stay by Waylon Jennings. (I only added the second sentence because the review has to be at least 20 words long)
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun, challenging free app! The controls are unique and use you whole device. I could see this being developed into something bigger.
0790731509|5.0|I love this movie. Paul is wonderful and yes cool. This is a classic. A must see for fans of Paul Newman and a great addition to your collection . Thanks to Amazon for making it availible.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|there really needs to be more variety in the boarders and more things to choose from and the effects could be a little better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This will be a short review - after all, there have been a lot of LONG reviews written, and there's really not much else for me to say that already hasn't been said!<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed the first book of this trilogy. This is the first book I've read in a long time that has kept my attention (since the Harry Potter series and some Dan Brown novels). The only disappointing part was turning to the last page!<br /><br />I'm hoping the next two books are just as good!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|i love it because u can play with your friends or play with some random person who you dont know at all.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|When I got to know that this book is for free, I thought it is going to be something which may not be fully useful. But when I read it I was totally mistaken. The book gives a brilliant perspective and I really really thank the author. I always follow his emails and they were great tips. Thanks a lot Mr. Victor Cheng!
0061992860|4.0|Contains lots of good information, very useful and could come in handy and it's small size you can put in about any pocket you have
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I got it it was really fun but when the new planet's. came there was ten level and the rest coming soon so not worth $2.00
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I've seen both the Swedish version and this American version. I've read the entire trilogy.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of subtitles but even with that handicap the Swedish version was far better. The acting in this version was very good but the script was bastardized in many places. The director and his ego obviously thought his story was better than the original. He was very wrong. If his version was a book it probably wouldn't have done as well as the original. Watch it for the acting but be prepared to be disappointed if you've already read the book.. Watch the Swedish version for the acting and the story as it follows the book very well and you won't be disappointed.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game its truly a great time passer add me my id is: soulshade22, and I don't see why so many people complained about the money issues ( the jewels)  I have yet to have the pop ups u can only get them by clicking on it.
030758836X|5.0|I am a fan of true crime TV and murder mysteries and this book did not disappoint!I found this book very interesting, with some twists and turns that I expected and could see coming, but as it got closer to the end, I did not expect the twist and turns that came.<br />Book left me a little creeped out (especially since I am about to get married!)but it will stay with me and make me think, which is a quality I enjoy in a book.<br />This book was on par with her other books, Dark Places and Sharp Objects....I thoroughly enjoy this author and hopes she keeps writing more books!
0439023521|5.0|I started reading it just because everyone was reading it and wanted to know what it was about and got hooked on the moment I started reading it...<br />I recommend it!
0060833459|4.0|The book is a quick reference in terms of leangth but concise and meaningful. It is suitable for executives with hectic schedules and students at graduate level.
