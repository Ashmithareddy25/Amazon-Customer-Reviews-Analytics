B004BRQYJ4|5.0|One of my most favourite soundtracks ever. Cher and Christine enthrall, thrill, and seduce with those powerhouse voices. Pure brilliance.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|I really loved this movie, to me it was lyrically fantastic and it had some really good acting and singing in some parts. The story line is my favorite and this is probably my third time watching it! :)

B004VMUS9G|5.0|downloaded this for my kindle.  It's a free app that is easy to use, ads are not obnoxious. this app does what you need it to do. Alarm tones all sound like steel drums, but that's part of the charm.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never been the person to sit down and read a book. I had heard so many good things about the fifty trilogy that I thought I would give book one a shot. I read all three in one week! That's saying a lot for me. I could not put them down. I loved the way this book played out and ended. I'm really hoping the auther is inspired to write more! Definitely a must read!!
1476733953|4.0|Very tantalizing! Never heard of the author before, purchased the \\"Wool Series\\" based on Amazon reviews. I must say the reviews helped a great deal! This book was what I was looking for in a post-war ravaged world where humans struggle to find the truth about their existence. This author was very descriptive and left you wanting more. Will read \\"Shift\\" and \\"Dust\\", the last two books in the series. I highly recommend them!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was heartrending.  My chest actually hurt at times--both good and bad--because this book is intense.  I was so sad for E and seriously pissed at G for awhile there, but how could you not forgive him after finding out the reason for it (made my heart ache in a good way)?  I get why he stayed silent, but he could have given E more information so that she wasn't in such pain while still achieving his purpose.  Sorry--gotta be cryptic in order to not give it all away.<br /><br />Near the end we finally get some more back story on G, and it's awful (one of the bad heartache parts), but IMO, not any worse than what E survived.  I'm not belittling his pain or experience (as I said, it was painful reading it), but I'm just not sure why he wouldn't tell her before that point, knowing what he did about her own experience.  Whatever. I guess it might be more difficult for a man to admit that kind of thing, especially a man like him, and especially to his woman.  I liked the rock star drama thrown in to the mix (he totally deserved that taste of his own medicine!), but it kind of just petered out 3/4 of the way through without any real resolution.  More to come from B?  Those are a few things that kind of bothered me, but that was the point--they are the same things that bothered E, too.<br /><br />While a great deal of the story made me sad or furious, there were still a few really beautiful moments and some hot encounters (sometimes it was both beautiful and hot!) that made up for all the angst.  G&E make some real strides in their relationship in this volume, even if at times it feels like they regress to new lows (and that's confusing--you'll see).<br /><br />I don't have any critiques of the writing...pretty much flawless.  All in all, an excellent follow-up to Bared to You.  Even though I want to dive right in, I'll have to wait awhile before I take on Entwined with You.  Now that the series is extended to five books, it's going to be way too long a waitfor Captivated by You and I'll need a G fix in the meantime. :)

B00F91G5BS|2.0|It's played out to mention that the movie has nothing to do with the book, but let me just flog that dead horse one more time.<br /><br />Also, it's just one of the most aggressively stupid movies I've sat all the way through in a while, and not in a fun way.

0670026638|5.0|Time has come today...and so it was and so it will be.  Ruth Ozeki's imaginative and delightful book has easily taken its place as one of my very favorite books of the year.<br /><br />The narrative interweaves two stories:  that of teenage Nao, whose family turn-of-fortunes has forced her to return from Silicon Valley to a cramped Tokyo apartment and an unforgiving school setting where she is bullied and tortured by classmates.  Gradually sinking into depression, Nao's only respite is a summer stay with her great-grandmother Jiko, a Zen Buddhist who encourages her to develop her own \\"supapawa\\" (superpower). Her father's suffering is equally pronounced yet more hidden, as his feeble attempts at suicide rock her world.<br /><br />The other narrative is from Ruth; she and her husband Oliver live in an ecologically beautiful and isolated islet called Desolation Sound and one day, she comes across Nao's Hello Kitty lunchbox with her diary and other mementos...swept onto shore.  Ruth and Oliver not so coincidentally happen to possess the same names as the author and her real-life husband.<br /><br />As the teenager's world increasingly impinges on Ruth's, the author delves into the real meaning of time and the thin barrier of separation that peels away as we get to know each other.  How much agency do we have over another person's narrative?  How do we connect with that shining single moment that we need to establish our human will and attain truth?<br /><br />In the words of Nao's uncle, a World War II kamikaze pilot, \\"Both life and earth manifest in every moment of existence. Our human body appears and disappears moment by moment, without cease, and this ceaseless arising and passing away is what we experience as time and being. They are not separate.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, the theme of this book is the life force of imagination and creation: how we weave mythical stories and authentic stories, how we create stories about others, how we eventually - if we concentrate - get to own our own stories, and how we put those stories to paper.  If this all sounds too \\"heavy\\", it's not.  The voice of Nao is that of a genuine irreverent teenager; it's fresh, authentic, and delightful.  And Ruth and Oliver - half-created, half-real - are engaging and searching characters/personages who are as large as life itself.<br /><br />I loved this book - how it introduces philosophical ideas in a very accessible way, how it combines insight and some humor with inventiveness, memory and myth and how ultimately it focuses on our shared humanity.  It's a 6-star for me.- get to own our own stories, and how we put those stories to paper.  If this all sounds too \\"heavy\\", it's not.

B00915G6MG|5.0|Great heart and comradery between the team is delightful and I have enjoyed it from the very 1st show to the last seen....would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to see an investigative team work together on all situations with intrigue and fun.  The season finale will definitely keep you wanting more!

0547848412|5.0|This was another replacement book for school.  My granddaughter loved it and so did my son.  I finally read it before we went to the movie.  It is a great book.
B00E3JGCHO|4.0|This 2-CD set is basically a remixed and remastered, slightly amended version of Rock of Ages. It includes two previously unreleased tracks, Strawberry Wine and Smoke Signal. The remixing & remastering makes the Band's vocal and instrumental contributions MUCH clearer and more vital than the Rock of Ages version. But... the horns have been mixed WAY to the back; so far, in fact, that they are darn near missing in action. So: I would give it 5 stars for the power, clarity and vibrancy of The Band, but 2 stars for the weak horns. I am still glad I bought it. The clarity and vibrancy of the performance is now very, very clear. The Band at their peak.

B0026O475M|5.0|I just can't resist a good survivor movie and this is certainly one of the best.  Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role as Chuck Noland, a FedEx executive who is the sole survivor of a cargo plane crash near a remote island in the middle of the ocean way off course, and consequently not in the path of where they would be searching.  His will to survive is strengthened by his love for Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt, whom he was planning to marry when the plane went down.  One of the reasons the film works so well is that Hanks actually lost 50 or 60 lbs during the filming. They literally halted the production for a year or so, giving him that amount of time to lose the weight, so scenes of him on the beach with his shirt off at the beginning of the movie, and then later when he's looking like he truly hasn't eaten anything other than fish for 4 years lends an air of authenticity to the film that could never occur had he merely worn a &#34;fat&#34; suit to begin with, etc.  But it's his portrayal of a man whose spirit than will not give up that gives this movie its soul and in the end.. even though it doesn't have a fairy tale ending.. it definitely satisfies the viewer to the point where you almost don't want it to end.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I needed this on DVD because my cassettes were getting worn out.  I will probably have to do that with lots of my tapes.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I needed a quick and easy way to get quality books for the the study groups I'm in. B&N Nook and Goggle Books were already on my tablet, but I prefer the Amazon site with it's Apps.
0307719774|5.0|I bought one of these for my Mom too. I love how it helps us share more with each other.
B009IF82SK|5.0|The laughs continue completely unabated in this season. No sharks are anywhere in sight for this show. The series is thoroughly enjoyable.
B00DWFQ2N4|4.0|The more listens you give both 20/20 Experience albums, the more you'll appreciate them. Disc 1 is more meditative, richer in texture and musical complexities. The sound on Disc 2 is meant to seem more raw than polished. (The first two songs on Disc 2 are perfect for Halloween.) For those with a short attention span, most of the songs are probably \\"too long\\" on both albums. Guest rappers unfortunately weaken the experience. On Disc 1, JayZ on 'Suit & Tie' is a lot better when he's edited out. On Disc 2, JayZ on 'Murder' is tolerable, even funny, but Drake's appearance on 'Cabaret' makes an otherwise good song awful. Overall, The 20/20 Complete Experience is ambitious and more rewarding for the listener than most other pop music out there.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I thought the music was very original and different.  I was immediately attracted to it.  Went to see the movie and really enjoyed it again. I went through a phase where I had to listen to it repeatedly.  Some time has passed and I still like it as much as ever, so I finally decided to order it. It was worth the reduced price and came in very good condition.

I received a regular DVD.<br /><br />And now that I look at the picture closely, I can see that the item is regular DVD and not Blu-ray. This is the actual listing for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00782O7NE The Artist (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]
1416596097|5.0|I am 79 yrs. old & have been an avid reader my entire life. Since I retired 25 yrs. ago, I have been able to increase my reading to 2-4 books a week. Sometimes I read 2 or 3 books at the same time. I have noticed thru the years that many writers have changed their writing style & have lost some of their creative brilliance. Not so with Le Carre. He is as exciting, incitefull, intuitive, & masterful as ever.
1573226521|4.0|The book arrived quickly and is in great condition.  My only complaint is that the book I received did not look like the one from the picture but instead has the obnoxious cover that was made after it became a movie (has dicaprio on it)
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Good packaging and the cd was the right one I wanted and paid the same price all together as if I bought it at a cd store.

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|My husband is thrilled to have this combo in his collection.  Joe's honesty about his struggles in appreciated. THe Eagles are amazing
B007HUD6OS|4.0|This a great book in my  opinion because it had good idea development fine convention good word choice but the thing I don't like Is the fast pace.
B00B4VXQC8|3.0|While some of the songs are really catchy and remind me a little of their older stuff, I miss the heavy guitar and faster songs from the 80's! Not my favorite, but ok.
0762777931|5.0|This book is amazing - so inspiring, educational and funny!  Kris Carr has the cutest personality ever.  Try the 21 day cleanse - I did it a year ago and it changed my life
B005XZHQKY|2.0|Having recently acquired a new 3D television and being an avid diver and fan of the ocean I thought this set would be an easy win.  I have to say I am pretty disappointed overall.  The quality of the 3D effects is just ok and the films themselves are sub-par.  There is no real storyline so you end up with a stitched together set of underwater shots with virtually no narration.  In fact, the lack of narration seems almost like the production company was paying the guy by the word and ran out of money to have him do the film any justice.  I tried all three films and honestly wandered away from the TV a number of times without pausing to get snacks or do some other trivial task.<br /><br />Would not recommend this to anyone.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Like the first three books Martin continues with the stories of all the cast that we love or hate. The action never stops and the people you love struggle to reach their goals. More often than not obsticles fall in their path challenging to challenge them. Hang on to your chair & enjoy the ride.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I like this app but in making the TV app it does not help either. I can not get the TV app to work

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Great movie. Kept the action going all the way. Recommend to anyone even non trekys. Right on time. Price great.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case turned out to be much more than expected.  The flip case can be perfectly used as a stand for the phone on my desks as I use certain application and view photos or video on the phone.  The phone is protected by the case when I am carrying it around and is easily accessible.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a great app. I like that I can check my email anytime. I like that both the computer and the tablet work great with this app.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is a great CD of Bruno Mars' recordings. Some of the songs I had never heard but are great. This has lots of great recordings for Bruno fans. The seller shipped quickly and the CD was protectively packaged.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This is a story that keeps turning.  It operates on two fronts for the most part and you have to really concentrate to keep it straight.  It is intriguing and masterful.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|For some reason, my 3 year old really loves this movie.  I am super happy about that, because I find it quite clever myself.  Via the Amazon Prime app on the iPad, my son can watch this on long drives and me and his dad get a little bit of peace on the drive.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is my second email address but is now my main one.<br />It is easier to navigate.<br />I would recommend it.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I really liked this movie. I read reviews on it a while back and I was aware that it didn't get many good ratings. It's kind of a light-hearted romantic story with nothing really heavy or shocking in it. Just a fun movie with Katie Holmes. Young teens may like this- there's nothing offensive for younger viewers!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|For me, I have tried many types of Office programs for Android devices both phones and tablets. Some have been OK, others not good at all.<br />Then I tried Kingsoft Office. This is a very FULL FEATURED Office program that supports DOC/DOCX/TXT/XLS/XLSX/PPT/PPTX/PDF and also I love the fact that it supports cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box.net etc.<br />And this app also has a file manager so you can locate your documents.<br /><br />So you can open and edit and create: Word, Text (Memo) Excel (Spreadsheet), PowerPoint (Presentation). And you can read PDF Files. This program is very compatible with Word, Excel etc and opens up Adobe PDF files as well. And I use this superb program daily on my 10.1 tablet. So I highly recommend this to all Android Tablet owners whether Kindle tablets or any Android tablet.<br /><br />Also Kingsoft has a manual in PDF and also Kingsoft has a support webpage for Android and Windows users. Yes there is a free Kingsoft Office for Windows as well. What a great company! Just type in this in google: Kingsoftstore.com<br />Also you can download the free PDF Manual for Kingsoft:<br /><br />[...]

B004EBT7RI|5.0|This was a great journey.<br /><br />I enjoyed the whole of Hassan's story, from the beginning in India then to England and finally France.  The writing was descriptive and insightful with pathos and humour as the story evolved into a visual experience.  The characters were bought to life, Hassan of course and  particularly the portrayal of his father and Madame.<br /><br />The culinary experience through Hassan's love of food and his determination to succeed was so literal you could feel it.  The geography and social content was like a travelogue,with the the Indian and French landscapes a contrast but integrated through the 2 nation's food cultures.  Then there was the human aspects of winning and losing and the ultimate triumph at the end.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Richard Morais works.
B000NY12LO|3.0|Peter should have killed Lewis too. What a boring character, skipped parts where he shows in the book.<br />A bit boring book. Too long, too cliché.

Don't give your fellow readers any plot details...just let it unfold !
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The heroine makes the movie, the rest was like a bad sic-fi from the 50's.  Obviously a disturbing movie when the premise is killing people for sport.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The author makes a great job making you think about your potential and all you can still do. Th beginning of the book exposes many motivating stories.

B009X012XM|4.0|Very nice cover, slim and sleek. But it should have a stylus holder, as many folks use them.<br />Nice color schemes...<br />This is in addition the case cracked today, a little over 2 months of use... worked well until then.

B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This is my families favorite show. We never miss an episode and now we can own the first whole season!
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I personally don't think I understand the attraction. I think for me, I enjoy much more character development than what this film had to offer. The emotional struggle of each character didn't seem real and if anything it seemed like a joke. It was very unrealistic (granted it is a superhero flick) but to the point where I lost interest. I never felt like \\"okay this could happen\\" which i suppose is something I have to feel in order to be invested in a movie. this is why I like the dc universe's films much more than this marvel universe (not including the amazing spiderman by marc webb). The sense of humor wasn't my style either. I've read some of the avengers comics and I do enjoy them but this is just so .... to me it feels like such a hollywood predictable flick and I have a hard time understanding why everyone loves it.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I love this movie Titanic , I know that I am going to be able to enjoy watching this movie over and over  again. I had  My Partner that I have been with for 24Yrs, when you know that is going to be growing together with but not only that. We love the same movies I had recorded this movie on a VHS and the tape would not play the movie I was so happy that it was available on Dvd. There are several other reasons why  I love movies I have been very sick with my back, I have had in the past three years I have been in and out of the Hospital every year so far 2010 I have had Major back Surgeries and I am going back into the Hospital again this year for yet another  back surgery. I buy a lot of movies and I will be ordering from you again. I want to thank you for a wonderful movie. I watch the news every every day I need something light and it needs to be enjoyable to wanch.

B00DJ80VLS|3.0|Musically it's not bad. Sort of middle of the road for DT and my tastes. And yeah I miss Mike. But over all it's worth a listen.<br /><br />But get the HD Tracks 24/96 version if you're into good sound. The CD is compressed and LOUD! DR range of 6-8. [...]<br /><br />The Vinyl and or Hi Rez versions are much better. DR range of 12-14. [...]

B000RLFJQ2|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Captures some of the uncertainty of the ending of the cold war.  Acting is quite good.  The cast of characters well selected and the action is almost over the top.  It also has some of the best one-liners of any movie.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is sooooooo amazing I always have to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Because the dragons are really cute just like a pretty pet.  The food takes a long time to grow but its not stupid at all. Just super cool and stuff.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I never watched this when it was on TV, well, because I didn't have regular TV to be able to watch it when it was aired.  It took a little for me to get into it, but now the connection with the characters and the need to find out what happens next has taken over.  The simple fact that no character is truly safe from being &#34;off-ed&#34; keeps you engaged.  The story is just crazy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really good game I really suggest u get it. The graphics are great and so is everything else.<br />,
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I guess it did what it was supposed to. Yes,it cleared space,but I guess I thought it would leave me with a lot more. I'm still getting the error message that the internal storage is low.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love this movie and could not wait to purchase the soundtrack once I found out it had one!  Love it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|play with my daughter it is a lot of fun. thanks for making a great game the family can play.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|This works well with my PD Novel White.  It is a perfect fit, and just like the black one I have on my original Blk PD Novel 7, it gives a nice feel and balance to the reader.  Why do I have two almost identical ereaders, you ask?  That's a good question that I can give no reasonable answer for! Lol :-)
B001KX50BK|5.0|What can I say about this movie! The Actors are all wonderful and they are all endearing! Classic fairy tale movie!
B000XSEPYQ|5.0|Saw is one of those films which I have avoided for years, due to its reputation and the consistent emphasis I've seen on the gratuitous violence or gore in clips from the later films in the series. However, having come across a comment which had piqued my curiosity, I finally gave way and watched the thing... and was quite pleasantly surprised. By no means a flawless film (typical aspects of Wan's directorial style I find offputting now and again), I would nonetheless say it is a very well done suspense-thriller; a puzzle piece which relies on suggestion, character, and the desire to put together the picture as a whole to build the mounting sense of tension to a climax which, while it will be a surprise to some, is nonetheless subtly prepared for quite early on. (Of course, no one is likely to be surprised now, given the focus on &#34;Jigsaw&#34; or John Kramer in much of the rest of the series; but still, it is quite nicely done.<br /><br />The performances, given the nature of the film, are generally either quite creditable, or simply very good, depending; the fact that the focus here is NOT on the gore (and in fact the &#34;gore&#34; sequences are not only relatively few, but generally only a few seconds in duration), but rather on actual storytelling and suspense, makes this a genuine oddity in a field all too often given to simplistic reliance on bloodletting and &#34;gee-whiz&#34; effects. While none of the characters is spotless, and few are easy to sympathize with at times, they do generally come across as much more than puppets, and their reactions to their horrendous situations are, overall, not at all unreasonable or unlikely. And, of course, even though he is actually on-screen in an active capacity for a very short time, Tobin Bell does make a memorable impression... as do Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell.<br /><br />Overall, I found it a very well done entry in the thriller field, with a great deal more style, panache, and care for quality than is the usual wont these days. Well worth the wait, but I'm rather sorry that I was misled about the nature of the piece for so long....
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Outstanding ......riveting. Fantastic directing.  Fantastic plot and remarkable acting by the cast.  The story won't let you go..... Get the same group together and do another project.
B000NMW6M0|5.0|I've seen this movie numerous times and each time I get a new message from it. If you're a very objective person I think you would have a hard time understanding the film because it is quite subjective. It contains wonderful and deep performances.
B00AEFY44Y|5.0|I have been watching this movie for years! I love it and am sure I will be watching for many more years. It has become a classic! Great Stars, great actors and a great story!
B008JFUO72|5.0|After the events in The Avengers Stark finds himself experiencing anxiety and he becomes obsessed with building iron man armors to protect himself and the ones he cares about but when a new threat arrives will Stark prove it is the armor who will save the day or is it the man behind the armor who is capable of saving the day without the armor

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard about the power of this show, but had never watched it.  Then, when I signed up for Amazon Prime, I decided to get caught up with Downton Abbey.  Wow!  What a magnificent show.  I have watched through season two and am ready to begin the third.  Great TV!
0307887448|5.0|A fantastic book. Total page turner that never wants to be put down. I wish it were a series that I just discovered so that I could have 3 books to read instead of just one. I hope more come soon
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so interesting. It is definitely a way to start as a beginning to colorme. It definitely does help you catch on and it is so fun playing and uncovering images one at a time that go with the theme. And the best thing about it is that there is no specific order for that pic.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Great quality and great show. Excellent price. Would recommend to all families. Excellent for preteens and adults. May be too intense for younger kids at times, although messgage is about love and good defeating evil.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This has become one of my favorite games.  I have never played a game that allows me to use my imagination like this game.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Since I am not a big tech person and use this all the time on my laptop, it just made sense to me to put it on the iPhone.  I believe most everyone knows about Google and by now they either like it or use another search engine.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|The Revelator, brought back the great feelings of listening to great Rhythm and Blues from the seventies and eighties. If You liked the Allman Brothers Band and the Vaughan Brothers, You love this.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Never see the Dredd actor as he's always wearing a stupid looking helmet. Mouth and jaw looked like a poor imitation of Stallone. Horrible acting. Tremendous amount of violence and graphic gore.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I stayed constantly mad at both of them, and then the ending came too fast.  Not a lot of description on their lives other than their sex life.  Glad it was free.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Not the best prose but an exciting read. A must read for every woman. If you don't read it, you'll simply be left behind.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Simply, buy this. If life was a kids card game and You have to choose a mother figure, I would choose Bonnie Raitt. Never a dull moment with her palying and singing.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This App is simple and straightforward, and brings enjoyable hours of entertainment. 4 stars instead of five because if the last two tiles are stacked on top of each other, then you lose that game. On other MahJong games that is considered a win. Wish there was a shuffle button on all games. I only saw it on one game. Strange.<br />I would still recommend getting this game as the above issues are minor in comparison to the amount of fun this game brings. Get it - you'll enjoy it!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was a GREAT book!! I couldn't put it down! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!  Highly recommend reading it! A must read for sure!
1250030951|5.0|You know a book called FANGIRL is working when you want to read the series on which the main character's fic is based.  But even more, you want to read her version of the story!  In this book, you get tasty snippets of both, and sweetest of all, you get Cather Avery's own adventures as she ventures into the \\"real world\\" of college freshmanity.<br /><br />As a one-time ficcer with a specialty in Harry Potter (and Sirius/Remus slash), I savored Rowell's take on the increasingly complex (because increasingly accessible) subculture of fandom.  A deep emotional response to stories and the worlds they create drive the phenomenon and create its most passionate members:  the cosplayer, the fan artist, and, here, the fan writer.  What's behind it?  Identification?  Escapism?  A drive to control and to understand the outer and the other?  All of the above and more, probably.  Close reading of this book -- and I will reread it -- should be a fruitful study for the fan-curious.<br /><br />Rowell's writing is artfully effortless, and her insight into character both sharp and sympathetic.  One looking for heroes and villains won't find them here, but one looking for humans, mostly lovable, often exasperating, sometimes downright mysterious and confounding, will have much better luck.  Cather is a strong creation who faces her insecurities one by one, and Levi is bound to attract a lot of fangirls himself.  Including me.  He enters my pantheon of characters good and loyal and deeper-than-the-first-glance-reveals along with Joe Gargery and Sam Gamgee.<br /><br />Couldn't ask for better company than that, now could you?  Especially for corned beef hash at Levi's fav diner-drive hangout.

0142418471|5.0|Such a wonderful book! Anything by John Green is spectacular, and &#34;Will Grayson, Will Grayson&#34; did not disappoint! The story is lighthearted, but deeply rooted in the social relationships of teenagers, shedding light on homosexual and heterosexual teenage couples.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|Had to buy it, because the title song was humming in my head one morning while making coffee. I haven't heard it in years. Great album with great bomus tracks. Very nice and pleasant record.

B00AZM7IQC|5.0|If you are a fan of Cirque Du Soleil and have a 3D TV, this video is worth having.<br />The various views of the performances can't be seen even during a live show.<br />And the 3D just adds to the experience.  And, it's a lot cheaper than traveling to Las Vegas!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Tedeschi Trucks Bands first album, The Revelator, brought back the great feelings of listening to great Rhythm and Blues from the seventies and eighties. This does it even better. But if someone is practically born into the Allman Brothers Band, it simply cannot go wrong.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Simply great!  Truly one of the Beatles best but also one of the greatest albums of all-time.  I love it!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I played this on my aunts opacity before and it was a lot of fun. my favorite part of the game is the song is because it is a catchy tune
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I remember being sixteen.  I remember turning off the lights in my room, turning on the Cranberries, and drowning in aching sweetness.  There was so much truth to the music, to the voice, to the darkness - if I could only swim through it deeply enough, I would experience everything.<br /><br />It is clear that Lorde has done this as well.  Her voice is haunting and evocative; it takes you by the hand and brings you soaring and swooping to places you may not remember, but you have certainly visited before.  Beautiful places, rife with mystery, where you can lose yourself for hours.<br /><br />I listened to the album for the first time in the car, driving in the rain as the world transformed to a perfect blue.  When I got home Buzzcut Season was playing.<br /><br />I parked in the driveway, lost myself in the rain, and shut my eyes to the song that plays.

B00EJ2WBX4|4.0|An amazing mp3 album from a new Scottish synthpop band! I found out about them by reading an article where the lead singer, Lauren Mayberry, came out against online misogyny. I came here to sample some songs and ended up buying the album (they also have an EP called Recover I got as well). I've been listening to it constantly. Some of my favorites: Lies, Recover (And if I recover/Will you be my comfort), Under the Tide (Stay under the tide/Stay in my eyeline), Science/Visions (Breathe Don't speak It's leaving your body now/Slow heart Set free A circuit of consciousness). Oh who am I kidding, they are almost all my favorites right now.<br /><br />It's such pretty music and has an uplifting feel to it. The lead singer's voice is kind of babydoll-girly, but there is depth and real appeal to it and she's very nice to listen to. There is a male singer in a few of the songs and he compliments the music as well. The melodies are beautiful and the lyrics are deep and sometimes poignant. I really can't say enough good things about this. There isn't a bad song on this album.<br /><br />If you like The Naked and the Famous, School of Seven Bells, Grimes, Purity Ring, The Foxes, Exitmusic, Goldfrapp, Imogen Heap, The Postal Service, La Roux, or even Saint Etienne, you will probably like this a lot. If you're interested, you might also want to check out (besides the synthpop genre) dreampop or electropop. Lots of good music out there these days!<br /><br />Oh, for those who care about this kind of thing, with the \\"explicit\\" rating, the first two songs have the \\"f-bomb\\" in them (not repeatedly), but I haven't caught anything else and the lyrics aren't graphic in any way that I have noticed.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Bronx Tale is so well done it reminds me of my childhood and growing up in that time frame 50's and 60's.<br />Plus all the music is what tells the whole story.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone it can't be beat.<br />Loved it both my wife and i

B00DM0XXCM|4.0|When I saw the trailers for this, I thought it was going to be a dorky film and I almost didn't watch it, but I'm glad I did. It's not dorky, it's very well done. A love story set to great cinematography and an interesting plot. The people who made the film are so \\"serious\\" about the love theme, and have taken care to provide a plot that constantly moves forward, so that the end result is a romantic film that works. I've always been a sucker for the film \\"Made in Heaven\\", so if you are into that kind of movie, you'll love this. The two films share similar mood and theme. Additionally in both films there's an interesting \\"musical subplot.\\" In Upside Side, it takes the form of an ongoing soundtrack that helps set the mood.
B00062IDCO|5.0|Loved it. No complains. No skips or freezes. Case was in great condition. Wouldn't be afraid to order for a friend.
0066621003|5.0|I am not a very business savy individual, but the book is written in such a way that it makes sense, and good business sense. I had to read it for a class, but I really enjoyed it.

And I also like it because of all the Greek gods and goddesses and the prophecy and the myths and also the totally awesome story. I just love the books!!!!
B0054R6BFM|1.0|**SPOILERS**<br />I personally did not like the book at all (one of the very few.) I did not like the character talking into the tapes, i had felt that she was an evil person because she always reminded the people listening to the tapes that if they don't do what the tapes have told them that they would br punished and the whole school will know the reason why she killed herself. The person speaking in the tapes should br hurt not seeking for revenge.
1439190275|5.0|I have purchased and read the whole &#34;New Atkins For A New You&#34; book. I have applied the Atkins rules and am living the Atkins lifestyle. For the first time in my life, my blood glucose numbers are great! I have Type II Diabetes and had it for 10 years. My Blood Pressure is the lowest It has ever been in my life and my blood lipids are also good. Plus I feel better and have a lot of energy. The book explains not only how you can eat healthier but why the Atkins plan works. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose weight, get healthier and keep the weight off.

B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of writing filled with twists and turns that kept me totally enthralled from start to finish.The characters are both naive and believable. The author weaves the story with a strong foundation, and amazing plot and builds the momentum by releasing information on a need to know basis. Although the book is geared towards teens, I feel that any age group would enjoy this story. I am looking forward to the next books in his trilogy.

B00B5L899C|5.0|From the moment I started reading Life of Pi by Yann Martel, I couldn't put it down. It is a wonderful story about adventure, religion, and the will to survive. It is a story of a boy named Piscine (nicknamed Pi) who searches for the spiritual meaning of life as he physically takes a journey when he finds himself alone on the middle of the Pacific ocean.  I loved the author's use of symbolism and underlying themes throughout the novel.  The descriptive word choice was superb. As I read I felt as if I was taking the journey with Pi because of how detailed and descriptive Yann wrote. The story is filled with exciting twists and turns that were completely unexpected. It is riveting, clever, humorous, detailed, and intense. I was constantly on my toes wondering what would happen next.  Additionally, I loved the way in which the Pi's character articulated himself throughout the novel.  I have already recommended it to all of my friends.
B0052HKY9S|5.0|Stunning. Superb. Keenly observational. Brilliantly drawn characters of great depth, who speak like human beings, who change, experience change, reflect on change as in lives actually lived. Very pinned to its times without egregiously taking sides. Filled with movies and books and music and politics and clever cultural references that include a Bright Eyes show at 9:30 Club that I think two of my boys went to. I recognize Franzen is not a writer for every taste. Who is? And besides, there's no accounting for taste. (Like the Duke said, \\"There's good music, and there's not-good music.\\" \\"Ah, but we disagree on the criteria of the good.\\" Thanks, Duke.) For me, this Franzen, unlike The Corrections, was simply exhilarating. A book I wanted never to end until...well, no, I won't go there. But if you like fat, intricate, complicated contemporary novels, filled with your neighbors whose back-stories you don't know, you should.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|This ruined the series and the Mandarin. Any real comic book fan was dropkicked in the face from watching this horrific movie. Plot from start to ending never follows any of the books nor story in any which way form to charter profiles. If anything the Mandarin that they cast is closer to Magma then the martial artist master with power of the 5 rings Mandarin. Feel like rushed 1/2 baked script to just end the series instead of going out with honor and glory. Another flaw of a character profile mishap is Patriot was not War Machine in the comic it actually Norman Osborn a villain role trying to use his connection in the military and attempts to steal Tony tech to combat spider-man. Obviously they had change this due to Sony owning Spider-Man rights, but just leave this out has no business in the movie if not gonna do it justice. Anyone remember Spider Man 3 looks like history repeats it's self here.

1594202273|4.0|Command and Control addresses an interesting and still vitally important topic. Namely, it examines nuclear weapons control and safety. We all too often fail to remember that the prime job of the Secretary of Energy is not electric cars but management and oversight of the nuclear weapons development and distribution. This book presents a diorama of many of the events surrounding the deployment and control of such weapons.<br /><br />However, as many other reviewers had noted, the style of the book can be very frustrating at times. The author uses the Damascus incident as an ongoing connector to other historical tale recounting the development of nuclear weapons control and the mistakes that have occurred over the decades. After a while this approach becomes not only distracting but an annoyance. For example the author will take the Damascus Incident, an incident when the maintenance on a liquid fuel Titan II resulted in a damaged fuel tank by a Tech who was apparently not following protocol, and then ultimately exploding, as a metaphor for each of the Chapters which are interspersed. Thus one is supposed to be drawn to see mistakes in the small and mistakes in the large. Nice idea but it just does not seem to work. In addition we are led through the lives of each of the players in the Damascus incident and at time this is less than a lucid presentation and often more confusing. One often asks why this detail is necessary. On the one hand the approach does lend context, on the other hand it may just be too much context.<br /><br />Now, I will discuss the text in toto. If one can work around the style, the book tells a compelling tale. It begins at the beginning, Los Alamos, and then proceeds to detail the many developments in the evolution of nuclear weapons. There are excellent discussions of the political in-fighting and the pros and cons of military control over the weapons. LeMay plays a key role during this early period as well he should. LeMay was a pivotal player whose world view of war was massive total destruction. LeMay viewed war as a total destruction of the enemy, as he had done in Europe and in the Pacific. Lemay in a sense was the driving force for military use and deployment.<br /><br />The author does an excellent job in developing the issue of who control nuclear weapons, by going over the various ways in which the weapons flowed into military hands. The design and building of the weapons was done under AEC and then DoE aegis with the support of such places as Sandia Labs in Albuquerque. Sandia was managed by AT&T under a Government contract and was a massive facility adjacent to Kirkland AFB which itself was adjacent to the airport at Albuquerque. Sandia developed various weapons and weapon security systems. Tests of the weapons were often done by DoE or its predecessor the AEC. The author integrates these efforts into the text. It would have been interesting to have developed the significant interplay between DoE and DOD as weapons systems evolved.<br /><br />The author interweaves many other near miss events into the text in a chronological basis between the evolving tale of the Damascus event. Such near misses as the explosion of a B-52 over North Carolina and the loss of 2 H bombs over Span and but a few.<br /><br />The author does a reasonable job in describing the safety procedures employed but it would possibly have been more enlightening to have some first-hand descriptions. Many \\"fail-safe\\" procedures had been developed but as the author states each time an improvement to a fail-safe was done it potentially impeded the effectiveness of the weapon.<br /><br />There are several areas, in my opinion, which the author has missed or touched lightly upon and should have been included or expanded upon:<br /><br />1. Soviet Nuclear Weapons: On almost a one to one basis the Soviets matched the US for weapons of vast killing power. The Soviets often played games of chicken with US SAC forces and this would frequently be at the risk of deployment of weapons, especially tactical weapons. In addition the use of the nuclear submarine fleet and the games played there also presented dramatic threats. It would have been useful to have had this interplay discussed somewhat. The classic Triad of aircraft, submarines and missiles would also have been useful to draw together. Understanding Soviet capability and control would have made an excellent counterpoint.<br /><br />2. Tactical Weapons and Special Weapons Depots: Tactical weapons were always considered just a step above a large non-nuclear weapon, and early on not w real nuclear weapon. The author does discuss the Davy Crockett weapons but in reality there were hundreds of Special Weapons Depots, SWD, across the globe which contained these types of weapons. The SWDs were reasonably well guarded but their very number often gave one concern not just because of what they contained but often because one could not reasonably expect to get the best personnel at this many locations. They also were DOD controlled and thus were subject to the change of staff which raised the risk of failure to follow protocols. Thus the proliferation of Tactical weapons, 1KT ranges, were in reality a serious byproduct of the enthusiasm early on for nuclear solutions.<br /><br />3. Other National Weapons Controls: The British, French, Chinese, Israelis, Pakistanis, Indians, and South Africans as well as North Korea and Iran all have dabbled in nuclear weapons and many have collections in their arsenals.<br /><br />4. Nuclear Weapons Treaties: There were many discussions between the US, UK and Soviets from time to time. They typically dealt with testing and proliferation. I spent the latest 70s as an advisor to ACDA and the CTBT during the Carter Administration and dealt with the Soviets firsthand. I also had the opportunity to spend many trips to Sandia and other facilities. Neither side trusted the other, yet side conversations between the parties were about children and grandchildren. Thus, although both sides were prepared for ultimate destruction, both sides also had a view of the humanity of the others.

0451196716|5.0|you felt like you were on that long walk yourself.<br />kept me turning the pages to see every detail and interaction of the long painful journey<br />stephen king has been a favorite of mine for a long time.<br />Great read
B00E0SX118|4.0|I loved the graphics on this movie. I did like the subtle hints of more &#34;adult&#34; humor. My 2 year old and 6 year old boys loved this movie! And the good thing is mommy and daddy didn't fall asleep while watching!
0345548981|5.0|A very inspiring example of perseverance and commitment and a very helpful plan that really helps you make hugh changes in your life.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love the game and play it every day, but now I'm being blocked from playing because it's requiring the new update, but no download is available. I've checked everywhere. Please help!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had tired of John Grisham novels.  He is so prolific that it began to feel as though he was putting out a book a year as his contract demanded without much thought to plot, characters, or unique subject matter.  This book was a refreshing change.  Mr.Grisham  seemed to actually put some thought into this book and the characters within it.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B0055D3EFU|3.0|After watching this movie and I really excited/scared to see the second one. I just hope the director does not disappoint the fans and actually stick to the plot lines!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|There are so many spiritual books in the world it is often hard to pick out an exceptional one. This one deserves to be in the top 10 spiritual books with ones like &#34;The Power of Now&#34; and &#34;Conversations with God&#34; and &#34;You can heal yourself&#34;<br /><br />Easy to read wisdom.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|This is a complex mystery/action thriller that does a great job of intertwining the mystery and the far future scifi world the novel is set in.  And unlike so many books today, it has a real and satisfying ending, not just a shameless hook to buy the next book in the series.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I like it, but wish they did more real classical songs. The pop songs as classical is a niche, I get that.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Got it to install on my wife's new kindle in order to see downloaded files in particular and storage layout in general.<br />Cannot understand why it is not a built-in part of this device.<br />ES is a &#34;must&#34; app because it explores everything (files/folders) you have on your kindle.<br />Understandable and user-friendly interface.<br />For the time being (my wife uses it only a couple of weeks) I have no contra points.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book. Such and interesting person and very well written. Very objective, shows boths sides of a complicated person who actually did what he set out to do when he aimed to put a dent in the universe.
0425252868|5.0|How each of the pilots survived their ordeals throughout the war is miraculous.<br />The title is correct- this was a higher call.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Was a really good read, even if it is about teens. Would recommend as a short read for the weekend.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|What can I say. One of my all time favorite movies and love that it had the ultraviolet feature. Really beginning to like ultraviolet. Nice case and packaging to go with it.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|lots of twists, loved it.  Tom Cruise was at his best.  It had a happy ending.  What more can I say.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was one of the best I've ever read. I am so looking forward to reading the next one
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie was a revealing saga of pilots and drug use. So sad but revealing content that we must stay aware of especially for those who constantly travel.
1582701709|1.0|If you can DREAM it you can DO it! I got that much from Blades of Glory. Waste of money.
0385743564|3.0|Sanderson's latest book is an interesting take on the classic super-hero tale. The main conceit is that some humans have developed super powers. The problem is that these people, termed \\"Epics\\", do not use their powers for good but instead they universally use them for their own personal gain. A small resistance has formed to fight back against these super-jerks and the book chronicles their attempt to take down the eponymous super villain.<br /><br />  The book is quick read, clocking in at right around 330 easy pages. There are only a handful of characters and the plot is extremely straight-forward, as one might expect from a book targeted at a younger audience. The themes are a bit dark and the opening scene, in particular, might be disturbing to young readers.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, while the concept is intriguing, the book suffers from multiple characters being intensely ignorant. Several characters should be able to piece together the plot and its twists well before they occur, but remain clueless simply because the plot demands them to do so. What follows is many laborious chapters that the reader must slog through while waiting for the character's knowledge to catch up with their own.<br /><br />  Overall I am rating this as three stars because I was generally entertained and am hoping that further efforts in this universe will have more consistent characters.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Very fast paced and thrilling to watch!  You can't miss this epic zombie movie.  It's like 28 days later on steroids!
B00AA0U046|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality and price of this product.  Also the short time it took to receive it.  Yes I would recommend this to others
B004LPLU4K|1.0|No story - quite different from the original. Everybody looked to be crazy. Far from the original story. The direction was terrible
B003TJR2HS|1.0|The ad certainly implied if not said that I could charge my iPhone from the car with this device. Totally FALSE! It will not charge. That's the only reason I bought it. I don't care about connecting through the case. Apparently an iPhone 4S will not charge in a Nissan without some additional equipment. THIS IS NOT IT! WASTE OF MONEY!
B00CATONCA|5.0|Great collectible  Will light up any movie room plus you get an awesome Blu-Ray set.  Any fan would die for this.
B00ANJJFUY|4.0|Yes, I know how much people hate Crocs, but these are seriously comfortable shoes and I'm not giving them up! I wear them around the house, especially when I'm in the kitchen (hard tile floor makes for sore feet otherwise). I purchased these to replace an older pair and the design has changed a bit. The other pair was a swirly blue and purple pattern, that I adored, and the back strap wasn't fixed in position. I like that the strap was movable, but I'm sure that I will get used to the fixed strap on these.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game.  It works flawlessly on my Motorola Razor M phone and on my Kindle Fire.  Arcade mode has increasingly challenging levels.
0061122416|1.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" was recommended reading... by the simple minded. It promised a great revelation awaiting over the next sand dune (in the next few pages), only to deliver more of the same boring cliches, wishful thinking, and new-age rot sprinkled with some perverted truth that appeals to pride and narcissism.<br /><br />  \\"The Alchemist\\" encourages us to fulfill our \\"Personal Legend\\".  The word Legend connoting a fame by which we will be remembered just as a Roman soldier was remembered in the Bible.  It then gives a misleading formula on how to achieve this Legendary status.<br /><br />  Paulo Coelho, the author, claims to be a Catholic and thus must know that, \\"It is morally wrong to take omens seriously and above all to guide one's life according to them, apart from such exceptional circumstances when there is clear evidence of divine intervention\\". And praying to the wind and sun and all other material is pantheism. The material world is the handiwork of God, but it is not God, just as the Mona Lisa is the work of a great artist, Leonardo da Vinci, but it is not Leonardo. Some sick people talk to the Mona Lisa, others to a golden calf. We know where that leads.<br /><br />  Finally we must ask three questions, \\"Is everyone's Legend to find gold?  Are we here to get rather than to give?  Is it important to be remembered by man, or by God?\\"
B0041D843M|5.0|Of all the \\"diet\\" books I've recently read (over 20) this is the first one that actually makes sense to me. Other books had nuggets but this book has truth. Anyone who will read this and refuse to change their diet is beyond the reach of reason. This is from a confirmed \\"foodie\\" and lover of well prepared meats and fine cheeses. I know this will not be easy, but it is necessary.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now, I can take my Amazon Kindle books along with me on my phone.  This is wonderful.  I can read them anywhere when I don't want to carry my Kindle with me,

B00E9P959O|5.0|Canadian power trio Rush's 17th studio album Vapor Trails was originally released in May of 2002.<br />The album was the band's first studio album since 1996's Test for Echo and the first since the tragedies that besotted drummer Neil Peart (losing his daughter and first wife within a year of each other), which forced the band to take an indefinite hiatus.<br />In 2000, whilst guitarist Alex Lifeson and bass player/singer Geddy Lee were pursuing production and solo projects respectively, Neil found the urge to play music again after meeting his new wife/girlfriend photographer Carrie Nuttall after moving to California.<br />When word came in 2001 that Rush were recording a new album, many (including myself) were anticipating what the band would do after they emerged from their tragedy enforced slumber. The band stripped their sound down to their Zeppelin-influenced core (guitar, bass, drums, vocals and (for the first time since 1975's Caress of Steel) NO KEYBOARDS) and just rocked out.<br />The songs are still complex and tightly arranged but Geddy, Alex and Neil with co-producer Paul Northfield decided to come up with a classic case of triumph over tragedy. Lyrically, Neil reflected on his personal struggle through loss and sadness.<br />When I first heard the original mix back in 2002, I admit the mix was muddied (David Leonard should stick to The Barenaked Ladies and not mix any Rush albums ever again, THANK CHRIST HE NEVER WORKED AGAIN AFTER 2004), the mastering was horrible (I thought my ears were developing tinnitus from the volume of the mastering) and the guitar solos were stripped.<br />I was wishing (like many fans) for a remix of the album. In 2009, \\"One Little Victory\\" and \\"Earthshine\\" were remixed by Richard Chycki for Rush's Retrospective III and both had some guitar solos not on the original muddied mix and saying \\"WHEN WILL A REMIXED VAPOR TRAILS COME OUT. Now, in 2013,, a remixed version of the album is released. The remix on this album is brilliantly remixed by Grammy winning engineer David Botrill and remastered by Andy VanDette now making (what was once just a good album) the 5 star album it should have been.<br />Apart from the optimistic opener of \\"One Little Victory\\" which signaled the return of Canada's most successful rock act ever, the album reflected mainly on Neil's tragedies and sorrow. \\"Ghost Rider\\" is about his documented motorcycle journey all over North and Central America to help him through the terrible circumstances in his life (ironically his book about this trek is also called Ghost Rider).<br />Other excellent songs on this album are \\"Earthshine\\", \\"Secret Touch\\", \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" and \\"Freeze (the fourth part of the saga Fear)\\", \\"Nocturne\\" and the closing \\"Out of the Cradle\\".<br />On this new mix, \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" has a previously unheard guitar solo (which is one of Alex's best solos and I like the new mix TEN TIMES BETTER), OLV's vocals don't sound like they were recorded on a transistor radio played through a flanger. \\"The Stars Look Down\\" and \\"How It Is\\" have acoustic guitars that were not on the original version. The songs I didn't like in its original state (the title cut and \\"Sweet Miracle\\") sound better and actually aren't bad songs (maybe I was expecting too much upon first listen in 2002 and the second play through in 2006 didn't move me then as well but now that I'm older these songs just rock out).<br />Vapor Trails was for the most part rewarding and inspiring, both musically and lyrically. The public even agreed as it hit #6 on the album charts when released (not bad when considering competing against the likes of Eminem, Britney, N'Sync and the rest of those TRL freaks in 2002). Now this new version is a MUST OWN FOR RUSH FANS!

B005LAJ16I|5.0|it froze on one of the frames but I fast forwarded and the rest was fine<br />very happy with the dvd
B00EP0KYDO|3.0|Ok movie, great future for the kid. Looking forward for more of him, we need great movies, not just another super Hero like Spider-Man and others, which are ok but to many of them.  We like drama too
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you are a first timer get this it costs less than Xbox and pc and you can even get an app that lets you change game modes it's minecraft editor
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I got this thing today. It was easy to install, I had it up and running in about two minutes, then I started to find the shortcomings. I originally installed it on my TV, but then I realized that the sound wouldn't come out of my surround speakers, so I tried to install it directly onto my A/V receiver. That didn't work at all, no picture and the light on the Chromecast dongle flashed red. So I switched back to the TV and I thought all was well. I specifically bought this thing so that I could watch shows and movies on The Dare Wall, but this was a complete fail - no sound through the TV, so I had to keep the laptop nearby for sound; and when I went to full screen on the laptop, the images on the TV screen froze up completely.  So, I am sending the thing back, maybe I'll try again in a year or so and hope Google gets the bugs worked out.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|The acting done in this movie was PERFECT.  The actors were PERFECT for this movie.  The story kept me engaged the WHOLE time! You will love getting to know Ellis and Neckbone!  The story grabbed me RIGHT AWAY!  I did not want to miss even a second of it.  I actually played back parts I stepped away even for just a few secs, just to make sure I didnt miss anything.  I thought about the characters even days after I watched it!  This is definitely a movie to watch and own!!
B00594XOZU|2.0|Would've rated this app a lot higher up until two days ago, it worked fine, but now it won't send messages
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This Book is completely different from the previouses.<br />while the previous book was action and surprise at every page.<br />this book is boring .  a long and continuos torture ( literally ) of Peeta and katniss.<br />it is difficult to find a motivation to finish this book.<br />while I loved the first.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun twist to other puzzle games. It can be challenging, but not too far out there! Can't wait to check out others like this.
B0013USZHG|5.0|It was not what I expected expressing the colors of S. American music but still Dudamel for your enjoyment, Good at best.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love this app I use it every morning while I have a cup of coffee making sure I know what I am going to expect on the way to work.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun! I enjoy the challenge and it is relaxing after a long day. I lime that the coins regenerate at night so I don't need to spend d money to have some idle fun.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl articulated well the challenges women continue to face in the workplace.  Her suggestions on things everyone can do to bring equity are reasonable. Her message is clear. We must continue our efforts to educate everyone to bring about change.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A great book, loved the quirky nature of the main character, a good fairly light-hearted read, that makes you think a bit about the parts of us that go into our relationships with people around us.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|I have no idea whether this software works or not because, after purchase, there was no link to download it.  I tried several different ways to access the software but eventually gave up.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I feel it charges much better than the original that plugs into the micro USB, but it does pop off easily.
B003G4W49C|4.0|it really reminded me of when i was his age; so confused about why adults treated me like that, even if it were for my own good. i definantly recommend thiz book!
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|nonstop action and good plot.  What puzzled me was I thought Mandarin was an actual nemesis of Iron Man and not a puppet of the actual antagonist.  The friendship between Tony and Harley added to the movie.  Looking forward to Avengers II
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My kids love to play Scribblenauts and can make it as challenging as they want. I have an 8 yr old and a 6 yr old. The 8 yr old can play without any help, but the 6 yr old often asks me how to spell the words he needs to type. It is great for letter recognition and phonics. Plus, it's a good game for imagination and problem solving.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Really fun and hilarious but one downside though, when you finish a round it shows an ad and sometimes it doesn't have the exit sign. It also plays the music when I exit the game and turn off my kindle fire HD really odd but still really fun
B0068FZ0ZG|2.0|Ripped from the movie. The cover is a sign of that but the movie displays correctly, so I guess that a plus.
B008OOYALE|5.0|A very fun and enjoyable game!  My whole family is addicted :)  We have it on all of our devices so we can all be neighbors and share in the fun!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this show. It definitely creates a yin and yang to the serial killer persona. Plan on ordering the other seasons. Item arrived on time, packaged well and as expected.
0920236162|5.0|I've purchased this book for all my granddaughters and some of their friends.  Now I'm giving it as a gift to extended family members.  It's a must read book for little girls!
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD.  This app changes direction with you on any other device.  For example, if you're standing facing east the app shows you the east sky then you turn around and the app is supposed to turn around with you...facing west.  On the kindle it does not do this.  You have to manual manipulate the app to view your new direction.  I deleted it from my device.  It's not worth the space it takes up.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate :) Remember that it needs a triple AAA battery and it last... well, pretty much a month now! It does varies on your usage, so I estimate 3 weeks of constant use? Not too bad! especially from the Game Boy days! :)
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|I liked it, they know how to jam and keep you going.  Alot like the young Neil we fell in love with.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|This first of the Harry Hole series sets the stage for events to follow. We hear his back story and start to become his champion. This book has quite a different tone from the later ones. It is lighter at the start but quickly moves into the darker territory we associate with Hole. The overview and legends about Australia are intriguing. The plot and characters keep you in their grip. A must read for Nesbo fans.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a wonderful series and season three was no exception.<br />Having Amazon Prime made viewing it easier and more convenient!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I Think this was the best one so far.  Go Pepper! Too bad she doesn't get to be a super hero.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love it! However there is nothing like the<br />real book to hold in your hands. I like to make notes and marks for myself which can't be done on the electronic version.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love a good mystery. So when I came across this app on Google Play and read the rave reviews, I immediately downloaded it. The reviewers were true to their word. The Room is simply and utterly marvelous! The music is eerie and atmospheric. I finished it in a matter of hours and I was sorry when it ended. The graphics are supremely polished and spectacular and this baby ran like butter on my Samsung Galaxy S3.<br /><br />The game's interface is simple and engaging. The game is done in 3D. Everything from the room to the safe appears to have length, breadth and depth. Even when you look at the objects in your inventory, it's done in 3D. You can rotate the objects and manipulate 'em in  a way which helps crack the puzzle. The game relies heavily on rotation, touching, shifting, and looking at things from a certain angle. So if you're anything like me and hate mathematical puzzles, then you're going to love this! Even if you do like mathematical puzzles, you're still going to love The Room!<br /><br /> You start out by being in an eerie room with a safe. On top of the safe is a cryptic, mysterious letter. It's your job to unlock the safe and find out what's hidden there. It sounds intriguing, right? Right from the start you receive an eyepiece which enables you to see beyond what the naked eye can see. Sometimes certain puzzles cannot be solved without the eyepiece.  There's an inventory slot and a clue icon which gives you three clues per puzzle. The clues are set in a timed interval.<br /><br />The clues give you enough information to solve the puzzle without being too telling. For example: I was stuck on a puzzle and the last clue to the puzzle told me to look everywhere where I normally wouldn't look. So I'm grateful that even when I was stuck, the clues gave me a nudge in the right direction without being too telling.<br /><br />The highlights of this game are the mind-bending, ingenious puzzles. They are challenging and clever, yet doable. I had to tap the clueicon only a few times and refer to a walkthrough on the Internet twice. This game requires you to inspect EVERYTHING. In every nook and cranny so to speak. It's SO much FUN! You're probably thinking, how many puzzles are there on a single safe? Believe me, the puzzles give way for MORE puzzles! It's multi-layered. For example: A hidden contraption suddenly emerges from the safe. It's all about finding hidden objects,  but it's MORE than that! Since you're ensconced in a single room with a safe, you're not required to move about except to search for stuff on the safe.<br /><br />In addition to the clever puzzles, the safe is beautifully designed. It has many exquisite carvings and ornaments. I wish more games were as innovative and interactive as this one! The Room set the bar way high in the mobile gaming market. Kudos to the developers! If you haven't experienced this game, I beseech you to drop whatever game you're playing and play this! It's SO worth your time and money! I promise you!

B006YC74E8|5.0|This app is an incredable app...I'm surprised its free with all the cool features like clone....u can adjust Color, the hue....also has a fun sketch effect... check it out highly recomendee..and its free
B0089LOG02|2.0|This book was really good, so real and believable.  I recommend it and look forward to more reading from Christina Baker Kline.
B005Q4CM0Q|5.0|I very much like the whole genre. I have  the Avengers movies and each of the individual character movies. Love the visual and special effects.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Good movie….my first purchase of a movie online with Amazon.  I accidentally hit the  'submit' button a second time.  I only watched the movie once…but I was charged twice.  Beware, not to submit (accidentally) a second time.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Still a great read and well written book. I definitely recommend it. I love how all the characters ended up coming together.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I have purchased the movies about each of the characters in The Avengers movies. love the special effects and visuals.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Acting was excellent, beautifully filmed, different and interesting.  I thought it was better than the Robert Redford movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio has repeatedly given excellent performances.  He is due for an academy award.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|I watched the movie - I thought that it was pretty vulgar - I always liked Jennifer Aniston and I do not see why she had to be so vulgar I did not get the whole point of the movie - what has our nation become that we find that kind of movie &#34;entertaining&#34;?
1572816295|5.0|Oh my gosh, the pictures online don't do this deck justice. It's a beautiful piece of artwork and I can tell we're going to get along famously. This is my first really Artsy deck and color me VERY impressed.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|I have seen this movie many times, but still enjoy it every time as if it were the first.  Highly recommend it as a great family movie.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|Thank God I attended the show otherwise, i might take this picture quality as the real thing, I own other shows and I compared to the sweet and sticky tour and it's a shame.<br /><br />Please Amazon, don't sell this version, please update your customers a.s.a.p about the recall, I don't want to return in exchange for a DVD.<br /><br />Sincerely
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I can't aptly describe the way in which this book moved me.  There are few books that can have me in tears while reading in a cafe and keep me thinking years after reading it.  This is one of my favorite books ever and I do a lot of reading.  The characters become people you know and love/ hate.  The book is really long and it took 2 attempts (4 years apart) to finish.  BUT if you want a taste of a India without going and a great story, you'll love this book.  It is so well written that you will feel you have walked into Mumbai.  I was actually sad when Shantaram ended, sign of a great book.  Look forward to reading more by Gregory Roberts.
B00E97AZZK|5.0|This is an intriguing movie that requires your attention to all details. It actually has a moralistic intention, although<br />rather aggressive.<br />A 12 yr old perceptive boy explained the intention of movie rather<br />well.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|This is the best combo pack out there. I am so glad that I bought it. I do recommend this.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|The first player that really worked for all media formats.  It plays AVI, MP4, AGP, and many more.  Finally I can watch videos from other sources that Amazon.....
1476719071|5.0|Love this book and to have it signed by Jamie McGuire is just a bonus. Now I have it on my kindle, paperback and signed hardcover!!!!!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|So Hilarious! I love this movie and I could watch it over and over again. This will be recommended to others.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|This show continues to deliver great and funny content.  This is coming from someone who watches reruns daily on Netflix and thinks it is the greatest show ever.
B003TTCURU|5.0|I loved it im obsessed with this show. This is the show you want to have at home. no not want but need to have.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|My Nephew recommended the show, and I am very picky of what I watch as I value my time greatly.  I was trully impressed definetely buying all the seasons.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Pretty little secrets! Super fun book. I never want to put it down. And definitely don't want the story to end. I love a mystery thrill!!
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|Love these types of games but this company has made me think twice. Games take days to load, freezes often, will not let you in app purchase as it States and they advertise free play which was all of 3 scenes! Top it off you have to load and reload multiple times just to play for a short time... I tried purchasing full app, what a joke..they attempted download of a complete new game which never would load!! No Surprise!!!!  Pop up again states i need to buy full version after i already purchased it! LAST GAME EVER FROM G5 FOR ME. GOOD SCAM THEY HAVE<br /> GOING FOR $4.99!  The review does not even work right!
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|&#34;Hail to the King&#34; proves that Avenged Sevenfold are the kings of hard rock.  Their writing, and musicianship, are magnificently presented on this very well-produced album.  The band's ability to produce what used to be called &#34;concept albums&#34; is once again showcased, and many of the songs are complex, progressive hard rock that will stand the test of time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very enjoyable and holds your interest.  Great for all age groups.  I love them and so do my children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Many popular TV shows start to get over hyped and as the hype increases the reasons why you loved the show starts to decrease.  Well, not Downton Abbey!  This show delivers all of the same wonderful characters and witty dialogue that we all feel in love with in seasons 1 and 2.  I won't spoil anything but the drama increases and you will gasp frequently throughout the season.  I love this ensemble but Maggie Smith continues to steal every scene in the most delicious way.  I cannot wait for season 4!
B005HE5J7I|5.0|I read the entire book to my husband, and we stopped every so often (to catch our breath), and to discuss the related London history.  We both have been to London, and if we get to go back again, we will look for the history at every corner. We also read Paris: the Novel, and felt much the same about it, but were much more familiar with Paris both architecturally and history-wise. We are thinking about reading New York. Mr. Rutherfurd, you have us hooked!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Crossfire books are absolutely fantastic! Best books I have read. Sylvia Day by far is the best ...  all 3 books couldn't put them down. Loved the ending :) Enjoyed the characters hope number 4 comes out too. Buy these books there a must.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I like this bag a lot. It's very comfortable, and fits all of my things. Though, I have trouble getting things in/out of it while I'm walking. I find I have to stop, set the bag down, unzip and get things out which takes up valuable time. It's definitely a great bag, but not for me.
B003UAMWWQ|5.0|My parents showed me that movie and I couldn't stop laughing! I saw the movie \\"Honey, I shrunk the kids\\" and I thought that Rick Moranis was funny in that movie! But, he did an outstanding job playing \\"Dark helmet\\" and I thought all the characters were really funny including actor/director Mel Brooks. My favorite character would have to be Yogurt because, I love his catch phrase,\\"May the Schwartz be with you!\\" So anyway, if you love Mel Brooks and STAR WARS you should watch this movie! I highly recommend it. So, thanks, for reading this I hope you have a good time watching this movie, and \\"May the Schwartz be with you!!\\"
B000SW4DP8|5.0|Under the expert direction of Jim Sheridan, this simple story of an Irish family moving into NYC remains one of the best tearjerkers in recent decades. The performances are fantastic all around. The little girls (sisters in real life) deliver performances unlike what you ever get to see kids do onscreen - emotional, honest, raw, thoughtful. The parents are both expertly played by a very moving Paddy Considine and an always astounding Samantha Morton. Finally, in one of the more overlooked performances in recent years, Djimon Hounsou radiates warmth, love and deep affection staggeringly from the screen. For anyone who likes an intimate, well told family story, this is not to be missed.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I've always enjoyed their music. This was a great price when I bought it and I listen to it on a regular basis.  If you are a fan of CCR and don't have this, you are missing out.
B0063M22QO|5.0|it was a lot of fun and a real challenge to play.  The signs on the tiles are easy to read.
B00CNB31U0|5.0|Beautiful cinematography, gripping story line, and the ending leaves you begging for more.  If you need an action packed adventure that is suitable for all ages, this is it!
B008R14YBK|5.0|I love this CD. Sounds unique, fun but also mature. This artist is top on my playlist. I bought this for my daughter but it quickly became my favorite CD. No more car fights over music because we both love this music.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I loved this movie as Kate Beckinsale was back!! An we got to see what happen to her & Scoot Speedman! If you love vampire & werewolves, you'll love this story. Enjoy the action & suspense TY
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|Every time I start a game, whether scored on time or tiles, it stops way before I'm done. The graphics are beautiful, so that's why I gave it two stars.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This is the informational jumping off point for which I have been looking.  It puts a whole new perspective to the idea of the religion of Christianity vs the reality of Jesus.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family,very funny & entertaining! I think E-1 should see it they will fall in love with Agnes as I did & her fluffy Unicorn. I got this movie right away which was amazing,didn't take long at all!! Enjoy  this movie!!!! TY
B00A757EFW|5.0|whats not to like? i got it for my son's tablet, he's six and loves it. hats off to the old school.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I read the Kindle version of this book and couldn't put my Kindle Fire down.  I then downloaded the audiobook so I could listen to it  in the car.  Anita Moorjani shares her life with us and has written a wonderful book about her NDE.  By the way, Ms. Moorjani does a fantastic job of narrating her own audio book.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|This movie was so action packed,,and a few great surprises! I loved that Vin Diesil,Paul  Walker,Jordana Brewster were all together again along with others! I've watched this movie at least 25 times already to me it's great!! You know we will see a few more,Oh Yes can't wait!!! Enjoy this movie,,,TY
B00C2IF9SQ|5.0|This is an amazing memoir. When I was in competitive gymnastics this book was my bible! A great, motivational, and inspirational story! Dominique Moceanu is and forever will be my gymnast idol! I am so happy I had the pleasure of reading this and I encourage others to do the same!
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|I very much love this movie.  There is a pre-order issue though.  I was thinking the movie would arrive on the release date.  I did not receive the film until a full week after its release.  I could have gone to any store and purchased it and had it earlier at the same price.  I won't pre-order a movie again.
B007YYLQ6C|5.0|Great family movie for all to enjoy. Heart warming, great entertainment based on a true story.  Actors did a wonderful job.
B0079R8KXG|1.0|Did not fit my Kindle Fire. Akin to wearing a size small when you actually wear a medium. Love the color and the quality is stellar, simply, not the right size.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This movie is a great childrens movie and also enjoyable for adults. I as an adult enjoyed the portrayal of each holiday character and how they played a role in the movie. It's very fun family movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys cartoon movies.
1407130366|5.0|I saw the movie first and so I wanted to read the book and in no way was I desappointed. The books are so jam pack with action that even the most stubborn boy reader will like this book. There is a love story in the mix but it is so subtle and so intwined with what is going on you almost over look it. There are fights and survival and death but its not a dark story. Highly reccommend to all who loves to read.
0143119680|1.0|I wanted to read a \\"scary\\" book to get in the mood for Halloween and The Discovery of Witches fit the bill up to a point.  I was greatly disappointed when the character, Diana Bishop, went from being semi-interesting to suddenly a Brainless Twit.  This type of sappy writing can be found in the Twilight Series and any Harlequin story. My recommendation would be to pass by this title on the bookshelf and pick up Dracula by Bram Stoker.  Leave The Discovery of Witches to the pre-teen reader.

B0060QM09M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and recommend this to teens as well as adults.  It was also very informative about the English.
B001TH16DI|4.0|At the end of the movie where Scotty shot the Klingon and he fell to the floor below........the part were they reveled it was actually Colonel West in disguise......was omitted!!!  Was wondering if this was on purpose or a mistake?????  Either way it's not good unless you are seeing the movie for the first time........I have owned this collection since it came out on VHS and have watched them numerous times over the years. A bit disappointing to have the climax of this movie compromised........

B000EWBKLC|4.0|Saw really should be exempt from most criticism as James Wan managed to pull of a helluva trick considering the innumerable restrictions and compromises that made the shoot very hard for the first-time feature director. Who'd ever believe that such a tiny movie would be the first to re-invent horror for the 21st century? Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell play Doctor Gordon and hapless jerk Adam, a mis-matched duo who wake up in a disgusting bathroom chained to the piping at either end of the expansive room. A dead body lies between, blood and gore on the floor around it. Doctor Gordon suspects that it is the work of the infamous \\"Jigsaw\\" - a madman known for subjecting lowlifes to brutal tests to prove their desire to live.<br /><br />A series of flashbacks follow which build a greater story around the plight of the two men, culminating in a climax that is still as unnerving now as it was nearly 10 years ago. Saw is a very clever film, but is let down by overly filtered cinematography, choppy editing that is full of stutter cuts, and a sound design that is bloated with far too many cheap stingers. The acting is a little weak at times too but considering the conditions, and the fact that there was no rehearsal at all so the footage you see is sometimes the first attempt by the actors to get it done means you can't judge it too harshly.<br /><br />The production design tries to emulate David Fincher's Se7en but ends up looking like a cheap 70s porno. But the whole film was shot in one big building, so you just can't pick faults. Like I said, what Wan managed to pull off with the time and budget he was given is nothing short of remarkable. The sequels were given more money to crazy with, but the first Saw movie should be viewed as a different entity.<br /><br />Love it or hate it, Saw is a major achievement for the fledgling writer/director pairing of Whannell and Wan.<br /><br />Saw is presented in a very drab and grainy 1.78:1 1080p picture on Blu-ray that reflects the harsh shooting restrictions. There was probably no time to set up and shoot more dynamic attempts at cinematography which gives the film a raw aesthetic, that fits the subject matter at the very least. The loud, obnoxious sound design is in DTS HD-MA, and extras are minimal.arsh shooting restrictions.

0812550706|5.0|Enders game is a fantastic book and I would recommend reading it. It would satisfy any reader who likes sci-fi books with action.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita Moorjani delivers her story in a profound and believable manner.  I usually read mysteries, novels and self-help books, I was surprised that it held my interest to the very end.  I was held hostage to each page, because of its style and tempo, which led to an easy read. I have recommended this book to all of my friends, as well as to anyone that I engage in conversation along this line. Once you read it, and you experience what I did, then you will want to pass along the same message.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, and it is like a mix of subway surfers and temple run. I like it a lot . Rate it
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|This is a pretty good transfer of this film but not as much of a difference from the DVD version I had before.  I kind of expected a more dramatic difference.  I do love this film and the music in it and am happy to have it on Blu Ray, but the last DVD version was pretty good too.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|good purchase; DVD as stated; quick delivery; enjoyed the video<br />and learned some history. Lewis terrific actor. and won best actor<br />award. gmk
B00DG292SK|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  The only thing I would like to see different is that in the afterward he talked about having to edit the number of pages down from something 1000 or so.  I would have liked to have had those included as I am sure some very interesting stuff was left out.  I would recommend this book.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Tried the free trial version, &amp; my 2 year old daughter loved it so much I bought the full version. She needs no help working this app, and there are no ads for her to accidentally get into. She loves puzzles and the pieces don't have to be perfectly aligned for them to fall into place, so there is no frustration. Well worth the money!
B003OUXECE|5.0|I played Bioshock 1 and 2 when they first came out. The ideology behind the game caught my attention right away and I was immersed in the experience throughout both titles. A couple of years went by and I randomly stumbled upon the book one day, and of course, I bought it. (The book was only a couple dollars) The book itself was amazing, especially already having the basic concept. It explained all of my questions about the games and provided a much deeper insight to the building of Rapture, as well as the main characters in the game. I'd also like to note that the book itself is extremely well written; props to John Shirley for writing an amazing story. After reading the book, I went back and played Bioshock 1 and 2 again, which proved to be an awesome experience. The details, storyline, hidden gems, and side characters all meant a little more, and drew me further into the game. All in all, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who was a fan of the games.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|FUN FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Play right known and you will LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to be like the happiest happiest
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy. Saves time. The only calculator I use. The memory option is great if you are adding a long list of numbers.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|My school had chosen this book for us to read, as always I groaned, not wanted to read it. But once I started reading. I couldn't set my kindle down! I finished it in two days and I would definitely recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anybody. Here I go, reading it again.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|This is the second August Burns Red album I've listened to (the first being Constellations).<br />Though I felt there were a few moments that were kinda awkward/cheesy-- like when the vocalist yells out lines he was just speaking in &#34;Spirit Breaker&#34;--I generally really enjoyed the music and the content of the lyrics. Though I haven't heard their other albums, in comparison to Constellations, I noticed the band played around more with different sounds in melodies. I'm particularly thinking of &#34;Creative Captivity&#34; and &#34;Echos&#34;.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|He play all day and learn every time More . now os expert playing  i love this game is awesome

B008Y212PI|5.0|This is TOTALLY a 5star app because it has all different levels of puzzles for everyone so it's always a challenge!!
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|I enjoy playing this game; however, it locks up a lot on my Kindle Fire HD. My husband plays the game on his first generation Kindle Fire and has the same problems. If this did not happen so often I would have given it 5 stars.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app is really a great app to have if you enjoy photography and art. the only problem that I have had is finding a drop box that works with it so i can upload my photos from my phone to my kindle fire...other than that i would rate this app as a five star app..download it today and see the world from a different lens...its awesome!!!

140006922X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I read it in a couple of weeks. In several chapters I was even able to visualize the historical times of Jesus; it was like a script for a movie.<br /><br />I just wished he would had been as tough with Mohamed  in his book Not God by God as he was with Jesus of Nazareth int this book. I just sense a little bias on that. Otherwise I found it very informative.<br /><br />I should wait for comments from scholars and people versed in the topic.<br />I'm also waiting for the translation to Spanish (Which is my language).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Fine app.  Works well. Quick to load easy to use.  Large screen and the price is right adds are minimal. I use it often thanks
030758836X|1.0|Not enjoyable. Characters are grating. Just not my style. Story leaves a bad taste in the mouth...leaves you without resolution but not the &#34;cliffhanger&#34; type...more like a sense of hopelessness. You could argue that the characters got what they deserved. No one needs to read a story like this...Unless you like wallowing in your own self pity...then this book will be right up your alley.
B0001IN07Q|4.0|I purdhased this dvd and cd and I could play the dvd on my dvd player. I was very diappointed when the Caught InThe Act dvd arrived and it would not play on my dvd.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|My family and I love this cd and dvd, music, lyrics and performance are great and inspiring. Great worship and family experience.
B00435WX7G|5.0|This model is really really cool. It is just like the one in OP. But you may like to pay attention that the people are not colored, and I really recommend that you should use tools to get the pieces down because they are easy to break. But this model is still a very very nice one.
0345525558|4.0|This isn't the kind of novel that I normally pick up, but I'm so glad that I did. It's so well written, and the depiction and voice of the main character is done with sensitivity and just enough wit to make it authentic.  The book also has a very strong sense of place (northern CA or the Bay Area), and the writing is lush. The book does move back and forth between the present and past, but this is done intelligently and seemlesly. I look forward to more works from this author.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is great!  I love to make books and hear a robot read it to me!  Also it's like you can be and award winning  book maker with the way they stack your books on shelfs!!
0307476073|2.0|I got this book because some friends were raving about it, and, of course, because of all the publicity. It starts out well. This picaresque kind of narrative usually works. Even the flashbacks to her mother's death and her (self-imposed) failed marriage were well written. So why can't I rave about this book? I didn't like the narrator herself nor the narrative voice. And, when it comes to my enjoying or slogging through memoir, this is a major issue. There were times when it was easy to see where someone (an editor?) had instructed this writer to add or subtract or insert. There were also parts of the book that rang (for me) as shallow, self-obsessed and lacking in true intellectual introspection.<br /><br />I can see why it's been popular. But I really struggled through to the end--all the while wondering why I was bothering.
1934030554|5.0|The best book about cycling training with powermeter. Demands a good knowledge and is a source for research during the whole season.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|clean master keeps my tire running like new.  moves files cleans the trash and frees operating memory. dimple interface. I reccommend it often.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I found this book completely relatable.  I recognized so many of the characters, it felt like a reunion of sorts.  Really nice job of weaving in so many of the management concepts I've learned and read about with references to &#34;The Goal&#34;, kanban, Lean, etc.  I'll be recommending this book to many of my friends and colleagues.
159562015X|5.0|After that i graduated from college with BS in business marketing, I was so confused what to do and where to start. This test helped me to find my passion for teaching. After that I did first grade classroom observation, I found my passion for my loving career. I decided to become a teacher, and I love it. Thank you.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|This ia a very powerful film with excellent acting, especially Sean Penn's performance.  It is much better than I remembered.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Great read that I couldn't put down! I loved hoping the Becky would figure it out. So many times I wished I could just tell her. I found myself smiling when she got through it all in the end.
B005LAIH2C|2.0|Updating fairy tales has been a popular past-time for decades. At first, Disney would give its spin to the classics, mostly by providing happier or more upbeat endings to the tales. Recently, some updates have been more like reversals, making the villains not just sympathetic but even the heroes of the stories. Others have moved the tales to different times and places, often contemporary times and places.<br /><br />Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters start with a faithful if over-the-top retelling of their story of abandoning by their father, discovering the candy house, and killing the witch who was planning to eat them. The feat put them on a career path that takes up most of the movie, killing witches and other nefarious beings professionally. It also sets the tone for the movie. The witch is fairly gruesome and her death in the oven is a bit much. The scene ends with a swear-filled voice-over by Hansel about what they learned from the experience.<br /><br />So there's a lot of swearing and gore and nasty creatures but it's not particularly scary, definitely not a horror film. It doesn't have enough laughs in it to make it a good comedy. Hansel and Gretel are a bit too brutal and a bit too grim to be fun action heroes. The dialogue sounds like contemporary urban characters but the setting is grungy small-town middle ages and the two never quite fit together. The same goes with their high-tech fighting gear and semi-martial arts combat moves--sure they look cool except they don't quite match the other elements. The film makers seem to have had a lot of different ideas of ways to go with the movie and then put them all in without any thought of how to blend them.<br /><br />The movie is very uneven and unsatisfying.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|The author spends much time stating her case for growth mindset... Too much time,  in proportion. I also did not like all the examples of singular events exposed framed in either one mindset or another; these singular events far out-weighed any examples of long term &#34;outcomes&#34; for someone who is a social scientist. The biggest downfall was the how-to section ... Basically just do it... Print and past a chart to your mirror to look at everyday. The reader needs much more.. Strategies, tips, how to deal w/ relapse, daily journal prompting/ reflection questions, etc. could have been so much more. Also, I would like to know the relation of &#34;mindset&#34; to resiliency.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I gave this to my husband for Christmas and we have listened to it in the car on family trips, everyone put it on their ipods, we learned the lyrics, and talked about the characters.  It has been a great addition to our playlists!  Fabulous performers, fabulous recording!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very interesting.  Got results on several of the &#34;tests&#34;.  Easy, short and fun read.  I plan to read it again and work on a couple more tests.
B00DYWKPAQ|4.0|The first song I heard off the album was \\"supersoaker.\\" I admit, I wasnt stoked about it but after several listens off my spotify playlist, the song's sound \\"clicked\\" and it became an enjoyable song-- one I would look forward to hearing. When the album was released, I listened to it and, again, wasn't thrilled. No song was memorable. I knew this to be weird for KOL because \\"Only by the night\\" was one of the albums I swore by when I listened to it during my sophomore year of college (2010). So I listened to the album again, but this time while reading the lyrics. Suddenly, everything  \\"clicked.\\" The album deserves several listens. Great lyrics. I knew KOL couldnt have possibly disappointed. I give it 4 stars because it wasn't an instant \\"one-listen-i'm-loving-it\\" album for me.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Mega City 1; a vast, sprawling metropolis, home to 800 million citizens, housed in enormous hive-like tower-blocks. Crime is rampant and is only kept in check by a department of brutal, unforgiving lawmen known as \\"Judges\\"; enforcers and executioners combined. Dredd is the best of them... he IS the law.<br /><br />Dredd is a comic book hero (or perhaps anti-hero) who made his appearance in the British sci-fi comic [[ASIN:1781080089 2000AD]] during the mid seventies. Ironically, he didn't appear until the second edition (or \\"Prog\\") of the comic (ironic because Dredd is unarguably one of that comic's most iconic creations). The story lines were at first glance relatively simple action adventure affairs but underlying them were some fairly complex (for a pre-teen reader) socio-political concepts. They also strayed far and wide from their action roots to cover romance, road-movie and comedy themes as well.<br /><br />While earlier generations grew up with Biggles, Bulldog Drummond and Dan Dare, mine had Dredd.<br /><br />Now, there has been one [[ASIN:B009YOH62S previous attempt to film Judge Dredd]] - Stallone's depiction is almost universally despised by true fans of the ultimate lawman, but I honestly didn't find the film too bad. As I remember it, the visualisation of the whole Dredd concept was done surprisingly well and even Sly managed to convince me \\"Eye am the leaurgh!\\". The film's most egregious crime was to allow Dredd to remove his helmet - something that only happened twice in the comic (once blanked out by a \\"c e n s o r e d\\" sticker and then with his face swaddled in bandages. Dredd is a faceless embodiment of the harsh justice of MC1, but also an enigma, a \\"man-with-no-name (actually, it's \\"Joe\\") and the helmet is a symbol of his unrelenting pursuit of \\"justice\\". But that's enough about the previous film... how do Urban (Dredd), Garland (writer) and Travis (director) fare in this \\"reboot\\"?<br /><br />Well, mostly good, but I'll start with the bad. Well, not especially \\"bad\\", but the look of MC1 is not quite the thing as far as I'm concerned. I saw the metropolis as a far denser, darker, more vertical place - more like Manhattan or Hong Kong than the wide open city, studded with city-blocks that we see in the film. It was also a much more futuristic city. In \\"Dredd\\" we are presented with a very 20th/21st Century place, where everyone drives VW Combi Vans instead of hover cars. You could have taken out Joe Dredd and replaced him with [[ASIN:B002MZ1UQE Harry Calahan]] or [[ASIN:B0000X7S7U Popeye Doyle]] and the film wouldn't have suffered (much). That was the only real disappointment, however.<br /><br />Urban wears the helmet and the badge drokking well. Dredd's comic book nickname is \\"Old Stoneface\\" and Urban has that trademark grimace down to a tee. So he earns top marks as a robotic, emotionless lawman. And he never removes his helmet. His acting support is a little variable, however. Olivia Thirlby does well enough as a rookie side-kick but her [[ASIN:1906735220 Judge Anderson]] is far too young and vulnerable and insufficiently highly strung for my taste. Lena Heady is amazingly good as a spaced out narc overlord, sexy and brutal by turns, and she steals the film in her scenes. She has a seemingly endless army of rather forgettable henchmen so the film boils down to her interaction with JD, with a side-order of Thirlby looking good and (eventually) kicking butt.<br /><br />The story is (unlike this review) suitably cut down and simple. Judges vs perps and there's only one possible outcome. That's all you need for this sort of a deal. I'll admit that the ending was a bit of a let-down and perhaps could have been done better - but then maybe we are just too used to the neatly packaged Hollywood crescendo-ending where morals are drawn and sequels are hinted at. Sometimes in life, things do simply end on a flat note.<br /><br />Ah yes. The blood. There is a fair bit of that, I can tell you. Well - more than a fair bit, to be honest and \\"Dredd\\" easily lives up to it's 18 certificate. Indeed, I can't think of any more gruesome film (not that I seek them out) and it appears that the director and cinematographer decided to make the gore a bit of an art form for this movie. Blood, guts and bursting bodies we clearly at the top of their \\"themes\\" list when they started work on the storyboard. Indeed, there IS an element of beauty to the treatment of the violence and death here - the slow-mo passage of a bullet through a human head, the Pollockesque sprays of blood and brains. It may be amovie for a lover of cinematographic art, but it is NOT a movie for the squeamish.<br /><br />Certainly the cinematography is very well done - the movie looks a million dollars with some startlingly vivid imagery (and I'm not just talking about the blood and guts). I only watched it in HD 2D but I can imagine that it's probably a seminal 3D film as well.<br /><br />This release is backed up by a number of fairly dull and brief \\"making of\\" mini documentaries and some particularly soul-less talking head interviews with the actors and creators.<br /><br />A startlingly gory, fairly simplistic but very enjoyable action film. I would give it five-stars for the watching experience and general treatment of the Dredd concept, and would mark it down one half of a star for it's poor depiction of the Mega City.<br /><br />Four and a half stars.it, to be honest and \\"Dredd\\" easily lives up to it's 18 certificate.

B003TTKB5I|5.0|Great show! Never realized how good it was till it is gone. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime and free streaming.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Didn't fall into the hype, didn't love it<br />. Definitely expected more. Good for a waiting room read or plane ride.
0385523394|3.0|It was hard to remember whicvh character was who or what.  I had to go back a chapter to see who this person was that she was talking about.  I guess that thery were not rememberable when first written about.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm addicted to Downton Abbey!  The writing, directing, editing, acting, etc. is fabulous. I've loved all 3 seasons to date.
B00AZ3027I|5.0|Best movie ever! Besides all the other Disney movies. This was a Peter Pan emergency and Amazon had my back as usual. Much appreciated!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I felt like I was in the story. There was never a dull moment and it kept my attention the whole way.
B0036TGT2A|4.0|The Little Mermaid is my all time favorite Disney movie. After the cancellation of the 3D theatrical release, naturally I was very excited that there was a 3D blu-ray edition. YOU NEED A 3D TV AND 3D BLU-RAY PLAYER OR PS3 TO WATCH THE 3D DISK!!!!!! I was not aware of this, and thought that if I had some extra Disney 3D glasses from the theater, I could watch the movie in 3D on my television. I don't regret purchasing this product; the cover art is beautiful, and the digital copy and free music downloads are nice. But I wish I had read the fine print and known that a 3D blu-ray player is different from a regular blu-ray player.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Having this app is wonderful.  We have been able to download free books and we are using it alot! My children enjoy reading the books they have.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A great way to pass the time.  The puzzles are not hard but are entertaining.  Also enjoyed the colorful graphics.
1250029465|5.0|I'm an English lady living in California and I really relate to Jame's book and his friend Bob the cat.  I have a cat that looks and acts like Bob.  I found him on the street and took him in.  I loved reading all about London and all the lingo.  It has brought back a lot of memories.  I wish the best for James and Bob and I will recommend this book to all my friends.,
B005C0DHEY|5.0|I'm an environmental science teacher and environmental scientist.  This Ac. Award nominated film is a great choice to show students and adults alike.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Love it! Can't wait to try other games like this one. I like that some levels get fairly challenge. Thanks for a great game.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Great book with lots of emotions. Love story with a little tweaks. I look f o reward to more books by this author.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie was a fantastic lead to the climax of Part 2, which I also bought as soon as it was available.
1616551607|5.0|This art book box set makes a great coffee table set piece. The box itself is covered very pretty fabric cover and the books are a fascinating read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This was an awesome story. It brings to mind memories in all of us. Each of us have lived a less than perfect life and yet, we turn out just fine! I didn't know the story of the orphan train and now I want to read more about it. It is amazing the people who come into our lives!
1421550644|5.0|The box set has two books in it, both well bound and the size of a small town phone book. The manga greatly expands on the anime of the same name. If you like the anime you'll love the manga.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Best book read this year!  The characters were so relatable, and the story line was intriguing and. At times humorous
B00CIFK316|3.0|Crime mystery drama- it is well written for its time though not a great page turner. An easy read and no concentration required
B00AW8UK0K|2.0|I like the concept, loved the doco on BBC very sorry I bought the kindle version, for me I like the glossy photography, helps to keep me motivated.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The movie is based on both books that is why it took so long to make b/c Orson Scott Card didn't think Enders Game on its own would transfer over to a movie format very well without skewing his story.<br /><br />As a literary major, this is one of my top 10 favorite books. I would not be lost on an island without it. Its an easy read which is character driven. But like all of Card's novels its deep if you want to read it that way. I'm reading it for the 3rd time now on my Kindle Paperwhite and I am writing on almost every page b/c I'm taking notes about the society structure, character drives, criss cross motives, socio-political backdrop, etc. so you can really get a lot more out of it if you want to.<br /><br />About 1/3 of the way into Enders Game and Enders Shadow is where the 2 books cross over to meet each other in the same time - when the characters meet that is. I've never had the opportunity to read 2 books at the same time but I read one book until I get past the last overlap then jump back to the other book - back and forth - criss crossing and driving up the timeline of both books at the same time. It is amazing! very enjoyable that way to read both sides of the story at the same time.<br /><br />Don't see the movie first though and don't read the reviews - you want to read these 2 books without outside interference so nothing is &#34;given away&#34; before you read them. Enjoy!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Awesome piece of technology wish it would support more apps like apple iphoto  as it only supports selected apps and although you can use it to see your tv screen you cannot use it to see pop ups as it only displays webpage and not associated content with that webpage. My 20 month old loves it as I use it to play nursery rhymes form you tube.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved this glimpse into the Roaring 20s, I especially loved the dance hall scenes. I would definitely recommend it,
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My 8 year old loves it and uses it on kindle to read the Bible daily  and it is great in that it has easy to read version and breaks out the bible into topics!!!
B009C7JS14|5.0|Does everything it says and then some, couldn't ask for anything more. I absolutely love this FREE app, it's excellent!
0062127241|3.0|While they write completely differently, one coherently and one idiosyncratically (guess which is which), I found a similarity between this memoir and Neil Young's \\"Waging Heavy Peace\\" - both books fluctuate starkly between being immensely informative/interesting and equally tedious.<br /><br />Mr. Townsend's book is a wealth of information, both personally and historically, and for the most part I enjoyed it. The down side? Oddly, for a man as accomplished and erudite as he, Townsend's open reportage often comes off feeling self-congratulatory - and when writing of others, often feels like name-dropping. Is this his insecurity coming out or am I imagining things? (Don't answer that.)<br /><br />Either way....
1781162646|5.0|Just  a classic Stephen King story. Loved the characters. Only complaint - too short. I really enjoyed reading the book.
031603438X|5.0|If you're into rock 'n' roll history and/or the Stones, this is one to choose.  It's the closest I've encountered to being on a par with the Miles Davis autobiography (a superb book by an extremely important and highly influential music figure).  As with Mr. Davis, Mr. Richards is fearlessly and unapologetically honest and possessed of a keen memory, and best of all, it feels as though you're in conversation with the man.
B001ECQ6E2|5.0|If you already own the DVD, it is still worthwhile to trade up and purchase this disc. The format is standard with a beautiful new video. The sound is the original mono with a stereo option. Robert Taylor is a wooden actor and is outclassed by Peter Ustinov's delicious over the top Nero. Deborah Kerr plays her fragile role wonderfully well.<br />I own a projector which throws a ten foot picture on a white wall. Just like I saw the movie so many years ago.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I play few of the online games, it helps me waist my Sapir time.<br />Too much writing on one app it's too much for me.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|great game nice and relaxing. if you like hidden object games this one is good. graphic are excellent too. me
B00DK9FNLY|3.0|Nothing to describe too much. It is an app with some good tips of tt.<br />Real n on tablet does make difference.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was thrilled with this entire series I really lived all if Christians revelations about his past and Ana`s strength us amazing-
B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  Humor,  action,  character interaction, social commentary,  graphics,  favorite actors,  political commentary,  aliens.  It has it all.
B0048KXRR6|3.0|My grandchildren love it, but I'm afraid I raised my children on Mary Poppins and you just can't beat &#34;perfect&#34;.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Takes a little skill to get good. There's this wheel you have to spin to box faster and I just can't get the hang of it. But the colors and artwork are great. Fun time waster.
0763644765|2.0|I didn't care for some of the artwork - liked the other book better - it's ok - I keep at my house
B0071DJZZA|3.0|Ok book needs more action and then I may like it I may read the other books but I am looking for a book that fits me
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The media has made this book out to be a porn/romance novel. It IS a love story and there are a lot of sex scenes but it is VERY well written. I love how this author writes and I'm very glad that I'm reading this series on my Kindle because of the dictionary option, my vocabulary has been expanded for sure. Love this book and can't wait to see the movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great app and fun for the whole family but it is definitely addictive.  Both of my small children love it and we all three take turns playing it
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fun game, super addictive and free to boot? Can't beat that. Great app, not a big buyer of apps phone apps but this would make me reconsider
B001FOR5XU|5.0|This was a good read.  I like the fact that it came with some of the authors other short stories included.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I have a lake about 1000ft from my house.  I have been able to receive my wifi signal from there. So now I go there with my laptop and have even been able to use my webcam from that lakefront with my friends.  They are amazed too!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love this game. It took me a few minutes playing it to understand the concept and how to actually solve each &quot;picture&quot; but once I understood, I couldn't stop playing! This game reminds me of the sudoku challenges in which I have come to love over the years. Hours of fun to get lost in.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The best book that I have Eads in a very long time.  The prose is masterfu; the stories are rich, and the characters are fascinating.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app. I downloaded it because I couldn't ting battery pro. but its way better. it estimates how much time you have left depending on what you're doing. love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved this book.  The subject was uniqued and made good reading.  Made me think, what would i have done in her shoes, but never came to a clear cut decision.,
B003O86FMW|3.0|Book one was good, this one is even better.  A page turner you can't put down. Five star for sure.
B009Y61ZMI|5.0|Not sure what more I can say other than we enjoyed the movie but as all movies go that is very subjective.  Its about a genetically engineered soldier that they replace with a better soldier... or at least they though
B00BC5FN2C|4.0|He and I have enjoyed the first season.  I would recommend it.  Also an insight to what we are seeing in DC now.
B001EX81ZI|5.0|I think these may be compatible with both Natural and Classic - but either way, they fit nicely into the Natural Bottle Screw Rings. Disclaimer: baby isn't here yet, I will try to update once I have actually had a chance to use them. This review is based only on checking to make sure they snapped into place on the Natural bottle rings.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|It took most of my memory on my kindle but it's huge game! Also but there's a problem. The mouths don't move when they talk but it's a good game!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is addicting and fun. Great for all ages. Kids are better than adults. But vector is a pain.  Should be easier to correct birthday though.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love this game. I'm always ready to go back and play some more. I recommend this to anyone who likes logic games.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This was a wonderful book and can't wait to dive into the next one. Keeps you ready for more. Good job Martin!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A real page turner. Amazing writing and plot twists. Compelling and insightful book not to be missed. Highly recommend it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I had been having problems trying to find a charging system that would work with my Kindle as well as my Samsung Galaxy phone. All that I tried either would not charge or would take forever, slight exaggeration.  The PoweFast and the USB to Micro-USB cable works like a charm.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a fun game. Unlike others I have played. I have really enjoyed playing this ham e on my kindle.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This series holds your interest........special effects are good as is photography and color....especially on BluRay,,,,,,,,,there is ALOT of gore but it seems to lessen as series develops.......you eventually get used to it as the acting and casting is first rate.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Excellent. I'd you like Tom Selleck and a good whodoneit, this is your series. Dark somber mood and music but the good guy always wins.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|If you can get passed the Old English, then it's a decent read. After reading this book, it's amazing just how much the movies butchered the original story.
0385742886|1.0|This book provides no answers whatsoever to the questions that are unanswered by the first 3 books. Save your money, don't waste it on this.
B00B7FOQCK|3.0|After corresponding with tech support I discovered that the Hub is not designed for what I was attempting to do.  It is designed for light duty type work.  Support was very helpful with pointing out the specifications for the hub. Another thing, although very small, the picture presented on the review page does not match the hub I received.<br /><br />Not at all satisfied with this product - have to keep updating the driver - devices attached to this hub hang - while trying to copy from one attached hard drive to anther attached hard drive received a message that the drive is not accessible and needs to be formatted - I don't trust the hub at all.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is perfect. My original cord fell apart and I needed to replace it. This works just like it should.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does what it says, really clean, well done in every feature, I would gladly replace the standard calculator for this one
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good movie... Very action packed and suspenseful. Great if you are interested in magic and mystery!! One of my favorites:)
B007SYWFRM|1.0|WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP ASKING US TO UPDATE TO A NEWER VERSION THAT NEVER DOWNLOADS/ UPDATES!!! TIRED OF LOSING EVERYTHING I BUILT/PURCHASED ONLY TO LOSE IT AGAIN!!! SO DONE WITH THIS GAME. NOT EVEN WORTH THE ONE STAR I GAVE IT.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|SHE HAS REMARKABLE TALENT, GLAD TO SEE HER TAKE IT INTO THE BLUES, GUESS BB, & JOHNNY LANG WERE GLAD TO JOIN HER INTO NEW TERRITORY
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting that I waste all my battery life playing it. You need to buy this game.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We rented this movie on amazon because we wanted to see the new movie and felt this would be a good way to understand the premise of the Reds 2 movie.  The story was never slow - always moving and interesting.  Yes there is a lot of shooting and some gruesome acts as this is a spy story/action thriller.  It was really good and I would not mind watching it more than once.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My grandchild loved it he spent hours putting the pieces together, he said it was very good. I am very pleased with it.<br />Kay Burns
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Everyone in our family from 6 to 45 loves this game. What a great improvement to the original Angry Birds Star Wars game.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|this was FANTASTICALLY DONE! it was nice that they gave an explanation the ~slow-mo~ effects were happening and it wasnt over done. Outside of that issue i loved the story, it was dark and gritty and the movie was full of great actions scenes! best of all they didnt try to shoe horn some love story into where it doesnt belong(not in my action movie!).
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|I went in to see this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about, other than race cars (I prefer drag racing, Formula 1 is one of those European things I never paid attention to). Now I am obsessed with both Hunt and Lauda...the cinematography is great, the 'feel' of the era is palpable, the racing scenes are exciting, the casting was brilliant...all in all a wonderful suprise.  Even if you aren't a racing fan, it's worth a look.  And the soundtrack...wonderful!
B000000H4V|5.0|A Sepultura classic CD, what else can be said. Bought it used and it came in perfect shape and like new.
B000VBJ504|5.0|Still love the old GNR takes me back to the good old days of care free heavy metal. Loved Slash and Axel at their best.
1475143389|5.0|I don't know where to start, every part of this book is important and great!  I love this book.  I read it and this book really hit every point about building muscles.  How Mike breaks down every aspect of building muscle and the truth about dieting.  I even emailed Mike about some questions and he answers back within a day.  I can tell that this guy actually cares.  Highly recommend this book to everyone.
B000V658NW|5.0|Still love the old GNR takes me back to the good old days of care free heavy metal. Loved Slash and Axel at their best.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book is great as motivator and introduction to minimalism. The topic can sometimes seem intimidating and overwhelming but Francine makes you feel like you can do it and I can't wait to read her other book The Joy of Less and start on my journey to a simpler and minimal life. Keep on writing Francine it is clearly your passion!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Opened a truth for me, thank you. I stopped eating any kind wheat long time ago, but still felt like to have some sweet cookies, and this book helped me to stop even my wishes.

B009EEFTMC|4.0|Needs more shapes but other than that I love the game please get more shapes thanks so much ! Kimako Martin
B00004WG2F|5.0|On of my favorite movies of all time.  Needed to buy it for a friend and found it easily on amazon. Love this site
B000TERDNO|5.0|If you were/are a fan or just like a couple of his songs (and therefore you are snobby), I believe this album collects his hits and some re-recordings of some of them.  The result is this album is like the best thing going in rock, but what's really cool is Billy Idol himself, his singing, and his backup singers.  Great! Great! Great!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It was a book I couldn't put down.  I would recommend to anyone who likes action, mystery, puzzles and technology.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Beautiful in form and function. Great interaction with clock application as well. Extremely accurate. Almost instantaneous results. A MUST for Kindle Fire users.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a great movie. I would go as to say in the top 3 of all the Star Trek material released so far.
B00ENBTI8C|1.0|I made a mistake on ordering this item.  I also purchased the DVD of it as well and do not want the video download but do not know how to cancel it.  Please advise.  Thank you, ngs
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I got to level 66 had almost every animal family you could have...then poor gone.<br />The I got a new kindle and was able to get it at again.....now it won't work again after about seven or eight levels. One thing that is interesting is while I was unable to play I kept getting gifts and hearts etc please open out the kinks!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've tried all the battery apps and this is the best by far. Ability to synch and estimated times, well done.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It's word prediction is awesome! I've always used T9 because the Swype just wasn't cutting it. I thought I'd give this one a try, and glad I did! It's very smooth and user friendly! 5 stars al the way!
B0018R5XZ6|1.0|The movie disc is so entirely scratched up it says error when trying to play it in the dvd player.
B002QCAXOS|1.0|One of the worst if not the worst movie I have ever seen.  Childish plot with non existent character development.  Don't waste your time and money.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|A great CD.  I do not have seventeen more words for you.  I like it, and that should be enough.
0451149513|5.0|any time you can pick  up a book and not let it down, this is one of them, better than the movie

0446554995|4.0|this book is good but they have written far better books in the past, hopefully the future books will be 5 stars.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|I loved the movie and was a bit cautious about the tv show but by the end of the first series of this show I was hooked.  This album when released was  a must have for me and would be for all fans of the show.  I had it on vinyl and had to get in on cd. I am so happy with this purchase.
B001BANK32|5.0|I've just reread the Shining and the book is so much better than the movie,either version ,although thats true with any of his books that are made into movies.
B00000DG1R|4.0|I loved the sound from this time and these boys were one of the best.  I was so happy to locate this music on amazon and couldn't wait for it to arrive.  80s fans rejoice and get this greatest hits collection before they run out.  I really love it.

B004MYFV0O|4.0|This is a well-balanced book. While many how to draw books are overstuffed with text, this book focuses on providing the reader with a clear visual guide to drawing. Many other drawing books also seem to be more showcases for the author and short on the actual steps-this book is a pleasant exception. Most of the examples carefully show the reader each step in the process, which is rather critical for the beginning artist. However, some simply show the finished drawing and this is not very helpful.<br /><br />On the downside, the book stops a bit short. At the end, there is a very brief introduction to drawing hands and eyes, but it stops at this point without going into how to draw, say, a complete person.<br /><br />When considering a book like this, the main question I ask is this: did the book help me improve my drawing to a degree that is worth the price? In the case of this book, the answer is yes. By going through the 30 days of lessons, I could see a significant improvement in my drawing. However, the book mainly just takes the reader through some key basics-so if you are looking to learn more complicated matters (such as drawing a person, animal or scene) then you will want to also get another book to pick up where this very good introduction leaves off.<br /><br />Overall, this book is well worth buying. If you want to get the basic of drawing, get a a copy. Plus pencils, paper and a good kneaded eraser.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I'm not too fond of tv series, but this one caught my attention from the very start... it's fast paced, at least it is for a legal series, and the actor all do a terrific job playing their characters... there's enough intrigue to keep you wondering what's going to happen next and the thing I like the most is that the endings are very clever and are difficult to anticipate...
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This movie just gets better with age. Every time I watch it, I marvel at the youthful actors and compare them to their more recent roles. Just make the movie that much more interesting. As if the shenanigans of the young bunch of rapscallions isn't enough!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is pretty much all of Kelly Clarkson's best songs. It's great and you can pretty much rock out like a total girl for a good hour+ with this cd. Highly recommended. We listened to it on the way to Maroon 5 and Kelly Clarkson's concert and had a blast. Amazingly enough, Kelly is just as good in person as she is on her cd.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King for as long as I can remember. The Shining was one of my favorites, not the movie,  the book. I have always wondered about Dan Torrance and now I know. I don`t think I have ever been afraid of the books Mr. King mentioned that readers say have terrified them such as It, to me the most terrifying book he has written is The Stand. I think because of the whole biochemical weapons thing is such a real possibility. The whole idea of good versus evil which is also prominent in this book is becoming such a possible reality in the world today and that is what truly scares me. Keep writing Mr. King because this faithful reader can`t wait for the next thrill ride.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|This game is overall one of the better builder games. You buy animals and buildings like all the rest of the builder games but this one is based on Ice Age the movie so it has a nice tie-in to the Movie. They do it well so you feel like it is a continuation of the movie, with all the main characters and even some of the minor characters from all the movies in the series. They also have seasonal challenges and purchases like other games so you get extras every now and then. If you like to move things along you can use real money to make things happen faster or to acquire items faster. Now that I have heaped on praise there are some serious downsides as well.<br />1st - They are extremely stingy on the acorns (the real important currency in this game) especially the further you go in the game.<br />You can get acorns through various ways but they are few and far between and come in pitying amounts, usually 1 at a time which is pathetic when you realize there are plenty of families that will need over 500 acorns to complete. There even is a Therapod Dino family that needs 4000 acorns to complete. When you are lucky to get 1 acorn a day well you figure out how many years it would take to complete with out using real cash to buy extra acorns. The prices you pay in real cash for acorns can get carried away as well. To purchase the Therapod family out right you would have to spend about $200, yes I said 200 DOLLARS of your hard earned real cash just to complete that one family. I know they want to make money but fleecing your faithful gamers reeks, especially since gamers are the same ones that spent their money to see all the movies.<br />2nd - The internal app game \\"Kung Fu Scrat\\" One of the ways to make money and get acorns in this game-within-a game. The grand-prize awards start at 10 acorns and 160K cash plus a chance to get a special animal. Not bad if the chances of getting it weren't almost nil. I am now at level 62 and the grand-prize has only increased to 100 acorns or 6.9 million. As you have learned that amount of acorns isn't a great amount by any stretch of the imagination. The money sounds good at first until you realize I still have 6 families pending completion that all cost 80+ million each to finish. So I would have to hit the grand price over 10 times in a row just to complete one of the families. I have been playing this game for over a year and haven't hit the grand prize more then 4 times. So the Kung Fu Scrat has become Flat and a waste of time and I almost never play. I currently have over 20 silver coins(the things needed to pay, unless, again, you want to use acorns). It becomes a waste of time playing just to get 1 acorn or a petty small amount of money. Maybe if the game had some variety it would help but playing the exact same game over and over and over(sorry fell asleep) is lame. Like other games they up the awards as you get higher in the game, but not nearly enough to keep it a useful feature.<br />3rd - They also have awards for friends visiting your village and you visiting their village, which again are lame. They actually have awards of 100 coins, really stupid when you are trying to save up for a $26,000,000 Troodon or 104 million for the family. But the biggest problem with the Friends connection is that they keep loosing your friends and you have to jump through hoops to get them back. Or they show your friends but only part of, if any, of their village. You need to have your complete friends village show up to get all the awards that are available. Especially hearts that help get special items. I love the Hyrax tree, that was a nice addition that they recently added, now if they could only fix the glitch that keeps it from showing up in half of my friends villages.<br />4th - Glitches, AND HERE IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. There are just to many of them. They seem to be getting worse as the game matures. Usually the glitches get better with time but not this one. The glitches are getting excessive. The game won't update automatically like my other games, even though it states frequently, \\"checking for updates\\". If you don't periodically manually update it you get left behind and miss out on a lot of special seasonal items. I hate the fact that friend's villages are disappearing which has been an issue for a long time and all you get when you ask for help is \\"we are aware of it and are working on it\\"<br /><br />Now of course they want you to buy acorns because they cost real money, but later in the game it becomes almost a insult and feels like you are being fleeced. If these practices were done at your local Walmart they would go out of business. The practices of these companies will soon lead to laws restricting the amount and frequency they can fleece money from their game players. I know that sounds like it can't or shouldn't happen but they have gotten too excessive in the way they design the game to make it near impossible to advance with out purchasing items for real money. The cost of which is more then anyone would normally pay for a video game. People hesitate to pay 50 dollars for a PS3/X-Box game yet get tricked into paying $100s to $1000s 2-100 dollars at a time.<br />They really need to straighten out the glitches and the over priced acorns before attempting to add more stuff. The glitches especially are starting to override the game play and make the game more work then fun. At the current time it is still 1 of the best games but if the glitches aren't corrected soon it will be the best game I uninstalled!

0802473156|5.0|We all should want to be experts at giving love. Gary Chapman's 5 Love Languages has revolutionized our understanding of how to show love to others, and will benefit anyone seeking to speak love fluently. As a Communications professor and ordained minister who has done marriage counseling, I can say this is required reading for any marriage relationship, and will even benefit you in other relationships where you want to show Christ's love. I find when I counsel married couples that they often have different \\"love languages\\", and while reading this book won't automatically \\"fix\\" your marriages, it will serve as an excellent place to start and give  you practical ideas you can start implementing today.  In fact, I found this book so valuable that I dedicated some pages to it in my recent book: Adam Meets Eve: Foundations for Love to Last a Lifetime (also sold on amazon.com, but different than Chapman's book as it focuses on all aspects of the science and theology of budding love relationships). Buy Chapman's book,  read the book, and put its principles into practice--you'll be glad you did!  [[ASIN:0989969800 Adam Meets Eve: Foundations for Love to Last a Lifetime]]
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|It was a gift for a friend, and they love it.  Her husband is also watching it!  I thank you.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Honestly? I had heard good things about this book, and I went into it with thoughts that I really wanted something to help kickstart my blogging that had kind of veered off this summer.  I must say, I really think I hit a winner with this book.<br /><br />We start off meeting Cather, or Cath as she likes to be known as moving into her dorm room at the beginning of the year.  She is really sad because this is the first time that she is going to live away from her sister, Wren.  (We later find out that her mom didn't know she was going to have twins and only had one name picked out, get it Cather-Wren?) Anyway, Cath is learning to live with out her other self and adjust.<br /><br />But the real challenge is that Cath has quite a following on the fan boards, as a fan fiction writer for Simon Snow fan fiction writing.  So it becomes quite a challenge learning to balance everything.<br /><br />I loved this story.  I actually haven't read Eleanor and Park before I read this (I'm reading it now and LOVING it as well!) so this was my intro to Rainbow Rowell.  I adored her characters.  They were so multidimensional and so fun.  Cath was great.  She was happy to sit in her dorm room on a Saturday night and write rather than go out and party, and her roommate was constantly snarking at her , but was so much fun.  Then you had the guy that was always in their room... but anyway...<br /><br />I also loved the story itself.  Rainbow Rowell took on some tough issues kind of from the side including excessive drinking and parent abandonment.  But she handled them in a tactful and thoughtful way.  This book was spot on and just so well written. So great in fact that at the first opportunity I went in and picked up my copy of Eleanor and Park and started reading. I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss about that book is about that I have missed!<br /><br />A great story and just amazing characters.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Great story and good acting. Damon and DaVito made a good pair to depict their parts. Never saw the movie when it originally came out.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This part of the overall Spartacus series was my least favorite and I actually didn't watch it until after Blood & Sand and Vengence, I watched it while I was jonesing for War of the Damned to start.  Because it was made while they were waiting for Andy Whitfield (Spartacus) to go through his treatment for cancer, there were no scenes with Spartacus (except for flashbacks).  It was interesting in its own right and it certainly did provide a lot of answers for questions I had regarding Oenomaus & Gannicus friendship.  Just with the other installment of the series, I HIGHLY recommend.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I've seen the play numerous times, I have the soundtrack and I've read the book.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I've updated my review today, July 3, 2015, which is about 1 year and 9 months later.  ________________________________________________________________________________ Pros -Wireless is freedom -Comfy -Audio is comparable to $200 and even $300 headphones -Built in Sidetone -Mic is clear and crisp  Cons -Plastic body is not sturdy enough -Sidetone will reset to 0 upon wireless signal loss -I've gotten a couple of lemons that I will talk about more specifically -Logitech support takes a while to get back to you  So I have a lot of feelings about this headset.  Let's start with the audio quality (that you will hear).  I personally can't say that I am an audiophile, but I have tried to delve into the world of audiophiles.  I bought an AKG K7xx which is a $200 set of headphones.  Linus from LinusTechTips claimed that the AKG K7xx sounds very, VERY similar to the Sennheiser HD600 (which costs $320 today, July 3, 2015 on Amazon).  The reason I am mentioning this is because I can't really tell the difference between the AKG K7xx and the Logitech G930.  Let me also add that I really dislike the surround sound and NEVER use it.  Next let's move on to the mic quality.  I really like it.  I talk with a number of different people online and they all use various different microphones.  Some of them use cheap desktop mics, some use Kingston HyperX Clouds, some use modmics, some use xbox 360 mics connected to xbox 360 controllers, and one other person uses the Logitech G930.  I have to say, the friend with the Logitech G930 is my favorite listen to.  There's no annoying static in the background, it sounds crisp and perfect for chatting.  I wouldn't say its great for Youtube videos or Podcasting, but it would be satisfactory.  If you already own a high quality microphone, the G930 make a good pair of wireless headphones.  If you're a person who *needs* sidetone, you can even use the G930 mic for just the sidetone while you use a different mic for recording.  Now it's time to talk about wireless.  There are reviews on this item that complain about the wireless being bad and it disconnecting often.  I feel like those people got the defective units.  The reason I say that is because when I first bought the headset it worked fine, hardly any loss of signal.  Then at one point it physically broke and I had to warranty it.  When I got a replacement unit, I was getting SO MANY wireless disconnects.  It was unreal.  I would get like one every ten minutes.  Again, through the warranty, I got another replacement and that unit worked perfectly fine.  There is a wireless router in my home and it doesn't affect my headset's signal.  I can even leave my room and walk around my home and still use this headset.  I can go to almost every room in my house and maintain the signal.  The exceptions are the basement (two floors down) and a few corner rooms.  I can even keep the signal on my porch steps.  Build quality is, in my opinion, the most disappointing part about this product.  It's pretty flimsy plastic.  It flexes as you put it on your head and you can hear it creak as you move it around.  I've had *three separate G930's* where the plastic broke in such a way that rendered the headset unwearable.  Once on the upside down &#34;Y&#34; that holds the earpiece and twice on the hinge that connects that upside &#34;Y&#34; to the top headband.  I almost want to mod it myself and fortify it with metal because I love this headset but it's not sturdy enough.  Let me also add some context: I am a heavy user of this headset.  I wear it anywhere from 2-6 hours a day (very rough estimate) so maybe a light user won't have it break as easily.  You may have noticed that I've had multiple headsets of this model.  I have only bought one.  That is because this unit comes with a 3 year manufacturer's warranty (or 2 if I read it wrong).  I've RMA'd it four times in the past and I am currently waiting on Logitech support to get back to me so I can RMA it again.  They've coveredit when the plastic breaks and they've covered it when I got a lemon (defective unit).  They even pay the shipping fee to send the item from you to them and then back.  Those things alone are great in terms of customer support.  However they do sometimes really confuse me.  I say this because sometimes it takes forever for them to get back to you.  Sometimes they respond to warrantly claims on their site within 2 business days.  Sometimes they respond to you in a week.  I've even had them respond to me in as much as 3 weeks.  That does sound kind of inconvenient but that's not even the worst of it.  On one of my RMA's they wouldn't even respond to my online account and I had to call them a few times.  So with all that being said, it's good and bad, but they definitely have pulled through for me.  Let me tell you, this headset is comfy!  I can happily wear it for extended periods of time.  Not having to deal with wires is a *Godsend.*  Whenever I am forced to use a different headset there will be times when the headset wire get's caught under my chair wheel or on the armrest and it's really annoying.  With wireless, I even walk around my house while chatting!  If I wanted to go grab a drink, I could.  If I wanted to watch a movie in bed at night without bothering others, I could!  If I wanted to play a console in the living room, I could!  With the appropriate setup I even feed console audio into the headset, which is amazing I might add.  Battery life is good enough.  Just plug it in when you aren't using it.  If you forget to, just plug it in while you use it.  The software is meh.  I have a big gripe about it specifically.  The gripe is that in the event the headset loses signal, the sidetone resets to 0.  I absolutely HATE that.  I hate the feeling when I sound muffled and sidetone makes it so I don't sound muffled.  There isn't anything that can be done about this aside from opening the software and resetting the sidetone slider.  There have been other users whoalso posted numerous times on the Logitech forums and in emails, but unfortunately it seems that Logitech just doesn't care about this problem.  My preferred setup nowadays is to use the Logitech G930 as wireless headphones.  I use a Blue Yeti mic for pretty much everything but I still have the G930 mic in place so I can have sidetone.  I have a $200 AKG set of headphones as backup (which I plan to use when the G930 breaks).  It's gonna suck when the warranty runs out.  I will then have to make a decision.  Try to find a better wireless headset, or just buy another G930 and deal with RMA's.

0920236820|5.0|One of Robert Munsch's most popular titles in my opinion. The theme of the book should delight both girls and boys. The read length is ideal at about 5 min.  I highly recommend the book and author, especially to Americans that might not know Robert Munsch's works.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Overall a very good book although a bit overly romantic (especially towards the latter chapters) for me at times. Adichie writes beautifully though and makes up for the sometimes conventional pace of the plot narrative. I'm amazed at how much I identified with it and the lead character despite my self perception as not Naija enough. As they say you can take the girl out of Lagos...

B001DUDKEY|5.0|First time i saw this, I thought it was too sedate. But over the many, many times I've seen it, I believe it might be one of the best Austen adaptations. The book is full of subtlety and maturity and the movie follows suit. The book is by an older Austen who has had experiences that have helped/ forced her to understand the long-term pain of love chances and the strictures of society and family. This movie captures that beautifully. The transformation of Ann physically throughout the movie is a great example. Early one she is pale and looks 'past her bloom' as they say. By the end, she's glowing. It's a beautiful & subtle movie, and I'm so happy it's on free streaming for prime members (right now).

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The game has random lagspikes throughout campaign and multiplayer but you would expect a few texture errors and bugs in a game like this on a mobile device. I found the shooting aspect very realistic as the reload animations looked amazing and the levels of the story felt easy to understand the only problem is assist it  was more like a defective magnet it locked on but you couldn't really move to another bad guy or player it just moved your retical away or dissent lock or just pointed you in a completely different direction but all in all it was a good fps and had good quality so I give it 5 of 5 stars

The changes that he made in his diet to take him to the top of tennis are very well described in the book.  I believe that he has received excellent advice from some experts in nutrition.  The changes to his health from eliminating gluten from his diet, and eating real food-- fresh veggies, fruits, seafood & meats made a huge difference in his career.<br />The book is well written with some of Novak's childhood stories woven into the narrative.<br />I highly recommend it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is great!<br />I really enjoyed, Cassandra is very talented. She will be one of the best authors of this century. Good dialogue, great characters and Good story line.<br />Great book for tweens and teens. A real pleasure!
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|My mom loves it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting.  It's a quick, easy read so I suggest that everyone read it!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I am very excited that with this purchase. This is when MTV had great shows on. Daria the complete series was the best purchase I have made in a long time.
B008Y212PI|3.0|As a free app of the day, it is OK, but for 1.99 I would  expect more puzzles. The early puzzles are a bit simple, but some of the later ones do not seem solvable by pure logic.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|Visually stimulating but zero story. The story they attempted seemed scattered. The why he was doing what he was doing wasn't clear.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Rowling did a very good job in developing her characters and the story line in this book.  The ending was a bit too neat but I didn't fault her for this. I enjoyed the book very much. I hope she keeps writing for adults.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|Good verses evil:  The good side tries to play by the rules and the evil side cheats and lies and, of course, sill get beaten down again.
B00B00RJFS|5.0|Time to fall in love with good music and records again....  I know this album won't sell millions... but it absolutely full of emotion and &#34;levels&#34;
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Johnny Dep does it again.  I don't like this remake of the classic, but Johnny Dep makes it entertaining anyway.  My daughter loves it.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|I saw it playing on tv and decided to order it immediately.  Two days later, it was at my door!
B00845PV16|5.0|And again, Nicholas Cage pulls off an amazing performance.  Not surprisingly, the hero, Johnny Blaze, wins the contest with the devil.
B003E88TKS|4.0|Dont expect a happy ending but the movie was well acted, well written, and had its funny parts. After watching it I came to realize why it got nominated for 6 Oscars. Definitely a must -see.
B0090EHVMC|2.0|Promotes erroneous themes.  Attacks big business and the free market on an emotional level because the tree huggers don't have a shred of information about economics .  This movie also promotes the fear of global warming and wilderness conservation, implying that anyone who doesn't go with the crowd doesn't care about the planet or the people on it.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I read this book very quickly, but I wasn't a huge fan. It's a cute romance story but mostly really depressing.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|Coraline makes up for his other movies. I didn't expect to like it because I absolutely didn't like Nightmare Before Christmas, but I do like Coraline.
1567184855|5.0|Read this! If for no other reason than to dispel a fear of death. If you are already relying on your intuition to guide you then this will reaffirm so much. I have had so many questions answered.
B000I9YX06|5.0|You will be assimilated: Resistance is Futile!  You cannot escape the robots, unless you are Will Smith or Seven of Nine.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy the Mahjong game.  It has many different levels to play and I like trying to beat my score.  The only problem is it can be difficult to see some of the tiles on the left due to the angle of the graphics.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Don't really know what to say about this movie other than it isn't really entertaining.  Even though it's pure fantasy I think it should have remained a comic book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Yay-uh, a good read that kept me turning pages<br />Way to go, Stevie by!<br />D S West, author of &#34;Special Reserve and Other Goths&#34; on Kindle.
B008133MDK|3.0|I can't sit through a whole episode, but my daughter loves Sherlock.  You do have to pay attention or you loose the story line completely.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading these books with the impression that it was an awesome series but I just got annoyed with all the sex in it.  It came to a point that when I would come up on the sex parts that I would skim over it until It was over.  I do like the story line and such but the sex was way overboard.  Maybe the movie will be better since Im sure they will cut a lot of that out unless they are making a porn.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Even though it deviates from the book on some major points, it is surprisingly close to how I imagine things in this country going as the people finally get their fill of the pompous, self-righteous group of men and women in DC's efforts to strip us of our personal liberty and human rights.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|The Lincoln Lawyer, 2011 film<br /><br />A man gets out of a car and enters a secured place. Another man talks to him about a criminal case. He talks to a bailiff about a defendant; the trial is held over. Lawyer Michael Haller stops his car to talk about that case. Haller visits his next client; \\"it was a set-up\\". The man is accused of beating a woman, but gets out on bail. Haller knows how to handle the press! He names his price to the family lawyer. A young woman is fingerprinted and processed. Haller arrives to advise her and learns what happened. Her customer paid in drugs not money, then she was caught. Haller talks to the prosecutor and makes a deal: his client will walk if she gives up this wanted man. Louis Roul&eacute; is out, Haller meets his mother. Roul&eacute; insists he is innocent, and tells his story. Note the differences in the point of view! Investigator Frank will check out the client's story. \<br /><br />Haller gets a ride home. Next morning Frank brings in a DVD about the event. Haller shows the DVD to the prosecutor. There is a discrepancy in the discovery file. [Prosecutors have to turn over their known facts to the defense counsel.] Haller tells his client to follow orders. A detective talks to Haller about the justice system. Later Haller meets a woman and they become very friendly. Haller studies the pictures of that woman. [Note the lack of bruises on her left side.] A prisoner insists he is innocent and won't take a deal. Haller visits a prisoner and hears his story. He reconsiders this case. Was a client really innocent? Haller has a dilemma. Can Frank find other cases like this one? Roul&eacute; makes a surprise visit to tell Mich something. The next day Haller learns his investigator was shot and killed at home! [Note the black blood from a body over an hour old.] Mick is upset and sees a man who could be involved.<br /><br />Later Mick talks to Maggie about \\"pure evil\\". Mick listens to his answering machine. Frank was killed by a Colt Woodsman (a .22 automatic). Did Mick have an unsecured pistol at home? The trial of Louis Roul&eacute; goes on. The police search Mick's home. They have old evidence on that Woodsman, it was a gift from Mickey Cohen. Regina Campo testifies and is cross-examined. The next day Louis Roul&eacute; testifies. \\"I am innocent!\\" There is a rebuttal witness, a man held in jail (a \\"snitch\\"). Why do people talk to him in jail? Can an old newspaper report affect the trial? There is a surprise ending! \\"Whose side are you on?\\" But there's more to come. Where is he going? There is a final confrontation. Mick knows people who can help him. There is another surprise at the end! Call 911. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.] \\"Martinez is free.\\" There is a repeat customer.<br /><br />This story starts out as an example of the practice of criminal law, then develops into a very interesting story about a murder. There was a novel in the 1960s \\"The Seventh Juror\\" about a murder trial where the real murderer was an observer in the courtroom. Would he be found out in the end?
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My daughter bought this movie after seeing it in theaters.  Everyone in the family enjoyed watching it with her, too.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I was not sure if I would like the twist on the  Sherlock Holmes story. I was pleasantly surprised,and found it very entertaining. The chemistry between stars Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu is great as well as the writing. I wished I had watched the orginal airing on CBS, but was able view the whole season on CBS .com before season 2 began .Looking forward to new season
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Decent show, but definitely fiction.  There are good story lines and character development, too. I will probably watch it over and over because it is delivered with no commercials.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved everything about this book. There are suspenses within suspenses. The plot, the style, etc are put together nicely. I cannot wait to read book two.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|You really had to follow along with this movie.  I had to watch it twice to figure out what happened.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|This movie started out a little slow, but once the fighting and action started this movie was great! I would have loved to seen more about Master chief's story
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|If you are a Star Trek fan, you already know what happens, but it does fill in some of the details left out of other movies.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie was very action-packed and exciting the entire time. I love the remake better than the original! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good action movie.
B009CPE424|5.0|We loved all three of these movies so much that we named our male chihuahua Papi, and through sheer chance, my first granddaughter is named Chloe!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it. Can't wait for season 4. I enjoy watching the quality of the actors/actresses.  That has been lacking in American television.
B003EY62II|2.0|This isn't near as good as the Saturday morning cartoon. Too bad, too, because Scooby-Doo is a classic and one of my favorite cartoons.
006190385X|3.0|It wasn't the book I expecteded. I thouht it was the one with the hard cover.  I' m disapointed. First time it happens.There are only a few phtos . I'm very dissapointed.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|It's hard to say which MIB is the best.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones never fail to meet expectations.
B000XTLUW0|2.0|When I purchased this cd/dvd it was written that the dvd was zone 2. ( for europeans dvd readers like mine)  and when it arrived the dvd is only zone 1 so I cannot see it. I expect amazon to do something about this.
B001XUYA0W|4.0|Suspenseful movie!  Wasnt happy with the way it all ended but it truly portrays that in real life there isnt always a happy ending
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is wonderful. It rings loud easy to navigate and easy to use. I am so happy I bought this app.
0060874775|5.0|I was disappointed that it was an abridged edition.<br />I am not sure how I can tell the difference on line purchases
0553541633|5.0|I chose the rating because the book was a great true story of a very brave girl that kept a diary almost daily of her life and family in how they had to cope with the Germans, while hundreds on hundreds of Jews were being murdered in the streets and out in the openings in the woods and they were buried in mass graves. One day there would be a getto and maybe the next day there would be a lot of shooting and then the next day the getto would be demolished leaving no sign of where it was in the begining. Not knowing who to trust and when they were going to get there next meal if they got any at all, then some one tured them in for a few cents and she and whe family were not seen again , her father was the only one to survive and he was given the papers that Anne Frank had done her diary on and he had the diary put in book form so that the world could see through her eyes what it was really like in WW11
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|I have had about three cases for this phone.  This case is by far the best.  It is very thin, durable and attractive.  I love it!
B000M0QMM8|5.0|kids and I watched it over and over , very funny, a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Great album, Susan at the forefront.  Contains several songs with different beats, from funky to soul searching.  Songs seem more personal.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Does the job. Seems to be pretty accurate. No problems here. Would recommend it for those who like no frills but functional app.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Once you start, you can't stop. Ive always enjoyed mahjong now more then ever.You will too. Try it today don't wait.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|I have used Bitdefender for PC for a very long time. Most desirable feature is despite its lean size it still offers uncompromised performance. Pretty much the same deal for its android version.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Had some good points and slow points but all in all not bad. I would recommend to someone who had a slow weekend.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Still playing around with my Kindle HD, so I can't give a definative answer to this rating. I'm sure Amazon doesn't stray to far from offering a great product at a very reasonable price.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I liked the characters and storyline very much. It was such an easy and fast read that I wasn't ready for the series to end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The True Knot is led by Rose the Hat.  The majority of the True Knot appear to be senior citizens in RVs.  Many members of the True Knot have been alive for centuries.  They are immortals who live on the steam from horrific disasters.  The steam makes them young and strong, but the best steam comes from children who shine.  These children are tortured and killed to harvest the steam.<br /><br />Dan Torrance has settled into the town of Frazier.  He has met a man that helped him get his alcoholism under control, and he is making amends by helping the residents of Rivington House, a hospice.  He helps the residents when it is their time to die.<br /><br />Dan is contacted by a baby, Abbra.  She also has the shining, and Tony has befriended her.  (Tony is the little boy, who lived in young Danny's mouth.)<br /><br />While killing a young boy in Iowa, Rose became aware of Abbra's existence, and now she wants Abbra because she is a powerful source of steam.  Abbra knows that only with Dan's help can she be saved.<br /><br />In true Stephen King form, he transports us into the world of Dan and Abbra.  The writing is strong and vivid.  Dan is a recovering alcoholic, who is also in the process of recovering his soul and dignity.  He has a strong sense of right and wrong.  Dan is driven by the wrongs he did in the past, and he appears to be unable to forgive himself.  He is protective of Abbra.<br /><br />Abbra is very much a young girl.  She knows her parents' are frightened of what she is, so she tries to hide that side from them.  She is actually overly protective of her parents, which makes her even more reliant on Dan and Tony.<br /><br />When Abbra's parents are finally told what is going on, they want to go to the authorities.  They find it difficult to understand that the policeman cannot help them, and they are unlikely to believe them.  The police will only see a group of nice elderly people.  They won't see the evil of the True Knot.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable \\"old style\\" Stephen King story.  I highly recommend it for Stephen King fans.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is app is awesome! You have a choice of clock faces and can even add your own music to go to sleep or wake up to. The face even dims so you don't have a bright light in your face.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|I LOVE HIMYM!!!!! IT IS THE GREATEST SHOW EVER! AND TO EVERYONE THAT SAYS ITS NOT AS GOOD ANYMORE.....YOUR CRAZY!! ;D
B007AL48UK|5.0|Love marjong games and this is one of the best there is.  Colors are brilliant and easy to see .  Good for any age
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen the play and was very glad they adapted it to a movie format. Now I can watch it anytime I want!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars on Blue Ray is an awesome format. Lots and lots of bonus content and never before seen deleted scenes.
B0013LKFVO|3.0|Bought this one and a competing product at double the price.  Both work well and install easy but i noticed that this one did not list a lumen rating while the competitor listed 140 lumens.  This one is much dimmer than that model and while this works, i recommend spending the extra money and getting the brighter bulb.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|The plantronics Voyager is a great bluetooth but the charger is so annoying. This little cable charger works great and made for a great spare :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall Chromecast works pretty well but there is plenty of room for improvement.  Only works with a few apps on an android device but works with most web sites via the chrome add-in. We have a very strong and dependable wifi network but connection drops periodically for no apparent reason.
B0081336FO|5.0|I can't say enough about how great this program is. I'm a die-hard Jeremy Brett &#34;authentic&#34; Sherlock fan, so I really didn't expect much of this version. But I am blown away by how well it's done. The two main actors are PERFECT in their roles (like Brett--Cumberbatch was BORN to play Sherlock). They have such great chemistry --their banter is completely natural. I love how close the stories stay to Doyle's original stories, but placed in modern day--that's not an easy task. And they do it brilliantly--nothing cheesy here.<br /><br />If you're in any way a Sherlock Holmes fan--try this out. Of course, I'd suggest starting with the first season and at least watch the pilot episode. It's fab-U-lous--you'll get enough backstory there you'll better appreciate the rest of the episodes.<br /><br />Watch it, buy it, rent it--any way you can--this is a MUST SEE.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am totally hooked!  I can't wait for season 4 to begin! I have been a fan since the very beginning.  Really excited!
B004PHE9F6|5.0|My husband bought this because he loves all things racing. He really enjoyed this movie and you will too. James Garner was great!
B007LGPMX6|5.0|Classic show! Wish they had all the seasons on Prime instead of just the first one! Was one of my faves to watch going through school.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Steve McQueen is awesome in this movie. My husband loves F1 and all things racing, so this movie made him happy. :-)
0345803485|1.0|I was told by a few friends, \\"you have GOT to read this trilogy!\\"  Ok. I gave in. Wow, I should have not listened to them & should've skipped this novel. I wasted my time on an entirely unrealistic book. A self-conscious, self-proclaimed virgin falls madly in love with an incredibly rich, extremely handsome, emotionally damaged sexual sado-masochist, lost puppy of a man. In approximately one week, our pure-as-the-driven-snow heroine decides to sleep with the masochistic. Not only do they have earth-shaking sex once a day.... they have it 2, 3, 4 times a day. Every time it is fireworks, crash, boom bang, over the top orgasmic. Every time. Yeah, that's realistic. Story plausibility is about a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10. The dialogue is juvenile. There is no true rhythm, nothing to capture the reader in their dialogue. It reads like a teenage novel about over-sexed adolescents. If I read \\"medullah oblongata\\" once, I read it 5, 6, 7, 8 times. Over-stretching it a bit, aren't we? I got sick of the author's I'm-going-to-impress-you-with-big-words attempts. It got old really fast. I could not connect with these characters who really were not as well-developed as my friends seemed to think. The plot & the writing flow were implausible & mediocre. All I can say if you're thinking of reading this 'new sensation' novel, it really isn't worth the time. To the book I say - 'laters baby.' (Oh, how I HATE that constantly repeated phrase. So dumb.)
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Back pack has a lot of room for my Nikon and extra lens, but sadly enough just like so many others the handle of the back pack tore off now I am wondering to get a replacment or go with a different brand ?
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have bought three of these as they are the perfect cover. Tried a different one first and it blocked the bottom of the kindle.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The best show on television , nothing else comes close<br />Cast is perfect in their given roles, FX & Sutter need to keep the show on as long as possible
1609611543|5.0|We have been interested in use of wheat and what the industry has done to process wheat. We have considered grinding our own wheat but since I can't eat wheat in any form, we don't know if its worth going to the expense of getting the equipment and so forth. So this book gave us a different prospective on a professional's viewpoint. We got a lot of good info.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this app. It's so addicting.the only problem is, I don't get as much done around the house.it's a lot of fun.
1401938906|5.0|I love this book! The experiments really work! It's is one to keep. When I forget where I'm going, I can go back to it and refresh.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really a great game. I love that it is split in sections so you don't have to spend more time on it then you would like
B005MVLI8A|4.0|OK, so it didn't actually start the Grunge movement, but &#34;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#34; is the poster song.  &#34;Breed&#34; and &#34;Territorial Pissings&#34; are two lesser known songs that also make you want to break stuff.  I think this album is a classic and a must-have if you like 90s Grunge music.
034580404X|3.0|I found that this trilogy had a lot of similarities to the Twilight series...only with graphic sex.  I did enjoy the storyline, although I thought the ending was pretty weak.
B004TLM284|4.0|I guess Britney's comeback is working.  This album was better than I expected.  Some songs are Pop and some are Dance.  It was definitely worth the 3 bucks I paid for it.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|I like the show as much as my 3-year old daughter. Shaun and his buddies get into so much mischief, and the whole dynamic between Bitzer, the sheep and the neighbor piggies is so comical. Great series for the whole family!
1451697686|5.0|I am slowly transitioning into my NYE goal of 2014 to become Zero Waste and this book has a lot of great ways to start and become Zero Waste.  It's already made a difference with the small changes I have already made.
B00B7VZN76|4.0|This is the season where the show really found its footing.  After an OK first season, the second season really didn't get any better.  The third season writing improved dramatically.  The redesign of the uniforms, some of the sets, and the return of Dr. Crusher greatly improved the show.
B000002PCS|5.0|This is one of the greatest love stories. You have to watch this movie with your special someone. It arrived fast. Thanks, Bert
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My son will be so excited to see this under the Christmas tree.  Its the same size as the original which is perfect.
B008U3NU38|5.0|After reading some of the reviews i was scared the CDs wouldn't play on my systems or that the box itself was just going to be crappy, but it all works great. This is a great thing to buy if you love the clash and happen to have a spare $180 just laying around
B005PK56TA|5.0|This series is great. It's very dark and takes unexpected twists and turns. It doesn't end the way you'd think, either.
B008Y212PI|3.0|the game could have been more interesting and interactive. if you are looking for a time pass to play in office the app is good .... :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I wondered what happened to Danny Torrance from the shining. It's amazing to read a book in which he still shone and still had the ability to make it work a very good read<br />Thanks As usual Stevwn
B005K0HDGE|2.0|When I was browsing for a new book to download for my Kindle, I made the mistake of just reading some of the best reviews for this book.  Another fatal mistake that I made, which I never would if buying a physical book, was not noticing how LONG this book is.  866 pages!  I noticed when I was on about the 15th kindle page and still at 1%, and I thought \\"how long is this book?\\"  Then I checked and thought \\"You've got to be kidding me!\\"<br /><br />This book was soooo dang LONG!  And it didn't need to be.  Mr. King may have gotten a kick out of putting a dozen unimportant sub-stories in here, but I certainly didn't get a kick out of reading all of them.  Often times I completely forgot that this book is a supposed to be about stopping the Kennedy assassination because it took off on such long, often boring, tangents.<br /><br />I kept enduring the long, boring story of his new life in small town Texas and his new love, thinking, \\"hang in there, it'll get much better when the Kennedy/Oswald confrontation draws near.\\"  But it really didn't.  I was very unimpressed with how that went down and also with how the book continued on beyond that.<br /><br />I like King, in general, but this was a bad novel.  I'm never going to buy a book anywhere near that long again without vetting it better first.  Live and learn.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|lol its so fun. it tests reflexes but plane part sucks lolipops cause u cant blow into the kindle but it has a good overall its so addicting and fun u. should get it
B003EXY1WS|5.0|A few must have songs on the album, especially the song Tension, and a must watch for any A7X fan.
1451626096|5.0|This author's books are always a hit. I loved this book as I have loved every other book in the cousin's war (and her other many novels). It is refreshing to see Richard III depicted as a human being that was actually loved-rather than the monster depicted in movies and Shakespeare. Reading the book from Elizabeth of York's point of view was also a nice change. Usually she gets forgotten in the Tudor lore. I couldn't put this book down. Well worth reading!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent Product. Now Google got Hulu Plus. I hope they can enroll other services to enjoy TV on demand anytime anywhere.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I had to watch this movie for a communications class I took, and I fell in love with it. T
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I had this game for a month or two then it needs more memory and I don't get it please fix
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was absolutely adorable. The acting was great, and the character development was spot on. I recommend this to everyone.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is an amazing game! I enjoy playing it. Wish it would update to the new update that IOS has.
038572179X|1.0|I could not stand this book. I had to read it for a class I was in and I resented every second of it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its kind of hard. I started writing the codes down as I found them so I would have them there when I needed them.
140120841X|5.0|I thought this book was reasonably priced and it arrived well within the stated time. I would recommend this seller.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I LOVE My microphone. A very simple plug and play. Price was good, shipment excellent. (just don't forget to turn it on before you start recording..LOL)
B0090X4GLW|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me and after watching it I found the songs sticking to me.  Yes, earwigs right?<br /><br />This is like Glee, but it should be noted there is NO musical accompaniment.  Everything is done by voice.  These kids are extremely talented.<br /><br />After watching this movie I realized just what short shift Anna got in the Twilight movies.  She is just awesome.<br /><br />This album is perfect for revving your joy motor!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I depend on trip advisor for 50% of my vacation planning. Thanks to the site I have saved myself from trying to book into some pretty icky hotels, and I'd like to think that I have also helped to keep others from icky sticky situations as well.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Smooth funk is how I describe this album. Currently on repeat, for six dollars, you should not hesitate to buy it. Every song goes through a significant transition just when you think that it's about to end, and becomes a complementary part of what you had previously heard before. That Girl is easily my favorite song of the album.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Splashtop gives me the ability to work from my tablet against my multiple compters.<br />Worth every penny.  Makes everything very simple.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|The album is only four dollars, which is an absolute steal for the quality of the songs. I bought it because I heard Safe and Sound on the radio, liked it, and decided that I would risk those 4 dollars to see if the rest of the album was as good as that one song. It is. Buy this album.
030758836X|3.0|Cute, clever, compelling.  I read to the end, partly because I just had to see what all the fuss was about.  I was occasionally taken up by it, a gorgeous stunt,  but coming to the end, and closing the covers, I felt like I had lost the better part of two days, like I had consumed a somewhat tasty (at least the first few bites) but ultimately unsavory snack with absolutely no nutritional value.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|If you are looking for a true survival knife then this is one of the best. Very thick, very strong, and holds its edge well.<br />If you don't have a large hand and decent arm strength then it will feel heavy and awkward to handle.<br />It is sturdy enough to hack through limbs, pry wood or split campfire wood, or butcher a moose or a deer.<br />The sheath it comes with is excellent and the detachable pouches can be used to store a small whetstone and emergency survival kit (like: a scalpel blade, suture and thread, fishing hook and line, firestick, trap wire, alchohol swabs).<br /><br />Some may prefer to have a softer grip, others may wish it had a gut hook or serrated section for sawing through tough cartilage/bone/wood. If these are important to you then look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is an excellent sturdy survival knife at a great price.

B00DOPEGAS|2.0|Product is very cheap....not worth the price...I was expecting some really cool rubberbands but they are all faded and look used...you cant use the the pink apparatus to make bracelets unless someone holds it because it slides all over the place.

B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We have enjoyed this program for a long time now.  We discovered it through our Netflix account, and usually watch each week during family get-togethers.  Unfortunately, Netflix quit carrying it, but thankfully....we found it on Amazon!  Yea!  = }

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love the minions, and this is just an awesome game!!! It's sort of like subway surfer, but way better, because there are minions! You can visit Gru's lab, the Residential Area, El Machos Lair, and the Minion Beach!

B009RH9HDS|5.0|This is the sturdiest Kindle covered I have ever purchased! The rotating option is the best I have ever used. The rotation stays tight so that it does not occasionally shift around like so many of the others. You can tell it is quality from the moment it comes out of the box!! Will buy this brand for all the tablets in our house again and again!!

B0002KZAKS|5.0|A superb PA microphone at an unbelievable bargain price! A rival for the Shure range but at a fraction of the cost. Good value  general purpose vocal microphone with clear frequency response. Much lower handling noise than other cheap ones but noise still present, so better suited to being on a stand. Feedback can be a problem, even at the bass end if it's near a subwoofer. Good solid construction, no switch to get wrong, no battery to go flat, XLR output to match the lead of your choice (not provided), comes in a plastic foam-lined case complete with a clip to go on your stand. no problems what so ever a good little buy definately worth the money just as good as the shure sm58 but half the price
0321543726|5.0|This book is an excellent guide to programming and the C++ language, but it is not without its faults. There are a few exercises and general moments where you will become frustrated for lack of a solution, dearth of information, or both. Not that this book is lacking in information - quite the contrary - but there will be times when Stroustrup seems to withhold information that you want or need until after you need it; you might find yourself skipping ahead or googling a thing a too. Thankfully, these moments are few and far between, but frustrating none the less.<br /><br />This is a challenging book for the true beginner, although not an impossible read. It took me about six months of reading the book and doing nearly every exercise before I felt that I had a fundamental grasp on C++ programming. If this book is a companion to a class, it might take you less time, but be prepared to spend a few months with it, especially if you are a truly new to programming. Just doing the exercises will take you many weeks, but the beauty of this book is that it is extensive and covers almost everything you need to know about C++ programming. It is not a reference library, but after reading this book there won't be much about C++ you don't know (or at least won't know how to find out) and that, to me, is the hallmark of a good text. Stroustrup guides you through things like template functions and memory allocation, shows you how certain containers are created (lists and vectors), covers much of the standard template library (STL), classes, object oriented programming...really, it is a solid foundation for the C++ programmer and programming in general. There are a few caveats; I don't think operator-overloading is explained in enough depth, for one. But this is truly an extensive subject and it's incredible how much the man is able to cover. This book sits somewhere above a beginners book that doesn't go into enough detail, and somewhere below a pure reference manual that doesn't tell you how to do anything. I haven't read his other C++ book - The C++ Programming Language - but I imagine that book and this are probably about all you will ever need when it comes to C++.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, I have rated it 5 stars, as recently I have begun to see just how poorly books like this can be written - this book blows them away. It has enabled me to program a VST plugin relatively easily. There's even some subtle nerdy humor in it. It accomplishes its task beautifully.tell you how to do anything.

B00DURHYWC|4.0|Kind of \\"discovered\\" by Jimmy Buffett and XM Magaritaville, this is their best album yet.  Best: \\"Sway\\" and track 8.  Lots of virtuoso instrumentation, with a cast this big (at least 12 performers), it's obviously done for the love of the music and not big $$$.  Wow! It's so good!

B00C5R8364|5.0|After reading and being disappointed by the latest offerings of several of my favourite authors, I was wondering what Frederick Forsyth would come up with this time around. Fortunately, my fears were unfounded, \\"The Kill List\\" was a great read, and well up to the standards that we expect from this author. A plausible plot, tight dialogue and a fast paced story with a very satisfactory ending. Keep up the good work Mr Forsyth, I look forward to your next book!
B0064MGU98|4.0|The good wife is very entertaining. Can't wait to watch the other seasons. I've even got my husband watching it!

0061478784|5.0|I've watched the anime version in English and Japanese and I adored the storyline. A friend of mine recommended the book and I was so excited. The book was in great shape and I can't wait to get started with reading it. I personally recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the anime
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|If this didn't have the M.N.S brand on it then would it still get so much hate? Stop camparing this to his earlier work...move on..cuz he sure has as a direcror. Dont get me wrong, I thought the last airbender is for the kindergarden and below crowd..but After Earth is a mature science fiction effort that I for one loved. Maybe the majority of the (dull-witted) americans (I'm american too) would look at the trailer and expect will and aiden trecking through jungle together, and just because the kid does the journey alone then its now a bad movie in your mind...? Good sci fi personal journey to overcome fear and fight for family. Anybody wanting a \\"MNS\\" twist and absurdly deep storyline then either grow up or go on living in the past..whatever.
0380807343|5.0|I originally watched the movie of Coraline, but when I found out there was a book version, I HAD to get it. I'm reading it now and it's really intriguing. It came in great condition and I would recommend this to others.

184794079X|5.0|This book gives you great advice on how to advance and build your career, I would definitely recommend this book especially if you are still relatively young in your career.  The book provides good examples on how to do this and has a chapter summary at the end on how to execute what it has talked about. The book also it gives excellent advice on networking and how to sustain and grow your network, which is crucial in todays market place.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|This wasn't the most well written book but the storyline stuck with me several days after I finished it.  It deals with a quadrapalegic's right to die.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars.  It would be a good book for a book club.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played many other hidden objects games and this is definitely one of the best. Great graphics, great story, great mini games, not too easy, not too difficult, and the hint button is very helpful in moving forward with the story.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|I ordered the Prince: Rave Un2 The Year 2000 from Amazon.com for my husband's birthday.  He is a true Prince fan.  He is so very happy with this DVD.  Loves that it has so many different great entertainer's on with Prince.  Said this was his best birthday present ever.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Loved the movie. The concept was new and different.  The additional footage in the extended collector's edition adds a lot to the story that was left to your imagination before. I somehow lost my 1st copy (I think I loaned it to one of my adult children) so I bought it again. There's just a few movies I like to watch over and over again and this is one of those.
0571238343|5.0|I´t has a lot of information, great guides. Very extensive and useful information. A very good reference book, a must if yo like classical animation.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use and has high visibility of time.  Easy to set adjustments and screen settings.  Brightness adjustment is a nice function.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a dependable and flexible sharpener, it is easily portable, and even does serrated blade sharpening. This is the third one we've bought.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Okay okay, I understand your point parents, but when I played this app I saw no such ads.<br /><br />The possibilities:<br /><br />1. The people dropped those ads<br /><br />2.I just never saw them<br /><br />3. Those ads where never there in the first place<br /><br />Oh, BTW great game
B004UFEJW6|4.0|This movie is not what you think it is.  By viewing the trailer you might get the impression that this is just another ho-hum action movie set in the future.  No, it is far more than that.  This movie is more of a look at the human condition.  It takes place far in the future.  Some grim military personnel are in a nursery looking at charts and carefully selecting certain infants.  You quickly learn that these infants are selected to become soldiers.  From birth to adulthood all they are taught is how to be the perfect soldier and nothing else. They end up resembling Terminator robots, in nature, and seemingly devoid of emotions.  Todd (Kurt Russel) is the best of them.  You see that through the years he has amassed an impressive amount of victories and experience.  However, nothing lasts forever.  There's a new generation of super soldier that is coming out.  These are genetically created humans that are faster, stronger and physically superior.  The 1st generation soldiers are considered obsolete and expendable.  After an arranged confrontation between a few of the new/old soldiers, Todd is left for dead on some forgotten planet/asteroid that is used for trash.  He is rescued by a harmless/friendly group of castaways who were marooned here.  This is where the movie really starts in my mind.  Now Todd is among regular humans and families where his skills don't fit in.  All he has known is killing and death, now he is exposed to feelings and experiences he has never dealt with.  What would that be like?  Kurt Russell does a great job with this.  He doesn't have a lot of lines, but his expressions and movements have a huge impact on this character and he sells it wonderfully.  It's really interesting when a beautiful woman (Nielsen) gets near him and how he reacts to it.  Ingrained human instinct fighting against years of brainwashing and conditioning from birth.  He really struggles in this environment.  Then it really becomes interesting when the 2nd generation super soldiers show up on a training mission on this planet with orders to kill any living thing they come across.  Now Todd finds himself the only thing standing between them and this group of people who came to his aid.  It's two full squads of soldiers that are his superior....or so it seems.  I wont spoil the movie, but I will say it's an excellent showdown that pits strength against experience.<br />Overall, a terrific movie.  Great cast, fantastic story, and some impressive action scenes. The blu-ray is pretty darn good and easily worth the money.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very easy to comprehend and a great refresher for those who know some spanish but need vocabulary practice. I also like that I can slow the playback down because I have always had difficulty understanding because those who are fluent speak extremely fast.
B000VGXJ4W|5.0|I love this album! You can hear a discernible difference between the Jamaican and US versions, but both sound great.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is truly one of the funniest one person game ever. I just couldn't put it down,  when I thought I was stumped and ready to put it down I'd be drawn in again. Graphics are amazing, sound is great, technical thought is CRAZY GOOD.  I can't wait for the 2nd one. I've told my children and grandchildren about how addictive the game was for me and their going to check it out to.  My favorite game that I've downloaded yet. Thank you for a great creation.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|This movie was nothing but a lot of &#34;Zombies&#34; snarling and biting, and it was all BORING!  I guess the makers of this movie thought there was a &#34;Plot&#34; in all this, but there really wasn't!  I threw the DVD away after I saw it, because I just could not INSULT anyone of my friends by giving it to them.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik works fine on my phone. Why won't it work on my kindle? I love it on my phone but this is crap on Kindle
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I know this will pro9bably not get nominated for an Acadamy award, but it should.  Everyone I talk to who has seen it says &#34;Great Movie&#34; or words to that effect.  I paid to see it twice in the theater, and bought the DVD when it came out, and have watched that three times.  This is just one of the best movies Hollywood has made in a long long time!
B003W5C0VC|5.0|This was the third movie in which Anthony Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter, yet the first book in the sequence. The only thing that did not feel genuine was the fact that Anthony Hopkins was older trying to play a younger version of Lecter. If you don't let that bother you however then you have a movie that, while not as good as Silence of the Lambs, was still very good.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays his foil Will Graham, the man who &#34;captures&#34; Lecter. We see that sequence in the beginning of the movie, which is different than what was shown in the 1986 film Manhunter which was a different adaptation of the movie. After nearly being killed by Lecter, when he stumbles onto figuring out who he is, Graham comes out of retirement to catch the &#34;tooth fairy&#34; played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />Hopkins steps right back into the Lecter role, and plays him with the same chilling, snarky sometimes understated, sometimes over the top way he did in the other movies. Ralph Fiennes really shines in the role of the killer, both when he is interacting with people in his normal life and when he is the Red Dragon. Norton is fine, but not overwhelmingly great as Will Graham. I personally like Hugh Dancy's portrayal of the character better in the series Hannibal, but that version of the character is written much differently.<br /><br />I know some people prefer the original film Manhunter to this adaptation. I think the studio almost had to do a film with Hopkins in the role since he made Lecter his own. I definitely prefer this movie, but then I saw both Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon before I saw that one, so my opinion may be skewed. Overall I think if you like the other films in which Hopkins plays Lecter, you will like this too.<br /><br />As far as extras go, there are a lot of them. Many deleted and alternate scenes, several behind the scenes and making of features and audio commentary. Definitely worth it for those who get the physical discs. Given that the movie is a little older now and was not special effects laden the blu ray is not spectacular like some of the newer movies are, but it still looks and sounds very good.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|To be able to &#34;cast&#34; things right to my TV from my phone or tablet for a mere $35 is amazing.  The picture quality in Netflix is fantastic.  I seriously expected &#34;something&#34; to be wrong, grainy, etc.  So far, no issues or problems other than it took 3 weeks to get my Chromecast since of the high demand.<br /><br />Easy to use and just have to wait for more apps to take advantage.  I've used it with Google Play, Netflix, and YouTube from my phone and tablet with no issues.<br /><br />For $35, its a bargain.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|a game worth more than 99 cents for sure! I love this game and love to keep my disease a secret from humanity for a long time. secretly spreading it and sometimes causing mass paranoia because of it. choosing the way humanity must die is sometimes causes me guilt but it also satisfies the dark parts of me that enjoy the power. totally for the secretly dark and twisted individuals and for the people who just want a challenging strategy game.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app has too many adds and takes too long to load.  A more basic weather app is better.  I will delete mine.

B007VDN1PA|4.0|I bought another brand of slide scanner, first, and returned it when virtually all of the slides I scanned were washed out.  I've had much better success with the DBTech scanner.  While the quality of the digital image is largely dependent on the quality of the slide, this scanner has allowed me to quickly scan literally hundreds of my father's slides that had been missing for more than 30 years.  I haven't tried to scan film, but for my purposes, it's been a wonderful little device and a product I'd recommend!
B00821OX98|4.0|Entertaining and easy to watch, a few cheesy dialogues but still a fun show to watch especially if you like Sci-fi.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|First time I've seen the show.  The cast was fabulous, but I'm a Rogers and Hammerstein kind of girl.  Not my cup of tea.
B000FBJG04|5.0|This is a fantastic book. You feel like you are in the middle of the action. It gives you a whole new perspective on World War Two!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved it.  Though there was some added plot line and characters that were not in the book, I still loved it.  Can't wait for the next.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|This is one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It is funny and interesting. Keeping up with Emma's antics will charm you and you won't be able to put it down.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I understand that some violence was necessary to establish the plot, i.e., mimicking the Zodiac or the Texas Tower incident, but after that the movie went overboard with the graphics. I think that this was mainly to show that Tom Cruise is macho. Also, there were several places in the film that I had to reverse the DVD and play again some dialogue that I didn't understand due to soft speaking or mumbling by both Cruise and Rosamund Pike.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I love this book. It reminds me of black beauty which is one of my all time favorite books.  Buy it for your kids and yourself!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought the ATR-3350 to do interviews in outdoor settings, including the rainforest. I was worried that any type of boom mic would not pick up in the field discussions and would pick up to much other sound like wind and noisy cicadas.<br /><br />I don't use fancy equipment, just a Kodak Zi8 mounted on an old school tripod. The 20 foot length of wire was essential for getting the subject in the right scenery setup without having to be too close. Rolling and bunching up the wire is a pain, but I can live with that annoyance. The lav mic itself is very light and unobtrusive. The interviewees had no complaints and had plenty of slack to move.<br /><br />For my purposes, the audio quality is superb. Shooting videos in the field can be an aural nightmare. This lav mic blew away any concerns with crisp and clear dialogue captured and no ambient sounds disturbing the moment. I'm putting up a series of videos on the web and am ecstatic that the audio makes it shine.<br /><br />Sure there are a few minor issues like remembering to turn off the mic (no light signal) and the little foam rubber cover got lost the first day in the jungle. But batteries are much cheaper than messing up a great video interview due to poor sound quality.<br /><br />If you're not a hi-tech type, than this little mic will function fine and make your videos worth watching.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case is working fantastically. It definitely pays off to buy the LIfeproof version of this case rather than the off brand!

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is a classic story that every American should read. Mark Twain is a fantastic writer. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a book that is inherently &#34;American.&#34;
0805047905|5.0|Great choice for kids.  Love the board books! Font size is easy to read and the graphics are large for a little one
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great series. It is targeted mostly at children but I think they are books that can be easily enjoyed by all ages.
0399213015|1.0|I was bummed.  I thought it was like the other board books (the real book but in smaller form)<br />You can't even read the writing in this when you are playing with the little one
B002RKSZWG|4.0|Jane Austen is a great writer and well earns the title of being considered a writer of classical literature. This is another great book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is really two books in one - psychology and self-improvement on the one hand, Sociology and Organizational Behavior on the other.  It is engaging and easy to read and will help you to understand some of the basic issues of how we can modify habits to our benefit. It can help you stay on a diet, or make your organization more willing to implement change.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a good book that is easy to read. It is targeted more to younger readers but adults can enjoy it as well.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the Hunger Games and you should too! They are targeted at children but readers of all ages would enjoy them. Also don't be lame and watch the movie first.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|Unlike the S.H. Figuarts Sailor Moon figure, the Figuarts Zero Super Saiyan Goku figure lived up to all my expectations and lived up to all the hype too. Figuarts Zero has finally released their first line of DBZ figures and they didn't disappoint. This figure is truly a badass masterpiece with really high quality and an awesome paint job to it. Figuarts Zero got everything right with this figure, everything from Goku's hair to the energy auras surrounding him. He looks exactly how he looked in the Frieza Saga. Would've been cooler if this figure glowed in the dark, but oh well. Overall the new Figuarts Zero Goku figure is a badass, edgy figure that was definitely worth the money. So if any DBZ fan out wants an awesome figure with high quality and for a good price, then what are you waiting for? Buy this figure, you won't regret it! Can't wait for Trunks to come out and hopefully Vegeta and Gohan.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Fun for everyone!  Plastic &#34;chips&#34; tactile-ly fun and they contribute to increased dexterity and could be help younger people with counting. I am a senior citizen and find this visually and tactilely pleasing . . . I really like the vibrancy of all four colors individually AND how they look when mixed on the board.
B00CM4VC7M|4.0|The Sailor Moon series finally gets it's first line of figures in years as S.H. Figuarts and Bandai Tamashii Nations finally produces the first ever really high quality line of figures beginning with Sailor Moon herself. Now when I pre-ordered and finally got this figure, I expected it to be perfect, but this figure is far from perfect. Don't get me wrong, I love Sailor Moon and this figure is a really quality figure (the first of its kind), however the figure itself looks really fragile and looks like it will break easily, but it's for display only obviously. Still, you have to handle this figure with care of course. Another thing I have a problem with is the interchangeable faces, getting them off is a major pain in the ass and it feels like the figure's head might come off cause you just can't seem to get the faces off and exchange them. Getting the figure on the stand is also a pain in the ass because I can never get her to stand up properly (especially when you wanna do the cool poses) and the stand is also way too small too, which is why you can't seem to stand Sailor Moon up properly. The packaging it came in was good and it had protection inside the box (unlike some unfortunate people), but that doesn't excuse the imperfections this figure has. Don't get me wrong, I love this figure and it has really good quality and all, but it's kind of a disappointment compared to other anime figures that I've bought and it's definitely not worth spending $43 on, considering the fact that they're better anime figures worth that kind of money. Overall the Sailor Moon figure is a good figure, but kind of a disappointment and definitely didn't live up to all the hype. Hopefully Figuarts Zero will produce better Sailor Moon figures down the road.
B008Y212PI|5.0|very fun addicting game. wish there were more levels! that is why I'm writing this review to open the bonus level.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I never saw this movie when it was first released even though I was 14 years old. After all these decades, finally, what a great cinematic achievement! The disc arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. My wife and I made time to view in and truly enjoyed it. I'd recommend this movie to people of all ages.<br /><br />Bill
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down.  The author gave just enough mystery and twists to make it a believable story.  I loved how she worked in the romance without making it sappy and smutty.
B009G41CG2|5.0|What is there not to like about any form of Mahjong? The game works well only I get a bit addicted to this type of game.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It was worth the watch for sure.  You have to bring humor to this amazing journey.  You'll definitely laugh. Enjoy!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book to me after she read it for a book club. Enjoyed finding out meaning of flowers and the story line kept me interested.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It don't cast images and videos from android.<br /><br />It's simple to write small app for that kind service.<br /><br />Very dissappointed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. I didn't want to put it down.  It really makes you think about the what ifs in life.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|The author made me feel like I was on this Alzheimer's journey with Alice, especially telling the story from her voice.  I found myself laughing, crying, in disbelief and shocked that so little can be done to cure or stabilize this horrible disease.  I was upset by the reactions of her fellow professors and friends; touched by her children; and confused by her husband John.  Alice faced the progression of the disease the best that she could, but it broke my heart to watch her decline and so quickly.  This is a definite read, beautifully written and a story that touches many in some way.  Would highly recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I could not put this book down. Interesting story with good character development. I am looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00881VLCE|4.0|My first purchase of a jigsaw puzzle game for my kindle..Love it..The 200 pieces are challenging and fun to do..One problem I had was it wouldn't load up after using it for a week then recharged kindle totally and it restarted over and the puzzles I had completed was not shown so did them again in easy mode. Glad I got this app.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|Worthless app. Couldn't delete it fast enough after messing with it for about 5 Minutes. Sure it's free but even at that price, way over priced.
0446310786|5.0|This is an amazing novel! I'm glad it was required in class or else I would of never picked up the book.  I will recommend to anyone.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My app says to download new update to continue playing. So I hit the download key out takes me to where you buy the game but nothing says update. I hit the open button it takes me back to the same screen I need to update to continue playing. I go to customer service screen and there's no way to contact anyone to find out what to do.
B004OR199G|4.0|I love the sass this author has in her written voice. The entire book was informative and scientific but in a way that makes common sense. The only thing I wasn't the biggest fan of was the large push to become completely vegan (although she does acknowledge ways to follow the lifestyle without doing so). While reading the book I nodded my head in agreement with how great I will feel when I eliminate meats and dairy from my diet but wanted to cry at the thought of not having a filet mignon with creamy bernaise sauce for dinner.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is a great game choice for entertainment, enjoying a quick challenge, and testing your critical thinking skills in a moment of down time.
B0019HQIGS|3.0|I liked some of his songs and others not so much.  Some songs go on way too long.  My favorite John Mayer song on this is Gravity.
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|Well the bigger of the two is the crashing, if you play for more than 45 minutes at a time lag may start and the game will crash. Also the Bunkhouse mission requires you to pay real money which is just wrong.
B0019IB26I|3.0|Some songs good, some songs not so good.  Some went on way too long.  He is a geat guitarist though.
0345511468|5.0|my review of The Making of Return of The Jedi book by J.W. Rinzler , This book is awesome so many bits of behind the scenes information and photographs on the making of Jedi. My favorite parts of the book are the visual effects breakdowns and how ILM makes a number of shots for a Star Wars films. Also great stuff on the pre production , shooting and post production that went on during the making of Jedi. Also so information on how the last scene in Return of The Jedi where Luke removes Vaders mask and see's his father for the 1st and last time. And so stuff in the last chapter on the Lucasfilm / Disney deal which is a nice touch to the book. If your looking for stuff on the Special Edition of Jedi you will not find it this covers the Original release of Return of The Jedi from the end of 1980 to the release of the film in 1983. So all in all the Making of Return of the Jedi book is a great book on a good movie and worth picking up for Star Wars and movie fans a like. 10 out of 10 across the board.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good read.  Grabs attention on the first page and never let's you go.  The style she writes with is enthraling and has kept me glued to her books one after the other for the past two weeks.
B00EHMG358|4.0|I eagerly await each Pendergast installment, so was pleasantly surprised to see such a substantial preview.  Now I have to wait until December to  continue the story, what was I thinking??? It's a great beginning. Looking forward to the middle an  the end.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|This app is great, I can pull it up with no problems and access my mail with no problems! The only thing I don't like is that it loads in a landscape view, but that's fine.
B001W63DX2|5.0|This video  deserved a five star rating because the performances of the band were classic.  The guitarists get better with age.  The solos were terrific.  I also enjoyed watching the reactions of the fans who were  from all over the world.  Iron Maiden is world class.  I would recommend this video to any one interested in seeing Iron Maiden live.  It has a documentary of the tour included with the concert footage.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Fantastic book!!!  I couldn't finish it quickly enough.  I’m recommending to everyone.  Great piece of fiction which addresses the topic of the lengths a parent will go to protect their child...even from themself.
0316067601|5.0|If you have not read this book all I can say is YOU NEED TO! Much respect to all of our warriors who have paid the ultimate price for us and those who came home with the reality of war in their background. Marcus is the man and every American needs to know this story!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I had heard of The Good Wife in passing, but didn't watch an episode until recently. Though I disagree with the premise (staying with a cheating husband) the episodes are all well crafted and engaging, and focus more on the politics of a law firm, its business, and the cases themselves. The cast is well-rounded and all of the characters are compelling individuals. Definitely worth watching!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Following a myriad of characters was a nifty theme for this book, but winding it down by revisiting previously seen characters was confusing, as I struggled to place the familiar name into one of the very many small stories I'd read by then.<br /><br />Also, not being a great geography whiz, jumping around all over the world kept me feeling displaced and disoriented. But all in all there were interesting little nuggets of information for me to dig out, which I do so enjoy. :)<br /><br />Overall however, I simply cannot give this book a higher rating. It was all over the map, quite literally. There was no sense of continuity whatsoever, and there were no main characters to whom I could relate, grow attached to, and care about. And for me, that is the essence of a good book: the character(s) I love who take me on their journey. \\"What happens next?\\" is the driving force behind a reader's desire to turn the page, and for me, it wasn't here. The question here was always, \\"Where are we flipping to now, and for how long?\\" Just when I did start to care about the character, the chapter ended and a whole new character was introduced.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this season, particularly the rivalry between state attorney's office and Lockhart Gardner. This season introduces some wonderfully contentious characters and brings them back every so often within the series - it's nice to see that bit of continuity and makes for a powerful second season.
B00112C4EG|5.0|This is the best Shleich yet.  So realistic with the Schleich quality.  You can even see tiny little veins on  her tummy, amazing addition t my collection!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's okay but I'm not able to view this game in horizontal mode on my Kindle Fire - only vertical.  Vertical is difficult for me to view.  As a result, I don't play it as often.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|LOVE this serious!! High quality picture!! My dad LOVES this serious and he is going to love being able to watch this at home!!
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I had owned this movie before and loaned it out....oh, well.  I like it enough that I wanted to replace it (never to be loaned out again).  It is a love story, but not at all a typical one.  Stellar performances by both Jodie Foster and Richard Gere.  This is a movie you should sit down and pay attention to; there are some subtleties.  There is nothing inappropriate for  children, but the complexities of the story and love story may well be over their heads.  I highly recommend.
B00338QENI|5.0|Like many others, I was told it stood for Helen Lane. Incredible account,<br />The technical aspects of cell culture were explained in clear and easy to understand.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|An ok book, gives some insight into first century Palestine.<br />This much is enough about this book  - managed to plod through.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I love this game. You can play for fun or you can try to play strategically. The wild cards add the fun of the unknown. Will you win coins or lose cards. You just have to keep playing.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I only wish I noticed you had it in a BlueRay pack!!!! My Girlz LUV this... I think my 3yr old has to watch it 5time a day at least.... She needs to know all the words to the Songs! XoXo P.Kitty
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I downloaded this game when it was free on \\"app of the day\\" a month ago, and we've played it a lot since! My 2.5 year old loves it, and I even sometimes play it myself. You first get to shampoo, rinse, and dry their hair, you can change the color, cut it, comb it, they have a razor and buzzer for the guys, and you can grow it if you cut it too short. After that you can use the flat iron, curling iron, or curling wand to give it a styled look. The only think I wish was different id they gave you more option on people. There are only 6 people.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the app it is a great extension of kindle. It functions almost exactly as if you were using a real kindle
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I always suggest that other's read the books as the tv show can't pack all of the action in, but its still an amazing show!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Latest release works fine on most primary functionalities, but still has a couple of annoying issues:<br />- the read/unread flag on messages is messed up: the app will &quot;read&quot; messages I haven't opened and, even if I flag then as unread, they won't always show the right status<br />- you can't select text from an incoming message (but you can reply and select the text in the original message)<br />I would expect better, considering the quality of the website, the money linkedin is making, and the number of releases this app already had...
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Just an amazing story and even more amazing is what went into researching and writing &#34;A Higher Call.&#34;  Rates even &#34;Higher&#34; than my two favorite non-fiction books - Erik Larsen's &#34;In the Garden of Beasts&#34; and &#34;Devil in the White City.&#34; Highly recommended.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This was a great movie that my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed and have replayed it several times.  We  Cannot wait for RED 2!!
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Awesome :) Everyone should see this movie and will enjoy every moment of it....if you haven't seen Hunger Games or read the books, you are missing out!
B001TODCII|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it and have replayed it several times.  It is about what a Father does when his Daughter is in trouble.  Every Father comes to his Daughter(s) aid when they need help.  May be not as action oriented.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I Received the cd today.  Brand New, quick delivery.  This music is something everyone should experience. Spread the word. Detroit makes music. Thanks
6304806434|5.0|My son absolutely loves this movie. And he kept bugging me to find it. Amazon comes through for all our (what I think) would be hard finds in stores.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Quick and easy to use.  I lilke that it crosses out the tasks or notes you have completed, but they don't disappear so you know what you have completed.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|this is a great series its one that you cant wait for the next episode to see whats going to happen next. I can only say that I cant wait for the next season to come
B00D23GXB2|5.0|For me, poetry must take me places, either kicking and screaming and bound in chains or quietly into the abyss with childlike humor. Words mean something, and if you can spin those words into webs of crystalline beauty which ensnare, you've won me over as a reader.<br /><br />This book of erotic poetry is one that I wasn't expecting, and therefore enjoyed immensely. GPA is a poet on the extreme, who indulges without being crude, who smoothly guides the reader's mind to entertain, and who knows his craft.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I have watched this movie about 6 times since I got it it never seases to amaze me believe me I will be watching it a lot more its that good
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|I thought this movie was good until the end.  It was just silly.  Almost felt like they had to come up with some kind of explanation so they just made one up at the last minute.  A rental at best.
B00CQRN3QI|5.0|A Disney classic and my husbands favorite animated film.  Take the adventure with Peter, Wendi, John, Michael, and of course, Tink.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a simple yet effective clutter cleaner for your mobile device. It doesn't take rocket science to figure out and you can clean out your entire device in less then 2 minutes. a very reliable app
0143124544|5.0|Not quite a fairy tale, but was a good quick read.  There are so many daily living requirements that you do not think about when you are healthy and able to do things for yourself.  Good wake up call.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun, makes you think and I get so let focused on figuring these out.  We need tons more and soon.
B00EPQQ2PW|4.0|Great vocals and harmonies, decent melodies.  Get's a little bland and sounds too calculated at times. The band has more potential than what came out in this album.
B00E0SX118|3.0|Takes a while to get going, but picks up and has some good laughs.  Heart-warming ending.  All the kids I know love it.
B00EJ2WBX4|5.0|Every song is a single.  Great album. 'Lungs' is the best song, but the others are great too. If you liked the 'Recover EP' you'll love this album, lives up to the hype.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|The CD is great.  I have enjoyed all of the tracks.  Great blues guitar and wonderful vocals.  Love the combo!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|skyfall is the best bond movie so far! you finally get to learn about bonds past a little! intense movie!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I like the variety of the exercises.  Nice way to mix up the normal ab routine.  Makes me want to work my abs...and that take a lot!
B00946WMXY|5.0|such a good movie
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love Reeves. Haven't seen him in a bad movie yet. This shows a different side of him. I would recommend highly.
B000F7CMQ8|5.0|Great movie.... Enjoyed adding it to my collection. I like all the movies that are made in Africa. Thank you
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is great.  I was surprised at how slow the first two chapters were but then I couldn't put it down!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love SOA. The acting is great and the story lines keep me interested! Love Gemma too, she is a queen B!
B008J34466|5.0|I'm a big fan of pink....didn't even bother to look in any of my local stores. Amazon has never failed me on getting my order correct or delivering!!!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love, love, love Kelly Clarkson and this disc has all the songs you could ever want of hers!  Love the Auto Rip feature!!
B000W4D27C|5.0|GREAT it was amazing I'm do glad I bought this, I can't wait to get more! Thank you so much,
0062011847|4.0|Samuel Vimes (picture Dirty Harry as played by Jack Webb) takes a vacation. Delightful social observation disguised as a rollicking farce.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Is there any who loves Star Trek that did not like this?  We all watched a second time.  And plan to watch it again. Great!
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|It is the exact same as the other books!! I do not like  the fact that this I is cabin fever but a different season
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun and entertaining!  Free is a very good price as well.  Trying to catch and eat humans is hilarious to watch.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game will make you scream, &quot;Finnaly a game that is as good as minecraft pe!&quot; Maybe not if you hate everything like Kristin Stewart, but you will  &lt;3 this game like me! Lol trooolololo nudder budder
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this game is awesome. It has great graphics its fun and has many worlds to explore and kill as many demons as you please. If your wondering if the ge is worth it i say go for it.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|It kept  me in suspense and im looking forward to the next season! I was happy that  i was able to get it for a reaaonable price
1476727651|5.0|I have been a loyal Stephen King fan since reading Christine and Carrie one summer long ago.  I can't say that I've read everything that King has written, but I wouldn't be off much if I did say that.<br /><br />Dr. Sleep continues King's march through our psyches.  Like a vampire at our doors, we have to let him in by buying, begging, or stealing his books (well, there is the public library) and then actually reading them.  The reader has to buy into Kings world, and this continues to be easy to do.  While Dr. Sleep builds on what happened at the Overlook Hotel (the literary one and not the cinematic one) back in the `70's, there are really few connections between the Shining and this new effort.  However, Dr. Sleep is very easily a stand a lone novel.<br /><br />Danny (Dan) Torrence is the major character in Dr. Sleep.  He's not the cute and innocent child of the Shining but a man haunted not only what happened at the Overlook Hotel so many years ago, but by his own demons as well.  The acorn hasn't fallen far from the tree.....  We find Danny struggling with alcohol just as his Dad, Jack did.  Danny drifts from one job to the other though somewhere a long the way he picked up medical knowledge that makes him a great hospice employee.  Then there is \\"the shine\\" that gives him the third eye plus the unique ability to relate to the residents of these houses of mercy.<br /><br />Honestly, I found The True Knot to be one of the more brilliant and unsettling aspects of Dr. Sleep.  I'm afraid that to say more would create a spoiler issue.  Suffice it to say that they have the ability to haunt your sleep far past finishing the book.  I wonder why they didn't get a book of their own.  Perhaps there are plans along those lines.<br /><br />Stephen King has never delivered a stinker that I am aware of.  Yes, some of his books are more memorable than others, but I have found each one to have strong legs and have the ability to transport me to somewhere else.  This is not always easily done, but King can do it.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend.<br /><br />Peace to all.ys easily done, but King can do it.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend.<br /><br />Peace to all.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Again I can get into this story and picture myself in a second<br />of drunken bliss or whatever getting married.  I don't think it<br />would work out but this was o.k.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Does not work. Only ads<br />Don't install this.  Phony PW gen. Installs adware. Should be removes FM amzn store asap.
B008Y212PI|4.0|fun puzzles...they are abit challenging but not so difficult that you get frustrated. closest thing to a logoc problem i have seen in an app.
B005F2BBLK|4.0|A little too long but I enjoyed the graphics...probably not on the top of my list. Watched TinTin at about the same time and found it to be much better.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in quite a while. Good cast, good story and plot, good acting and even an ending that I did'nt see ahead of time.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Absolutely fell in love with this little film; superbly done in every way...hope there's a sequel. The graphics were spectacular.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I have all four of the first presentations of Enigma as the years progressed.  I heard this CD on Pandora and was totally<br />taken by this Album.  I had to have it.  It is a different style as the first four.  But it grows on you.  It is a must have for Enigma<br />followers.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The logic required in this game makes sense. If you enjoy soduko you will likely find this game much to your liking. I have found it addictive. The three levels of difficulty progress smoothly and when you choose you can solve a more challenging puzzle. Easy to follow directions. Hints are not always needed. I never chose the unlimited error option. I enjoyed the challenge of each puzzle with realistic limits. A real winner!
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I got this music because I love it in the DVD and at the Theater when I first saw it.  The music score is very lifting.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that love the new music being written for movies of this caliber.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Added it to my playlist of dancing music I use to exercise with. Love the beat...it's so much fun to dance to.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater long ago.  I had to see it again.  There a lot of movies coming about the times of WWII lately.<br />This is one that ranks up there with Casablanca and Catch 22.  So I had to own it and play it to quell my desire to see<br />times gone by 60 years hence.
1609611543|5.0|Whether you buy the author's ideas about wheat or not, this book is worth the price for the info on genetic and historical changes in our foods. Probably explains why I developed severe food allergies later in life for foods (specifically corn) I had eaten earlier all my life without problem. It can be tedious reading but worth the effort!<br />I believe info in this book has a bearing on many of our emerging health concerns, and perhaps on our society's emotional and psychological problems as well.
B008220C38|5.0|This movie has been done a thousand times.  But i think Keira Knightley is just fantastic an actoress.  The style of this movie is<br />unique in that the whole scenes are done in one place.  Jude Law is a great actor as well.  I have watched him grow in all his<br />acting career.  Watch him in The Midnight Garden of Good and Evil and see how he has progressed.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|These three play off each other so well. They're hilarious and the scene when Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart are drunk is one of the best scenes from any movie I have ever seen. This movie is suggested for all ages. I love these three each alone but together they make one heck of a hit!
B00E0SX118|5.0|The Croods is a very funny, family oriented movie. My daughter and I love to cuddle up and watch it together.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was the perfect sequel to the shining well done Mr King you rock as,always what's next?  Thanks for the great read
B007SGM084|5.0|Five stars,can't get enough ,yes it has some bdsm ideas,but the characters are there.you will need,no plans with this book,Because once you start you not be able put it down.WOW!
B006LA6IW2|5.0|A must read!!  Chris Kyle shows you what's it's like to be a SEAL in the US Navy. Eye opening accounts of the wars in the Middle East.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game.  Fast pace but fun.  Would like it even better if it wasn't required to use real money to get further into the game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is a godsend. It comes with a very nice selection of relaxation &amp; white noise sounds which you can mix to your taste and needs. I use rain at full volume with urban rain at 3/4 and thunder at 1/2, for winding down to sleep. There are no noticeable loops or glitches in the sound samples, a problem I've had with some sound machines. And the timer lets me choose a span that won't drain my battery to zero, since I do fall asleep.<br /><br />All this in a free app that doesn't constantly poke me to upgrade, or flash ads at me. I think I'll move up to premium just because I'm grateful!<br /><br />Try this. It's good.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Way better than the first 2! Exciting all the way through the book. Could not put it down. Must read!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|After viewing the first season I went crazy looking for the second season? Finally decided to order second and third season from Amazon.  It came quick, watched the second season in a week, it was so good!  Now am on the third season.  Amazing series!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'm addicted. This game uses the same type of logic that Soduco uses. If you like Soduco you'll enjoy this one.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Better than expected. Can't wait to finish and be ready for the fourth season in a few weeks! Never thought I could be so in to this series.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It was useful for keeping a working edge on my knives, but was definitely not for finishing them at all.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|On to book 3!<br />An intriguing whirlwind of life, love, good, evil, and magic.<br />I can't wait to read what happens next
B00062PN6I|3.0|My all time best and favorite pair of headphones were Behringer (I paid $25 for them) they were low end studio headphones. They were built very well, long cord, adapter (used them for home studio and regular music). These HPM1000s? Not very good at all. They have the same audio quality as a cheap pair from the dollar store. Seriously. Not nearly as good as a pair of in-ears I paid $7 for a few months ago.<br /><br />Negative: You know the closed headphones with the airholes, where you can hear music from both sides when they're on your head? These don't have the airholes but you can hear music out the other side with only a slight muffling. No privacy.<br /><br />Positive: I see a lot of complaints about them hurting ones ears, luckily I have extra small ears so they fit right around them.<br /><br />Positive: The plug is built solid, and they're turned side ways when you plug it in. So you don't have to worry about bumping the plug or it getting twisted. They did a good job with that. The adapter 1/4 adapter screws off and you can plug them into any mp3 player, laptop, tablet, etc.<br /><br />Negative: One of the earmuffs has already came off twice and it was hard getting it back on without tearing it. As good as the plug is built, the muffs are cheap (despite the texture mimicking better headphones).<br /><br />Positive: The over the head arch? Very well built. Thick. One of the best features. I can't imagine these breaking or the adjustable part snapping, which happens on many headphones.<br /><br />Positive: The cord is thick and wont twist or short.<br /><br />If the earmuffs were better, the sound were MUCH better, and there was even moderate muffling of the sound, these would be some awesome headphones and worth much, much more. What's well built is very well built, what's cheap is VERY cheap.<br /><br />I was waffling between a 2.5 and a 3. The sound being below the level of even cheaper headphones is inexcusable.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I am not eloquent with words or reviews.  I will say this book was a good read and held my attention well.  The author does a good job of introducing the characters so you know them and want to follow their story.  Read the second and am on the third now!
B004V73FGE|3.0|Good, fun, movie! But the amazon app on my Xbox continuously has to stop and load. This made watching this movie very frustrating
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is. So amazing that I just couldn't put it down. In the end you'll have so many emotions running through that you want know how Suzanne Collins did it with just her words. I love these books and definitely recommend them to anybody who wants an adventure.
B004UPAN6W|2.0|Entertaining for sure, but the story line lacks any real conviction that the other x men movies have. The movie I would have given a three star rating, but my amazon app on my Xbox kept stoping and starting that I had to stop watching.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|This was a fun game that kept me interested and wanting to keep playing. It's exciting with plenty of twists and turns in the story line. It keeps you wondering where your going to go next.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|All in all this is a fun game and can be played without spending additional money, you just have to be willing to wait at times.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I love the hero even though he's a bit stubborn.  Las Vegas is the perfect setting for an impulsive drunken marriage to happen although the law usually prevents places from marrying anyone under the influence.  Annulments are hard to get as well.  I almost wish we could have had more of the cousins or some secondary characters involved with h & H.
B00EP0KBXM|1.0|I don't know why they still give M.Night Somethingsomething yet another chance to make a movie. One horrible piece of garbage after another.<br />So you have M. Night's talent for producing utter trash 10 out of 10 times, then this pathetic idea of promoting Will Smith's son just because he is Will Smith's son even though he can't act better than a paper bag, plus you have a script that must have been written by someone completely stoned out of his mind and the result is predictable - disaster.<br /><br />To give you an example for how bad the script is - the entire movie rests on the concept that in order to fight the evil aliens you have to be able to control your fear, because that controls your body odors. Because the aliens are blind and can only kill you when they smell you. Are you still with me?!?<br />So this is supposed to be a hard sci-fi movie, with a human civilization that has mastered interstellar travel, large-scale terraforming and faster than light communications - but they have to fight some aliens - with swords!<br />And therefore they have to walk up to them - and they have never considered just wearing a suit with helmet that would just contain their odor. Or, you know, use weapons that.. are not SWORDS! They do have odor-containing plastic bubbles to protect their children when the aliens attack, so they are aware that this is a concept that would work - but no, they put their children under the bubble and then the parents go and fight - with SWORDS!<br />Not a laser gun, or even just a rifle or - heck - even a crossbow would do, since the aliens are actually quite vulnerable (to swords...).<br />No, it has to be a sword so that there can be an entire movie about Will Smith's son carrying his father's blade and then finding his own and learning to control his body odor in ways other than just taking a shower or wearing a suit and helmet.<br />This is how incredibly dumb a piece of nonsense this is. Now imagine adding M.Night Shalala's directing and Jaden Smith's \\"acting\\" and you understand why this will go down as one of the 3 or 4 worst movies of this decade.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This movie is full of zany humor moments. It may not be the Disney masterpiece that everyone else loves but I enjoy watching ever time and probably watch it several times a year.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game. Once I started<br />playing it I could not stop.Wish there were more puzzles. Definitely worth the purchase.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is truly phenomenal!  I have never been so emotionally attached to characters before! John Green created an amazing story that I highly recommend if you enjoy realistic fiction. I can't wait to read more of Green's work!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|From beginning to end  I found this book hard to set down.  Interesting facts I do not remember ever hearing before now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is easy to use and offers nice streaming capabilities.  Hulu Pro announced today and more to come.  Still waiting for device mirroring though.. Hopefully soon...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Answered questions I've always had about the shining. But it's a work of art that can stand alone. Well done.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|No dull parts.  Lots of action.  Great effects. OK acting.  Tom Cruise is not the greatest actor, but good action scenes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a great game.  We love that we can go into eachothers worlds.<br />Its worth the 6.99.I just wish it was easier to find diamonds. :)
078689136X|4.0|It's got duct tape and a very intense killer. What else do you need? Steamy sex? ok. Still getting used to the writing style. The biggest mystery of all is: &#34;Who's Richard Castle?&#34;
0857680986|5.0|A wonderful book for anyone who does figure drawing, or painting, perhaps sculpture of the figure as well.  A classic
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Someday, somewhere, someone will figure out why these games are so addicting and why people buy something they hate/love/frustrates them. It ain't gonna be me. I'm running out of space on my Kindle, but I just had to have SW II. glad I did, though it's tricky (as always) getting the little goody boxes tucked away in seemingly impossible places. Spoiler alert: The Jar Jar Binks bird always behaves stupidly, yet like the SW1 character seems to come through in the end. Da Fantum sez: &#34;If you ain't got it yet, get it!&#34;
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Had seen all the other seasons except the 1st, everything makes sense now.<br />So sad that this show was cancelled
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Ordered the chromecast, had to wait 3 weeks for it to arrive. Ordered it for the ability to play local content. Before I even received it Google went and broke the ability to play movies off of a local server. I received the chromecast, used it once and haven't used it again. It is a good device for the money but has so few content options that it's not for me. It could become a great device give time or it could become one of Googles many unrealized dreams. I hope it works out but for now I use a Roku3 with PLEX. Roku3 cost 3 time what I paid for the Chromecast but has 10 times the options.
0792839730|4.0|A good look at the fortunes of war and the blunders we always encounter. To bad most of the combatants are no longer with us to explain the real problems
B000FC13UE|4.0|This author will never disappoint you with a poor story structure. He always stays original. He is always Heil Gaiman.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Gameloft seems to excel in creating quality tablet gaming.<br /><br />This has been very enjoyable and immersive both as a solo play and multiplayer game.<br /><br />However, as much as I've enjoyed this &#34;free&#34; game you really cannot play very long before you become held hostage to it's in-app purchasing system.<br /><br />After a couple of hours, you will be trapped by longer and longer &#34;item upgrade / charm merging / crafting&#34; times that can only be mitigated by paying.<br /><br />Similiar limitations occur with inventory space and quest requirements.<br /><br />Some simple number crunching makes you realize that to actually continue playing to completion will require either $100 or 100+ hours sitting around with your kindle idle waiting on those little pings that signify some que time finally expired and you now have enough inventory room to play another mission.<br /><br />In the end, it just became too irritating to play one mission, then spend an hour waiting to process loot/gear/charms to get enough inventory to play again.<br /><br />A truly great game, totally ruined by it's cost strategy. I would have much rather paid up front for a truly awesome gameplay experience than to be baited in, then nickled and dimed through the entire game.<br /><br />Not only did they not get a sale from me, they lost my interest in other titles produced by Gameloft.<br />There is just to much competition in the app market these days for this type of profit model to continue to be effective.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|This recording is not the highest quality. It is not high fidelity. Sometimes the vocals are drowned out out by the  band. Some songs are  a little &#34;fuzzy&#34;. On the TV show songs sound great..
B00C061HZY|5.0|My first Daft Punk record I would highly suggest their music. The album takes you own a musical journey to lands old and new.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to agree with all the reviews that were written about the disappointment with the ending of the book. The last chapter of the book was a real downer, I thought it was going to have a better ending.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This book had a lot going on, and it all worked for it. There were some points where I was like, \\"Oh, it's still going.\\" But I ended up enjoying the whole experience. It showed what was going on historically with workers, naturalists, etc.; it didn't take place in London at the height of the season with debutantes, it showed a more long-lasting version of how a relationship can be, with love, trust, \\"betrayal,\\" discussions, etc.<br /><br />I think that some of the problems could have been averted with simple discussions. I liked that there were rational and intelligent characters who COULD discuss things.<br /><br />I was sad, but liked, that there were family tensions and arguments. It made it seem more realistic. For instance, the main male character's brother's family didn't like him very much for not great reasons - stuff his father did - but it was realistic that they wouldn't necessarily embrace the main character, because what the father did was serious and detrimental.<br /><br />I liked that the main male character was not a rake/womanizer and was in fact very nervous and awkward around women because he didn't want to be like his father. He was also a genuinely kind and good person. A good hero.<br /><br />I also liked the heroine, though, while there was a lot of talk of her strategic mind, I don't think they really SHOWED it that much. They briefly touched on some things that she'd done and planned, but it didn't seem exceptional.<br /><br />I really wish they would have had a chess match between the main female character and the male character's brother.<br /><br />I REALLY enjoyed the conversation on the train with the main male character's cousin and friend. SO funny.<br /><br />There was also a very mature look at sex. It doesn't necessarily work perfectly the first time. And this was tackled and continued well.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I really liked how they changed how Kirk goes into the Radiation chamber instead of Spock in this version.  Nice cameo of Leonard Nimoy again too.  This one kicks much A..
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book is intense. The main characters have very volatile relationships. They've also moved very fast for people as young as they are. I don't think that either of the main relationships was exactly healthy, but at least people called each other on the immature decisions they made - to some extent.<br /><br />I do feel that everyone needed to age a little more, relax, and settle down before coming to their relationships as actual adults.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br />-I enjoyed the main female character's relationship with the male character's family.<br />-I liked that they built a friendship during that period when they were trying to resist each other.<br />-The main female character knew what she didn't want (a Vegas life) and stuck to that aside from as necessary.<br />-I like that the main female character didn't get into too much of a snit when she wasn't with the main male character and he had relations with others. They weren't together, and she realized that. Minimum amount of maturity shown.<br />-There were side characters that were introduced but not really explained. Friends and acquaintances that had small roles but were not vital. It actually happens in real life, but rarely in books. Nice addition.<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br />-No one should get someone else a dog without consulting them. Really. Especially if it's to manipulate that person into spending more time with them because they know the other person can't care for/house that animal in a dorm.<br />-Possessiveness, temper tantrums, aggressiveness, violence on the part of the main male character.<br />-Don't know if it was just because I went to a larger school, but that college seemed smaller than my high school. Rumors about the relationship from EVERYONE, even people outside of their friend group? Really? Didn't seem realistic to me.
0060555661|4.0|I am about 1/3 of the way through this book and am finding it an interesting and informative read. Just what I was hoping for.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Not much more to say. The acting is wonderful. The story is great. Could rewatch a number of scenes over and over.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|The combination of the Stillers, Will Ferrell (with Nathan Graham in particular), Owen Wilson, John Voight, and David Duchovny as the street smart hand model is completely over the top.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We love this movie, no bad words and great for the entire family. Having the digital copy makes it great for on the go.
1587143879|4.0|I have bought books by this author and publisher before and it usually comes with a PDF version but all I see on this one is a sample of chapter 5 in PDF.  Is there not a PDF or soft copy version that comes with these books?
B005K0HDGE|3.0|My review, is sort of lapping....though that's time travel...though I figure some dumb people makes you so angry.  If you get angry quick don't read the book, if you get angry and figure well it's fascinating since time is allowing for a hole to go back in the past then well you might like it.  I sort of love the idea of a hole for time to allow the past to exist.
0061122416|5.0|trust me. get it if you have not. and i dont like fiction and this one, i loved.<br /><br />get it a shot.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.<br /><br />Doesn't that send a thrill up your spine? I read this book about a year ago and loved the idea of it. Unfortunately, in retrospect, I think I liked the idea better than the actual book. It is a very magical idea, this whole night circus concept. A mysterious, stunning circus in black and white and red appears out of nowhere in the middle of the night and features the most unique and mind-blowing performances anyone has ever heard of. Excellent! It could stay for a day or a month or a year, who knows!<br /><br />The main story here is not the circus itself really, but a fierce battle going on behind the scenes between two warring magicians who have each selected a \\"student\\" as their pawn in their sick game. The Night Circus is the venue. It's very complicated, and I never quite understood it really. Basically a boy and a girl find out from a young age that they have been chosen by the magicians to play this game. They never really seem to understand what the terms of the game are, who their Opponent is, when the game will begin, or how it can be won. Naturally, as soon as the opponents do meet each other, they fall madly in love, which is deeply tragic given the implication that one must kill the other.<br /><br />The whole opponent/game thing was shrouded in so many layers of mystery and complication and vague, esoteric rules that I just never really felt too engaged with it. It took me a long time to finish this book actually and I think that's because I never really had a grasp as to what on earth was going on or what I wanted to happen.<br /><br />I think the underlying problem in this book is that the author spends far more time discussing how enthralled everyone was with the Night Circus than demonstrating in a concrete way what it was about the Night Circus that was actually so enthralling. And she does the same thing with the Opponents. She hammers home the point that this is an epic saga of star-crossed lovers, but as a reader, I had a hard time feeling it...I was just really confused a lot of the time. I kind of felt like this was published too soon, like we have here an early draft not fully developed.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book, but something about it just didn't quite do it for me....I just never felt all that connected to the characters or the story. Still, it was a super creative idea, so it gets points for that: 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Also, the jacket art is amazing. Well done whoever designed this jacket!!he hammers home the point that this is an epic saga of star-crossed lovers, but as a reader, I had a hard time feeling it...I was just really confused a lot of the time.

B0034G4P4O|5.0|A delightful fast-paced romp, like having Indiana Jones back! the artwork is beautiful, with evocative exotic backgrounds; the music is energetic and suited to the pace; just plain fun. so totally  Spielberg. The disc is generally high-quality with only one sticking place ( the same place as in the library copy, so the defect may be systemic.)
B008602KQI|2.0|Too much violence of teens killing teens. We watched with family and it was very violent for younger kids.<br />Just okay.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I waited forever to get this season and in two days watched them all.  Now, how many years do I have to wait in order to see season 7?
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I loved this book. I could not put it down. I really do think this could help someone. You did a great job Nikki, I'm proud of you. I'm really glad you worked things out with your mom in the end. Much love and respect  <3 -Sunnie Rae
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to load no major problems, little easier than I like but only have played 4 or 5 times. I love all mahjong games and this one is fun, easy to play

B006T5GTK0|5.0|We recently visited Alice Springs and it inspired us to see the original movie again after all those years, fabulous story
B000YAFE0M|5.0|I like this movie, Noone could play this like Anthony Hopkins, he is my favorite actor, this keeps you on your toes. This movie is a mind thriller very very good.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|5 Star's<br />The film was very epic and showed  the suffering Christ absorbed for the children of God. The Pain of Mary seen through the eyes of her love for her son captured my heart. She as for Christ forgave everyone who tormented the only man that the only crime for spreading the Lord God message was crucified on the cross. The people that wanted Christ put to death condemned him because they were afraid and ignorant of change. Mass hysteria created by ignorance fueled the hotheaded masses to put Christ to death. Fear of the unknown at that era was the Justice the church & people wanted.  Christ knew he had to leave this mortal life on earth to a higher purpose. But his Love for mankind shunted his existence. For God for seen Christ end on earth and took him in his arms to  a higher existence where he could worshiped in the hearts of everyone who believed in him.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik was just amazing then I tried to log in into my kik acc it didn't work at all its been like this for over 2 weeks for me!!! You need to fix it kik it's annoying basically everyone that has kik on a kindle. I even emailed kik it didn't do anything to help.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|Then you should try this CD or any others from this band.  Susan Tedeschi has a beautiful voice and together with the band, they are very good listening.  I intend to purchase other CD' s and/or MP3 versions of this band as soon as possible.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|I playing their other game, Ice Age and closed out because of frustration with game errors, erased points portions stuck. I gave up, I felt maybe their new game Epic mate have less errors. So far a little confusing fighting, it's a little slow and not enough ways to earn the points I think it is water drops most things are 20-200+ but you can only earn 2-5 when you play for a day? Not cool? Only time will tell if it get' s better.
0393317552|5.0|A highly readable and cogent account of Man's development from the cave and beyond! Why have some races developed more quickly or more slowly than others? Here is Prof. Diamonds answer! I challenge you not to be convinced or even to be able to put the book down down once you have started it!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Exactly what I want from the game.. casual play, relaxing music, and tiles automatically shuffle when there are no more pairs. Very enjoyable.
038572179X|5.0|Another wonderful book to spend some time with.  The story is beautifully written and will hold your interest all the way through.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I do love this device, it helps me with cartoons for my LO  and the quality is great, but it dose lose connection occasionally which is very annoying. It has nothing to do with our network as nothing else is affected. still, its opens up great viewing potential and I am getting one for my dad.
0679731725|5.0|Once I saw the film, I knew I had to read the book.  It is well worth your time to do so.
1416595236|5.0|I love Vince Flynn.  Discovered his first book one day on a random search, ordered it, and after a few chapters, ordered all of the rest.  Books are about one central assassin, Mitch Rapp.  This is last one in the series.  Outstanding book.  Reading one of Vince Flynn's books is amazing, the pages fly by and before I know it it's over.  He draws the reader in from page 1.  The action is non stop, and this book was one of the best.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for assassin thrillers.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Great game !!!! It is fun for all ages and takes up time. Some parts are tricky !!! Great buy
1781162646|5.0|I have read everything by Stephen King, and this was another great one.  Love anything by this author, and this book didn't disappoint!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is one of the very best movies ever; showing our humanity and why we needed our relationship with the heavenly Father.  It shows that true men believe that there is someone to answer to; and it shows that true men can have that Godly faith and trust!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gonna continue with the other 2. Looking forward to the movie release for the second book. I recommend the book for pleasure reading.

B009P5K4HK|4.0|This album is great. It comes as described (1 CD & 1 DVD), I've had this for about 2 months I believe, and I still haven't watched the DVD, but seeing as this is Amy Winehouse I will automatically assume that the DVD is amazing. The CD is magnificent, most of these songs sound better live than they did on an album.<br /><br />However, the album case was cracked, but I'm assuming thats because of shipping and not how it originally was.<br /><br />Anyway, I do recommend this for any Amy Winehouse fan, or somebody that is looking to get into her music.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I love this movie,three of my favorite actors, De Niro,Pesci,and Liotta, and I love Lorraine Bracco also I like her in everything she does what an actress !!!! I really love My Kindle Fire HDthe picture is great the sound is great so overall I love.
B00942S4OY|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to the CD, even though it's not what I normally listen too.  They are a really talented group and seem to have their priorities right.
0439023521|5.0|A friend told me to read this book. Wow. I really loved it. Katniss is such a wonderful character and her relationship with Peeta is one of the best in books. The concept was great.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|Enjoyable music from a talented group of young men from the UK, who appear to have a lot of respect for their fans.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I really like this app. It keeps me distracted for hours and it is very family friendly.  All in all I'd buy this app again.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I purchased this after seeing the documentary about them.  They have risen far from their upbringing by an ultra right-wing religious family.  I really think they are great!
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I thought this was possibly the best bluegrass album of the year. The songs that A.J. wrote are pure Bluegrass, very traditional. The backup is perfect. It is the type of album that just cheers you up when you hear it. The only very slight complaint I might have is that it might be a tad too smooth. It lacks a little of the rawness of the older bluegrass albums. I don't normally give 5 star recommendations, this album deserves every star. The long extended instrumentals on each song are a pleasure. There is nothing I can say negative about this. I got it yesterday and have played it 3 times already. Good thing you can't wear out a CD.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Great documentary about the greatest pilot ever. It shows the backstage conflicts the most of the times we don´t know that happens among pilots.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Very detailed description right off the bat of a black ops extraction on Gibraltar.  But, these things never turn out as they're planned and the book then follows several key characters from the black ops and the follow-up (or clean up?) from this.  Well defined character and well defined locations.  Berlin.  Vienna.  London.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|perfect image quality and sound, from the greatest musical production for the movies ever. For US users, it´s possible to stablish internet conection from TV / Blu Ray and get news and information.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great APP,  you must use  your grey matter of your brain . The more you play,  the more. you  understand.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I have been a fan of the show since the beginning..I think this is one of the best series ever created...I would recommend this to everyone..The DVD's played great..I just really love this show.
B00DWOUY3Y|5.0|i cannot think of a better way of honouring Verdi's bicentenary than listening to this marvelous set of ten of his most celebrated operas (though it could have been streched to a dozen to include Trovatore and Ernani as well, or Don Carlo and Vespri) performed and brodcast by the Metropolitan opera from the mid thirties to the late sixties, with some of the greatest singers of the past century. All of them have been released before in no authorized editions, with diverse quality of sound. I had most of them and I beleive that the present edition, from the actual tapes curated by the MET, have better sound overall. Particularly the legendary Traviata of Ponselle from 1935 is presented with a restoration that seems to me almost a miracle. I have listened to this recording since its release by Pearl in two vinil discs and later in several CD editions, including the Naxos transfer by Ward Marston, and never thought that anybody could dig out from those old acetate discs (or rather surviving tapes made from the now lost acetates) any more sound. But how wrong I was. In the present incarnation the richness and grandeur of Ponselle 's voice has a presence that I never dreamed possible. It almost brought tears to my eyes. Only for that I would have gladly paid this set asking price. But then you get the 1940 Otello, in opinion of the late John Steane (to me the supreme authority regarding vocal criticism) the best performance by Martinelli and the rest of the principals that have been preserved. Which is like saying the best Otello in recorded history. The other 8 operas are equally superb performances by some of the greatest verdian singers of the past, schooled unlike many of the present \\"stars\\" in an almost lost tradition of singing, which combined attack and legato, impeccable phrasing, beautiful tone and expresive declamation. Get it while it lasts.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is captivating and I didn't want to put it down! I loved it! It's a definite must read
B001EN71DG|3.0|If George Lucas didn't add all those digital or new cut scenes in the original movies.  To me it cheapened the collection and made the story not flow well.  You have the option to view the old version with this set, but the picture is small, and the quality isn't so good.  I understand what he was thinking, but after 20 years till episodes 1-3 came out, it was already too late.  He should've just started with episode 1! LOL
067165991X|5.0|This is not a how to book, unless you cannot read between the lines. Examples from history reverberate in the world events of today.
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Got the item as expected pretty quickly. Went to play the blueray and it just kept looping to the menu.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series of books.  I would recommend this series to anyone wanting a good read.  Similiar to 50 shades but I still liked 50 shades better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was the BEST book I have ever read. Thumbs up to Susanne Collins. LOVED all of it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Good characters, sometimes a little too much sex but great!!!! Would definitely recommend this book!~
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Great book. Superbly written.<br />It captures you from the first page and it certainly leaves you wanting more.<br />I can't wait to see how this amazing writer finishes the story.
B007HACDLK|4.0|What's not to like about Mitch Rapp?  Vince Flynn gets this character going and the read I tough to put down.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin have the Bakersfield sound down!  Great guitar and pedal steel. Great old country classics by Merle Haggard and Buck Owens.
B0039N74CW|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and ending up loving it myself, so much so that I bought all of the Shrek movies.
B00C7607BC|5.0|My daughter's favorite all time movie was The Little Mermaid. She wore out the VHS version. Now it's her daughter who is enjoying the DVD version,
B00000G3I2|5.0|I first watched this movie, &#34;The Big Chill when it came out.  I've owned it on VHS and now I thought I'd get the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition from 1983 release date, it is now 2013 so it is the 30th anniversary for me to own this Wonderful Movie.  Love all the parts played by these great actors, especially Glen Close and Kevin Klein, Geff Goldburg is fantastic and Tom Berenger and Mary Kay Place are terrific in their roles. William Hurt, Meg Tilly and Jo Beth Williams were not new to the screen in this movie, but it was a launching point for many of us to follow all of them in their budding careers to follow.  Love it!  One of the best.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Its Blake Shelton, what more needs to be said. Just a great album Its one of my go to albums when you just want to be happy
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|I ordered Feels Like Home by Sheryl Crow the same day Jack Johnson's new CD came out.  Jack was a disappointment, but Sheryl Crow has put together a nice compilation of her music and talents.  I have followed Sheryl Crow for years now and this is as good as she gets.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Ok, I have revised this up one star.  After listening to it about 5 time through now, I can say the music behind her voice is better than I had origionally settled on for my review above.  The truth is Sheryl Crow is talented.  Her voice is a little hi up there when she lets loose.  When she lows down a bit, like on \\"We ought to be drinkin\\" she comes off for me better than her rendition of, \\"Give it to me\\" she almost screeches.  I know the die hard Sheryl Crow fans will have something to say on this, but give me Bonnie. I listen to music for the whole spectrum of the music, lyrics, instrumentation and subject matter and she does bring a lot with the writing and usually she surrounds herself with some really great accompanyment. So may out there to listen to and Sheryl does put it up there to be more than worthwhile in most of her music. One reviewer threw out that she is out of her style in here country delivery, but like Kenny Loggins, you play where you have listeners who appreciate what you have to sell.  So many styles out there are not my cup of tea, but if Sheryl stays country, then I'll listen to here doing country. She still has much to offer.
1451695195|5.0|It was inspiring.  Those who read it will not be able to deny that  God exists. recommend it to all.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It is a awesome book and a great novel  it had all kinds of funny stuff in there really funny
B000PXUA5W|4.0|My son really liked this watch. It's lightweight and somewhat flimsy but it does the job. I would recommend it.
B000UZ4OYS|5.0|Has a great sound to it, like something America would have done if they smoked more and several of the band member left leaving a striped down holistic sound.  Great grove on the acoustic guitar in many of the songs.  This is the first Jose album i've picked up and there will be more.  Excellent find.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is great and I highly recommend it . You can read it quickly to if you try . Really worth a read . It is a bit repetitive and predictable but if you want and set out to enjoy it you will . Please try to read it,it is free on the kindle classics . Well worth the time to read .
B0019Y8G9I|5.0|Ok Willie is getting up there and his voice is starting to show it a little.  Some songs more than others.  For me though the music more than makes up for the minor vocal issue.  This was a great match up in my opinion and would like to see it happen again.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Great movie for folks across all age groups and specially for people who have groen up reading a lot of comics.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|2013-10-03
B004L03B3S|5.0|Perhaps it was my taste for the forbidden and the unorthodox. Perhaps it was the beautiful cinematography, the soundtrack and the director who put it all together. Perhaps it was the sight of two gorgeous actors unknown to me until this film, the tenderness expressed in each of their gestures, looks and smiles when they interacted, their genuine chemistry making me believe I was seeing something real, rather than acted and deep inside, making me wished I had what they had. Perhaps it was a sum of it all. I found myself mesmerized, seduced even, by the movie. I watched it twice and then, kept on going back to slices of it, finding new angles to catch  and keep my interest.<br />I am a woman and straight, but it did not matter, I liked it all the same. I am glad I bought it and recommend it highly, though it is really for the open-minded and unconventional audience.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wasn't too impressed until about 40% of the book.  After that I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Andre Rieu is one of our favourite entertainers. The filming is great, the song choices are excellent and the addition of Anthony Hopkins was the &#34;icing on the cake&#34;<br /><br />Claire Legault and Gerry Wright
B000001FT2|5.0|Grace Jones at her sultry best!  A very upbeat album that gets you going and keeps your foot tapping again and again
B005HSL626|5.0|it is very intertaning and I have got to tell all my friends about this like I said so epic! !!!!<br />LOVE this game
B000005RS0|4.0|Tina Turner gives her all in this memorable album.  The singing is sultry and sexy, and the songs themselves are very catchy.
B00F4IIB36|5.0|Amazingly talented songwriter, singer and pianist.  Enjoy the album, and be sure to go see him whenever he comes to a venue near you.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Great book!  Didn't want it to end.  One of his best I think, very enjoyable.  I looked forward to reading it every night.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works Great, exactly was item was described!  Worth every cent.<br />Easy to use and very user friendly. Makes searching a breeze!<br />THANKS AMAZON!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Is a very entertaining series. we only started watching in season 3 so it was necessary to catch up to current events. We have enjoyed the series very much and look forward to next season
B005DMNS4A|5.0|Pete Townshend said Quadrophenia was the Who's last great recording. It was the end of a golden era that included Tommy, Who's Next and some great live recordings. Love Reign O'er Me is still the most moving song in rock 'n'  roll (See Me Feel Me is a close 2nd). Sound quality is okay for a 40 year old recording. The demos are sonically superior (turn down the volume) and sometimes different enough to be genuinely interesting(including two tunes that didn't make it on to the original record). If you need to replace your vinyl this is the way to go.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had heard so much about 50 Shades! What I hadn't heard is what it was about... I'd got into my head that it was a thriller, being so successful and all. To my surprise, the genre is something I quite enjoy. And besides, the style, mmmmm... Too many words repeated, very simple. Not my cup of tea, really.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the graphics. I'm a cheater, so I use walkthroughs, but I love trying to figure it out on my own as much as I can. Eagerly waiting for more rooms.
0811826848|5.0|I love this book!! I bougth this book in english and in spanish version! There are a beautifull photos in there.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is the best mlp game I have ever played, I mean I can't put it down fun so worth the download
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I like this case very much, I had another one, but the only issue that i had was that the rubber protector was white, it gets dirty fast. All i needed was that part, i search but could not find in commuter series only in defender. I have had for 6 months, its very compact fits in pocket or purse easily. Its also easy to put on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so super easy and totally addicting! I highly recommend this game for players of all ages and skill levels!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This game is exiting and a little tricky because you run out of time to do activities quickly and you get no prior instruction before starting the game. This is a survival game where you try to save the people in the video by doing things like swatting the wasps before they sting and flicking away piranhas before they eat the private parts. Unfortunately, I find the game a little boring after you play it for a while. You may not and I would get the app if I were you even if you only keep it for a little while. The game has a lot of cute characters and you also get to watch the video of dumb ways to die after a while. So really, its a good game and quite fun but a little repetitive. Get it though.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Probably the best best out of all hard to chose from but now more books in the new series can't wait
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thought this season was much better than the 2nd season. I'm Glad that I decided to give the series another chance.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game with my grand children and we all love it. We play this game for hours on end.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Just the actual best film. A true triumph of cinema. It doesn't get any better than this. BUY IT, GODDAMNIT.
B00BOVKYT6|5.0|Clever and original plot. Story telling economical and witty. The characters have been well crafted and are very believable. Good read.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I Bought this app and I'm on it every day. When I installed it on my kindle fire nothing could get me away from the screen. I recommend getting it its worth way more
1469298279|4.0|This is a delightful little book.  Funny if you paid attention to early Star Trek, probably somewhat puzzling if you didn't.  It is, at times, touching, often funny and very clever. I enjoyed it immensely as in laugh out loud while driving. My issue with the recorded version is Wil Wheaton as the reader/narrator. Let's face it, he wasn't/isn't a very nuanced actor and he's not that way as a reader either. It's fun to have him as the voice of the book. The ultimate inside joke. But he pretty much makes all his characters sound the same, especially when excited or angry.  However, this is not some Tolstoy master work. It's a Star Trek parody. So turn off your inner critic, set phasers on fun and go with it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|this dvd l got for my daughter,she loved it.lve already pre-ordered the new version for her highly recommend this dvd for everyone.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|It freezes and you can't use all your games such as candy crush saga.It is not a full Facebook app.
0739319175|4.0|This book is very intense and lives up to his others. The characters portrayed in this book are right on pace for the suspense to unfold as in his other books. I believe Dan Brown is one of the best authors I've red. He alone is responsible for my enjoying reading again. I look forward to his release of the next volume on the Series, which I understand is already in the works.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It worked and did all the things I had hoped it would do, what more can you say about it
B004LWZW24|5.0|I love scary movies, my dad hates them.  So we watched it together, it was fun watching the movie and my dad's face during the movie.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Without giving the story away, let me just say that this isn't a normal Zombie movie.  The movie has little twists and nuances that made it very enjoyable and set it apart from other zombie movie's i've watched. Check it out cause it was entertaining.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is fun and inspirational.  A good introduction to manifesting without too much &#34;woo-woo&#34;.  Well-written and easy to read.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|In this day and age, someone that goes to movies a lot can rarely find the chance to be surprised by a movie.  This movie had the biggest surprises and was so well done with the story.  Even when you think you know what is going to happen, it's something else.  I loved this movie because it surprised the heck out of me.  Definitely worth watching, and so good i'm probably going to own it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I didn't get to finish this in a day like others, but when I did pick this up, I couldn't put it down.<br />I think what I admire the most about this is the sincerity of Charlie. I see a little of myself in Charlie. I love how he takes account of the little things in all his friends & how he wishes nothing but the very best for everyone. Charlie is a very honest, loyal & noble young man.<br />The ending was a little sad, I remember what it was like when high school ended. I look forward to watching the movie & can't wait to compare & contrast.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|Dude..... It's Pantera!!!! What is there not to like about this five CD set? All the songs at a great price, a must have for any Pantera fan!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft but there is some down side like no bots no flint and steal in creative mode but fun cool awesome and crazy
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Good quality sound and video, movies speak for themselves.<br />Having all the movies in a single box is great, plus the inside artwork is a nice touch.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|I enjoy the show however it don't like the fact that it glorifies teenage sex and drinking. I wish the characters were in college instead.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Once again this was a captivating series. Always something to anticipate or look forward to. Very well put together and worth your time to watch.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Great family movie. It was nice sharing a good old family movie with my young children. One two three foe
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love the little town folk and the wonderful episodes.  Makes you want to watch one more episode every time.  And I normally do.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|i buy it for my boyfriend, and he loves it. He use it almost everyday. so i recommend to buy it as a gift to someone
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was the best book I have read<br />Loved it best book EVER loved it u will love it to
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This book was amazing and full of suspense. I can't believe I've never read it,  I love classic books written long ago. They leave you to wonder what was really happening behind the scenes. Now books lay it all out no matter how dirty. The classic leave you to wonder while keeping it clean.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Christina Baker Kline is a wonderful, gifted story teller.  Orphan Train is a real page Turner, difficult to put down.  It's written as though I experienced each character's trials and tribulations myself.  You can't help but get drawn into the lives and trials of the characters.
B00AEFXOWC|5.0|I like the majority of the films Tom Cruise has made but this one is my favorite in both the storyline and his performance.Jamie<br />Foxx also does a nice job with his character.
B00DX88GWU|5.0|I don't normally purchase live albums due to overall quality, this CD was awsome! great guitar sound. overall great quality live recording.
B000FA675C|4.0|A very well made novel the da vinci code.  If you haven't read it yet then what are you waiting for?  Go read it!
1885167776|5.0|I figured out what my one thing is and I'm now focusing on it. The book makes you realize how much time we spend on activities that just don't give you a good return.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|The boys are back!  I have been a fan for over 10 years and they are by far the best band out there.  I don't see any other bands with this type of music.  I enjoyed every single song on this album.  I am glad they are back together and creating wonderful music!
B00C7607BC|5.0|The last copy of this that we had was on VHS tape (remember those?) so this is a great improvement. The graphics are beautiful!
B00F35BV64|5.0|great movie  love sience fiction  good actors  very realistic action movie love space movies<br />hope i will see it again
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Science fiction in the tradition of the greats of the past. Post apocalyptic survival in the distant future. The human spirit lives on!
B001JIDE3M|5.0|i love this guy  he is so funny  great actor and i love the history  by julious verne  watch the first one many times when i was a kid<br />love it even more now  with more tech
B004YOEFG8|3.0|There was a screensaver a while back that had stunning Hubble photos of no less than 20 to 30 different galaxies.  I would estimate 40 minutes of this IMAX footage focuses on the astronauts and only 5 minutes on the photographic results of their repairs.  What they have to say is somewhat interesting but when it comes to outer space, a picture really is worth 1,000 words.
B00F91H666|5.0|very real  --can happen any time more than a movie could it be our future? and brat pit was there
B003KGBIRK|4.0|First let me say that Cronenberg created wonderfully surreal images that no computer has quite duplicated.  I'm not sure he was even attempting to answer any questions but simply to provoke the audience to ask them through the use of shocking and bizarre hallucinations.  The obvious theme is how our behavior might be negatively affected by tv and movies and how powerful people may be manipulating us in ways we cannot detect.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I ordered this CD for my daughter. It arrived as we were told.  She loves it.  I think she will wear it out if that is possible.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|on kindle it says. when you type a word there is no enter button so I don't know what to do
B006AX6ONI|1.0|Mark Cuban may be rich in money but not in writing. Reads like notes, emails, texts, all combined. It is more in the commanding yet covered style...like he is trying to be inspirational by telling us how rich he is.
1401223176|5.0|One of my favorite Batman comics with plenty of classic villains and an introduction of one of my favorites. A nice big story that spans the Batverse.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game. Easy to get wrapped up in it and forget how much time has gone by.
B005LVQA9S|5.0|Loved it.  Great service and speed on getting the book in on time.  This was exactly what I was looking for.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard I have ever used! I'm not the most app savvy... Since I found this keyboard I don't have to search anymore :-)
B004N8CP8K|1.0|I didn't get it to work, and working for a solution to get it to work for me.  That's all.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|Will watch this one again and again. Saw this years ago and glad I could get it here and at such a good price.
B009NX409M|3.0|I love these actors, but the film was slow and not very interesting.  Such an 80's time warp.  Just so-so.
B008Y5OWMK|4.0|That being said, while some scenes definitely are longer than they should be, I liked this film and would like to say that I love it.  I come close to that.  The story that centers around the Johnson County wars is too small for the running time, but it's beautifully photographed and easy to see where the money was spent.  The film was originally released with an intermission and my older DVD includes the intermission.  This cut, supervised by Michael Cimino from what I understand, deletes the intermission.  I think the film is better served with it whether or not you're watching it in a theater or home.  Very good performances; too slow for some; too long for others; but it's a very good film and, if you're not the type of person with a short attention span, you owe it yourself to see this movie.  The Criterion Blu Ray is gorgeous.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I think writer Steven Hyden put it best when he said that, \\"debut album is nearly perfect indie rock -- so perfect that there's hardly anything \\"indie\\" about it.\\"  This album, IMO, has the accessibility to all audiences hearing classic rock influences, R&B, pop-rock and much more.<br /><br />What's impressive in this regard is that such differences flow from song to song with good examples being the transition from \\"Forever\\" to \\"The Wire\\", Song's like \\"Honey & I\\".  The attitudes displayed in this work are quite diverse but cohesive at the same time.  Truly a brilliant piece that I feel most anyone can find and least something they like about it (though it is extremely difficult not to like all of it)
B007URVZJ6|4.0|My only critique of the book, at all, is that in parts the book is unfocused. It contains the necessary information, but not always as plainly stated as it could.
1933308087|5.0|It breaks down the block into halves or quarters to make it easier to understand. Variety of photos, color suggestions.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Mermaids,John Candy,Tom Hanks,and of course Daryl Hannah as the mermaid. My 11 year olds love it! An all ages treat!
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Turned it off after about 30 mins of watching.  Thought I'd watch something that wasn't so gruesome.  My advice to the director/producer would be to add some humor during the stressful scenes.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Well written. You can almost hear James saying it. Chronicles the beginning of a friendship that will last forever. I don't think either one would be able to be without the other. No silver spoon, no sugar coating. They survive because that are two beings with a connected soul.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The most heartbreaking but beautiful story I have ever read. To know this really happened to so many children is overwhelming and hard to release from your mind and heart. I have recounted this story to many many friends and family. Everyone should read this book. Phyllis
1451695195|5.0|I read this book after my moms sudden death and, wow, what an incredible story!! This doctor was a skeptic, especially since so many of his patients reported their near death experiences to him. When he got sick, his remarkable experience began and he miraculously recovered to tell his story. I recommend this book for believers & non-believers! I tell all of my friends to read this book and about the peace it brought to me after my moms death.<br />This man is a reputable neurosurgeon who wrote about his incredible experience, despite possible criticism from other medical professionals. He risked his reputation and his story is one that is rare & unique.<br />A definite 5 stars!!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell makes you feel like your right there with him.  What he and his fellow soldiers endured (and sacrificed) for love of their country is sobering.
080419257X|5.0|Great look at Jesus as a man in terms of history, not as a religious figure, looking at history, the bible, and other sources
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I enjoyed the story line and like other review it was too short.  It would have been nice to learn more about her before she got caught.
1465408681|5.0|Great book, in great condition, my son loves it and likes to share it with his Star Wars enthusiasts friends!
B00AR83PN4|1.0|The cube are too close in colors so the confusion in matching them causes you to lose the game easily.
B00AUA67GQ|1.0|I didn't see the Kindle part so it didn't work on my tablet - at least it was free. Found another app.
