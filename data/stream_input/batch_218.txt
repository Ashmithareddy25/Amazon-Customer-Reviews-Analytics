B0000025HG|5.0|Barbra has wowed us all with her performances for years now. &quot;Wet&quot; is possibly one of her best albums to date. She has a voice and a style that is timeless. Every song in this collection is awsome. The only exception, I would say, would be &quot;Splish Splash&quot;. The song doesn't fit her voice or style. No one could fault this album just for the one song,though. The other songs, with the exception of the hot duet with Donna Summer, Enough Is Enough, are beautiful ballads that Ms Streisand performs stunningly. My personal high points of the Cd are &quot;Come Rain Or Come Shine&quot; and &quot;Niagara&quot;.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I don't have much to say about this cd because it is VERY good. I just really like this album. I've heard singles from Incubus's last cd (&quot;Drive&quot; - need I say more?) There was also a lot of hype over this cd when it first came out. Or, who knows, maybe it was the cover, but I bought this cd and, a couple months later, its still in my cd player. This is just an awesome cd full of balance and music. There's the amazing opener, &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, and lots more variety - hard(&quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever&quot;, &quot;Blood On the Ground&quot;) the softer, almost relaxing ones(&quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot; &quot;Mexico&quot; &quot;11 AM&quot; &quot;Warning&quot;) and some pretty weird ones(but still awesome - &quot;Are You In&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;) <BR>All in all, GREAT CD. IF YOU ARE/HAVE EVER BEEN REMOTELY INTERESTED IN &quot;ROCK,&quot; BUY THIS CD! It offers a lot of what the genre is made of.
B000002KB8|4.0|I think Scott Ian from the speed metal band Anthrax said it best during an interview he did for VH1: \\"There was nobody like Black Sabbath.\\"  It was a very true statement.  When Black Sabbath's self-titled 1970 debut was released, nobody in the music world expected it to go anywhere.  Of course, how wrong they were.  Sabbath's debut was certainly one of the most original and daring hard rock albums to come out in the genre's short history.  The only other two bands playing that loud and ferociously were The Who (the godfathers of hard rock) and Led Zeppelin (hard rock's torchbearers).  What set Sabbath apart were their horror movie influences, dark, fuzzy guitar riffs, and moody rhythm section.  It's been over a year this March since I own this album, so I thought it was about time I write a review for it.<br />The band's signature song \\"Black Sabbath\\" opens the record with sound effects of thunder, rain, and chiming church bells before Tony Iommi's spooky guitar riff scares the daylights out of you.  This is a great, haunting 6-minute tune about going to Hell.  Ozzy Osbourne's whiny wail makes the lyrics all the more devastating.  I can understand why many say that this was the start of heavy metal, but it was only for this opening track.  The rest of the album sounds more like bluesy hard rock than metal.  But it's still good.<br />\\"The Wizard\\" is a lightning-fast blues number where Bill Ward shines on the drum kit.  Great harmonica playing by Ozzy as well (I didn't even know he could play harmonica!).  The 9-minute medley of \\"Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B.\\" is the album's highlight.  It starts off with the slow and grinding \\"Wasp,\\" which leads right into the similar-sounding \\"...Wall of Sleep.\\"  Geezer Butler's bass solo \\"Bassically\\" follows and is a segue for one of the band's most popular live songs, \\"N.I.B.\\"  Awesome.  \\"Wicked World\\" is yet another blues song, but it's groovier and you can actually dance to it.  Great riff, too.<br />Despite all this greatness, there are two reasons why I took 1 star off the rating.  1) The sound quality is bad.  This was mainly due to the extremely low budget ($900), but if they were able to use groundbreaking sound effects for \\"BS,\\" I think they could've produced the record a little bit better, don't you think?  2) The closing 14-minute medley \\"Warning\\" is just too long.  It showcases Tony Iommi as a talented guitar player, but most of the time it's just him and not the band.  Plus, it's mostly blues and little else.  If they added other influences and picked up the tempos, then this jam wouldn't sound as boring as it does.<br />Although I don't listen to BLACK SABBATH as much as I used to because of those flaws, it's still an important album in classic rock & roll and is worthy enough to be in anybody's record collection.
B00005V9IL|2.0|This disc is not Anamorphic widescreen and it is missing DD 5.1 sound, it has only French 2 channel and English two channel sound.<br />This disc , not the Movie is a major disappointment.<br />I thought they were finally releasing this movie in an Anamorphic widescreen format.
6304401132|5.0|In an age when Disney has become a cultural icon with little or no equal, it's nice to look back at the movies that gave the company its distinction, and Sleeping Beauty is the perfect example.  Walt Disney wanted the movie to look like a moving illustration, and he achieved everything he set out to do.  Six years were spent giving the movie its superb animation, score, and storyline.  Of course, everyone is familiar with the story of Sleeping Beauty, but, as with all of its great movies, Disney takes the original storyline and simply makes it better.  After seeing the Disney version of this classic tale, anyone would be glad to forget all of the other versions.  This movie was so special to Walt that, as he was designing Walt Disney World while the film was being made, he chose the Sleeping Beauty Castle to be the official symbol of Walt Disney World and of the entire Disney corporation.  In my opinion, at least, this movie evokes the same feeling of distinction in everyone who sees it!
B0000070QS|5.0|Morten Harket's voice is one of music's most distinctive. Most people thought A-ha fell off the planet after their second album Scoundrel Days, but they didn't - only in North America. After three more albums (two of which were awesome) the band took a \\"break\\". Each member did their own thing, with Harket putting out a few albums in Norwegian before releasing this masterpiece.<BR>It is more mature fare than the catchy pop music from the early years but his voice remains the same - AMAZING. After listening to this album and some of Pal Waaktaar-Savoy's other work with Savoy, you can see where a-ha amazing comeback album Minor Earth, Major Sky came from! This album is a must for any a-ha fan!!!
B00005JKG9|5.0|If you want to take a look at the darker side of selling, there is no better movie.  Forget Glengarry clones like \\"Boiler Room\\", this is the one.  Wonderful!
B000002HMH|2.0|this isn't my metallica. metallica have turned into tired old men looking for something different to play for money. sure there are a few catchy hard rock songs on the album but i don't really think its worth buying. master of puppets is ten times better than this, don't get me wrong i don't hate metallica because they went in a softer direction with the music but i hate what they turned into. its pretty obvious that they completely abandoned their roots and turned radio friendly to become more popular. i would have rather seen them retire after the black album.
B000002UAI|4.0|This album, even with the originals, shows the Beatles's early influnces. I think they all did a great job, even if they were rushed. Some truly great gems here. I think it's a little weird that John Lennon was a millionaire, had women chasing him, and wrote \\"Im A Loser.\\" Also, the medley just rocks. Very bluesy. I also like \\"8 Days A Week\\" and the classic \\"Honey Don't.\\" I seem to like any Beatles song with Ringo singing. \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" is a nice ballad, yet I have to cringe when John yells out ...[\\"MISTER MOONLIGHT...!\\"] in an untuned fashion... The rest of the song's cool, though. Every song's a keeper. Very nice work.
0684847248|4.0|This book caught my attention because somehow I cross upon some people reading it, or mentioning it in delight.  So I finally bought myself one.<BR>Indeed, it's a very good book.  It shows how we can see things differently.  Too many 'acceptable', expected norms in our lives are actually destroying our minds and souls.  Only if we have the courage to defy them.  Hence the LESS TRAVELED.<BR>And it explains why certain many things do not meet the eyes.. how our very subconscious manifest itself, sometimes against our conscious, in many ways.<BR>If you're looking for something to help you get a fresh, great outlook in life, consider this book.  I'm glad I did.  It sure enrich my mind.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's second CD (his first being put out pretty much by himself) is awesome.  His vocals are astounding and his guitar playing is great.  However this CD does not do him justice, his live perfomances are 100 times better and have tons more energy than &quot;Room for Squares&quot; if one can imagine that.  I'm not saying Room for Squares lacks anything because it doesn't, in fact every song is great, well written and beautifully done.  Special props to &quot;Love song for no one&quot; a song that many of us who feel lost in regards to love can relate to and &quot;Your body is a wonderland&quot; a sensous love song.  &quot;83&quot; is a song that brings back childhood memories.  I would also like to say Ricky Wright is way of on this one- I usually agree with a lot of his reviews but I think he doesn't give enough credit to Mayer.  If fans like mayer check out others like Jack Johnson, Willy Porter, Nick Drake, G Love, Howie Day, Jeff Buckley, Peter Yorn and Norah Jones.  He is nothing short of awesome.  Can't wait to see what else he does in the future.
0374384576|5.0|The Witches is a book that deals with how you can tell whether a lady is a witch or not.  In the story, a little boy is told by his grandma about how to watch out for witches.  She would tell him stories about what witches have done to other kids to frighten him.  The boy ends up coming face to face with the grand high witch herself.  <br />One character that stands out in my mind is the little boys grandma.  She stayed calm after finding out that her grandson was turned into a mouse.  I think that the author wrote this book really well because he added so much detail to everything he wrote.  Also the book kept me reading and it had a good ending, which wou will have to find out for yourself.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Can't sum up this soundtrack in 1000 words.  it is just amazing.  From each song you have the feeling of being there and being a part of this grassroots/bluegrass/country music.  Classics on this have to be &quot;Down to the river to pray&quot; and &quot;Didn't leave nobody but the babe&quot;  Great cover of &quot;you are my sunshine&quot; and i like the different takes of &quot;man of constant sorrow&quot;  All the songs are great, even for those not intrested in this type of music it really has a gopel/homey/blues/soul feel to it.  It's a cd for everyone
B00000ADG2|5.0|She is one of the most talented people in the world. If you can sing, rap, produce, write, composed and do anything to songs, then you are a true musician. That is Lauryn Hill. She can basically do anything with music. After the Fugees helping her to write songs and so, she went solo with her first album given quite a descriptive title: The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill. Well at least you don't have to go to school for this album, because there's a class on the album, after some of the songs. Lauryn Hill's music and the Fugees have also rapped and sung about things that are happening and reality. Lauryn sings about Zion her son, she talks about ghetto youth in: Doo Wop (That Thing) and in Everything Is Everything. She also has some love songs like Ex-Factor, I Used To Love Him, Nothing Even Matters. She raps about someone losing some and keeping your eyes on the Final Hour! She talks about the past in: Every Ghetto, Every City. And so that you feel like you at school, she's added in some Interludes and an Intro about school, and most of the time the class is talking about Love? I like all the album tracks, but I think the best album track is the main title: The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill which talks about her reality and what people always sometimes forger about her. Her singles for the album were chosen in a nice order starting off with some mixture of 60's and 90's with: Doo Wop (That Thing), going into a sort of ballad: Ex-Factor and then Spanish with: To Zion which Carlos Santana plays the guitar in and finally ending in Everything Is Everything for reality check. The collerbrations for the album are also nice R&amp;B artists like Mary J. Blige and D'Angelo and guest apperance by Jamaician artist Shelley Thunder is also really good. If you loved the Fugees, Wyclef Jean and Pras then you're surely going to love Lauryn Hill.
B000002MP2|5.0|Besides the Ramones and the Sex Pistols these guys where the new revolution for Punk in the mid 90's.  Started with them and we now wind up with bands such as Blink 182, A New Found Glory, No Use for a Name, Impossibles, Saves the Day, Good Riddance, etc (could go on forever)  Green Day puts out the classic punk album, every song should be savored and kept, also look for the funny addition at the end of the last track for the \\"all by myself\\" song.  Basket Case, Longview, When I come around - these songs are well known in the punk world.  Throw in burnout, welcome to paradise, she, and in the end and you get a whole lot that not even Green Day's new greatest hits can give you
0767903862|4.0|Brilliant, with all the usual wit....
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd's music is such a chill and laid back type of music.  The band which consists of David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Richard Wright and Roger Waters (who wrote the songs) were visionaries in their time.  Written when music was really music back in 72 and 73 every single song on this CD is a classic.  One of the best albums of all time.  My fav moment is when Dick Parry breaks into his sax solo in \\"Us and Them.\\"  You will find almost every one of these songs on Floyd's new greatest hits that was released however all real Floyd fans will and should own this masterpiece.
B000002C4J|5.0|This is one of my favorite Celine Dion's albums. I never regret buying it.
B000000WA4|5.0|Reading some of the awful reviews this album got, I was astounded. First of all, if you think Billy Corgan's voice is annoying, you shouldn't be listening to the Pumpkins at ALL. And secondly, this is a remarkable collection of incredible music. I've owned this CD for 7 years, and I'm going to need a new copy soon. It's wearing out.<br />People say Billy, who's currently in his 30s, shouldn't be writing angst music for teens. But he was only about 25 when he wrote Mellon Collie, young enough to still understand teenage depression. He connects with everything so well, and he is a brilliant, brilliant lyricist.<br />If you haven't heard the Pumpkins, though, download some of their stuff before you shell out [money], because Billy's voice is quite a matter of opinion. I, for one, adore it, but some people find it rather annoying.<br />High points on MCIS: Tonight Tonight, Zero, Muzzle, Thru The Eyes of Ruby, Stumbleine, etc. But it's all so good.
0345413377|5.0|I intentionally avoided reading too many reviews or articles on the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series because I really wanted to go into it fresh.  I had vague notions that it was a \\"children's'\\" story and that religion was in some way involved.  In retrospect, both of those notions were correct, but not nearly in the way that I expected.  The series was nothing like I had anticipated, but was so good that I stopped thinking about these differences in perception before I had finished reading the first chapter of the first book.<br />It is a child's story in that most of the main characters are children.  And while I feel that mature children can enjoy it, it sure isn't \\"Harry Potter\\".  (Disclaimer:  I have read and loved all four \\"Harry Potter\\" books and will read the next three as soon as they are published.)  And, it is about religion, but it sure isn't the New Testament.  In that sense, it also requires a mature reader to appreciate these books, as organized religion is not given a particularly happy face.  <br />There are other surprises.  Early on, the reader knows that the ubiquitous fight between ultimate good and ultimate evil is coming and it's going to be another big one, of Biblical proportions.  But the final denouement is so subtle, you have to go back and reread a few pages to be sure you didn't miss it.  Several other major plot crises are settled with this same air of subtlety.  I regard this phenomenon as one of the series' major strengths and feel that Philip Pullman is a literary genius to have pulled it off so consistently.<br />I wish I knew more of the history of the world's religions; I know I missed dozens of allusions that may have enhanced my understanding of some of the finer points of the story.  But even at that, there is much to enjoy in these books.  The characters of Lyra and Will were expertly drawn.  I'll try not to give away too much about the ending, but it had me, a grown, rather obese adult man, as misty-eyed as I've been in a while.(And it was a relatively happy ending!)  Other characters, such as Mrs. Coulter and Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear, were also vivid, complex, and interesting.  As in the works of George R. R. Martin, the good guys are not always totally good and the bad guys not always totally bad.  As in real life, shades of gray abound.   And the worlds Mr. Pullman created for this story are often fantastic, but not so much that they get in the way of the story.  Along these lines, the different races he invents, such as the Gyptians, the armored bears, and the mulefa are well developed enough that their traits both make sense and add to the story.  <br />I won't give away any more of the story so other readers can be as surprised as I was with these books.  I will say that this is the best fantasy series I have read so far this year and will let you find the rest out for yourselves.
B000056N8X|1.0|I didnt feel this movie was good at all, in fact i felt it was a huge dissapointment.  I reccomend even if you are a highlander fan rent it first.  See it for yourself,  then decide on it.  I disliked this highlander the most.  the first was great and the rest seemed to go downhill.  This one was wrock bottom.  But dont take my word for it, rent it and see for yourself
B00003CXRM|5.0|The Coen Brother's O Brother, Where Art Thou? is based on Homer's Odyssey and the film is a magical journey through 1930's Mississippi.  The film centers on three escaped convicts who are trying to get to $... that Everett has stashed away at his home before it gets flooded out for a new hydropower network that's being set up.  The three cons are hilariously played by George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson and John Tuturro.  Mr. Clooney in particular shines as Everett.  He fashions himself as an intellectual and his crazed obsession with his hair is hysterical.  Everywhere he goes he must have Dapper Dan pomade and hairnets.  Along the way on their journey, they met a man who sold his soul to the devil in order to play a mean guitar,  cut a record as The Soggy Bottom Boys that, unbeknownst to them becomes a big hit, met three sirens who seduce them, met a crooked bible salesman (played with hilarious gusto by John Goodman) and cross paths with the governor (Charles Durning).  In the end Everett is really looking to stop his wife (Holly Hunter) from remarrying.  The film strings together all of its twists and turns brilliantly.  The acting is first rate, the cinematography adds a brownish hue reminiscent of photographs from the era and of course, the soundtrack has recently won a Grammy as Album of the Year.  All in all, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a first rate film.
B00004Z459|5.0|I don't believe i have heard a music cd that accurately describes the youth of today, until i heard this one. If you look past the facial peircings and tattoos and listen to the underlying messages of truth and undying passion...you will truly understand where this generation is going. They (we) may not take the same route as our parents or teachers, but this generation has more faith, love, courage, sympathy, forgiveness, understanding, passion, loyalty, strength, and perserverance than any other generation before. Wake up world....she's changing.
0446608955|4.0|This book was a very easy read. I enjoyed the way the author made us feel exactly how the characters felt. He really got me under their skins. So much so that I litterally had to put the book down a few times to get a hold of myself. <br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good cry.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I didn't  buy the DVD, but I did see the movie.  All I can say is Ben Stiller... no.   This movie wasn't funny.  Just plain [not all there], and well just horrible.   You would've had the biggest laugh if all you saw were previews.  There was nothing else.  It was just a horrible movie.  Don't waste your money on this piece of [stuff].  I didn't crack a smile.  It just wasn't funny, not a good plot, dumb characters, and Derek Zoolander is just annoying as a character.  Ben Stiller overdid the jokes.  Be good to yourself and get a different movie.
0790729628|4.0|This has got to be one of the best SciFi movies of all time.  But what makes it so good?!  My opinion is that Harrison Ford makes it so good.  He is 100% in character in Blade Runner as a tough but reluctant replicant hunter.<br />Another thing I like is the way you can almost feel sorry for the replicants.  They didn't have a choice in their fate and they seem to have a legitimate reason for the havoc they are creating.  The end of the fight scene between H. Ford and R. Hauer (when the replicant dies) always chokes me up.<br />I could go on for a long time on this one... but the bottom line is:<br />Blade Runner has set the mark by which all other SciFi films will be judged for a long time.
B00003CXXI|1.0|...of everything that's wrong with the film industry of America today.<br />In writing this review, the question I'd like to ask everyone who has given this film such a high rating is simply, WHY??  What is so special about this VASTLY overrated piece of garbage that's been hailed by so many critics and moviegoers alike as being unique, clever, a masterpiece, and so on?<br />Like so many other curious film buffs out there, I wasn't even interested in seeing \\"Shrek\\" when it came out in theaters, but after hearing so many great things about it from so many people, I finally decided to go ahead and give it a look when it came out on video.  Just for the record, I didn't spend any money on it, but some of my friends had rented it and I decided that I'd give it a try and find out what all the fuss was about.<br />And now, after having seen \\"Shrek\\", I still don't know what all the fuss was about!  What you have here, is an ogre that speaks with an annoying Scottish accent supplied by, the usually likeable, Mike Myers, an annoying donkey sidekick given voice by the even more annoying Eddie Murphy, a stuck-up airhead of a princess personified by the equally stuck-up airhead Cameron Diaz, and a whiny little wiener of a Lord voiced by the somewhat talented John Lithgow.<br />The PG rating awarded to \\"Shrek\\" is just as much of a joke as the movie itself is, with there being no small amount of farting/belching cracks and crude humor spread throughout the film, foul words a plenty, and enough not-so-subtle suggestive references to make even the most liberal of grandmothers blush.  \\"Shrek\\" even has the nerve to try and rob children of their imaginations and love for classic fairytales as the movie continuously portrays timeless and wonderful characters like Snow White and Cinderella (the two Princesses, at one point, get into an argument which leads to a fist fight!), among others, as being nothing more than sleezy, snobbish burdens on society!<br />And now, as is the current trend of major motion picture studios to crank out rather unremarkable run-of-the-mill sequels to their animated films (I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Di$ney releases \\"Snow White and the EIGHT Dwarves\\"), I hear there's going to be a \\"Shrek 2\\", and I imagine all the same mindless, shallow, superficial critics and moviegoers who helped make the first such an undeserved success will do the same for its follow-up as well!<br />That's really just about all I have to say regarding the movie \\"Shrek\\".  I've already wasted more time on it in writing this review than it's worth.<br />Thank you.
B00005YTFG|2.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie in the theater but this VHS edition is not nearly as good.  The big screen version had me thinking that this would be my new favorite musical to watch again and again.  The special effects-- the cutting in and out, flashing lights and images, etc... made it impossible to follow the story and feel the emotions of the characters.  I was quite shocked when other renters of the video said that they didn't get into it.  Now I know why.   I am very disappointed with this version.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This is another Kubrick movie that I have changed my mind about over the years.  I found it too slow and dull when I saw it on release.  But now, with time and perspective, and with the luxury of DVD & home theatre I find it a beautiful and satisfying experience.<br /><br />First, of course, is its gorgeous look which won deserved Oscars for the Cinematographer & others.  It is fanatically correct as to the period look & details.  Much of the photography resembles the great paintings of English life in the 18th Century and the look & manner of everything has a complete authenticity.  The story of Kubrick making his own cameras & lenses to photograph candlelit scenes naturally is well known.  But it remains impressive, being the first and best approximation of what life must have looked like and been lived prior to electricity.<br /><br />Next the pace.  It is slow.  Actually, today I would say it is stately, matching the slow rhythms of the minuet and the accompanying music.  I believe Kubrick intended to take us back to a time before speed, before haste, before life ruled by the nano second.  People moved slowly, travel was slow, battles were fought in slow movements.  The speed of life was bracketed by the footstep and the horse's gallop.  There was no way or reason to move faster.  Perhaps this is a failing in a modern motion picture, but it was a courageous and daring decision to pace your film to these unhurried beats.<br /><br />The performances are fine.  They are strict in manner, formal, and precisely politely constrained to superficiality and rigidly controlled emotion.  Barry undoes all his work at attempting to break into fine society when he lets loose an unbridled rage and attacks his stepson.  It simply isn't done, dear boy.<br /><br />That the voice-over narration is wry and offers often acidly arch observations of the story and characters is Kubrickian and certainly welcome.<br /><br />So, this story of a rake's progress in attempting to climb and break into the world of aristocratic privelege and power has much to offer.  It certainly has an undeniable grandeur in its composition and  look and it does offer us as good a glimpse into what life in the long ago past might have been like as any movie is likely to achieve.<br /><br />I once, by happenstance,  had a long conversation with Leon Vitali (Lord Bullingdon) on an Air India flight to London, discussing why Barry Lyndon didn't do well in America while it was a huge hit in Europe.  It boiled down to length, slowness & no Intermission.  Well, Leon, I was full of it!  It's a great film.<br /><br />As I said at the outset, I have changed my mind about this film and now I give it 5 stars.  With some patience, it is a worthwhile journey.  But, if you're in a hurry, give it a pass.
B00003CXXP|5.0|...to create a beautiful, horrific vision of the future in 'A.I. Artifical Intelligence.' From the impeccable, letter-perfect opening and closing narrations by Ben Kingsley to the plasticine sexiness of Jude Law's \\"lover\\" robot, Joe, and even William Hurt's compassion as a mad scientist/father figure, 'A.I.' stays in mind as a study in the combination of two the most brilliantly diverse directors to ever work in (or outside) the Hollywood system. The simple plot: Haley-Joel Osment stars as David, the first A.I. \\"boy\\" programmed to--get this--actually love, and the typically cliche quest: Once rejected, David goes on a journey to become a \\"real\\" boy--are, in actuality, deceivingly complicated. While the basics are set up like bowling pins(the assumption being that Spielberg will just knock 'em down), the execution is more like a couple of 7/10 splits and a spare. Spielberg manages to throw suprising curveballs around each corner; unexpectedly humourous moments tossed with a bizarre futurevison that even David Cronenberg would smile at. The studied, impressive performances from Osment, Law and Frances O'Connor as David's human mother, play great with the cool, atmospheric grays and tacky neon of a future America that is undoubtedly Kubrick yet accessibly Spielberg. While it's not surprising to discover that 'A.I.' is, at times, a modernistic 'E.T,' there are enough shades of '2001' and even 'Eyes Wide Shut' to create a stunning, highly absorbing, modern classic.

6303477259|5.0|This is my favoite video -- I was hoping to premire my new home theater with Pulse as a DVD!  Will it ever come out in DVD format?
B000002KE2|5.0|In retrospect, it is now apparent that Black Sabbath quite literally created an entire musical genre. In my opinion, Volume 4--along with their subsequent release, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath-- mark the pinnacle of the band's career. <br />After five years of music school and another decade of playing much jazz and rock, I find myself coming back to the music that got me excited about playing the guitar in the first place. Volume 4 features Sabbath's strongest performances and writing.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes is the dream compilation I have been waiting decades for. All the more impressive, given how difficult it is to package such a concept band whose best works are often lengthy and thematic. But Echoes masterfully and gracefully combines eras, singles, and longer theme pieces. The happiest thing about this collection is not what was left out from Pink Floyds classic works, but what IS included from their less satisfying, more recent output. Uneven almost-rans such as The Division Bell and A Momentary Lapse of Reason never get played anymore, by me. But in the context of this compilation and their greater works, the best pieces from those albums get new lifeand a grateful, pleasurable new hearing. Same goes for some of their earliest work included on this set.<br />Fans and purists can be so persnickety. Really! Such crumudgeons! I dont know what all the grudging fuss is all about. Four stars? I give this collection SEVEN STARS. For my money, the inspired artwork (an incredible overview of references to their legendary Hipgnosis album covers over three decades) and generous packaging (including all the lyrics and a lot of photos)  these alone are worth at least half the cost of this album. It does, however, make me wistful for the larger canvass of the old LPswhat a breathtaking souvenir this package would have been in THAT format (I see that this collection is available through Amazon.com on LP, though at almost twice the price, and with the lesser sound quality of that format.)<br />Im as pure a Floyd fan as the best of em, with more than a few gray hairs in my long hair to prove it. Pink Floyd has always been one of my top ten bands and, like Dark Side of the Moon and its record-breaking run on Billboard, has remained there for more than thirty years, since my first copy of A Saucerful of Secrets in junior high. (My dad said of the cover that it looked like someone had thrown up all over it) But as with so many bands, their middle period was clearly their best work. I stopped buying Pink Floyd albums (in disgust) when each new album was just another reshuffled LIVE or greatest hits package.  But now theyve finally done it: A completely satisfying overview drawn from most of their best work. Lets be honesttheres no such thing as the definitive anything, so why dont we just set that stupid measure aside. The fact is, the much-complained about more obscure works left off this collection are better off (as you yourselves have said) heard in their entirity. So buy Obscured by Clouds, Ummagumma and shut up already. Adding a third disk, and a third-again of the price, would cost a third of the potential buying audience for this compilation, which would be a pity.
B0000033P0|5.0|If Tarkus had been written by a Western Art Music composer, it would have been recognized for the complex atonal arrhtymical masterpiece that it is.<br />For most Rock listeners and critics, however, this album asked simply too much from them.  It is a complex work, full of invention and shifting horizons, far more complex and coherent than even the most celebrated rock albums previously called complex.<br />Is this good music?  Good question.  I love it, but I could well understand how people might be put off of Tarkus, given its harsh edges, mish-mash of styles, and long playing time. Still, it is an important album in Prog rock, and ups the ante for all others in the genre, and no other band has yet come close to this, then or now.<br />As synthfool, Proghead, ELP fan, I would love to see a new recording of this album, since frankly, the original sound is flat and sometimes muddy.<br />If you don't like Progressive rock, stay away!
6305013578|1.0|This is one of the worst reproductions of this fine movie that I have ever seen.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I was lucky enough to have seen this movie without any prior knowledge as to what it is about. My opinion is the less you know about this film the more enjoyable it is in solving the riddles. So if you haven't seen it stop reading this review and go watch the movie.<BR>The movies main theme consist of perceptions vs. reality and how the two only briefly come into contact with one another. Our protagonist Lenny, played excellently by Guy Pierce, has a peculiar memory lose condition, and we are forced to relate to his inability (and unwillingness) to face what he already subconsciously knows.  But we don't know that at the time and neither does he. Confusing, I know.<BR>In order to give the viewer a sense of Lenny's (he hates it when you call him that) confusion over his memory condition the film is played backwards so that in each scene we are confronted with no memory of the preceding events, left only with clues that must be put together.<BR>We journey with Lenny the investigator and try to put the pieces together but he ultimately leaves out a key element: his own motives for not wanting to know the truth. The reason for this is that  Lenny instinctively knows that even a terrible purpose is better than no purpose at all, and should he solve the mystery he will be left as a mindless mental patient.<BR>Basically Lenny, with the help of &quot;Teddy&quot;, are building a mystery using the truth as model for their deceptions.<BR>The black and white scenes give the movie a truly nice touch that threw cleverly threw me off the scent.<BR>The DVD also has an excellent bonus, the original short story that the movie was based on. A must for all fans of this classic movie.
B00004Z459|5.0|This has got to be the best Music available on one CD, its incredible! Each song has its own tempo, rythem, and feeling.<br />&quot;In The End&quot;, &quot;Crawling, and &quot;Papercut&quot; are three of my favorite songs of all time. Then they add &quot;One Step Closer&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot; to back up these incredible songs. Definately a must-buy! Linkin Park is the hottest band in the world!
6305313687|2.0|...certainly made this film interesting to watch. Every other actor and actress in this film were truly deplorable. <BR>As far as the story goes, it's difficult to say. Vineyard (Norton) gives some good and convincing arguments but then the contrived Hollywood universe converts his views into the reason why his life is difficult. His pointing out of the evils of the world are, in fact, the causes for those evils. It's as if act of pointing out Emporor is naked is the cause for his insanity. Just stay quiet and all will be well, is that it? Then, as if by magic, point he was making was suddenly void and null because Mr. Two Ph.D. African American and Mr. Funny black prisoner are \\"nice guys\\", while every white nationalist in the film is portrayed as either irrationally violent, stupid, confused and/or evil. (with the exception of the Jewish teacher who, of course, is supposed to be just another innocent, caring, sensitive human being)<BR>The film was entertaining and probably worth owning but it's not something that helps uncover the truth about race relations and obviously, with it's preachy overtone, that's what it was meant to do.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a wonderful novel about two siblings named Scout and Jem Finch.

B000002U94|5.0|This is one of 2 Seger LPs I owned as a kid, and hummed and hawed for the past four years considering purchasing the CD.  I was awaiting a restored and remastered version (what's the deal with that not occurring?).  I finally broke down and was pleasnatly reminded about what I love about the CD and more, too.<br />What I especially love is the arrangements.  Listen with headphones for the the organ and the horns especially in the mix.  I never needed to hear &quot;Old Time R &amp; R&quot; again until I started to follow Alto Reed's playing deep in the mix.  Only &quot;Fire Lake&quot; has an obnoxiously peppy crowd noise throughout.

B000002P5W|5.0|I bought this album as a mono LP in 1968. I was instantly mesmerised by it, the whole album a 'sound picture' and to me, more than the sum of its individual tracks. A visionary, poetic piece but with plenty of rhythm, gunshot drumming and layers of guitar sounds echoing throughout. Other reviewers have discussed individual tracks but to me it is the album as a whole that is the masterpiece. I recently bought the CD which is well recorded but I was disappointed to find that my favourite track, One Rainy Wish, does not have the echoey, reverbing guitar presence of the mono LP mix which gave the track its beauty. I noticed recently that the mono mix is available on 180gm vinyl. I would recomment that to anyone with a record deck.
0060392886|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!!! Even if your not a CRUE fan, you will enjoy it.  The stories are mind blowing, and to think they got through all of it!  This book proves, even more so, how determined they were.  These guys are real bad ...they ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ---Meg
B00003CXXP|4.0|With most Stanley Kubrick movies, you'll either love it or hate it. A.I. is no exception.<br />A.I. was the pet project of the late Stanley Kubrick, who in fact never got a chance to direct this movie. Instead, his friend, director Steven Spielberg, reconstructed the late director 's notes and created a movie very true to Kubrick's original vision.<br />A.I. is essentially an updated version of Pinocchio. The story is set in the near distant future in a Blade Runner type world. Humans have created life-like robots to assist them in their daily work and leisure activities. <br />Haley Joel Osmont plays the part of \\"David\\", a robot constructed as a loving child to the fill the void left by a couple's comatose son. However, David is unable to please his real parents and is eventually banished. The story is his journey in discovering who and what he really is. In the end, the film requires us to reflect on society's responsibility in creating artificially intelligent beings who have feelings too. Do we accept these artificial beings as equals or do we treat them as throw away appliances?<br />Again, you'll either love or hate this movie. It's very slow paced at times. However, it requires the viewer to think. Something that most movies today fail to do.<br />This film also features a wonderful soundtrack by John Williams.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|What a great movie this is. You wouldn't regret buying it. It is about two robbers,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid who always rob trains. You'll think that it is a bad choice to buy this show by just knowing that they are robbers.But you are wrong. On the contrary,you'll find it hilarious. I'll go on with the story. Butch is all brains whereas Kid is skilful with guns.<br />They are the topmost wanted men. And once they were nearly hunted down. They were lucky to escape. Many things happen before this... I love this show and I bet you'll love it too.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I love Rammstein music.This DVD blew my mind the first time I played it on my DVD player.I cant say anything else.This brilliant DVD has the most powerful sound I've never heard.It's like being on a live show.perfect image quality with the best 5.1 sound of the market<BR>It's a must.Go for it
B0000251VS|2.0|this is my least favourite maiden album,and luckily,the band soon changed vocalist.none of the tracks are stunning,and it is an anti-climax after such a good debut album.i like the cover art though!
B00000DFSK|5.0|Two words: absolute perfection. The sheer artistry and craftsmanship of U2's music is unspeakable, and this cd collects the best of the best. Sheer poetry and beautiful.
B00002NDB1|5.0|My 2nd favourite Maiden album,closely after fear of the dark.<BR>all the songs are superb,which makes the album a masterpiece.tracks 2.3.and 7 are the best -all long and Dont look to the eyes of a stranger has such a good build up,
B000003TSP|4.0|Back in '97,I heard Portishead's \\"Only You\\" and fell in love with it.It was the first trip-hop song I had ever loved and that alone made me pick up a copy of their self-titled '97 release<BR>(which I believe was one of the best albums of that year).I loved it as well.<br />Beth Gibbon's sad,Dido-like voice paints the darkness of mood<BR>of trip hop in Technicolor even while sounding dreary.<BR>This album is full of gems:\\"Cowboys\\",\\"Humming\\",\\"Seven Months.<BR>I may not be a \\"proper\\" dance music critic but<BR>I know good music when I hear it and \\"Portishead\\" is right up there.Also recommended on the trip hop tip are Morcheeba,<BR>the ingenious Tricky,and Massive Attack(I used to love those guys).Also check out Portishead's exellecent '94 debut,\\"Dummy\\".
6302800927|5.0|Stand By Me is the greatest movie ever. It's really funny and really sad. You'll love it - pretty much everyone that saw it fell in love with it. River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, Jerry O'Connell, and Keifer Sutherland were *fantastic*! R.I.P. River - *Only the good die young.*
B00003CXPJ|1.0|This is one of the worst attempts at comedy in a long time. This film is supposed to be a comedy, the only joke is that you spent your money to witness one of the worst attempts at making an already dimwitted VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards skit (like SNL) into a actual motion picture. If you do not like someone, force them to watch this piece of garbage from beginning to end. This \\"wanna-be\\" Austin Powers of a flick gets worse as time goes by there is only one \\"male-supermodel gag\\" that goes on for the entire film. Zoolander is a jab at the world of male supermodels (Derek Zoolander  Ben Stiller) which is funny for the first five minuets, after that, the gag, the story, and the acting go down in a huge ball of flames. The story writer (ben Stiller) wrote and directed, which eventually becomes offensive to the viewer! The writers make it easy to turn a fashion world foo-foo into unfunny celluloid poo-poo. Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary, Meet the Parents) does a horrible performance, toward the middle of this \\"stinker\\" I felt sorry for him. Will Ferrell is funny for about 3 seconds, then the joke is on him for rest of the movie, instead of Ferrell being entertaining, he made me feel creepy. There are some celebrity cameos in this film to try to fool the viewer into thinking this movie was worthy of of your time and money. I could not wait for this movie to end! Out of 5 stars, I'll give it a 1 (lowest score).
B00003CXXP|2.0|Although an interesting view of the future (which thankfully downplays Spielberg's usual awful family/religion based view of the world) this is such a dull movie. For a start, where's the problem? The kid is horrible. Haley Joel Osment should be packed up in a sealed crate and left to rust! Who would want the pathetic disturbing guffawing little idiot in their house in the first place?<BR>And worst of all, there's a revolting Christian feeling to this movie's lazy morality that will have all intelligent beings vomiting popcorn before the first hour has passed. If God existed, even he (in his 'infinite mercy' - don't laugh) would have struck most of the cast down on the spot. A tragic end to a legendary movie career.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|this is the album that convinced me that the clash was no group of wanna-bes. my personal favs on here are Rudie Can't Fail, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, The Right Profile, Clampdown, Train in Vain, Lost in the Supermarket, and guns of brixton. but really this is like a greatest hits of the clash because it contains so many GREAT songs. of course you'll either love or hate joe strummer's vocals - i personally thought that he's really got a unique voice! really cool guitars as well (mick jones of course). this is my favorite clash album. ahead of its time fer sure as another reviewer mentioned earlier! very awesome album from one of the best bands of the 80s!!!
B00005JKQX|3.0|I admit I was moved by the movie, but it's not the sort of film I go on discussing the day after.  Not like Moulin Rouge, Lord of the Rings and Amelie.  All these three contributed major stuff to movie history.  A Beautiful Mind was , well, just a plainly beautiful movie. <br />Was it my imagination or did they actually spell Nobel as Noble on the prop seal?  I can't believe they'd make a mistake on such a major thing as this.
0805047905|4.0|A great addition to your toddler's library!  I think I like this book better than my daughter, she will sit still while I read, but it is not one that she tends to BRING to me to read.  I was surprised, usually she loves books illustrated by Eric Carle.  I think that maybe when she shows more interest in colors, this one may become a favorite.
B00000294R|5.0|wow! i heard about big l for years but i nevergot any of his albums because since 1992 i was west coast obsessed.<br />i out grew west coast mindless g-funk and lost my faith in all hip hop around 1997, 98. recently however i have gotten into hip hop again, and have come to the realisation that the absolute best hip hop is east coast early to mid 90s. <br />nas, oc, smif n wessun, black moon, jeru the damaja, gza, wu tang, b.i.g. etc. now i can add big l to that list as this 1995 album, in 2002, has brought me back to hip hop. or atleast classic albums, im not interested in any of the new stuff.<br />big ls lyrics are incredible. he is probably the greatest mc ive ever heard. his flow is incredible. nas and those other guys just seem dull in comparison. the beats are also top notch and sometimes pretty dark and forboding, in the middle of the album. basically this album is a classic.<br />i dont feel sorry for what happened to him at all, but he made one great album.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Truly a connisseur's offering, the unbeatable acting be all the cast will take your breath away. You need to watch it more than once to understand fully the actions involved. Probably one of the best films about working life that has been ever made. Dont waste time reading reviews, just go watch.
0792839730|5.0|With regard to those reviewer(s) who critique the casting in this movie, General James Gavin -- portrayed by Ryan O'Neal -- was born in 1907, making him 37 years old during Operation Marketgarden.  Gen. Gavin was one of the -- if not the -- youngest US Army generals in WWII.
B00003CXFG|4.0|It's rare to find a good movie that is a good SCI-FI movie. Yeah, it is a bit of a horror flick, but Pitch Black is a very interesting Sci-Fi movie.<br />Vin Diesel made his mark here for millions of fans and I look forward to what he does next. He is a cross between Michael Clarke-Duncan and a little Arnold Swartzenegger with a touch of Sylvester Stallone. He could well be the first in a new line of action heroes for the new millenium.<br />The movie is good and the effects awesome. Of course, I love the visuals of what the Aliens see as well as what Vin Diesel's character sees (the character having had his eyeballs polished while in prison on another planet), as some of my own artwork is slightly akin to what is shown in the movie.<br />Very worth your time and money.<br />...
B00005Y228|5.0|I cannot believe how good this cd is. It has quickly become my favorite. Kylie sounds so good. Every song has a unique sound that keeps the whole album fresh. <br />Can't get you out of my head is good, but I agree with the majority, that there is a whole slew of better songs on here. My personal favorite would have to be Fever. Such a great song.<br />See, this is how pop is supposed to be.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I love Britney and everything, but I definitely expected a little more \\"personalization\\" with this album. I was hoping the album would be a little more personal than it was. I like the sound of the songs, and it really isn't a bad album, but I would really like Britney to get down to the nitty-gritty and let us in on how she feels, without repressing herself. Its definitely sounds different from her other two albums, but sound is one thing, and lyrics are another. If you like POP, like I do, then I would recommend the album, and of course, any Britney fan better not go without it! :)
B00000K19E|4.0|I won't comment on the movie, except to say that it is horribly overrated.<br />The DVD is pretty good when it comes to the tech side. Great picture and fantastic sound. A boring commentary and some behind the scenes stuff. No trailers, which is becoming a very disturbing trend on DVD's.<br />A decent DVD, I just wish people would quit touting this DVD as revolutionary. Many SE's came out before this with many more features.
B00005Y228|5.0|To be completely honest, I had never heard of Kylie Minogue until her track, \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" starting getting radio play. My friend bought the album for the song (Can't Get You Out of My Head) and we were listening to it in his car and I couldn't get over how awesome the songs were, it was like a mixture of 80's tunes mixed with techno pop. As soon as I heard the title track \\"Fever\\", I had to have this album. Since I bought it about two weeks ago, I have yet to set aside and switch to something else. Its like a drug, I need it! haha <BR>All the songs on FEVER are dance tunes, it never slows down, the calmer dance songs are very trance-like and beautiful. The more you listen to the songs, the more they grow on you. There isn't a song on the album that I dislike, they're very catchy. Pick this CD up for your collection if you haven't yet, its definitely worth it!
6305428220|4.0|This is an excellent teen sci-fi film. I love the way the story unfolds. The movie is about aliens that are taking over both the students and teachers bodies, hoping to eventually take over the world. I like the explanation given for the alien parasite having to drink lots of water and the reason for trying to take control the human race. I watched this whole movie one night on USA. When it was over, I wanted to see it again. I liked the way the kids from different cliches come together. Josh Hartnett as Zeke the drug dealer and Elijah Wood as the geeky kid really stood out in the movie. Clea DuVall wasn't bad either. Overall, this is a good movie to sit down and watch by yourself or even better, with your friends.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Let's get something straight. \\"O Brother...\\" is one of my favourite films of all time. Not only that, but the musical soundtrack is one of its strongest features. And as far as the soundtrack album is concerned, I can only thank the producers for having given the world such a valuable cultural document, and for bringing this wonderful music to a wider audience. They deserve all the CMA, Grammy (and perhaps Academy?) awards they get. <br />In short, this is an album that anyone who loves country, bluegrass or folk music is likely to want in their collection. So why, as I write, am I tossing up whether to only give it four stars?<br />The answer is that I'm attempting to review it, not as a collector's item or a socio-historical document but as an album of music for repeated listening in the comfort of your own home. For that reason I'm not going to review the film rather than the album, as some reviewers here have done, because I don't assume that every listener is going to have the movie playing back in their heads as they listen to the music. <br />Rather, my comments are based on how this album will sound to someone who has picked up on the hearsay, or watched the Grammy ceremony, and is tempted to go out and buy this as a musical compilation. And in that setting, many listeners are going to be disappointed. The fact that a song has integrity, emotion, historical importance or great musicianship doesn't automatically make it great entertainment.<br />There are some standout contributions: The title song is long-term loveable (although why four different renditions of the tune are needed on the album is a mystery - a couple of the \\"period\\" instrumental versions which work well on the movoe soundtrack are somewhat less successful as pure listening music. Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch are as usual faultless. Ralph and the other Stanleys are devastating. But how many times will you want to listen to the 4+ minutes of prison chant that opens the album? Or the squeakykiddy song (the Peasalls)? Or the ancient ditties like \\"Big Rock Candy Mountain\\"? After a couple of spins, you may find yourself reaching for the skip button more than is comfortable.<br />I'm not really knocking this record - in a sense it's a masterpiece. And it's rightly selling by the millions. But if you haven't seen the film I'd give it a whirl in the listening booth before you part with your cash.
0891411194|5.0|I have read many books about WWII, both fiction and nonfiction. This effort is without a doubt the very best from the foot soldiers' point of view. The ranks as high or higher than Sajer's &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot;, which is a must read for WWII enthusiasts. A definite &quot;Five Star&quot; book.
B000001DTM|5.0|...but I need to help the faith of the congregation. ^_^<br />Seriously, I have listened to almost any kind of music you can think of. Everything from The Clash to Cibo Matto to Mylene Farmer and all the De La Souls and all the Fiona Apples... <br />...but this is the ONLY album I can not get sick of. Over the years people will praise alubms like Sg. Pepper and The Wall and The Bends, and I'll be touting this one.<br />The greatest album ever made.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Vietnam is the single most defining \\"moment\\" of my generation. I have kept silent, because no one seemed to really care. I have literally prayed for someone, somewhere to tell our story. \\"We Were Soliders\\" is an excellent beginning. Every American should take the time and view this \\"our story.\\" I wept openly and unrestrained when Mel Gibson stated so succintly, \\"I can never forgive myself! I led my men into battle and they died; and I didn't!\\" For the very first time, after all these years, I was forced to face myself, my fears, my questions, my doubts, and my anger. Now, I feel I just may begin to forgive myself. For every Vietnam Veteran...THIS IS A MUST SEE! For all those who have never understood the war or those of us who fought it...maybe this film is the very best bridge to understanding in our life time! Please...DO NOT TAKE ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18; for the horrors of war has come to the silver screen with dramatic trauma...but, oh so true. American Vietnam Veterans owe Mel Gibson as well as the entire cast and crew a great debt!
0736041850|5.0|This is an awesome view of all the muscles used in both free weight and machine exercises.  I am a visual learner and not only are the muscles shown in detail, but there is a description of the proper way to do the exercise.  My basic criticism of most popular fitness magazines is that they do not tell you the names of the muscles worked, this book gives you the names and shows them also.  Great reference book!  Highly recommended for anyone in the fitness field or looking to understand what you are working when you lift.
B00004W55E|5.0|Don't you love it when you pick something up on the strength of the reviews written here and you find that it is exactly what you had been led to believe - stunning! Rachelle's voice really is the \\"instrument\\" that everyone is raving about and she proves that there is so much more to singing that just having a huge range (Hello Mariah). The first couple of tracks are not quite as good as the rest but from there on, Ms Ferrell sings with a fire and an abandon that literally gives you goose bumps. I Can Explain, I Forgive You and Run To Me really, really show off her pipes.
B00005QG9J|5.0|It seems like each Incubus CD is better than the previous one.  Morning View is by far my favorite! It is usually unheard of for a band to make such a dramatic change from one CD to the next, but Incubus can pull it off. Some may not like the mellow side of this album, but the band sure knows how to experiment with different forms of music and suceed.  Brandon's voice is absolutely amazing. When I first listened to the CD I couldn't believe my ears. Every song is amazing.  I'm so used to bying a CD and skipping every other song, but every track on Morning View is outstanding! There is such a variety of music on this album, that just shows how amazing the band really is. It is unlike anything I have ever heard. My mom even steals my CD because she loves the songs, and it's not to often that we agree on music. I can't wait to see this band live in May, I know I am just going to be a bigger fan. Do yourself a favor and buy this album, it is so worth it!
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel Washington has to be the greatest actor alive! This movie portrays Washington in a light you have never seen nor thought he would be in. Me and a friend left this movie stunned from the pure evil he portrayed. If you are or are not a fan of Washington's, you will be when you see this movie. This is not a movie for the faint of heart, or for sensitive people. You have to be totally open and unexpecting of what is to come next, that's what will make you enjoy every aspect of this gripping and excellent peice of work from one of the greatest actors alive.
B00004RFCM|4.0|I had not seen this series prior to purchasing the DVD on a whim. I now know what all the fuss is about: this is a well-produced, well written and well acted work.  There is a continuation from show to show which greatly contributes to our interest in these four characters (and others with more minor functions).  We are privy to a fairly good treatment of various themes, which are developed in an uninhibitedly fresh and thought-provoking manner.  Sexy, intelligent, entertaining and stylish -- not a bad combination.  One caveat: no one on this show is particularly enlightened -- it's not quite THAT intelligent.
1586212567|4.0|I listen to the CD's over and over again (nothing else to do on my 2 hour drive to work). The one thing to remember is that this book is about how to \\"BE\\", not how to \\"DO\\".
B00005UW7V|2.0|It's difficult to believe this movie would have been released, in this form, at this length, with this ending had the name &quot;Spielberg&quot; not been attached to it. Yes, the film has a few bright spots - the visuals are quite striking at times, and Jude Law gives a wonderful turn as a robotic prostitute, but on the whole, the film just rambles (at considerable length) without going anywhere. It's a lot like a dream - filled with physical impossibilities, emotionally wrenching at times... but then, in most dreams, you don't have to wait 45 minutes for what you already know is going to be an unsatisfying ending. Better you should rent Disney's Pinnochio, or read the book... you'll get a better ending and possibly enjoy yourself.
0375507507|4.0|After reading Entertainment Weekly's review of this book, my curiousity led me to purchase it for my wife, since she enjoys reading true tales of other women. However, I started reading it before she did and I quickly was drawn into Alexandra Fuller's world.<br />Her style is a little disconcerting at first (simply because she is speaking in her own voice and the language and slang  she grew up with), and it takes a while to fall into the flow of her jumping around in her life in the early chapters, but I almost immediately was drawn into her world.  <br />I really enjoy writers who have a style all their own and Fuller definitely has her own unique voice. Her language is sometimes choppy, but it stills conveys meaning and understanding. <br />What I partuclarly liked was the subtle way she conveyed the changing of the guard in Africa, as black rule began to become the rule, rather than the exception. Without directly commenting on the changes either positively or negatively, she conveys the confusion that the change brought about and suggests that whether blacks or whites are in control, the common people of most African nations remain oppressed by their leaders.I think Ms. Fuller makes it clear that regardless of their race, whites and blacks are Africans and that something must eventually be done about the oppresive political environment present in so many African nations. This book is particulary relevant given the recent turmoil over the apparent re-election of Robert Mugabe. <br />I was fascinated by her mother, but wished she had provided more information about her sister. At one point she hints that her sister may have been molested by a neighbor and that a neighbor may have attempted to do the same to her, but she is vague on details, perhaps deliberately so. <br />I also was a little disappointed that there was not more detail on her and her sister's lives in their late teens and early adulthood, but she still manages to convey a tremendous amount of information about their lives as young adults in a relatively short span. <br />Overall this is a fascinating look at a way of life that is rapidly dying out and I would be curious to see if her parents are eventually forced to leave Africa. I guess its a mark of a good author that when they finish their tale, you're asking for more.

This book shows the joys and troubles of a lonely girls life and how she maneges to solve all her problems. I love all the caracters. They all have such real pesonalitys. I really hope Garth Nix can write the sequel to this book fast! I am waiting for it to come out every expectantly!!!!!
B00005QDW5|4.0|Now before I start, I write as a fan, so I'm aware of how each Pink Floyd album should be listened to in whole, to understand each song completely. But, if the band wants to introduce a whole new legion of fans by teasing them with their greats, then I support what they've done here. They've culled together some of their best work, from the Syd Barrett psychedelic years to the David Gilmour-led Pink Floyd of the 1990s. A HUGE contrast of music styles, which just shows how creative and talented the members of Pink Floyd were, and still are.<br />I am not happy with the way they cut parts out of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Echoes\\"; that is the reason I gave this 4 stars. Cutting songs out of the albums was bad enough; \\"Shine\\" loses its effect to me without David Gilmour's second guitar solo in the first part (I-V). However, I'm happy they included Syd Barrett masterpieces like \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"Bike\\", as well as late Waters' works such as \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\", which was off of \\"The Wall\\" movie soundtrack but not the album itself. I think the band put in too many songs from the later albums, but Gilmour probably had the largest say in this compilation so he wanted to represent \\"The Division Bell\\" a bit, even though it's rather weak in comparison to the 70's glory years.<br />A lot of die-hard fans will be very critical of the band's release of a \\"greatest hits\\" album, and I have to agree with them that a best of album might not be in Pink Floyd's style. But after listening to the songs here, I can't help but admire the band again for their impressive talent and creativity. It's THE MUSIC that stays alive. If this brings a whole new generation of fans to appreciate Pink Floyd's music, which I hope was the band's intention (a bit too naive on my part), then I'm very much in favor of it. **Also, if this project was an attempt at Gilmour to patch things up with Waters and end this silly feud between two bitter old men, please doanything to bring back the good music.** For those who have NEVER listened to Floyd before, this is a good start.
B00003CXRP|5.0|CAST AWAY is a great film full of heart and soul. The DVD gives you all the extras you want. Don't you DARE buy the single-disc edition. You won't get as much out of it as you do with this sprawling two-disc set full of extras that'll make you feel closer to Chuck Noland and Wilson! Grade: A+
B00005T30L|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was not overly impressed but after a second viewing I have to say that it was not the fault of the movie but mine. I wasn't paying attention to the sardonic humor or the pathos played out in Thora Birch's performance as well as Steve Bushemi's.  The premise is pretty simple, two life long friends graduate and try to find their place in the world around them.  Enid, (Thora Birch's) charecter pretty much is the focus and she isn't sure of anything, so she goofs off and in the interm meets Steve Bushemi through a cruel trick. <BR>      I found that I kept thinking of this movie after it ended. I think alot of people fantasize about doing the exact same thing as Enid does as the film closes.  Ghost World will definitley enter into your waking world and it does so with a witty florish and a memorable finish.<BR>     Can you tell that I am still in the throw of the Olympics?  All the ice skating fried my brain!
6304341849|5.0|I didn't like that the movie, in VHS I guess has allot of ads from other films of the same company, and I mean ALLOT. But well, I didn't know Pierce had made some wierd film when he was younger. Anyways, on to the story.<br /><br />  The acting was great, the places, the locations where it's filmed. It was perfect, everthing well done. And the story was great, very moving. The story will touch you some way. It makes you see the way that homesexuals were treated back then. What both Clive and Maurice had to go trough to hide there feelings, after realizing how strongly they feel about each other. How they fell in love, and how love is possible in all ways. Takes you to all the hard work that had to be done, then only to be beaten by society's views, when Clive, Hugh Grant, does the right thing, and marry a woman. Of course, after seeing the things they had to do to get there, the \\"right\\" way seems more like the loser way, the cowards way out. Now at first it seems a little ackward to see Maurice, James Wilby, find another relationship with Rupert Graves's character. It really throws you off, it seems unreal in this case, but then it starts to fit in. You really have to think about it. Well, it really makes you think after watching this movie, are we just with the opposite sex.... cus society said that's the right thing to do? In how many different ways is love possible if we didn't have to limit ourselves?
0783229895|5.0|I wasn't expecting much out of this movie but it succeeded where most other horror/parody movies fail....it's actually funny.  <BR>Chucky's former girlfriend is unhappy.  Living in a trailer park, involved with a jerk that makes black look un-goth, all she's got to get her through is that someday she'll be reunited with her one true love.  Guess what?  She gets her wish.<BR>Bride of Chucky is gory, campy, still manages to be cheesy even with  very good special effects, and is basically just a very fun, charming movie.<br />Oh, to further compliment the movie, Spook master Rob Zombie is the main attraction on the soundtrack.  With Rob Zombie you can't lose!
6305609705|5.0|In this most sad of year's for movie going, the best film I saw was the re-release of Apocolypse Now . This is simply a masterpiece that must be experienced by all true movie lover's. Today's director's, like Ron Howard, should take a page from coppola's book and challenge them-selve's to make film's with the power and in-sight of this movie.
1559409010|5.0|I liked this movie when I first saw it. I didn't like it as much as Holy Grail, but this DVD helps me appreciate it more. The two commentaries are the reason that one purchases Criterion DVD's. I am amazed that they got together so many Pythons to create the commentary. Deleted Scenes, wow, with commentary. Amazing. The quality of the transfer of the video and sound is fantastic. If you like Monty Python, buy this right now!
B00000DC10|5.0|I liked their first cd (songs to fan the flames of discontent), but I hysterically love this cd. When I first heard it I wasn't sure I liked it too much...until about 5 seconds passed. This cd is as revolutionary as the sex pistols were back in thier time...but unfortuanatly the group broke up. Some of them are still around in the International Noise Conspiracy, but thats another story. <BR>   This group can somehow mix all sorts of music and not stray awsay from either the album's central theme or the ideas they are passing on. The drums and bass are outstanding, the guitar is soft at someparts than hard as a brick in the face at other times. These guys are genius. <BR>   Anyhow, the singer is just incredible. His voice pumps you up and produces a feeling of adrenaline in your blood. He makes the listener want to jump up and cry out about the wrong in the world. Yes, this cd has a political theme, and I wasn't a believer in anarchy or marxism at all until I discovered this band.(as I didn't really understand it and thought I knew everything from my economics class...like most people) <BR>    Why would a band change my outlook on life? Probably because they have a feel unlike any other and know what they believe. They have seen truth and scream it in their music. Not with just words, but the ACTUAL MUSIC gives the listener a feel of what they believe. And they believe in changing the world. The old punk rock is now associated with corporaions and radio, its time for a new sound. It is the shape of punk to come.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|_Session 9_ is truly an overlooked little gem of a film.  Just caught the DVD the other night and this is one scary, disturbing movie.  The setting, the abandoned Danvers State Mental Hospital, an ACTUAL place, is one of the all-time great settings for a horror film.  Just walking around it is enough to send chills up a person's spine.  On one of the commentary tracks, star Peter Mullen says it really wasn't very hard to get in character, as the whole place is ... creepy.\\"<br />Mullen plays the leader of a group of men employed to remove asbestos and other toxic substances from the building, in preparation for its use as a public administration building.  Desperate for the job, he agrees to do it in a weeks' time and he and the four men under him are under a great deal of stress to get the job done.  If they're successful, they'll receive a $10,000 bonus.  The film follows them through each day of that stressful week as they get progressively more and more stressed out and as one of their number mysteriously disappears.<br />This was an excellent, scary film.  It has the same sort of unsettling vibe as _The Blair Witch Project_.  There isn't a whole lot happening, until the gruesome conclusion, but just the atmosphere and the tension will keep you riveted to the screen.  The DVD includes a bunch of great extras, including a whole deleted subplot, complete with directory commentary, as well as a section of storyboards to screen, and a brief look at the actual hospital where the movie was filmed.  It's too bad this didn't get more attention when it was in theaters, but now that it's on video, here's your chance!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|I'm not sure what possessed me to pick up Tomb Raider after reading all the horrible reviews already posted for it, but I did, and while Tomb Raider is everything that has already been said about it, I still found it a fun and worthwhile purchase.<br />Tomb Raider had the task of trying to please two distinct groups of fans: the video gamers who wanted an accurate adaptation of their beloved franchise (I never got around to finishing the first game), and those drooling for another Indiana Jones-style adventure flick. On the first count, Tomb Raider (TR) succeeds admirably. Lara Croft's world is perfectly translated to the screen, and Lara Croft herself is perfectly captured by Angelina Jolie. Like the games, the movie has Lara facing ancient evils and supernatural powers all while blasting away evil guardians and humans attemptng to thwart her. All the actors are believable, and the dialogue can be very witty at times: When the Illuminanti tell their field agent he must hurry or risk waiting another 5000 years, he answers that that's more time than he's willing to commit to this enterprise. It's not too hard to imagine someone in real life saying something of a similiar nature. The subplot of Lara wanting to see her father again adds depth that wasn't found in the game. Tomb Raider is a good video game adaptation, easily the best since the original Mortal Kombat movie.<br />However, as an adventure flick, Tomb Raider is sorely lacking. The movie feels like four distinct action set pieces coupled together with bits of dialgoue and traveling. At one point, Croft and her allies head to Siberia, but we're never told exactly how they knew to search there. This is one case where I wouldn't have minded if the movie had been longer, just so we could get a sense of the logistics behind the globetrotting. Another gripe is the action sequences: they're flashy, loud, rapidly cut, and totally ruin whatever excitment they were trying to build. Think back to the Indiana Jones Trilogy or even The Mummy Returns: these had nicely choreographed action sequences set to epic scores, where the viewer could savour the action without being over-bombarded. Then there is the special effects: A lot of them weren't needed. The Ray Harryhausen-ish stone monkeys were cool, but I could have done without the lightening in the final scene, and if they'd filmed the flashback of the triangle's origin using real locations, it would have been more believable. Lastly, there is the suspension of disbelief factor. The movie asks us to buy the whole 'controlling time with a mythical triangle' storyline. Okay, fine, for the movie's sake, I will. But plots like these need realistic scenes to ground them, and the movie doesn't have enough. Case in point: Lara drinks some tea given to her by a monk, which magicaly heals her wound. Walking stone monkeys I can accept, but herbal tea has its limits!<br />So while Tomb Raider succeeds as a video-game-based movie, it fails as an adventure movie. The disc has top-notch video and sound, but while the supplements are generally good, they're not enough to warrant a purchase by themselves. While Tomb Raider isn't the best movie I've ever seen, I enjoyed it enough that I can honestly say I didn't waste 100min of my time.logy or even The Mummy Returns: these had nicely choreographed action sequences set to epic scores, where the viewer could savour the action without being over-bombarded.

B00005NWRS|1.0|Okay, maybe it's a bit cliche to call someone a sell-out (who isn't?), but I'm still angry I plunked down my hard-earned money for this garbage collection. Ryan Adams is a fantastic songwriter, but it seems the only consistant, bonafide evidence of this lies in Whiskeytown's \\"Faithless Street\\" and his own solo debut \\"Heartbreaker\\". Having already been turned off by the slick production on \\"Strangers Almanac\\" (despite the masterpieces \\"Inn Town,\\" \\"Avenues\\" and \\"Waiting to Derail\\"), upon listening to \\"Pneumonia\\" my inklings that Adams had been [tricked] into believing he is the great, on-the-verge-of-stardom songwriter everyone painted him to be were indeed confirmed. The 21 songs (yeah, I was stupid enough to buy the version with the bonus disc)... Big, slick production (Ethan Johns is the worst thing to ever happen to Adams, aside from all the fallatious critics), calculated songwriting (again, Adams playing the part of the hard-drinkin', heartbreakin' urban cowboy type the press has made him out to be--whatever!), convoluted arrangements and stupid vocal inflections that lead me to believe Adams thinks he's some type of modern crooner ... And let us not forget the liner notes: the first instance of printed lyrics on an Adams release, leading me to believe that he thinks his songwriting is so good he needs to show it off; and two, plenty of name-dropping of his newly found celebrity friends. Now I know why the late, great Whiskeytown self-destructed--the gifted musicians and songwriters that surrounded Adams were sick of dealing with his ever-inflating ego. Adams appears to be going the Rod Stewart route of delivering passionate albums early in his career, only to get caught up in his favorable press and turning into a sell-out has-been (is a \\"Do ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" cover too far off?). What a shame. I hope Adams has fun rolling in his money and polishing his awards. I'll stick with \\"Faithless Street\\" and remember what this dude was capable of before he got too bigfor his britches.
0679879269|3.0|The powerful imagery and great visual scenes in this book is undoubtedly what makes it so popular. But like all of Pullman's books, it suffers from egregious logical lapses and loose ends. For example, one character flees his own world because he's wanted by the police for murder: when he goes back to his world, there's no further mention of him being wanted for murder. It's never clear exactly what the two main characters did to save the world, nor why it worked. I have a list of about thirty inconsistencies off the top of my head, but listing them here might spoil the book for those who want to read it. <br />There are some great scenes. I do think, however, that Pullman needs to work on cohesion if he wants his books to survive for more than a few years.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I'm actually part of the minority that cherishes the little imperfections of live recordings, including awkward interruptions from ecstatic fans. I like knowing that overproduction did not get in the way and that we are really tapping into what it was like to be there (except for the cig smoke in our eyes).<br />If anything, there is a strange contrast between the explosive reaction of the crowd to songs that are mellow and soothing.<br />Obviously, her reuniting with her adoring fans after a long absence justifies their elation.<br />Sade is a wonderful vocalist who lends such grace and elegance to truly finely written songs and this, like so many of her releases, is a worthy addition to your music collection.
0399900705|4.0|He has 4 millions of dollars. He is a professional killer. He's been hunted by another professional killer. And he hasn't the slighest clue of whom he is. This is Jason Bourne -- or not.<br />Robert Ludlum's \\" The Bourne Identity\\" is already a classic thriller. This is the first instalment of the Bourne's serie and as many other series, you have to read all the books to really reach the end of the story. I mean, this novel has an ending, but it is very open, and many mysteries remain unsolved so far.<br />Of course the most developed character here is the man named Jason Bourne. It is interesting to see how he discoveries his potential identity little by little -- and brings up many other questions about himself. And as it should be, he is very afraid to find out who he is, because he may not be a good person. The other important character is Marie St. Jacques who is not as well written as Bourne. Sometimes she lacks in credibility, but it doesn't jeopardize the reading.<br />Some people may complain this novel is very dated: the actions happen in the mid 70's and geopolitics has an important role through the action. But it seems to me that only by that time such story would happen. Nowadays, the world is so different and tecnology much more developed that would make Bourne think and act in  different ways.<br />I think the film version of this novel --starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente --that is about to be realesed is quite different from the material source, adding characters, events and maybe updating the story. We have to wait to see it. Anyway, I highly recomend this page-turner  for those who wants to read some action and mystery.
B00005A46T|3.0|I'm an extreme metal fan - you know, death, black, etc. etc. etc., and I have to admit I don't hate this album.  Sure Slipknot is a commercial band, sure the masks are a gimmick, but musically they're probably the best representative of metal that have surfaced in the mainstream lately.  The nu-metal vibe is there, but the occasional grind beat sneaks it's way in.  Some of it seems genuinely angry, surprisingly - unlike many other bands in the pop rock genre that tend to sound no more than whiney at best.  Yeah, not bad overall IMHO.

My favorites are: I Remember You, S'Wonderful, The Look of Love and Dancing In The Dark.  Sorry, I don't have time to be a nitpicking &quot;music expert&quot;.

On seeing that the second CD of Six Degrees was yet another side-long concept album, no small degree of apprehension set in.<br />Do not fear. Not only is the title suite gorgeous (OK, the overture is a bit lacking) and far more accessible than Scenes from a Memory, you get a whole other CD of rokkin tunes as well.<br />If I told you that the fourth track on the first CD was a longish song about stem cell research... well, I'd have to remind you not to fear.

It is quite faithful to the book, with very few deviations, and the characters, with the possible exception of Mary, are wonderfully and faithfully drawn.  I have watched only a few minutes of the A&amp;E production and was so put off by the departures from the book in just that segment alone that I have never been interested in viewing the entire thing.  Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul are perfect in their roles, and they will forever personify Eliza and Darcy for me.

B00003OSTV|3.0|In addition to the outrageously wonderful performance of Peter Ustinov as Nero in this film, there is the smoldering and lascivious Patricia Laffan (spelling?) who plays his wife, Poppaea.  This movie is worth buying just to watch these two.  I particularly remember Poppaea lolling about with a cheetah or leopard or tiger on a chain, uttering insolent remarks and casting lustful glances at Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor).  There is much spectacle and wonderful sets.
B000002J03|5.0|Make no mistake when you hear the opening riff of Whole Lotta Love you have heard the moment that heavy metal. On Led Zeppelin's debut they took the British blues movement and took it to the next level, making it heavier, louder, and with more kick a** attitude. On Led Zeppelin II they took it one step further, speeding up the tempo, shortening the songs, and adding catchy riffs to the mix. So in 9 tracks and about 40 minutes heavy metal was born. Whole Lotta Love laid down the template for all metal that followed. As for the rest of the album. Well, they must have been having a lot of fun making this, because they never seem to be taking the album very seriously. They also prove their worth as songwriters with the almost-jazzy What Is and What Should Never Be, as sonic geniuses, and John Bonham proves he's, next to Keith Moon, the greatest drummer in the world on Moby Dick. Led Zeppelin also proves it can expand its sound on the classic Ramble On and Thank You (both of whom are based around an accoustic guitar) Jimmy Page continues to be a brilliant guitarist and producer, Robert Plant wails away like he's the greatest screamer in heavy metal (which he is) and Bonham... well give him some sticks and watch him go. There is simply no heavy metal album like the first and greatest. Sure groups like Black Sabbath, AC/DC, and Metallica are great (legendary is the more proper term) but in the end they're one level short of Led Zep. This is Zep having the most fun they ever had, and making groudbreaking music at the same time. Next to Physical Graffitti and Led Zeppelin I this is the greatest. If you don't own it then do not hesitate buy it... right NOW!
B00000DF6O|5.0|Blues on the Bayou is the 18th BB King album I own and it is my favorite. This album shows what he's always been about: great music from a great guitar player and singer with a great band. &quot;I'll Survive&quot; is my favorite and anyone who's followed BB will agree with every word and note of this tune. In this day and age, it's nice to hear from an artist who isn't holding anything back. Music is supposed to be about feelings, especially the blues, and this album feels right.
B00004Z459|4.0|I never thought the day would come when I would like a rap rock band, but out of all the horrible music out there right now, this is actually one of the better CDs.  And I used to hate this band.  When I first heard One Step Closer I thought it was pathetic, the lyrics were Trent Reznor ... angst and I guessed the age of the singer to be about 17 or so.  Then one of my friends played the song Crawling for me and I just started laughing I thought it was so bad.  Stupid synth effects, and it opens with this loud chorus where the guy seems to be screaming offkey.  Later, when I was driving around LA with my dad, I turned to a radio station playing Crawling right during the part where the verse comes in.  My dad really liked it 'cause he thought it was a Savage Garden song until the chorus came in.  Next time you hear it pay attention because its hilarious, the verse sounds exactly like the music of those awful Austrailian pop sellouts.<br />Then I saw them on Ozzfest, and even though they weren't the greatest band, and from the front row you could tell the lead singer wears CK briefs, and you could barely hear the rapper because Chester's volume was turned up so much more, oh and then they didn't even play Crawling, which by then was starting to grow on me, they were probably the best band there with the exception of Black Sabbath and maybe Godhead.  ...I figured why not get the Linkin Park CD, even if it won't be very good.<br />Anyhow, the CD actually turned out to be surprisingly good, very well produced and concise.  The instrumental track is great, although it should have been at least twice as long.  In the End is a great single, probably the best track on the album along with the last track.  Plus I'm a sucker for groups in which two people do the singing (ex. AIC, Veruca Salt, Sleater-Kinney).<br />There a lots of reasons to dislike this band, believe me, but I can't deny that they actually made a good CD.
B00000J2SQ|4.0|This seems to be a rather polarizing album among Rainbow fans.  This is due to the fact that Rainbow wrote material based upon the strength of the vocalist.  For instance, the Dio-era albums are worlds apart from either the Bonnet- or Turner-era records, or even the White-led group that recorded \\"Stranger In Us All\\".  There's no question that Joe Lynn Turner's voice was well-suited for the lighter fare recorded for \\"Straight Between The Eyes\\".  The album itself features a very polished production by bassist Roger Glover that was well-suited for airplay in the USA, which was Blackmore's goal in having Turner front Rainbow.  So, seen in that light, the choice of material is understandable.  But what I think is Blackmore's greatest strength comes through strongly here - his innate ability to drop in catchy lines, whether he has 8 or 8000 bars to do it in.  His solo on the big single, \\"Stone Cold\\", just fits so well.  For a more intense guitar workout, the song \\"Death Alley Driver\\" recalls Blackmore's playing on Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\".  With the exception of the uptempo \\"Power\\", most of the songs are more laidback and balladesque.  Overall, it's a pretty decent album as long as you don't expect to hear Dio-era songs.  And there is still only one Ritchie Blackmore.
B000006UNG|5.0|One of life's great mysterys - how can an album as good as this be largely unknown outside the legion of wide-eyed Talk Talk acolytes?  Even if difficult art-pop isn't your 'thing', this is loaded with seductive tunes and a bright eyed beauty you will find almost nowhere else.  Look beneath the shiny surface and you find a lyrical depth and exquisite detailed production to die for.  Endlessly fascinating and wonderfully soothing.<br />The first cd I ever bought and still one of the most played, I can't recommend it highly enough.  Worth a few bucks of anyones money.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Best Picture - 2001 - Moulin Rouge<br />I've seen a lot of reviews of Moulin Rouge over the last 9 months.  It's definitely a love or hate film.  I'm not a musical lover or much of a romantic as far as films go (I don't cry in movies often).  All I know is I was a mess at the end of this film and I thought the story was true, honest and beautiful.<br />Ewan and Nicole BOTH should get Oscars for their performances (Ewan got robbed for not at least getting nominated - the boy can SING and act - the last scene alone is amazing).  The story - as simple as it was - was true and honest, which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of films these days.  It was beautiful on levels I didn't know film was capable of.  People who say they didn't empathize with Satine and Christian didn't \\"get it\\".  Yes - the plot is predictable - Baz SPELLS OUT what will happen in the first 5 minutes.  The beauty of it is that you still care about it by the end.  It doesn't matter that you know what will happen.  It's the journey that is entertaining and meaningful.  The emotional roller coaster - starting so low - shooting high so quickly and slowly falling back to the deepest low is the point of the film in my opinion.<br />On first viewing, I was skeptical for about the first 20 minutes, but I gave in and loved it.  As an artist, I feel this film is an accomplishment of amazing proportion.  The art direction, cinematography, editing, etc is just astounding.  My first thought upon leaving the theater was \\"It's the bravest film I've ever seen\\" and I'll stand by that today having seen it about 8 times.  For someone to have that vision and realize it so fully must have taken a lot of determination.  It seems Baz definitely got his vision on film and hats off to him for it.  It's the most beautiful film I've ever seen and redefines the medium of \\"filmmaking\\".<br />See it.  And give it a chance.  Go in with an open mind and heart.  It's worth it.
B000002NAK|5.0|The story is so depressing that it almost makes me cry, but I suppose that's a mark of a good performance if the singers can produce such emotion in the listener!  Madonna is wonderful, of course, but Jonathan Pryce has a nice voice, too, and Antonio Banderas is fantastic!  Who'd a thunk it?  My favorite songs would have to be &quot;Oh! What a Circus&quot;, &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot;, and &quot;Rainbow High&quot;.<br />I once heard that Antonio Banderas was being considered for a new screen version of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and at the time I thought that was nuts, but after hearing him on this album and seeing him in the movie, I think it's a good idea! (Except I think he has to try to train some of the accent out of his voice, first...)
B000001Y42|5.0|I remember when I first this CD. I LOVED Pollution (and still do), and I thought this CD rock major...butt. (and it still does!). I had respect for this band back then, and I had very high expectations for their future albums. Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever... and in this case, Limp Bizkit's rein on the rapcore world fell as limp as their name (I always thought that was a really corny name). But back then, I miss the old days! Same thing with Korn, man! I miss the songs like Blind! Those were the GOOD ones!<br />WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?? The answer: $$$$ - they had too much of it for their own good.<br />Needless to say, their second album fell (VERY) short of its hype. Many Three Dollar fans out there were wondering what the hell happened to them!...<br />Anyway, back to the point!! And of you 14 year-old 'hardcore' kids out there who think Limp is hard now, because they're not. Fred lost his potential hardness a long time ago. You probably won't like this CD as much, because it's much heavier. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes a band's old stuff.
B00005NNU4|2.0|I gave WildCard a thorough, 'headphones-in-the-dark' listening and formed the following opinions. Comparatively, it comes nowhere near the high level of quality TTD achieved with \\"Symphony Or Damn\\". That album was his high point, nearly a masterpiece, and one of the best albums by anyone in the 90's. I don't expect that level of quality from everything he does, but it did show me that TTD has the capacity to make superb recordings. It's hard not to compare his other work to it.<br />I'll first note the most obvious point about WildCard: TTD's singing is incredibly soulful, and he really gives it his all for every song. He's a brilliant singer and is one of the most talented vocalists in the world today. That said, WildCard has quite a few problems, even more than Vibrator, which was generally good but also had problems (too many for Sony as it turned out - they dropped him after it). The major problem on WildCard is the instrumentation and the production. Far too many songs employ poorly recorded and very generic electronic drums. You'll notice an obvious improvement in sound quality and inspiration during the few times he chose to use a real drummer; those songs sound fuller and meatier. Another problem is the fake, annoying synth sounds used on nearly every track. TTD has the same problem Stevie Wonder's had for the last 20 years: the songs are generally well written, but the overproduction, crowded mixes, and gimmicky electronics tend to obscure the true nature of the songs. TTD wrote some interesting chord changes, but you won't usually notice them because there's a lot of electronic noise obscuring the analog instruments which carry the tune (examples: \\"Shalom\\" and \\"O Divina\\", with famed pianist Jai Winding buried deep in the mix). TTD can be a very good songwriter, but he would be well advised to stop adding synth after synth overdubs, and playing them all himself in a sometimes amateurish way. His songs will generally stand up on their own with analog instruments like piano, bass, drums, etc, but he insists on tinkering with the mix, adding badly placed fadeouts, weird sounds, swirling headphone mixes, and other things like that which end up sounding gimmicky instead of inventive. He's obviously trying to make his songs interesting, and he does have a knack for doing so (almost everything on WildCard is interesting to listen to), but too much of a good thing often spoils it all. This is what I call the \\"Supermodel Sandwich syndrome\\": he uses that song's production technique on too many of WildCard's songs. It's a clichéd sound which worked on Supermodel, but doesn't work here.<br />As on all his records, TTD's amazing voice always carries the tune, and here again he has a real talent for creating interesting, sinewy vocal lines, but there are major problems with the lyrics on WildCard. TTD divides his lyrics between totally shallow (Ev'rythang, Suga Free, SRR-636) and his own unique form of free-verse poetry, which sometimes succeeds, but too often sounds overly wordy and cryptic. He's often striving for meaning and relevance, and it might sound like he's achieving it with his passionate vocals, but most of his lyrics on WildCard just end up going in one ear and out the other; forgettable and sometimes pretentious. You shouldn't have to read along with the lyric book to try to find out what he's talking about (and even that doesn't work). He's good at catchy choruses though; songs like My Dark Places and O Divina will stick in your mind for days afterwards. <br />Personally, I think TTD can do much, much better than this. I think he's a musical genius. WildCard sounds like a hodgepodge of leftovers, with O Divina being the only great song out of 18. It's a considerable letdown; not a memorable creation at all, though it does have consistantly good vocals and a few decent songs (the first three especially). In my opinion he needs to go back to the drawing board for his next album. He should let others assist him with production and instrumentation, and focus more on quality songwriting. Also, he is developing a sameness with his overall sound because he insists, perhaps narcissistically, on overdubbing only his OWN voice to do all the background vocals, when using other people might sound better and less repetitive. <br />I love the guy and his music, I'm rooting for him and I know he can do it. This album gets 2 stars compared to TTD's other recordings, but when compared to the godawful music of today being made by his peers, boost that to 4.
B00000F169|4.0|If you like Monty Python, you should LOVE &quot;Dark Star&quot;.  This is dry, dry, dry and (did I mention) dry humor.  Definitely a thinking person's film.  You'll find yourself laughing out loud three days later when one of the jokes finally catches up to you!

6301661737|5.0|Kurosawa at his best. When i stumbled over this movie, many years ago, I wasn't aware, that Kurosawa was so deep and important. I loved \\"Seven Samurai\\" and \\"Yojimbo\\" and expected \\"Kagemusha\\" to be another cool Samurai flick with action and subtle humor. But this Masterpiece made me have a closer look upon Akira Kurosawa, and I found a whole line of exceptional Films. After experiencing Kagemusha, I wanted to see all the other great films made by Kurosawa, one of the best movie makers ever. Today, I watch the movie once a year and still find things i haven't noticed before, things that only a genius like Kurosawa could have placed into a movie.<br />The Titel \\"Kagemusha\\" means Shadow of the Warrior. <BR>The story takes place in the later 16th century. The Clan Daymios are fighting each other to gain control over the Country. Among them, the legendary Takeda Shingen. One day, he is shot by an enemy sniper and about to die. To prevent the fall of his house, he commands his most loyal man to keep his dead a secret for three years. To make the plan work, a perfect looking Double, a commoner, a thief, is taking over the representative role in public.<BR>From this day on, the thief lives as a shadow, a shadow without a body to follow. More and more, he learn about loyality and respect. He finds joy again in existence and becomes more and more the body, he should be the shadow of. But a shadow is nothing without a body...<br />All in all, this is not only a great story, a great visual joy, but also a momentum of japanese society and military, and a melancholic view of mans nature.<BR>If you can stand three hours of good movie, this one is for you. I only wish it would be available on DVD...<br />When does a compilation-box of Kurosawa movies appear on dvd? I just can't wait!
6304711905|5.0|This DVD was one of the best stories on Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday that I have ever seen.  It showed a completely different version of these two legends and some insight into them as men and not just gunfighters. Kurt Russell did an excellent job as Wyatt Earp and Val Kilmer's role as Doc Holiday was an oscar winning performance. I was amazed that Val Kilmer was not  nominated for this movie. This is an excellent way to spend an evening. This movie is one that can be watched more than once and enjoyed every time it is viewed. It has become one of my favorites.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|This movie has some of the most memorable and hilarious quotes.  The people who gave bad reviews to this movie obviously only watched it once.  Ben Stiller's comedy is genius.  Owen Wilson steals Ben Stiller's thunder with his character.  Don't waste your money renting it - buy it.

1558908382|4.0|Calling all John Cusack fans!  You must own this DVD.  This movie is a great action packed semi-dark comedy that keeps your attention from start to finish.  The wide screen version DVD is a must have.  Why would anyone want full screen these days?  At any rate, Cusack and Driver click in this romantic piece of nostalgia.  Joan Cusack plays his secreatary with a great performance.  Also look for other Cusacks.  Another Cusack (a sister I assume) plays a drunk friend and yet another (a brother I assume) plays a waiter.  Apparently he makes this movie a family affair.  And lets not forget Dan Ackroyd's great performance as a fellow hitman.  A wonderful, wonderful, wonderful movie.
1577311523|3.0|As someone who reads everything I can find on spiritual subjects, I found this book to be highly simplistic and too black & white/right-or-wrong for my taste. It has redeeming qualities, however: the entire book is just questions from people who seem to be skeptical about intuition and spirituality, with very well thought-out answers by Eckhart Tolle, who is very down to earth and not flaky in the least. His main point seems to be the importance of using intuition and not relying on logical thought alone, accepting that the intuition is tuned into many more of the consequences of our actions than a person's logic can possibly understand on its own. If you are interested in investigating this subject deeply with someone who is articulate and well-spoken, then this is the book for you. However, at times he writes as if a person cannot know what to do until they make a judgement about what is WRONG, and then go the opposite way. This is great if one is an addicted personality, but not for someone who is just looking to be balanced and open, free of the strain of always having to judge others and oneself. If you're wondering whether this book is for you, I hope this gives an idea of what's inside.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't normally take my music instructions from weekly newsmagazines, but when both TIME and Newsweek this week had articles about Norah Jones and her debut CD, I felt I should purchase it. That was a very wise decision on my part, for both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this collection. My wife feels that her voice is &quot;mellow&quot;, but I prefer using the word &quot;smokey&quot;. She has a mixture of song styles on this CD, and she does well in all of them. Considering her age, I feel sure that she is only going to improve with additional experience and releases, and I anticipate all of them. This is the type of CD that just calls out for being listened to with a glass of bubbly in your hand, while you're sitting in front of a roaring fire with your significant other.
B000000HTO|5.0|Dear friends, this is simply one of the best albums I ever heard. I get into VDGG by chance when a friend showed me the wonderful Godbluff opening track 'the undercoverman' and I almost collapse of the deep emotion and awesome sound of this strange band (VDGG doesn't have a proper bass and guitar in these 2 albums!!). Then I knew that Pawn Hearts was the devoted album of the group by all the prog fans...but..I seriously find this record as their masterpiece and 'pilgrims' one of my favourite songs. Buy this CD it won't desapoint you.
0142000663|3.0|I personally have read a majority of John Steinbeck's works, and I've found that the more popular the piece happens to be, the worse the piece is.  The Grapes of Wrath is certainly no exception to this.  The characters in the novel tend to be rather unamusing compared to some of Steinbeck's others, and they very often do things without any sort of reason.  The plot is rather bland as well, with the action mostly repetitive through the majority of the novel.  The novel also includes many irrelevant scenes that does not pertain to the story or its characters itself. The reason for this is mainly that Steinbeck designed this novel to be more of an illustration of the Great Depression than a story.  To be fair, though, as a depiction of the Depression, this novel is great, showing all of those scenes which are unrelated to the characters that illustrate other aspects of the Depression that they do not encounter.  If you are looking for a novel that will give you some of the attitudes of tenant farmers and others during the Depression, then this is certainly your book.  However, if you happen to be more like myself, simply looking for an interesting story, you would be better advised to look elsewhere.  Perhaps one of Steinbeck's lesser known works, like Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, or East of Eden, which are all wonderful novels, even though they are often overlooked.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|The scares maybe few and far between, but what makes Session 9 so convincing is the growing sense of terror lurking in the dark bowels of a deserted Mental Asylum. Shots of empty patient's chairs rocking back and forth at the end of a tunnel. Shadows chasing men into corridors where there's no light. A true pyschological horror film. One to watch alone at night. Miles ahead of recent scare flicks. 5 stars.

B00005QAPH|5.0|Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is mesmerizing in it's tone, style and technique all the while telling a coherent story of the inner depression of a director. It can be somewhat obvious that Fellini used a lot of his personal experience after the success of his film La Dolce Vita and how most likely he was under the gun to make another success. It is also one of the testaments to his imagination and creative flair of film that he decided to use this problem to his advantage. By combining many of his deep, joyful, though troublesome memories with strange and interesting detail around the picture world in Italy, he has crafted a masterpiece about film.<br />Marcello Mastroianni, who also played the lead in La Dolce Vita and a number of other Fellini movies, takes on playing a verion of Fellini- Guido Orefice is fourty-three, somewhat sick, pulled in several directions at numerous times, the director with little time is assigned to pump out new ideas for his new movie and get the right actors for the job. Mastroianni projects a splendid performance of his version of Fellini (his version by the way, not an exact replica) since he conveys all the sorrow right in his eyes, within at a lot of moments. This is a good mood motivator.<br />Overall what makes 8 1/2 unique are the numerous sequences where Guido escapes in his dreamworld of women, memories, and the fancy free-flight. Most memorable (indeed one of the most memorable of all time from my standpoint) scenes is the first of the movie, where he is stuck in traffic, surrounded by a many lot of odd looking people, and getting exasperated when some type of gas fumes into the unopenable car. Then he finally reaches his abscond- getting out through the roof of the car and flying away in the sky; only to get tugged at by a counselor while floating without moving in the sky to the words- Down, definitely down. The fact that this scene is only the first in a line of others that ring surreal simplicity while is just one of the many triumphs present here. The last scene is also one for the books if only for it's cheery lunacy.<br />(By the way, this critertion DVD is also worth 5 stars. There is no English dubbing, but in a way that's a good thing since dubbing is the last thing this movie needs. Terry Gilliam makes a nice intro segment as well on disc 1).riumphs present here.

B00005M91K|5.0|First of all, don't be worried that there is no dialogue in this film.  After seeing it for yourself, you'll know why.  I have found that watching it with people you know presents a very good forum for discussion and you'll more than likely find the same.  The camera work is nothing short of pheonomenal and the time lapse, etc. is equally amazing.  Each person will have his or her own favorite part(s), but certain moods will make you like certain parts more than others. I found it relaxing, perplexing, insightful, and at some points, scary - all at once.  I know that may have sounded perplexing in itself, but trust me, you'll see what I mean when you watch it.  Sit down, relax and see what our world consists of from another's eyes insted of CNN, National Geographic, etc.  The crew that filmed BARAKA was very good at not interfering with the daily goings on in the settings that they filmed.  ENJOY<br />-arjay
078062551X|4.0|Inside Dark City, the oppressive urban locale, a man named John Murdoch is trying desperately to get out.  Inside \\"Dark City\\", the 110-minute movie, a two hour and ten minute masterpiece is trying to get out.  I suspect that Director Alex Proyas had a lean budget and pressure from New Line to deliver a lean thriller, and thus had to cut corners he might not have otherwise cut.  For example...<br />The film's opening, a section usually reserved for introducing characters and context, felt rushed and uneven.  One scene ends abruptly and, before the audience can get their bearings, another begins.  I had a difficult time keeping up, which I suppose was intentional.  Just as the characters on screen have a sense of vertigo every time they awake, so should the audience.  I can forgive this flaw this time.  Where I can't forgive it are in the film's few (thankfully, just a few) action sequences.  Somebody let a monkey loose on the editing bay, apparently, for these scenes have little coherence, structure, or sense of pacing.  Put on a blindfold, spin around in a circle a dozen or so times, and then walk down the stairs.  You'll get a pretty good idea of what the action scenes feel like.<br />Once the film settles down into its rhythm, things begin to pick up.  Proyas can then concentrate on explicating, in usually subtle ways, the fascinating idea that makes up the core of the film.  I'll not tell what it is; that job goes to Keifer Sutherland's character, during a clumsy scene in a boat, that's pretty much all dry exposition (another example of Proyas being rushed to the film's conclusion).  Proyas has much fun giving us the clues to the mystery, and then shaking things up by throwing red herrings at the screen (what was the significance of those incessant swirls?  Hmm...).<br />The film's biggest strength, and I'm not the first to point this out, are it's dazzling sets.  I can only describe the cityscape as being made up of liquid skyscrapers.  The Strangers, an enigmatic alien race that controls Dark City, push and pull and stretch the tall buildings as if they were so much taffy.  At one point a man on a balcony gets crushed between two itinerant high-rises.  The problem that Proyas encounters, and to me it's but a minor one, is that though the movie needs to be set entirely at night (an important plot point) the glory of the sets sometimes gets lost in the darkness.  I longed for a spotlight or even a harsh torch to better light the way through the ominous streets.<br />Sometimes you can judge a picture's quality by its cast.  I know I did with this one, which is why it took me so long see it.  In 1998, William Hurt was ten years removed from his glory days a perennial Oscar nom, Keifer Sutherland had recently embarrassed himself in \\"A Few Good Men\\" and \\"A Time to Kill\\", Jennifer Connelly had a couple of years before her career renaissance, and Rufus Sewell wasn't (and still isn't) a household name.  Not a spectacular bunch, I'd say.  But don't fret: three-fourths of the leads are solid and watchable.  Hurt's Detective Bumstead comes off first as a cliched noirish cop, until you realize that there is a very good reason for him to be cliched.  Connelly, always watchable if only for her unchallenged beauty, manages confusion and pathos as the wife of a man accused of serial killing.  And Sewell, the accused killer, overcomes his distracting lazy eye by jumping in with both feet to the shoes of his nihilistic anti-hero, John Murdoch.  I think Sewell's anonymity, at least to my eyes, works well for him.  I didn't know if he would end the film as a conquering hero or just another casualty.  This greatly helped the film's suspense.  Sutherland, for his part, is once again quite ludicrous.  Nothing more than an amalgamation of ticks and tricks (a scarred right eye; an asthmatic vocal rhythm; a limp.  C'mon!  Hasn't film psychology gotten past these tired character conventions?), his Dr. Schreber is supposed to be the conduit between the humans and the Strangers.  But I wouldn't trust Sutherland's character with my brain.  Okay, so I wouldn't have the choice if I was in this film, but still.  It's a grating performance from Donald's son.<br />Richard O'Brien, whose work on \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" threatened to typecast him as a creepy pale-faced bald weirdo, plays the lead creepy pale-faced bald weirdo.  He is the only one of the Strangers to be moderately fleshed-out (although, for a member of an alien race defined solely by their collective unconscious, he sure has a healthy ego and a forceful streak of ambition).  Named Mr. Hand (was Ray Walston even asked to reprise his \\"Fastimes\\" role?  *smirk*), he is meant to be menacing and omnipotent, but comes off rather fey and ineffectual.<br />Someone once said that this movie could be called a cross between \\"The Matrix\\" (obvious) and \\"The Truman Show\\" (much less obvious, but still very relevant).  I tend to agree with that neat shorthand assessment.  Its originality is tainted by being such an easy comparison.  But if you look close, and I mean real close, you'll see that \\"Dark City\\" is indeed a flawed masterpiece, hampered by outside circumstances, desperately trying to bust open its seams and reveal it's true nature.  It was this naked potential that forced me to enjoy the film.
0385503954|5.0|I picked up this good-looking book with no advance knowledge of its plot - just a liking for other works of its author -  and I'm grateful for that, and won't give away the story here.  I was grabbed by its first description, and held closely throughout. McEwan has created characters who are so fully realized that I felt as if I had known them for years. It's an amazing story, though not at all far-fetched.  It's slyly easy to read - think \\"page-turner\\" - but it is about vitally important things. In addition considerable historic research went into it, and that's a delicious plus.<br />McEwan invites you into an English world that you will smell, hear, feel, and taste - and your mind and emotions will be fully engaged.  The family has money and servants but this is nothing you've seen on television or the movies. The story is told with discipline and control, and  from several points of view. The people are palpably real. It's a tightly organized and  satisfying assemblage of the things that matter, among them family life, childhood, debt and obligation, loyalty, imagination, faith and hope, innocence and guilt, love, desire,  varieties of destruction -  and the urge to make a difference. Finally: war and peace. (In fact, you might be reminded of Tolstoy in more than a few ways.) In addition it's a fierce and moving meditation on  the life of the mind and creativity.  At the same time, McEwan's powers of description are such that all of your senses are never anything but fully engaged. English country life in the 1930's - a heat wave, and the fragrance of wildflowers, the feel of a silk dress that is sticking to skin, the thick dark of a moonless summer night - through  the horrors of the Second World War (Dunkirk most dramatically and effectively) and beyond. It is either sheer brilliance, or a deeply humane urge, or maybe just a workmanlike sense, but McEwan takes full responsibility for each of his characters- and sees them through to the end.<br />Nearly every page has something unselfconsciously remarkable to think about - or to reconsider. I used my pencil throughout; there is so much that is wise or just plain awe-inspiring in this book.  McEwan has accomplished something amazing. I'm telling friends to read the book first, reviews second.  The story is so terrific, and so moving and important -  and might unfold best for the reader who comes to it blissfully uninformed. It's not very often that I've felt transformed by a novel.  Read it as soon as you can.
0380977281|5.0|Stardust was my introduction to Neil Gaiman. Simply put, it is a beautiful and sad little book. If you ever want a quick read that will give the satisfaction of time well spent, here it is; you will not be disappointed.
031286504X|5.0|Always a good writer, Matheson had at least three classic novels in him, and this is one of them.<br />Dean Koontz usually gets the credit for creating the cross-genre novel, but he was predated by others, Matheson among them.  I Am Legend redefined the vampire novel as science fiction, but it actually is even more complex than that.  The story is richly layered and textured, highly adult and morally ambiguous.  It is a medical thriller of the genre later made more famous by Michael Crichton and Robin Cook, a post-apocalypse novel, a commentary on Darwinism, and even a war story  -  Cold and Hot.<br />The '64 AIP Vincent Price vehicle The Last Man On Earth was a faithful and effective adaptation of the book, though Matheson didn't like it any more than he did the far less faithful Warner Brothers remake ten years later, The Omega Man.  Both movies are worth a look, for different reasons.  But you owe it to yourself to read it as Matheson originally wrote it, if you really want to enjoy it to the max.  I re-read it about a year ago, and was pleasantly surprised at how little dated it was.  In fact, it's actually more up-to-date, in light of AIDS and concern over biological weapons.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Glam rock kind of exaults the Rock Star life and exposes the less-sung about bad parts. MM does exactly this on the album, and you can tell which songs are just typified 'rock' songs as the album booklet will explain, one side for the empty sell-out the other side for the artist who's trying to communicate. The writing took a huge step up from ACSS, the sound is purposely contained, almost like hearing it through a seashell. There are many worth-while tracks that exceed so many other recordings. It's a lot like David Bowie's older stuff. Pick it up!
6300214044|5.0|i highly recommend this film.  I found it very moving.  It is baded on the novel by Christine Sparks.  The Elephant Man, was <BR>done so well.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Having little knowledge of Harry Potter, but being of the Star Wars generation I was blown away by this film.<br />This is the first film in a series of upcomings, but doesnt need an hour of boring storytelling to bring the veiwer up to speed.  The story is told in the most interesting ways possible, keeping me entertained to the max, even though I had no idea what to expect, and seeing a film that wasnt really aimed at me.<br />Harry Potter is the type of movie that makes your forget you live in reality, which in itself is the most fun you could have for 2 hours.  <br />It has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, in the way of it being a fantasy film.  It doesnt need to explain why things are happening the way they are.  They happen, and your happy with that.<br />The characters are all very likable even the sinsister ones.  Alan Rickman seems to be having the most fun as the villan Snape.<br />Like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter has the sequel vibe all through it.  2 hours is clearly not enough time for the plot be be filled.  However this movie uses its time very wise, and doesnt drag at any point.<br />The special effects are excellent.  We know brooms cant fly, and there are no two headed monsters, but if there were... maybe this is what they would look like.  There is a scene where the charcters are pawns on a chess board, the effects look like something out of Jumangi.<br />All in all, I had a big smile on my face in the end, as I turned to my nephew we both had the same idea....\\"Let's get back in line\\".
B00005RYLE|5.0|Yes I am a Dead head, an evil dead head, I always buy the newest version of the DVD when they come out but when i heard about the book of the dead edition i flipped, i finally got to see pictures of the casing and was a bit disapointed but once i saw this on the store shelf i had to have it, it is so much cooler looking in real life then int he photos, also, you get the standard commentary with the first evil dead re release but you also get this awesome Fanfare documentary put together by Bruce, overall it is a good colelction of stuff and if you shop around you can probably find an even better price, although the amazon price is pretty good, there is also a pretty well rounded book included with evil dead info and all the good stuff fromt he frst release on DVD, if you can swing the extra bucks i would defiantely pick this up.
B000000H7I|5.0|As all reviews of this now seminal 1990 album show - it really does rock.<BR>Produced by Scott Burns/Morrisound, Fame & sporting a fantastic Dan Seagrave cover... there isn't that much more that can be said of this CD [I actualy only a Vinyl Copy - Better!]<br />If you have cash on the hip to spare & have not been introduced to the delights that is Suffocation - start here as this is the Debut [Album] for Roadrunner & still the best.
B000056NX5|5.0|Wow! I completely loved this movie! I go to a Catholic School so I'm glad that the director of this movie made Jesus seem like a man for once. Judas almost had me in tears! I think that he is an amazing actor and had me on his side from Strange thing Mystyfing to after his death. Mary hasa beautiful voice and she captured everything that she felt in her facial expression. Cheers to her! Renee Castle (the actress who played mary)did an amazing performance in I dont know how to love him which was a beautiful song. However, I think that Glenn Carter was not right for the part of Jesus. Why did he keep trying to sing so high? The part wasnt right for his voice range (me being a singer myself at the new england conservatory). Overall this was an excellent movie...a must have!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, comparing John Mayer to Dave Matthews is fair - I heard Dave and Tim Reynolds at Luther College (Go Norse) and John Mayer has some of the same talent, musicality and artistry, and some great sevenths and ninths in his guitar riffs.<br />John Mayer's lyrics remind me more of David Wilcox - more of a folk artist with some good guitar chordage.  I've heard David Wilcox in Des Moines on three different occassions a few years ago, and forgot about him ntil I listed to John Mayer's CD.  Some of the same thoughtful lyrics about romance and personal experience set embraced with some inspiring chords and a great &quot;happy music&quot; beat.  <br />If &quot;happy music&quot;  makes you sick then go back to the stuff that gets you through the week.  But if you dig Dave Matthews, David Wilcox, and other REAL musicians and lyricists,  then give this guy a listen.<br />I just got John's CD and It's spinning non-stop.
B00005TT77|4.0|this album contains the only beatles covers i've ever found purposeful in any way at all.  a few are painful, but for the most part this is true to the the spirit in which the beatles recorded.  the entire album was produced in three weeks' time, so it doesn't have that overdone sound, and the artists are really having fun with the music.  that's what i think of as the beatles' appeal--music that's fun, music that makes you want to sing along even when you're sober.  my hippie parents and i danced to the beatles when i was a child.  i horrified my grandparents by belting \\"strawberry fields\\" at three.  these were my lullabies.  this album makes me happy--it's like a soundtrack to those memories.  purists beware--license is taken with melody and tempo on some tracks.  but if you're not too anal-retentive about such things, i would suppose you'd find this album worth its price tag.  a good road trip selection.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Is there anyone else in rock and roll that holds a candle to Bob Dylan?  Who else has been writing his own stuff for around forty years now?  Who else, even when it's not great, is still interesting?  And who else keeps reinventing himself not only with new material, but with the old stuff?<br />Bob Dylan has left his mark in several areas, most notably as rock and roll poet.  With &quot;Love and Theft&quot;, he should now take his place as an American icon in the same class as Johnny Cash.  This one is just loaded with styles of traditional American music, done his way.  While there are still a decent amount of cryptic lyrics, there are also some simple love songs.<br />I like the look he's sporting these days.  Remember, he's a 60-year old man.  Just a few years ago, he was looking terrible, with his face all bloated.  Now he's got a lean/mean riverboat gambler appearance that's very fitting for this album.  The voice is more gravelly than it's ever been, and that's the voice we'll probably watch him ride into the sunset with.  Backed with a super tight band of real professionals, he's charged up and ready to continue to challenge us.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Well, I guess I didn't &quot;get it,&quot; since that's how everyone who loves this stinking movie explains away those of us who don't.  Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch,&quot; a REAL muscical, made fun of &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; pays homage to it).  This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video.  And for those of you who think we've all missed the point----Baz ain't exactly Ingmar Bergman.
B00005YTFG|2.0|I hate sampling, which is the practice of taking a small cut of another hit, putting it in \\"your\\" song, and getting more mileage out of it.  It seems to be popular, and even the original artist gets paid off in royalties.  <br />So in this world of sampling in recordings, and \\"live\\" performances that are lip-synched, we have now entered the era of the sampled movie.  I seem to be in the minority with this one, but I was turned off by most of the movie, and the biggest issue is the sampling.  I keep reading that this is a triumph for the Oscars in that the musical is now being recognized again.  In my eyes, if you are going to make a musical, try writing some original songs that people like.  Don't take other songs, and in many cases, just parts of popular songs to pander to the MTV-generation.  <br />Another problem is Nicole Kidman.  Here she is, once again as a cold-as-ice man manipulator.  I think she's a terrific actress, and the role certainly called for it, but I'm just getting sick of her cast this way.  Is she capable of playing someone tender?  I buy Ewan McGregor acting like a puppy dog around her, but I don't believe for a moment that she has a thing for him.<br />Speaking of guys acting like puppy dogs, at least he has somewhat pure, if naive motives.  The rest of the film treats sex in that leering, sniggering, teasing way that Hollywood loves to stretch the boundaries of.  I know the movie is supposed to be creating the fantasy of what the place was marketing, but I don't need it thrown in my face.  The final straw was the master of ceremonies sampling, er singing \\"Like a Virgin\\" to the Duke surrounded by mincing butlers.<br />I threw in an extra star because the movie does have great sets, costumes, and a lot of work was done on the choreography.  I liked the director's previous stuff (\\"Strictly Ballroom\\" and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\").  I'm sure the extremes they take this style to are intentional, and I admire the risk-taking, but once again, try writing some new songs if you want to call your movie a musical.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I don't like precocious child actors, because they usually can't act. Haley Joel Osment is an exception, he can act better than most professional adult actors. He did a tremendous job in this movie, but the film was dragged down by the dreadful plot.<BR>This updated Pinochio story started promisingly. It then reached a point where having built up everyones emotions, the storytellers didn't seem to be able to find a satisfying ending. So it dragged on, and on, and on, and then there wasn't a satisfying ending at all.<BR>Surely a better ending would have been to create a whole android family (inc. 'mummy'), using the new technolgy and to adjust the audiences and android's perception of what being real, really means.
6305627347|5.0|The fun guys who put this together fully intended to see how much they could get away with.  As the story goes, even the title (after others were rejected) slipped by the censors.  Once the censors got it, it was too late to change it, so score one for the good guys.  <br />I'm pretty liberal with letting my kids view movies.  This one I keep away from them.  It's loaded with possibly more profanity per minute than I've ever seen in a movie.  But you know what? When I saw the movie, I hadn't laughed as loud in a long time, and I'm embarrassed to say it was at all the childish parts.  Embarrassed, but extremely pleased I saw it.  <br />But I would not give the movie five stars if it was just a lot of potty humor.  Well, maybe I would.  But this one has a lot more.  For one thing, it's a musical, with original, funny, full-length songs (take note &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;).  And they're songs that tie in with the plot of the movie, not just ones where the plot stops so someone can sing a song.  Not that you'll ever hear most of them on any airwaves.  <br />And, agree with it or not, the social satire is excellent.  The major theme, of course, is censorship itself. But we get to see excellent shots taken at Sadaam Hussien.  We also see Satan as a somewhat sympathetic character, as we hear a song from his point of view.  While they also poke fun at the true odds of anyone actually making it to heaven, you'll be surprised at how heart-wrenching Kenny's final act of heroism is at the end of the movie.  <br />Great film.  Too bad I have to find time to watch it when the kids are away.
B00003CXXP|2.0|as we all know, this film was originally intended to be directed by Stanly Kubric. a genius film maker who always puts a dark side to everyhting he makes. sadley he died before completing his story. then theres spielberg. another brillinat director but is on a whole differnt page. he is more on the happy go lucky side than dark and scary like kubric. it is so easy to pick out the parts of this film that are kubric and the parts that where spielberg. its like jumping back and forth between two movies! one minute there are dark cities with crime and polution, the next there is a walking teddy bear and robin williams! dont get me wrong! i think the backgrounds and special effects where wonderful but they can only do so much for a movie. thats the reason i gave this two stars. this film should have either been based on one director's ideas or not made at all. plus the ending is completly redicuous! the movie takes a serious u turn and flies off into the distance. any movie with an ending like &quot;3000 years layer&quot; can not be good! if the film was just kubric, it would have been fine, or if it was just spielberg, it would have been fine. but mixing the two together is like disney meets rambo! if you want a good future sci fi movie, try ridley scott's BLADE RUNNER or Katshiro Otomo's AKIRA.
B00005QW5X|5.0|...<br />Hedwig is easily the best film in the history of its relatively limited genre.  I have to admit first that I was skeptical upon hearing a description of the film--transsexual East German glam rock singer makes good in Midwestern buffet venues.   In fact, the genre of transsexual/transvestites coming to grips with their identity has never held any appeal to me.  The critically-acclaimed Boys Don't Cry stands out as one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I felt that film took far too much for granted--that we should feel sympathy for an admittedly confused individual who nevertheless lives by writing bad checks, deception, and keeping bad company.  Hedwig, however, avoids all these flaws and makes a meaningful statement that transcends specific questions of gender identity.  It does so with a high degree of sophistication, wit, literacy, great acting, and a terriffic score...<br />I should add that this film wouldn't have been half as successful if it were not for a truly inspired score.  I've never heard of the composer before (Stephen Trask), but it's clear this individual has a gift for song-writing for stories not exceeded by anyone of his generation.  I eagerly await his next venture.
B000001ELR|5.0|Just to let you know even though Ace Frehley's face is on the album he never played or contibuted to it. Besides that this album is good heavy metal. Thunderous drums, machine-gun guitars. Songs like &quot;I LOVE IT LOUD&quot;, &quot;ROCK AND ROLL HELL&quot;, &quot;KEEP ME COMIN'&quot;, and &quot;DANGER&quot; are excellent pieces of material. My favorite song on the album is a toss up between, &quot;ROCK AND ROLL HELL&quot; OR &quot;KEEP ME COMIN'&quot;. I love this album and to be a KISS fan you must have this album.
B0000041LL|5.0|With no exception, every performance in this set is outstanding. I was especially taken by their performance of the op. 130 quartet, and the Grosse Fuge. Their dynamics, synchronicity, tone, phrasing, everything, is 99.9% perfect. I definitely recommend this, and it will not disappoint.
B00000AFDW|5.0|This Reunion KISS album of 1998 is the best studio effort I ever seen. When the band reunited in 1996 they became bigger than they were in the 70s. This new album catches all the life this band has and how much the fans mean to KISS. I became a huge KISS PSYCHO when I listened to this album. This album is nothing like any other KISS album before. It's sound is leaning more towards the heavy metal side with loud guitars and really loud drum beats. The album has it all.<br />The title track opener, \\"Psycho Circus\\" starts out with circus music and noises and then Paul starts out with a heavy metal guitar riff and Peter starts to bang the drums and Paul screams, \\"YEAH!!\\". The song has awsome loud guiat solos by Ace and really good drum beats by Peter. The trademark song of the album is \\"I Pledge Allegiance To The State of Rock and Roll.\\" Some lyrics like, \\"I gave my blood and I gave my soul. It stood my ground and I took control. The legend's growing as the story is told. I Pledge Allegiance To The State of Rock and Roll.\\" It has a EXTREMELY loud guitar solo and is just to cool to be true.<br />Ace's song, \\"Into The Void\\" is definitely one of the loudest songs on the album. Really cool lyrics and a excellent job on the drums. This is definitely a song that describes Ace and Peter. The really good tune by Gene is \\"WE ARE ONE.\\" This song is about the band's unity with the fans. This song is one of KISS's best ballads. The next track, \\"You Wanted The Best\\" is an excellent song. The explains why KISS is the Best. Hey, you wanted the best and you got the best, right? That's what the song is about. The cool thing is all band members did lead vocals.<br />The next track, \\"Raise Your Glasses\\" somewhat describes the US's unity. Some lyrics like, \\"Everyone around the nation Raise Your Glasses cus we're the champions.\\" The last two tracks, \\"Dreamin\\" and \\"Journey of 1,000 Years\\" are excellent closers to an excellent album. The last song \\"Journey\\" is acoustic and electric guitar and has some of Peter's best drum beats ever.<br />AFTER YOU LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM, YOU WILL BECOME TRAPPED INTO KISS'S PSYCHO CIRCUS!!!!nd has some of Peter's best drum beats ever. <br />AFTER YOU LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM, YOU WILL BECOME TRAPPED INTO KISS'S PSYCHO CIRCUS!!!!
B000002O7C|3.0|As usual, Basil Poledouris delivers an exceptional score. The UNUSUAL is that there is barely 29 minutes worth of music on the CD. Is that EVERY bit of music that was in the movie? I don't think so.....So why the selective editing? Some of the cuts on the Disc are less than a minute long!<br />  The music is great, and for the price Amazon is selling for, I guess it's worth it. But I can't go higher than 3 Stars for what amounts to a sampler disc.
B000001ELL|5.0|In 1979 after KISS released the four solo albums of 1978 they all reunited. Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss and Paul Stanley joined in New York to write the album. The disco era was in power at that time and they decided to move into a disco sound. The album in general was a mix of hard rock, pop, disco, and heavy metal. A lot of great songs came of the album like the two singles written by Paul Stanley and Desmond Child(Aerosmith) were &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You&quot; and &quot;Sure Know Something&quot;. The solo album for Ace Frehley inspired him to write meterial which he do as much as Gene and Paul. Ace redid Rolling Stones classic &quot;2,000 Man&quot; and wrote &quot;Hard Times&quot; and &quot;Save Your Love&quot;.
0399226907|5.0|The genius of this book is the holes.  Kids love to stick their fingers in them, or to peer through to the next page ... and to the delight of the parent the holes don't tear or fall off like so many of the doodads in kid's books.  This gluttonous caterpillar is an IDEAL choice for a board book.<br />It's also a cute story that makes children laugh.  The Amazon reviews here spoil the plot :-) but really it is a colorful and fun book -- with holes -- and a theme of transformation, that the grown-up can bear reading over and over and over.  I wish only that Carle's other books were as good.
B000059T5O|5.0|Musical collaborations like \\"Wicked Grin\\", often, look a lot better on paper than they sound on my CD player. John Hammond, veteran intrepeter of country blues meets Tom Waits, ex-lush life poet turned avant-gardist. Hammond is not a songwritter, but has a gritty baritone and falsetto capable of an astounding range, like his idol, Robert Johnson. Waits, a sort of postmodern Kurt Weill, who writes haunting, often savage, sometimes tender, always evocative songs depicting society's outsiders. Given the each man's idosyncratic career path and the unique artistic gifts of Mr. Waits and Mr. Hammond, the potential for a creative disaster is almost a given. I could build a bridge to Babylon with the compact discs of failed collaborations, such as this. As much as I am loathe to admit it, \\"Wicked Grin\\" is a rare occasion when it works.<br />Tom Waits and John Hammond appear to intuitively understand each others' strengths and weaknesses. As producer, Waits makes it a stripped down affair, which is the best setting for Hammond's smoky voice. Hammond's signing isn't as gritty as some of his delta blues, but the added clarity of his singing enhances Wait's beautiful lyrics. The production values are lean, but the addition of ex-Sir Douglas Quintet wunderkind Augie West's Hammond organ adds definition to the sparse sound. \\"Jockey Full of Bourbon\\" is a favorite where Augie West's tex-mex accordion and Hammond's cabaret style vocal are a suprising reinvention of the original. Hammond's chilling vocal in \\"Murder In the Red Barn\\" is as unsettling as it is brilliant. This wonderful collboration has me lusting for a second effort from these two brillant and uniquely talented musicians.
B00005V9HH|5.0|\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is one of those movies that simply makes you say \\"wow.\\" When I first saw this film in the theater, it was only because the movie that my wife and I wanted to see was sold out. Without knowing anything about it -- not a word -- we bought our tickets and headed into the auditorium. Little did I know that within the next two hours I would be witness to one of the finest pieces of moviemaking ever created.<br />Bryan Singer's wonderful direction and Chris McQuarrie's story are flawless. The movie engrosses from start to one-whopping-of-a finish and, like you've probably already heard, will make you want to see it again. The characters are memorable, with Benecio del Toro's and Steven Baldwin's roles really standing out. And Kevin Spacey, as in everything he does, is masterful.<br />When the film was first released on DVD, there were the \\"usual\\" extras, but now, finally, the masterpiece has been given the treatment it so rightfully deserves, with deleted scenes, better commentary, high-def transfer, and a whole truckload of stuff that fans of the movie -- and film buffs in general -- will cherish. A \\"Special Edition\\" was in order, and now, it's here.<br />\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is a movie worthy of your time. This DVD will see to that -- I can guarantee it.

Well, Bueller this was the movie that was it. It's \\"so choice.\\" The music from the movie is cool I loved that song \\"Big City\\" whent they were going to Chicago. Ferris is cool. His friend is cool. His car is cool. Everything about it was just cool. Just a lot of memorable scenes. This is my movie and I love it. Peace.

6301174240|5.0|Can I just say that this is an awesome film. It's the [best]. It's whatever good thing you want to call it. I enjoyed it immensely back in the day I will always. I remember my brothers and I would watch this movie all the time, even my older sister who was grown and moved out the house. She used to laugh everytime at the \\"Come Together\\" part. Also, we even named our dog \\"Skipper\\" after the dog in the movie. I remember me and my brother would dance around the house to the Young version of Bad and smooth criminal and all of that. This was an amazing movie and I will always love it. I thank Michael for making this film it's great and I will never grow tired of it. We used to rent this video all the time from the video store and we even bought the Sega Genesis game of this film! I love it.
6301174240|5.0|I am an avid Micheal Jackson fan. Ever since I was eight, and now nearly eleven years later, more than ever. Moonwalker is beyond awesome. I have the entire movie memorized. It's fast paced and fun, and filled with clips of his classics. It's something that you can watch for forever, one of those videos that you will never part with. I guarantee that!! Enjoy!
B00000490M|5.0|This was the movie me and my brothers would watch all the time. Especially my older brother, he would always rent this movie from the little local video store and would just keep playing it over and over and I would just watch it all the time and enjoy it. Who doesn't know about the HOLY &quot;WAX ON WAX OFF!&quot; that is iconic! But yeah, this movie was it for me back in the day. It's still good. Loved the music and I loved when they played &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; in the movie. It had it all. Recommended.
B000051S44|5.0|Hey it might be light on story-line &amp; dialogue but the on-board camera work plus those magical sounds,to me,are what make this movie something really special.After all the years since this movie was made,I'm finding it pretty hard to recall another movie on racing that comes even close to this classic.
B000002J1X|4.0|I have to say this album has to be Yes's entry into Mainstream Jazz. With a bass player who can play as fast as a frog jumps to catch a fly (Chris Squire), a guitar player who won't play very heavy (Peter Banks), an organist who does his stuff with one hand and plays the knobs, drawbars, and switches with the other (Tony Kaye), a jazz drummer who did for jazz what Keith Moon did for hard-edged rock and roll (Bill Bruford), and a singer with a high tenor-falsetto up his sleeve (Jon Anderson).<br />Usually when you think of Yes, you think of freaky science fiction paintings, but the original line-up shines its own limelight on their first two albums; Yes and Time And A Word. Yes (the first album), was the band just starting out (which most first albums sound like), but Time And A Word was something better for us to listen to. It's got very good jazz beats to it, it has good music to listen to at a party, but to every good album there is a down side...<br />I'm talking about the orchestra. Some songs with the orchestra are ok, but it drowns out the organ at times. The only ok songs are Richie Havens' No Oppertunity Necessary No Experience Required, the mega-opus The Prophet, the short-love song Clear Days, and the title track Time And A Word. On those songs the orchestra isn't very interfent with Yes doing their stuff, but others like the fearful Then, & Buffalo Springfield's Everydays. The orchestra just interferes with the music and drowns out all of Tony Kaye's organ leads and most of Peter Banks' guitar solos.<br />A few songs could've been better, but overall the albums is pretty good. I just can't believe that this album didn't make Yes famous, it took their next album, undoubtedly entitled The Yes Album, because they were about to be dropped by Atlantic Records from their label, but it all worked out in the end....There's A Time, And The Time Is Now And It's Right For Me,<br /> There's A Word, And The Word Is Now And It's Right For Me.\\"
B00000JZIK|3.0|\\"The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn't exist,\\" says con man Kint (Kevin Spacey), speaking of the \\"heavy\\" in the movie, Keyser Soze--whose identity is kept under wraps until the end of the film.<br /><br />Soze is depicted as a criminal mastermind who stays in the shadows, using people at every turn to attain his goals, which themselves lack clarity.<br /><br />Of course, the police force is under his thumb.  Does anyone ever make a picture involving police in which they are not corrupt?  There must be a reason why the usual fare foisted onto the American theatergoer always, ALWAYS shows our paid public servants (police, FBI, CIA, prison officers, etc.) as worse than the criminals we pay them to catch and keep behind bars.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a convoluted, confusing drama with a lot of explosions, violence and nastiness.  Probably a lot of people will enjoy it.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre
0395389496|5.0|This amazingly illustrated Christmas story about a little boy who is anxiously awaiting Santas visit on Christmas Eve.  When he hears a train whistle he runs outside to meet a beautiful train which takes him to the North Pole where he is given the first Christmas present, a bell from Santas sleigh.  Sadly when he returns home he finds that the bell is missing.  It had slipped through a hole in his pocket.  The disappointed little boy returns to bed.  On Christmas morning he opens a small box to find his sleigh bell nestled inside.  The parents complement the beautiful bell.  But oddly it does not make a sound.  Only the little boy really knows the truth that only the people who truly believe in Santa Claus can hear the bells ring.<br /> I love this story.  I used to love having this story read to me.  With the recent reading of it I remembered just how much I love the story and illustrations.  The pictures are amazing, add that to the story and this book completely captures the season of Christmas.  The author does a wonderful job with the miracle of Christmas.  The author illustrate with word and picture the importance of the miracle of Christmas and how important it is for you to believe in that miracle.  As well as all the miracles life has to offer, all it takes is a little bit of faith and imagination.
0971855110|5.0|Last summer, I happily donated my organization books (and let me tell you, I had a library and a half!) to our public library. Earlier that year, I had become a FlyBaby and thanks to FlyLady's incredible system, had baby stepped my way into a completely transformed way of living. I will always be grateful!<br />FlyLady's wit, wisdom and just plain talk speaks to everyone who has ever struggled with organization. I know I speak for thousands of women all over the world who benefit from her system when I say, no one teaches organization better because she doesn't just address the unmade bed or the piles of unwashed laundry. She's been in the trenches, struggled herself and speaks from experience and with victory over the problem. And that makes all the difference in the world.<br />I also need to mention that I personally know FlyLady (after becoming a FlyBaby) and will vouch for her personal integrity: she walks her talk, every single bit of it. I am buying several of FlyLady's books to give to friends and will treasure my own personal copy, too.
B00003CX5P|3.0|There are some really, exciting wonderful effects in this movie.  It just doesn't have the HEART or artistry it should. A little Jar Jar Binks goes a long way, and I understand the need for comic relief and the attempt to amuse the kids, so I wasn't overly bothered by him.  Some restraint was needed, however, and that wasn't there.  And in the extra material on the DVD it is sooooooo apparent George Lucas picked the WRONG KID.  He must have fancied himself such a \\"Great Director\\" that he could make Jake Lloyd look like a junior Jack Nicholson.  George Lucas does technical/visual stuff very well (\\"we'll fix it in post\\"), but he is not artistic enough to get heart and soul performances out of his actors -- who of course play second fiddle to the effects.  He tends to stunt an actor's creativity.  That's common knowledge.  But from what I hear, G.L. learned from his mistakes and redeems himself in \\"Attack of the Clones\\" to a great extent. Let's hope so!
B00005Y1XZ|2.0|I've heard a lot about Costello over the years and decided to give this  set a try.Bad idea.His singing is grating,and well,the music is just plain mediocre.There is really nothing more you can say for it.
B00003CX8I|4.0|I have read most of the reviews for this movies and I must say I am not all that impressed with them. Don't get me wrong I loved the movie and I am a huge X-Men fan, but we have to realize that Rouge did not get that white streak in her hair from Magneto's machine she got that when she took Ms Marvels powers and that is also when she got the ability to fly. Not to mentioned that they kill Sabretooth he is like one of the best villians that they have as for Toad I don't remember him ever being in the comic books. I was heartbroken when they did no include Gambit, Beast and Juggernaut on the movie. I think that if they make a second part they need to include more of the original comic book characters. As for the cast I think everyone did a great job if they would have picked a different crew I might not have liked the movie as much. The movie all in all was great.
B00000IGGA|1.0|This is one of the worst albums I've ever had the displeasure to try and listen to.Aside from the drunken,groggy,sounds-like-he gargled-with-a-mouth-full-of-razorblades-voice,the music itself has little merit.I've always suspected those who claimed to like Waits music(if you wish to insult the medium)are typically of the pompous,wanting-to-appear-deep crowd.You don't have to listen to obscure,crappy music to be deep,or to pose as deep.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is quite possibly the finest science fiction novel ever written and fares well in comparison to non-genre novels as well. Combining elements of adventure, romance, political intrigue, sci-fi/fantasy elements and character study in a single work would be a daunting task to begin with. Herbert has successfully accomplished this in a fully realized and fleshed-out universe with a coherent history, economy, ecology and political structure. And beyond that, he uses this setting to examine such wide-ranging issues as the impact of technology on human society, the essence of self-discovery and the world-shaking (and potentially disastrous) impact of messianic figures on society.<br />The characters are memorable, multi-layered and possessed of plausible motivations. The settings are diverse and well-articulated as is the futuristic technology. And the techno-speak doesn't get in the way of the story.<br />Additional gems await those with a varied knowledge base such as the fact that the doctor, Yueh, is named for the Chinese god of epidemics.<br />Don't be disuaded from reading this marvelous book by the movie or mini-series. The first is unintelligible if you haven't already read the book and both succumb to symbolism at the end that is not in the book.<br />Dune is one of the (very) few books worth reading more than once.
B000002UCN|3.0|I know that this is a collection that covers his music only until 1976...and that there was a dark horse records compilation that came later in 1989, which in my opinion was a better collection-it included three new songs and had Harrison's full artistic input...and his choices were exquiste...i don't know what kind of album would have resulted had george had any say in this earlier compilation...but somehow i feel that if beatles era songs were included-&quot;the inner light&quot; would have to have had made the grade-it's a beautiful tune which features the sitar, and would make this collection more complete, but with cd-r's now, it easy to upgrade this collection into something more complete...something that should be done for harrison as an official release...a comprehensive hits package that builds upon on this hits collection as well as his latter best of dark horse would be in order, not just for the fans but for the casual listener. How many casual listeners out there long to hear all the songs they have loved from the radio by this great musician?....a disc that would include his best songs from the beatles to the wilburys, (or even just his solo career which has plenty of materiel in of itself. On the &quot;live in japan&quot; album put out by harrison you will find perhaps a sketch of what a great harrison compilation should be like...An album with this title should be re-made for the current CD market, remastered and repackaged...it's a pity that you can't find barely any harrison materiel in the record bins at the shops, whilst lesser acts have their bins full...harrison deserves better, more now than ever, he deserves better...
B00005MP58|5.0|I cannot say enough superlatives about this DVD.  I first saw it on A&amp;E a few years ago and loved it - instantly.  Now, that I own the DVD and can watch in in total (5 hrs!), I am even more a fan.  The language is, in my opinion, exquisite, as are the landscape and acting.  The manners and customs of people of this era have always fascinated me and the actors' portrayals are excellent.  When a character is to &quot;vex&quot; you, believe me, you are abundantly vexed. Colin Firth really brought Mr. Darcy to life for me as did Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.  If you enjoy period pieces, this is one you must own!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I loved the way the movie was made. The sequence of scenes is generally in reverse exept the black/white parts where the story of Sammy Jankis is told. There are no tearjerking attempts made &amp; the actors are shown for what they represent nothing more or less. <BR>It does take about 30 minutes to get grabbed by the story. <BR>The ending (beginning) just was not something one thinks of but really is when reflecting upon the movie the most plausible option left. <BR>Truly amazing storytelling.
0783225792|5.0|We know right from the beginning that the movie does not end hapilly.  We see Ace Rothstein walking to his car, dressed ostentatiosly.  It blows up into flames when he starts the ignition.  The flames on the screen then make a transition into the bright lights of the Las Vegas casinos and the story begins.<br />Notice the theme of greed causing people's downfall in this movie.  The rich Japanese man that comes into their casino walks away with a fortune in winnings.  But they bring him back and he bets small and still wins.  But because of his greed, his perception is that he's losing $90,000 a hand instead of winning $10,000.  So he increases his bets and loses all his former winnings plus an extra million dollars.  Then there are the two guys cheating at the blackjack tables.  Ace says that they could have gotten away with it if they weren't so greedy.  They beat his hand in with a hammer in the back room and told his buddy to spread the word that the casino was no joke anymore.  Ultimately, the greed of the whole casino crew will cause its downfall.<br />If you've ever read \\"The Great Gatspy\\" you'll see a lot of similar themes in this movie.  Ace Rothstein reminds me of the wealthy, ostentatious Gatspy.  Rothstein says that in Vegas, \\"love costs money.\\"  He buys his wife Ginger over a million dollars worth of jewlery to get her to marry him.  She shows off the jewlery to her daughter as testimony to how much he must love her.  Nicki reminds me of Wolfsheim who is behind Gatpsy and whose corruption and brutality are profound.  <br />There was one part of the movie I totally did not understand.  Ace is sitting at his office desk when his secretary calls him saying the state commisioner is there to see him.  He says to send him in then call him back four minutes later.  Ace then stands up, revealing that he is fully dressed in a suit and shoes and everything but pants.  He then walks to his closet and puts pants on.  He has a talk with the commisioner whose relativehe fired for complete incompetence.  The secretary calls him as instructed and he says \\"ok\\" and hangs up.  What was this all about?<br />The story builds up and gradually unravels.  You can see it's going to fall apart.  Besides the beginning part about Ace being blown up in his car, there's Nicki's uncontrolled brutality and rebellion from the law and disregard for \\"the bosses back home\\" that gets out of control.  Then there's Phil Green.  He's the casino's \\"clean front man\\" who poses as the president of the casino but doesn't really do anything.  He turns out to be a real estate hustler and one of his affairs goes awry exposing the corruption of the casino.  Ace is initially attracted to Ginger when he sees her on the casino surveilance stealing money from a man she's with.  He argues with her then she starts throwing stacks of his chips in the air.  As if this weren't a bad enough indication, Ace marries her after she turns him down saying she doesn't love him.  He basically talks her into it with the promise of money.  Later, Ginger's drug problems and leech of an ex-boyfriend will contribute to the decline of the story.  Rothstein's ego becomes  \\"bigger than his casino\\" as Nicki put it and their relations begin to break down.  The FBI strikes the coup de grace as they finally come in and shut down the casino.  <br />I find the saddest part of the story about Ace Rothstein.  He just wanted to run a legitamite casino.  He's great at what he does and he's so committed to doing his job right.  He failed only because he didn't play \\"the game\\" with the corrupt governement officials and the Union bosses who gave him the money to run the casino.  He even cares about his daughter, unlike Ginger.  She kidnapped her just to get money from Ace.  He even loved his wife and put up with her longer than you would think he'd be able to.  His life was only spared because there was a steel plate under the car where the bomb was placed.  As it turned out he thinks he \\"knew who lit the fuse\\"-- his long time friend Nicki.  In the end, Rothstein goes back to where he started.  Picking winners in sporting events for gambling.  You have to question whether he served a useful purpose to society.  Sure, a casino is entertainment for people, but as Ace tells us, the real purpose in Las Vegas is to get your money.  Even though the corrupt casino was taken over, it was just replaced by another one where parents gamble away their kid's college savings, as he said.  But still, Ace Rothstein stands as the greatest character in the movie.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This movie is a twisted Pinnochio story.  I was kind of disturbed by the similarities actually.  I was expecting to see something more than that but that's all this really was.  Don't get me wrong, the visualizations were amazing and the actors did a good job but about half way through the movie I found myself thinking, &quot;This is just rediculous.  Is this over yet?&quot;  <br />One thing I will say, you can tell exactly at what point in the story Kubrick left off and Spielberg took over.<br />Bottom line, in my opinion, if you want to see something for it's great visualizations then this isn't a bad choice.  If you want to see a movie with an amazing story line, look elsewhere.
0441172717|5.0|I loved this book. I liked how Mr. Herbert described various objects and habitats. The characterization is phenominal. This IS one of the best books ever.<br />What happens in the beginning of the book is a whole story of it's own so I won't reveal too much for those who haven't read the book. <br />The main character is a fifteen year old boy named Paul Atreides. His father, the Duke Leto Atreidies is forced to move from the planet Caladan (A planet that is rich with water and forests.) to Arrakis AKA Dune. Dune is a harsh desert world were water is scarce and food is even scarcer. The thing that the planet is best known for is the spice Melange. Melange is used for food, drugs, and many other things. Melange helps people see into the future, Starship pilots use it to pilot better. There are a few people who can have special powers by using it. Paul is one those, he is also the only male. The natives also beleive that he is their Messiah and that he will lead them to freedom.<br />Dune intertwines politics, religion, ecology, action, and adventure all into one story. I love this book and I give it a *marks a five into Paul-Muad'Dib's stillsuit\\" FIVE!
B00003CXI0|1.0|When I went to see this movie, the first sentence that flashed through my mind was \\"This movie is nothing like<BR>the book.\\" It was horrible. It left out all the best parts of the story and changed the parts it did have. And for  God's sake, couldn't they have gotten an actor that looked slightly liked Harry's vivid description  in the book? ...And the same goes for everything else in this movie. MUCH less than magical, at least in my and all loyal fans of the books' opinions.
0393307050|5.0|What a happy surprise to find that I simply can't stop reading this series.  I had long heard fans of this series sing its praises, but I was always put off by the thought of reading a seafaring military saga.  My few attempts at historical &quot;sailing&quot; novels made me believe that the genre was chock-full of misogyny and slow plot-lines.  After reading &quot;Master and Commander&quot; I have revised my estimation of the genre and have resolved to continue reading this series in its entirety (I am now on the third Aubrey/Maturin book).  <BR>     I agree wholeheartedly with the recommendations by the reviewer from Charlottesville -- in particular, skip trying to figure out all of the sailing jargon and just go with the flow of the novels.  They move along at great pace; you'll never be bored.  I do keep a dictionary by my side to look up some of the more arcane and obsolete vocabulary used.  (Indeed, the OED would be a great choice if you have access to it.)  And that's half the fun of reading these novels -- immersing yourself in a bygone age of such different morals, manners, language, knowledge, and priorities.  Of course, the other half of the fun is getting to know Aubrey and Maturin.  O'Brien's ability to draw these characters so rich in their complexity is nothing short of amazing.<BR>     As a relatively young female reader who never thought she'd see the day that a seafaring tale would hold her interest, I highly recommend this series.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|Prince is right back where he started... an exceptionally talented underground musician with a strangely mixed message. On The Rainbow Children it is difficult to separate the religious overtones from the music because the cartoonish narration sporadically interlaced throughout the album is about a subtle as a blow torch in a wax museum. I find myself cringing every time I hear this sophomoric baritone voice beaming from my bass speaker. The Rainbow Children is about message and content with a very competent jazz arrangement to prop it up. <br />Continuing on the content theme, Prince seems to have a odd obsession for creating new nations of followers, which is now bordering on the theatre of the absurd. First it was the \\"Revolution\\" followed by the \\"New Power Generation\\" and now the \\"Rainbow Children\\". Is Prince giving us a lesson in marketing or is he truly searching for the offspring \\"of a new breed leader\\" to carry us off to some celestial nirvana? <br />Musically speaking, TRC is a finely crafted record with jazz influences interwoven into this edgy piece of work. There are plenty of musical gems in this tightly choreographed arrangement that are difficult to overlook in spite of the lyrics. Prince's funky fusion forays hearken back to a previous release called \\"The Vault - Friends 4 Sale\\". The Rainbow Children is gutsy, rhythmic with plenty of guitar to break down the doors of contemporary R&B pop. Musically this record is solid, however it's not quite up to the Vault's standard.<br />Personally I'd like to see Prince shed the message in a bottle approach and focus more on the music. In fact I'd recommend he eighty six the lyrics altogether and just play his guitar. I think fusion is a logical step for Prince and hopefully his fans will encourage him to move in that direction. <br />In spite of the mixed messages and unnecessary narrative, the musical arrangements are solid enough to warrant the investment.
B00005OWEG|5.0|After more than 20 years since its theatrical release we can finally see Coppola's vision of Vietnam as it was meant to be seen. Although the so-called deleted scenes in many movies are often times both minor and inconsequential to the plot, that is certainly not the case with Apocalypse Now Redux. With over 48  minutes restored this version takes the focus away from Willard's search for Kurtz and brings it back to a more general statement about Vietnam and Western Colonialism. This change of focus also brings the similarities between ANR and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, much more apparent, which illustrates the relevancy of his work to contemporary history. With this change the emphasis of the film is brought back to the soldiers who fought in Vietnam and the tragedy of war. In retrospect it is easy to see why many of the scenes were deleted if one considers the cold-war climate, as well as the national embarrasment that the Vietnam War represented at that time. Regardless of what one thinks of that war, Coppola's vision will stand out as one of the most intense and thoughtprovoking exploarations into the spectacle of war ever produced. While it would have been nice to see Coppola's documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness: The Making of Apocalypse Now\\" included with the release of Redux, the flawless picture quality of the widescreen format and booming Dolby sound still make this a great dvd to add to your collection. You haven't seen Apocalypse Now until you have seen this restored version, truly a landmark in American cinema.
B00004U8P9|5.0|As any fan will tell you, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is the best movie ever!  You can't go wrong with dancing transvestites, people turning to stone, and catchy songs like the time warp.  Absolutly astounding!
B00005J6UP|5.0|First of all.  I'm obsessed with DVDs.  More than that I'm obsessed with Special Edition DVDs - especially ones with Making of Featurettes.  Even further, the Goonies is awesome.  On to the reviewing.  On this DVD you will find a fabulous cast commentary.  The reason it is fabulous is because the ENTIRE cast is there (along with Dick Donner) and they're all spectacularly grown up.  Corey Feldman is loud and obnoxious and Sean Astin never gets his message out to Cyndi Lauper, but that's why I love them.  Also included is a Making of featurette from the eighties.  There's behind the scenes stuff and it is absolutely fantastic.  Last but not least the *entire* Cyndi Lauper video for 'Goonies R Good Enough' is on there.  All 11 minutes.  I highly suggest you go buy this DVD - RIGHT NOW.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I know that's a tag line from Reboot not Star Wars but it fits sooo well. My first rational reaction to this was &quot;It took Lucus 16 years to write this mess?!&quot; It is pretty, I'll give it that much. The special effects are gorgeous and so is Ewen McGregor. That's not enough. This film has serious plot problems. Too many to go into here. In addition I felt that long sections of the movie were just commercials for the tie in products. The pod race is the prime example of this. You just knew there would be a pod racer toy and video game. Sure enough there were. The character of Jar Jar is so offensive that there are actually people out there offering bootleg tapes with the promise that most of his scenes have been edited out. Not since Barney has there been a character that is so hated.  If you really feel you must spend money on this (I wish I hadn't)then by all means get the DVD. The special effects will look better and it will be easier to skip the really bad stuff than it is with video. OR better yet get the Weird Al Yankavic Live DVD where he does &quot;The Saga Begins&quot; His retelling of the story set to &quot;The day the music died.&quot; It is a much more enjoyable experience.
B000002B7M|5.0|There really isn't anything bad you could say about this album. Being the breakthrough it was for Ozzy, it's almost necessary for anyone and everyone to check this out. <br />Made in the late 70's and early 80's, this album is the blueprint for a great rock album. It has songs that are radio friendly, but still are great songs to underground fans. Songs like &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;Goodbye To Romance&quot; may be hits, but were absolutely amazing. They truly show the songwriting talent of Ozzy and Randy Rhoads. Other songs like &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; and &quot;No Bone Movies&quot; are great rock songs, that aren't really recognized enough by pop culture. Sure, this album isn't Ozzy's best, but it is still a great album. It is certainly the best one for anyone wanting to explore his music to buy first. <br />If you are already a fan, but don't own this album, you should really get this one. Later, try the best albums, &quot;Diary Of A Madman&quot;, and &quot;No Rest For The Wicked&quot;.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Blondie is my favourite band ever; they were innovative, unique, and everything they did reeked of originality (but with obvious influences, the greatest being Girl Groups of the 60s). And they weren't afraid to take chances. Parallel Lines is their masterpiece.<BR>01. Hanging On The Telephone; Wonderful cover of The Nerves song, Debbie's vocals are rockin' (evokes Pat Benatar).<BR>02. One Way Or Another; Catty vocals, perfect pop rock. You all know this one.....one way or another.<BR>03. Picture This; The best New Wave love song?<BR>04. Fade Away And Radiate; An unsung and lost classic.<BR>05. Pretty Baby; The Shangri-Las provide the roots for this danceable and supremely fun song; wonderful lyrics,..., innocent vocals. A triumph.<BR>06. I Know But I Don't Know; excellent, one of my favourites on the album; mixes synthesizers and guitars for a wonderful hard rock effect. Debbie does NOT do all the vocals (Chris Stein guests).<BR>07. 11:59; Definitely hard rock, but Debbie lends it a soft edge that is endearing.<BR>08. Will Anything Happen?; Similar in feel to track 07; excellent chorus, you can really bounce to this.<BR>09. Sunday Girl; What can I say? One of their best, and probably the best on the album; icy cool lyrics, 60s sound, Debbie's...vocals, and many, many versions to choose from [this version is the original, entirely in English; The Best Of Blondie includes a verse in French; The Platinum Collection has a rare recording entirely in French; and their Live album includes a wonderful live version]. This song gets better with every listen.<BR>10. Heart Of Glass; Everyone thought they sold out to disco with this, but it's a bit punkish in nature really. It sounded like they were having fun, and you will too. This is the original single version; The Best Of Blondie includes a remixed version that is shorter and missing some musical interludes and a verse.<BR>11. I'm Gonna Love You Too; Excellent cover of Buddy Holly standard.<BR>12. Just Go Away; Debbie is all tough chick in demeanor here, and it's a song of macho posturing, much like Rip Her To Shreds was; cheeky and fun.<BR>I won't bother talking about the bonus tracks, save for:<BR>13. Once I Had A Love (aka The Disco Song); An early version of Heart Of Glass, it's interesting to see how the band progressed to the final product, no doubt helped by Nigel Harrison, the album's producer. This cut is funky and chunky.<BR>
B00003CXUM|2.0|I anticipated this movie being captivating, heartbreaking and sentimental especially since I am quite a fan of HK &quot;real-life&quot; dramas like Chungking Express (the movie that inspired Quentin Tarentino's Pulp Fiction).  Instead, watching this movie made me feel like I was perhaps missing something all the Cannes and Toronto film award critics saw.  The movie never really captured me nor did it make me sympathize with the characters.  It was one of those &quot;artsy&quot; movies that leave critics in awe but moviegoers in disbelief...disbelief that we actually spent $$ and time watching this film.  It sets out trying to lure you into it's &quot;coolness&quot;: insinuating scenes of raindrops badgering broken down concrete buildings, softly vivid colors that defined the 60's, characters walking slowly in tune with slow romantic music, etc.  But that's just it, I felt the movie tried so hard to be &quot;artistic&quot; that it never gave us a chance to feel what the characters might be feeling.  The music was highly repetitive; trying to soak you in it's intended ambiance but I guarantee you would want to turn down the volume after you hear the movie's theme score for the pointless Xth time.  The story was convincing: two neighbors each find out that their corresponding spouses are having an affair with each other.  Imagine the feelings of guilt, denial, anger and curiousity you would have finding this out about your husband/wife.  Now picture those feelings trying to surface but unable to because of the fabulous clothes you're wearing or the melodramatic music that is controlling your slow, rehearsed movements.  That would be this movie.
630518299X|3.0|Jim Carrey. What can you say?. You either love him and see his incredible talent, or you hate him and refuse to see or acknowledge his talent. If you fall into the latter, well, that's too bad. Carrey went and tried to do something different with this film. He tried to show that he can act too. If you still don't see it, I recommend you seeing the early 90's TV movie \\"Doing Time On Maple Drive\\". In this film, Carrey plays Truman Burbank. A seemingly normal guy with a very normal, everyday life. He has a great house in a very picturesque seaside town, a great wife, and a good job. This is real life isn't it?. Then, Truman's world comes crashing down all around him. Everything he knew and had and throught to be true, turned out to be one big lie. Nothing is real. It seems that his whole life has been televised for the whole world to see. This isn't a town. It's a set. everything isn't real. His family members are all actors being paid for the job. The whole operation is being overseen by a producer, played very beautifully by the Oscar nominated Ed Harris, who's always good. At first, Truman thinks he's losing the mind. Then the truth comes out. This is a real showcase for Carrey and his talent. Yes, he is good. Yes, he can act. Yes, he's brilliantly talented. Some people already have their view on him and refuse to let actual truth come to them. It's a real shame. The movie was wonderfully directed with a real airy and haunting feel by Peter Weir. And don't worry Carrey fans, there is some goofball moments that will please the die hard fans of Carrey's comedic work. He should've been nominated for the Oscar. Weir and Harris were, but the star of the movie who made it work wasn't?. Where's the logic in that?. Oh well. \\"The Truman Show\\" is a fine piece of film. You'll likely have a nice experience viewing it.
0345404475|5.0|This is Philip K. Dick's best known work thanks to the Ridley Scott movie. The movie is an action-packed special effects extravaganza whereas the book is more introspective philosophical affair.<br />The novel tells the story of one day in the life of bounty hunter Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford in the movie). He lives in early twenty-first century San Francisco. A nuclear holocaust has wiped out most life on the planet. Most species are extinct, vast areas of the planet are uninhabitable and many people have migrated to colonies on Mars and other planets. Androids have been developed to function as workers on these colonies but they are forbidden on Earth. It's never made clear why they are forbidden on Earth but the penalty for coming to Earth is death and Deckard is the man who hunts down and kills the androids.<br />Much is made over mankind's newfound love for all forms of life. The peripheral character John Isadore finds a bug outside his apartment and is filled with joy at having found a wild living creature. Isadore is a \\"chickenhead,\\" genetically damaged and mentally enfeebled by the nuclear fallout of World War Terminus. Isadore starts to live with three of the androids that Deckard must retire. <br />It comes out late in the story that the androids are not mechanical robots but rather artificially created living beings with a 4-year life span. This explains why it is so hard for the bounty hunter to tell if someone is an android and why psychological testing of one's empathy with other living creatures is needed. There's a funny scene where Deckard discovers that Rachel Rosen is an android by noting her lack of reaction to a description of a babyskin wallet.<br />There's little point in trying to link all the plot points that are odds with each other. Dick wrote most of his novels in a hurry and not everything makes sense or is holistically consistent. That's okay. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is great escapist science fiction that I'll takeany day over The Scarlet Letter or somesuch literary torture.
0446678430|5.0|There is no real estate &quot;how to&quot; value in this book! I gave it 5 stars because when I was done reading it I came out with life saving solutions such as: stop working for corporate america, don't invest in 401k or stock market and concentrate fully in multi family real estate investments. I know it's the opposite of what you hear from CNBC but after reading this book you'll realise that this guy makes sense. For his message alone I wish this was required reading in college. This guy is brilliant!
B00003CY0V|1.0|Swordfish is one of the oddest action-adventure thrillers of the year. It starts out with one of the main characters, Gabriel [John Travolta], drinking coffee at a table with a couple of other guys. He is telling them his theories about how an old Al Pacino thriller named Dog Day Afternoon would have been a more honest movie if the bad guy had gotten away. The camera then moves back to reveal that he has been saying all this in the middle of a huge bank robbery. We see chaos. The thieves, of whom Gabriel is the leader, have strapped bombs to their hostages and are desperately negotiating with the police and FBI agents outside. Things go terribly wrong when a SWAT team member tries to rescue a hostage and accidentally sets off a tremendous explosion that kills the hostage and several policemen. This is shown in slow motion as the camera dramatically swirls 360 degrees around the unfolding disaster. The movie then jumps to four days earlier to show us the events leading to this moment. Though somewhat cruel, this opening scene is impressive and visually arresting.<br />The odd part is the rest of the movie, or about 90% of it. Rather than logically explaining what lead to the robbery, the movie's plot twists and turns so much that I still haven't figured out most of it. It has something to do a covert government agency, of which Gabriel seems to be a part. This agency has 9.5 billion dollars in 'forgotten' assets which, somehow, only Gabriel and an ultra right wing US Senator seem to know about. Gabriel wants the money to fight terrorism, he claims. This absurd storyline seems to be simply a pale outline on which to lay more explosions, a long and gratuitous car chase, an absurd, though thrilling, sequence involving a flying bus, and an excuse to show costar Halle Berry's breasts. As a result, when it's over, you don't feel electrified, you feel indifferent. And that's not what a thriller is supposed to do. <br />Part of the problem is in the construction of modern action flicks. The idea of letting the tension build has been replaced by having these movies start off literally with a bang. This creates a situation in which the writers give themselve a hard act to follow. It's sort of like beginning a joke with the punch line. The makers of Swordfish try to compensate for this by showing another thrilling event every five minutes. The result is what they call in the movie business 'overproduced'. Or, as Shakespeare put it, something 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' <br />John Travolta breezes through his role. It's not a stretch for him, since he's played similar characters several times before. Halle Berry is beautiful to watch and does a decent job as Ginger, who may be either Gabriel's lover, a government agent or both. The problem is that her role adds to the story's confusion and is essentially unnecessary. The bright spot is Hugh Jackman as Stanley, a computer hacker recently released from prison. He is commandeered by Gabriel to crack the bank's code so the money can be transferred electronically. Jackman is an actor promisingly close to major stardom. He gives Stanley a dimension and a meaning that aren't really present in the script. He manages to make something out of essentially nothing, and that takes real talent.
B000021YQV|5.0|...but System managed to beat the sophomore slump.  Toxicity is the second full-length album from the Armenian metal quartet, and it is head and shoulders above it's current peers in the music world.  Serj and crew draw on many things for the content in these songs; the mushrooming Prison-Industrial complex in the US, Corruption, State-sponsored violence, sex, drugs etc, and every song has not only thoughtful lyrics for us to ponder, but also stunning musical range to enjoy.<br />\\"Chop Suey\\" is probably the best-executed song on the album.  The rhythm changes are catchy, and Serj's stop-start singing style is infectious.  The unifying ingredient proves to be the beautifully sung chorus and final breakdown section where Serj dazzles us with the soulful side of his voice.  The song is a bona fide hit, and any metal band that gets a video into semi-regular play on MTV must be doing something right in that department.  \\"Needles\\" is at times humorous, but mostly sinister, and contains one of the most hauntinglt beautiful vocal sections where Serj sings: \\"Sitting in my room/with a needle in my hand/waiting for the tomb/of some old dying man.\\"  His vocals are still as raw as ever, and they compliment Daron Malkian's crushing guitar licks perfectly.  However, there is much more middle-eastern style vocalization on this record, and the results are stellar.  Almost every track is a potential hit.<br />\\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\" both talk about LA, and you get the sense that much of the inspiration for SOAD's work comes from their living environment.  The cover photo of the Hollywood sign re-worked is an amusing twist as well; is LA toxic because it's LA, or is System part of the problem?<br />Other standout tracks are \\"Science,\\" \\"Forest,\\" \\"Jet Pilot,\\" and \\"Psycho.\\"  \\"Shimmy\\" is another one of my favorites, combining hammer-pounding riffs with anti-brainwashing lyrics and incorporating a quirky little jazz bit.  Many of the songs on the album are potential singles, and only \\"X\\" seems to fall flat from its repetition and lack of deep subject matter.  In a sense, System can't really go simple and repetitive, because we've already seen how good they are when they're complex and innovative.<br />This band has come a long way since I first saw them in a tiny club in Santa Barbara in 1996, and they deserve any and all success that comes their way.  If they continue to put out albums with the same success rate as their first two, I think we can expect them to become heavy hitters in the metal world.  I can think of many bands that don't deserve it, but few that would deserve it more\\"X\\" seems to fall flat from its repetition and lack of deep subject matter.

B00005LOUP|3.0|The Grinch is the smash hit film version of Dr. Suess's beloved children's book, How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Only Hollywood knows how to take a short modern fairy tale and translate it into a frenzied, overblown spectacle. Despite all its excess, this movie has a lot of entertaining moments and a knockout performance by Jim Carrey as The Grinch. It's a role that's perfect for him, even though he is virtually unrecognizable under all that green, hairy makeup. In fact, ace makeup artists Rick Baker may have done too good a job. Instead of charming all children, this Grinch is apt to terrify a few of them. <br />It's nearly Christmas in Whoville, that wondrous town that exists inside a snowflake. Its citizens go all out for the holiday, which is their favorite time of year. Right now they are in the midst of a shopping frenzy, and only one resident, Cindy Lou Who [Taylor Momsen], wonders if the spirit of Christmas isn't getting lost in the rush to buy stuff. But she's just a little girl, and who is going to listen to her? After all, the only character who is decidedly not in the spirit is The Grinch, who lives up on Mt. Crumpit with only his dog, Max, for company. That's just fine with The Grinch, who hates everyone in Whoville anyway. He lived there as a kid, but the other children laughed at him and made him the butt of their cruel jokes. He has spent the last several years trying to make his heart so small that he won't feel anything. Cindy Lou takes pity on him and tries to including him in the festivities. When her idea backfires, The Grinch decides to ruin Christmas for everyone in Whoville, and poor Max is his unwilling accomplice.<br />Carrey, of course, has the movie's best role, and he has a blast with it. Momsen is winning as Cindy Lou. She's sweet but not sickeningly so. Christine Baranski is hysterical as the sexy Martha May Whovier, the only one who was nice to The Grinch as a child. He's secretly in love with her. If they gave Oscars to dogs, Max would have been nominated. He's a remarkable canine actor. The rest of the cast doesn't have a lot to do, but they all get to wear really cool makeup. <br />Before a movie ever goes before a camera, a color palette is chosen. These are the colors that will be emphasized throughout. While it's not something the average viewer often notices, this important decision defines the picture's tone. Someone decided it would be neat to use red and green almost exclusively in The Grinch. These are, after all, the colors associated with Christmas. The effect proves to be too much, giving the overall movie a much too electric and rather too hard look. Children probably won't be bothered by this, but adults may find it irritating after a few minutes. <br />The Grinch is decent family entertainment. Its heart is certainly in the right place, wisely emphasizing Dr. Suess's themes of the true meaning of Christmas and tolerance of those who are different. While I don't think it's destined to become a holiday classic in years to come, it's a mostly enjoyable way to fill a holiday evening

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Michael Eisner is the man who rules the Walt Disney Company. For many years, Jeffrey Katzenberg was his second-in-command. Katzenberg's most notable achievement was the revival of Disney's stagnant animated movie division. Under his guidance, the studio made commercially and artistically successful movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Several years ago, the two executives had a falling out, and Katzenberg exited Disney. He soon co-founded Dreamworks Studio with Steven Spielburg and David Geffen. That enterprise has been highly successful. Katzenberg is openly out to unseat Disney as the undisputed king of animation. Dreamworks had moderate success with The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado. Antz and Chicken Run were hits. Now comes Shrek, which is the highest grossing movie of 2001 so far. Since Mr. K's departure, Disney has had its share of hits [Tarzan] and misses Pocahantas]. This all goes to prove that the American competitive spirit is alive and well in Hollywood. Not only has the consumer benefited, so has the industry as a whole.<br />Shrek is one of the merriest and most mischievous animated movies ever made. It operates on two levels. Kids will see it as one thing, parent and older viewers as another. All age groups will have a great time. You might call it a revisionist fairy tale, one that manages to be smart, funny and thoroughly modern without once drifting into cynicism.<br />Shrek [voice of Mike Myers] is an ogre, a big, tall, lumbering creature who has ears that look like trumpets. One day the short, pompous, egotistical Lord Farquaad [John Lithgow] decides to kick all the fairy tale creatures [Snow White, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, etc.] out of his kingdom. They take refuge on Shrek's swampy property, and he gets really mad. He's been alone for so long that he takes his privacy very seriously. Accompanied by a loud, obnoxious, yet somehow lovable donkey [Eddie Murphy] he can't get rid of, Shrek goes to confront Farquaad. The lord tells him that if he will rescue Princess Fiona [Cameron Diaz], whom he has decided to marry, he will rescind his banishment of the fairy tale folks and give Shrek his privacy back. Off Shrek goes to a dragon-guarded castle to retrieve Fiona, who is no ordinary fairy tale princess. But, then, this is no ordinary movie.<br />The actors' voice talents are all quite good, but the one who is absolutely perfect is Eddie Murphy as the donkey. This animal could easily have gotten on our nerves, but Murphy makes him so funny that we are too busy laughing at him to get upset.<br />For the first time this year, there is an Oscar category for best animated movie.

B00005QHPQ|5.0|It's about time somebody as talented as Enrique, releases a dance album. He does sort of follow the same formula as Cher's \\"Believe,\\" album, but I think this album is more hip, and up-to-date. Just listening to the new single \\"Escape\\" reminds me that he is more talented than his other contemporary Ricky Martin. The best choices here are \\"Escape,\\" \\"Don't Turn Off The Lights,\\" \\"Hero,\\" \\"One Night Stand,\\" and \\"Maybe.\\" I suggest that you pick up this album if you're tired of some artists shamelessly following the same formula.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Too many reviews already so let me add just a few things. I was glad I picked this movie after a long day at work, not only it cracked me up every 5 minutes or so, it also helped me look back at the &quot;serious&quot; things I had to deal with during the day and laugh them all off. The miscommunications and linguistic twists were hilarious, and trying to spot all the cameos was fun too. One last thing: Don't  miss &quot;Zoolander&quot; on DVD. I really enjoyed the special features. One of my favorite scenes must be the dialogue between Winona Ryder and Owen Wilson (the &quot;Aliens&quot; referral - LOL). Too bad it was deleted from the main feature.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Many die-hard Dream Theater fans don't agree, but I think this album is their best work so far.  But I also don't think it would be so if it hadn't been preceded by their previous works.  Every album has been a powerful statement in its own right; and 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence is the next logical step, made possible and necessary by the monumental showing of 1999's Scenes From a Memory.  This is NOT an album for a first-time Dream Theater listener.  It stands more as something for those already familiar with Dream Theater's sound to enjoy.  There was a definite style change for this album - a \\"coming together\\" of each member into one, solid unit.  We already know what stellar musicians each one of them is; now they are showing us that they can write real songs without sacrificing any of the technique and flair we've grown to expect and love.  With this album, Dream Theater has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are a BAND, not just a collection of different musicians going off on their own.  My only regret is that John Myung's bass is so low in the mix; rarely is he audible.
B000024D4R|5.0|I'll admit -- at first listen, it wasn't a favorite of mine. I loved Wish You Were Here and DSOTM already; and I was expecting more experimentation. But directly upon the second listen, I finally picked up on the mammoth that is \\"Dogs,\\" \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones),\\" and \\"Sheep.\\"<br />\\"Dogs\\" is amazing. It's almost as amazing as \\"Wish You Were Here\\" -- and I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating or something... but listen to it. Give it a try; it's clearly astounding. Glimour creates some amazing guitar work in here; it almost sounds angst-ridden sometimes. Waters goes great lengths to create some of his best written lyrical content in any Pink Floyd album -- example: \\"Deaf, dumb, and blind/You just keep on pretending/That everyone's expendable/And no one has a real friend..\\" Greatness all around. It sounds like they spent a long time on this one.<br />\\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" has a more mellow quality to it than the aforementioned \\"Dogs\\" -- great, slow melodic drumming; low key keyboard riffs; and some pretty dark yet realistic lyrics. And all of this great instrumentation (including some great guitar solos by Gilmour) works together so well. The shattering lyrics are of the like: \\"You got to stem the evil tide/And keep it all on the inside/Mary you're nearly a treat/Mary you're nearly a treat/But you're really a cry.\\"<br />\\"Sheep\\" is actually better than some certain people say. I'll agree with the fact that the lyrics are perhaps a bit forced, fake -- but the beautiful, hard hitting music more than makes up for it. For some odd reason, however, these somewhat forced lyrics work for the music beside it. A good point would to look at the lyrics of \\"Sheep\\" and some major rock song of today; in most cases, \\"Sheep\\" of course still holds up content wise. It's a great song.<br />I'm forgetting the bookends -- \\"Pigs On The Wing.\\" These simple, loving songs are really needed. Without them, Animals wouldn't be complete. I can't imagine starting up Animals without \\"PigsOn The Wing Pt. 1\\" or ending the album without part two.<br />Is Animals the best PF album? I don't think I have one; I'll agree with most and say that DSOTM, WYWH and Animals are tied for the best PF albums.<br />If you're one of the many who have not listened or bought Animals yet (there seems to be many PF fans without this amazing album), please do yourself a favor and buy this milestone. It contains some of the best PF music ever made.
B00005JKYS|5.0|The title of the memoir that inspired this film, \\"We Were Soldiers Once...And Young,\\" written by Lt. General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway, says much about what this film ultimately conveys, as in a few words it addresses the state of being of the individuals, as well as the country, which so soon would be embroiled in one of the most controversial wars in the history of America.  \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" adapted for the screen and directed by Randall Wallace, is an uncompromising look at war and the commitment of those who wage it.  It's a true story told realistically, and moreover, in terms that are humanistic rather than political, which succeeds in making it a riveting drama that is both absorbing and emotionally involving.<br /> It's November, 1965; some 400 American troops-- the 7th Cavalry-- led by Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), take the field at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, where they are quickly surrounded by over 2000 North Vietnamese soldiers.    The ensuing battle will last for three days, and it marks the first major confrontation between America and North Vietnam, a battle from which many, on both sides, will not walk away; and on hand to record it as it happens, is reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper).  Going in, Moore knows what they are up against, and he promises his men two things:  That he will be the first to set foot on the field and the last to leave it; and he will bring every man back home with him, alive or dead-- no one will be left behind.  And it's a promise he keeps.  <br /> With this film, Wallace succeeds where two other, recent depictions of historic battles, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down\\"-- both good films in their own right-- failed; and it's because he managed to achieve just the right balance between the rendering of the battle itself and the human element involved.  Of the two, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a close runner-up; the love story leading up to the battle was perhaps a bit extended, though ultimately engaging, whereas \\"Black Hawk Down\\" put the viewer in the battle, but was emotionally uninvolving.  Here, Wallace not only gives you a battle that is brilliantly staged and presented, but before he takes you there he makes sure you know those who are about to die, and the loved ones they are leaving behind.  War has many casualties, and they are not all on the battlefield; and beyond the realism of the fight, this is where Wallace makes his strongest statement, as during the three days of the battle he makes you privy to what the soldiers wives and families are going through at home, as well, waiting for the dreaded Western Union telegrams being delivered by cab drivers because the army wasn't prepared to deal with it.  <br /> The film is effective because Wallace keeps the human element at the heart of the story while he presents a perspective to which the audience can relate on very personal terms.  In short, he gives you the \\"whole story,\\" that enables you to know the horror of the firefight, as well as the throat clenching terror of seeing a yellow cab drive up to the front of your house, knowing full well what it means.  This is a prime example of filmmaking and storytelling at it's best; and it's a commendable achievement by Wallace.<br /> Gibson is perfectly cast and does an excellent job of bringing Hal Moore to life with a convincing portrayal of a man dedicated to both his family and his life as a soldier.  Moore is focused and determined, and Gibson makes us realize that he knows the seriousness of what he is about to undertake, as well as the possible dire consequences thereof.  The real strength of the character, however, is in the fact that he is not some kind of superhero out to win the war single-handedly, but a man who lives and loves and feels like anyone else, who bleeds when he is cut and hurts when he loses one of his men.  A man who feels guilty that he is still living when his men die.  And it's all captured in Gibson's strong and credible performance.<br /> Besides Gibson, there are a number of exceptional supporting performances in this film, most notably, Madeleine Stowe, as Julie Moore, Hal's wife; Sam Elliott, as the gruff and seasoned veteran, Sergeant Major Basil Plumley; Greg Kinnear, as Major Bruce Crandall, the helicopter pilot with a memorable nickname; Chris Klein, as Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, a new father to whom Moore gives a perspective on the war that enables him to face the job he must do; Keri Russell, as Barbara Geoghegan, the young wife and new mother who must watch her husband go off to fulfill his destiny; and Pepper, turning in an extremely affecting performance as Joe Galloway.<br /> The supporting cast includes Ryan Hurst (Sergeant Savage), Mark McCracken (Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Freeman), Edwin Morrow (Willie), Jsu Garcia (Captain Nadal), Matt Mangum (Private Soprano), Brian Tee (Nakayama), Joseph Hieu (NVA Major), Don Duong (Ahn), Alan Dale (Westmoreland) and Simbi Khali (Alma).  A film like this goes far in demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the medium that created it; it will never, however, enable us to understand war, because war-- in all it's myriad manifestations-- is beyond human comprehension.  But it has always been with us and always will be, and a film that is well made and presented, a film like \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" is important because it lends a needed perspective that allows us to take a step back and consider the magnitude of our endeavors in these regards, and the price we must pay for freedom.  It leaves one with a sense of pride and patriotism, but tempered with a sobering concern for seeking altruistic alternatives.  It may be only a dream; but hopefully, it's one that someday all the people of the world will share.
B000002G7G|5.0|I realize many other reviewers have put in their two cents on this album, but I feel compelled to add mine. Folks, this is, simply put, an ESSENTIAL album. Coming off the heels of their first two records which are like a building, brooding maelstrom of feedback and experimentalism, this is a very understated, quiet and personal record. Lou Reed at his most lucid and literate, yet still it rocks. Actually, to be more accurate, it ROLLS-- perhaps better than anything of its ilk before or since. With the Velvet's third album what we have is the template for SO many who followed in its wake and attempted to live up to it. Bands such as Big Star, Television, Acetone, the mega-hyped Strokes and innumerable others would have had no starting point if not for this astounding collection of songs.<BR>A wide range of emotions is in evidence here: upbeat and humorous (\\"Beginning to See the Light\\"), sweet and hopeful (\\"After Hours\\"), confused and insular (\\"Murder Mystery\\"), sultry and scorching (\\"Some Kinda Love\\"), and utterly melancholy (\\"I'm Set Free\\", \\"Candy Says\\"). This is just a stellar album-- I cannot recommend it highly enough or say enough good things about it. I do not give 5 stars lightly, but this is classic and timeless. Light a couple of candles, put your mind at rest and sink right in. You will find a welcome respite from the world into a place you will want to revisit often.
B000000643|5.0|This album, as usual for the Fairports, marked a personnel change for the band with the departure of vocalist Ian Matthews who went on to form Southern Comfort and who had a hit in Britain with his version of Woodstock.<br />In a number of ways the album was a turning point in the band's career. Rapidly building on their reputation as a live act, the album is an expression of their maturity as performers and songwriters and their confidence as leaders in the folk-rock field.<br />The album opens with a Richard Thompson song, Genesis Hall, with it's unusual form and lyrics, sung almost as a dirge by Sandy Denny. To begin an album with a somewhat experimental track was certainly novel and had some nice touches from Thompson.<br />The next track, Si Tu Dois Partir - Bob Dylan in French no less became a minor hit for the band who were televised on a pop show, Top of the Pops with Underground DJ John Peel purporting, if not actually, to play the spoons. A catchy chorus helped it to sound like a French folk song!<br />A Sandy Denny composition, &quot;Autopsy&quot; followed with a jazzy feel to it, a lush Denny vocal going along with some neat guitar. This is certainly an indication of Sandy's expanding musical interests.<br />The only taditional song on the album, &quot; A Sailor's Life&quot; follows with a traditional folk vocal by Sandy expressing a sad refrain while the rest of the band produce an almost Velvet Underground type of backing before turning to a growing, strengthening combination -  also showing the band's interest in extended playing - a powerful song indeed.<br />Cajun Woman, another Thompson song is again innovative showing his development from his folk-rock roots and indicating future direction.<br />For me the highlight of this album is the Sandy Denny song &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes&quot; which has become a poignant regular feature of the Fairport repetoire. This a haunting song with wonderful lyrics and great playng.<br />The two final cuts on this album are both Dylan songs, &quot;Percy's Song&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot;, the first done in a traditional style and the second shows the band having a lot of fun. A great way to end the album<br />For me every one of these tracks is a lasting testament to this band and all of it's members, past and present. In a way it epitomises everything one has come to associate with the Fairport family.s on this album are both Dylan songs, &quot;Percy's Song&quot; and &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot;, the first done in a traditional style and the second shows the band having a lot of fun.

B00005MP58|3.0|This is by far my favorite movie, but I am sorry I bought this DVD.  I thought the new release would correct the problem with the color that so many complained about with the first one.  I recommend either buying the VHS version, or waiting until they produce a DVD with picture quality worthy of this film.  (My wife's favorite, but I like it as well.)
B00005QZWI|5.0|I had never heard Enya before this CD. I just loved the music from the movie. Just a sort of feeling that it was &quot;right.&quot; I loved the movie. <br />After getting the CD, I tried imagining what the movie would be without the music. The movie would not have been anywhere near as good.<br />&quot;The Bridge of Khazad-dum&quot; almost made me cry, so did Enya's song.<br />The funny thing is that I never liked classical music!
6305364613|4.0|Ignore any bad reviews of this movie. The direction is amazing. The acting is also on par. The water imagery is simply stunning. One of the best modern adaptations of any Shakepeare film. This is not just a teen movie. This movie takes risks and triumphs.
0316286850|4.0|This book is wonderful to learn the basics of make-up application. Although Aucoin seems to repeat looks, each one is beautiful. If you have never used cosmetics, this will teach you the essentials. If you are an experienced user, the book is full of little tricks of the trade. And when you do get the book it is fun to try and guess who he made over!
1558807381|5.0|I love this movie, its the coolest fantasy movie ever. I like it better than all the big budget blockbusters, like Willow (2nd best of all time)and Lord of the Rings... The Prince of Darkness aka: Devil in this movie is the best looking Devil ever designed, those huge horns are awesome.  I first saw this movie when I was a little kid and I still get the same feeling when I watch it now. Anyone who has ever watched Dark Chrystal as a kid and than as an adult will know what I mean, as a kid its great, as an adult not really.<BR>If anyone collects action figures there are going to be 2 figures released from this movie in McFarlanes next Movie Maniacs line. If you dont have it, buy it,[money] what a steal...
B00005QZWI|3.0|First off, let me say that the music that Howard Shore has composed for the Fellowship of the ring is absoloutly fantastic, easily deserving a 5 star rating.<BR>     However, the editing on the soundtrack has unfortunitly cut out all the best bits from the movie.  Example: The incredible track of when the fellowship runs over the bridge of Khaza-Dum, and when Gandalf fights the Balrog.  On the CD, all that comes up is: Gandalf sees Balrog, Gandalf falls. Problem? they completly cut out the best track in the entire movie! (In my opinion).  This happens everywhere on the disk.  All the best parts of the movie are cut out, which is a mamoth dissapointment.  The great opening track for the movie, with the earie early parts, is completly absent, leaving us with a track on the CD that sounds almost nothing like the movie.  How [weak]. The music is still worthy of a 5 star rating, but the editing cost it two stars.<br />The good:<BR>Its the lord of the rings music!<br />The not so good:<BR>the best parts from the movie are completly cut out (No fair!)<BR>the opening track DOES NOT sound like the movie.<br />Summary:  Sorry, But I can only half-heartily recomend this.
0380713802|5.0|Having just returned from Japan, Kuala Lumpur and Australia, I'm not yet ready to attack &quot;War and Peace.&quot; But after reading Bryson's &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; which gave us a hilarious and tantalizing introduction to Australia, I'm finding &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; just as much fun and an easy read while suffering from post-Australian jet lag. <br />I've visited most of the cities he describes, and he brings back lots of funny memories and also takes me back to places and points out things I really didn't pay enough attention to when I was there. As another customer reviewer said, if you don't laugh a lot when reading Bryson, you don't have a sense of humor, and I wouldn't want to be stuck on a desert island with you.<br />Although I winced a few times at some of his crude language -- he doesn't use it in &quot;Sunburned&quot;; maybe he found his vocabulary during the 90's -- he didn't use any words I haven't used myself when the situation warranted it.<br />Read it and laugh.
B00000420F|5.0|As an accompanist for the past 20+ years, I'd come to believe these songs - many contained within the (in)famous \\"24 Italian Songs and Arias\\" were stricly for the high school/early college vocalist to butcher while learning the basics of good singing and Italian.<BR>     Boy was I wrong!<BR>     Cecilia Bartoli takes these songs and makes you ache, rejoice, and desire right along with her.  I never thought I'd be moved by ANY performance of \\"Caro mio ben\\" and yet I nearly wrecked my car the first time I heard her on this recording.  Magnificent!  As is each and every track on this disc.  It's inspired me to be a better accompanist and coach, as well as an ardent admirer of all things Bartoli.  Many of my choral/vocal music teacher friends have received this disc or bought it after hearing mine.  BUY THIS RECORDING!<BR>     The only downer is that I may never feel complete if I don't get to accompany this lady on the title track before I die.  Oh, well - I guess you can't have it all!
0790729725|1.0|There is simply no excuse for having to flip over a DVD half way through to watch a movie.  Plenty of longer movies than Goodfellas have been able to fit on ONE SIDE of a DVD.  <br />Without a doubt, this is an excellent movie (as the other reviews concerning the movie itself make evident), which is why I bought the DVD.  If I had known in advance that I was required to flip it over half way through the movie, I never would have bought it in DVD format.
B00003000M|5.0|this whole album is tight.especialy rebel music my favorite track with the great krayzie bone....no one still gave a good reason not to buy the cd.othere then the fact hip hop artists was on here i mean c'mon now! thats so ... trivial.this whole cd is great and was meant to introduce the man to the new generation.did they have to remix the songs to do this?.probably not but it really didn't hurt the cd.go buy this cd.
0871137380|5.0|Wow! This account of the battle is amazing.  If you've seen the movie, you've got to read this book. If you haven't seen the movie, you've got to read this book. If you don't know anything about this courageous and heart-stopping battle, then you are missing out and definitely must read this book. It tells the story of brotherhood, honor and courage. You will not put this one down for a while and you will certainly not forget this story for a long time. A must read now during this time when American troops are abroad in conflict.
B00000055E|4.0|i do agree with a earlier reveiw that the first disk is verry good.if they took do for love,ready 4 whatever,and the second version of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto,along with loosing my mind,when i get free and the interludes and cramed the in the first cd this would actually be a tight cd.but it still deserves 4 stars even though its not a single disc.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite albums, and it is my favorite Stooges album - hands down. This is the last album featuring the original line-up (Iggy, Dave Alexander, and Ron & Scott Asheton), soon after Dave was kicked out. The entire album manages to be different, yet it still blends. There is no possible way that you can hate this album.
630460291X|5.0|This is truly one of my all time favorites.  Kevin Costner did a fantastic job playing Sherwood Forest's favorite thief, even if he did not have the greatest English accent and the movies was not historically correct.  Do not miss out on the performances of Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman.  Freeman plays Robin's dedicated Moor friend he met while captive in the crusades.  Together the two return home to face the evil Sheriff of Nottingham played by Rickman.  He plays a deviously mean part sparked by flashy showmanship that will leave you in stitches.  Truly a winner to any DVD library.
B000002I2M|5.0|When I first heard LA woman, I just thought that it is crazy song with pathic lyrics sung by a wacky weirdo with a throaty baritone. Upon few hearing ,I got hooked, LA woman is a timeless classic, preserved in the annals of Rock and Roll. It lighten me up everytime I hear it. All songs are well worth a listen, it all ends with the Riders on the Storm, woow, &quot;Killer on the Road&quot; will blow you away.A winner from the original four.Doors ROCK on, Do not just listen to it HEAR it.
B00005RYKU|2.0|This movie is the 21st centuries version of a &quot;B&quot; rated movie. It is entirely predictable and not very thrilling for being a mystery thriller movie.  The acting, well, I hope these actors don't quit their real jobs.  You guess the ending before it's over.  I would certainly NOT waste $ to purchase this movie.
B0000509C4|5.0|Rarely do we see a movie that can affectively gain unanimous praise from it's audience based on one sole creepy story.  The Raft has got to be one of the few genious moments in horror movie history since it just gets under you skin and never goes away.  As for the other stories, well, let's break it down like this:<br />First Story: \\"Old Chief Woodenhead\\"-sensible plot, decent effects with the exception of the cheesy looking guy in a rubber/wooden suit-lol.  This is more of a garden variety slasher flick sporting a Native-American vibe.  Myself being Indian, I find it slightly offensive but thankfully the story offs the bad guys effectively.<br />Second Story: \\"The Raft\\"-as said before, simply brilliant in it's execution and quite simply a definitive moment in horror cinema.  I wish I had seen this in the theatre!  What is so brilliant about this is that these kids in the movie are smoking \\"something\\" and no one really asks the question, did they just drown from being stoned or did a blob thing really eat them up?  I was waiting for a sign at the end to say: \\"Only use 100 percent pure folks-not all flowers have the same effect!\\"  LOL.<br />Third Story: \\"The Hitchhiker\\"-standard Hollywood horror fare.  Nothing really new here except for the fact of the adultress who is haunted by something she's done wrong.  The actors play this story rather well.  I guess it would be pretty creepy being chased by a bloody ghost in a dirty yellow rainslicker....hmmmm....sounds like a movie I remember seeing \\"last summer.\\" Cheers!
B00000JPH5|5.0|My oldest fell in love with this movie and David Bowie when it first came out in 86. Now her sisters (10 &amp; 7) feel the same way. I too have always enjoyed this movie. It's kind of hard <BR>having &quot;Magic Dance&quot; blasting on the car stereo and acting cool at the same time but it's a song that stays in your head. So, who cares!? What other movie can keep my whole family including myself (40yrs) happy watching it over &amp; over again?
B000000P11|5.0|Of all the albums I've purchased in the past, this was one of the hardest to get into.  I was initially disappointed, since it sounded so much different than their previous two releases.  After the first listen to two, I was uninterested and just shoved it on my cd rack, but nearly a year later, I decided to give it another try, and it just clicked for me.  It's not an easy album to listen to, especially if you got into their earlier material a lot, but I found it even more rewarding after so many listens.  Now, Script of the Bridge sounds so plain in comparison (but still a fantastic album), and this has become one of my favorites.  The fact that it's on a major label does nothing to make the music more commercial, and in fact the higher production values make it thicker, full, and more atmospheric, making it a bit of a journey to listen to.  My favorites are the ode to heroin Mad Jack, the ballad Tears (a tribute to a dead friend), Soul in Isolation (amazing drums), the obvious Swamp Thing, and the bittersweet Seriocity.  <BR>Again, it's not easy to love, and not for everybody, but if you can get into this album, it's a higly rewarding experience.
006441034X|5.0|When I first picked up Howl's Moving Castle, Diana Wynne Jones was already one of my favorite authors. I had torn through her Chrestomanci and Dalemark books, as well as Dogsbody and The Dark Lord of Derkholm. However, I just couldn't begin this book. I tried harder to start it. Then I realized how absolutely incredible it is!<br />The characters in the story are very realistic and have great personalities. Howl is arrogant and conceited, Michael is quiet, and Calcifer is ... Calcifer. The story jumps to different dimensions, like the worlds of Chrestomanci (it doesn't take place there, though.) Howl's Moving Castle is now my #1 favorite book, and if I had to name the worst part of it, I would say it was when it ended. I reccommend this book to all fans of the fantasy genre.
0312965788|5.0|It is a great book!<br />Each chapter is a new story of another faimly and another animal patient James Herriot is treating.  They are all  really touching, and most of them are funny and light hearted.  Herriot is a great story teller. He seems to make everything about life beautiful and new.<br />It is easy reading and really enjoyible to read.  The chapters are short. So you don't have to read on forever to find a place to stop.<br />Read it!
B000002O3I|5.0|Two unbelievably good albums - the first two, in fact - from THE king of electric blues. The patented growl, the lyrical innuendo and black humour, the AMAZING performances from the band, make every single song on this twofer absolute killers. Ultra-gruff swamp-blues mayhem that'll knock you dead.<BR>The line-up of songs is almost a walking blues cliche now, but remember these are the originals (mostly) and done better than anyone since: \\"Red Rooster\\", \\"Wang Dang Doodle\\", \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"Evil\\", etc. A powerhouse collection.<BR>Looking back, I remember when I was much, much younger reading about the early '60s UK R & B scene ('Stones, Pretty Things, Yardbirds, etc.), wondering why on earth all these geeky white guys idolised the likes of 'Wolf and Muddy Waters so much, when they had the likes of Elvis, Eddie Cochran and Buddy Holly to be content with. Well, no disrespect to those mentioned, but the wall-shaking vibe of Howlin' Wolf is something no such artist could argue with; these two discs make much of what passed for rock'n'roll in the '50s sound positively tame in comparison. Life-changing stuff, for sure. Get to it.
0393307050|3.0|For many years now I have wondered about Patrick O'Brian and why his novels are so popular.  Naval fiction has never attracted me so it was with some trepidation that I eventually bit the bullet and decided to try this book.<br />I cannot pretend that this book was easy-going.  There is a lot of jargon used that, unless you are a sea boffin, frankly you will not understand.  But the funny thing is, you don't need to.  As other reviewers have pointed out, O'Brian has very skilfully evoked the world of 1800 in this novel and this book really did transport me to another era and place.  It is also frequently funny.  The characters of Aubrey and Maturin were attractive and engaging.  You certainly do not need to be a man or 96 years old to be able to enjoy this book!  <br />I am not sure if I will read any other novels in the series since I did find this book to be hard work at times.  But what I cannot deny is that the Aubrey/Maturin series undoubtedly gives a great deal of pleasure to many people - if it is for this reason alone, you owe it to yourself to give this book a try.
6304082428|5.0|Who can resist? I've never seen a movie receive such a large number of positive reviews. And I can well understand why. I, too, was captivated by P&amp;P from the first time it aired. I knew Jane Austen, had even kind of read some of her works. Since then, I have become a dyed-in-the-wool fan of hers. <br />What can I say? Almost everyone has raved on about the wonderful qualities of the movie, and they're absolutely right! The casting, setting, costumes, character portrayals, etc. is all divine. Highest compliments to everyone involved. As soon as I could, I bought both the VHS set and the soundtrack. Let it be said, I'm infamous in my family for this movie. I've quite literally seen it hundreds of times (wore out my first copy, working on the second, will soon need a third) and will continue to do so! It's quite possible you'll sit down, watch the entire thing, then go back to the beginning and start again. So, schedule some free time, sit back, and enjoy a truly dazzing production!<br />PS. My personal favorite is episode #4 (in the tapes, don't know about the DVD) beginning with Darcy's letter explaining his behavior regarding Wickham, right through to Darcy and Lizzie's surprise meeting, &quot;Mr. Darcy!&quot;
B00005RHGL|4.0|Ok so anytime you gather this many stars in one film you might have the tendency to see the stars and not the characters. After reading some other reviews I wonder if people were actually paying attention or too busy picking it apart to just enjoy a great performace on a very loose rendition of the old west. I DIG THIS FILM AND RECOMEND IT HIGHLY.<br />peace out.
6304083777|4.0|but boring as hell.it was nice looking at the animation but it was boring.and the story was too hard to follow.the animation is the reason why i gave it 4 stars.
B000002AH9|5.0|...these reviewer folks is right:  this is a haunting, voyeuristic and reckless-eyeballin view into the soul of a hurt woman.  i have owned this cd for about a year and i have been very reluctant to play it...not out of dis-interest, but out of reverence and respect.<br />...feel like i done peeped into somebody's diary and discovered they dirty lil' secrets...<br />very touching...<BR>this aint to say that you shouldnt get this, but it helps if you are a deep-souled person yourself...very mature and understanding...(i barely qualify!!)...<BR>for those of yall who are meshell n'degeocello fans, lissen to her 'bitter' album and then imagine if she was REALLY, REALLY brokenhearted!!! - this might be what you get....
B00005NQPS|3.0|The bonus disc is the same as the Sparks EP which are also listed here in amazon. so if you already had the LP, I recommend you to go buy the EP rather than this. The EP itself has b-sides from the various single that has been released before, with \\"Careful Where You Stand\\" and \\"See You Soon\\" plus \\"Yellow (acoustic)\\" and the video, the EP is really meant something.<br />As I said before, don't waste your money on this box-set asian import that cost double the EP. lucky for me, I live in asia, hehehehehe
B00005JL9B|4.0|a japanese class go on a school trip with a difference...only one can survive. as japan decends into maddness, a new law, battle royale, comes into effect. A class chosen at random has to participate. each child is armed with with a different weapon, from a paper fan to a machine gun. the last one standing wins.<br />although its subtitled you soon soak into the atmosphere. with some very funny moments and scenes it truly is one of the best japanese films ive seen. <br />the dvd extras arent that great but skipping to the funnest death is worth it.
B00005NZJX|3.0|well, is worth it? first thing you must think before purchase this double cd. <br />1st, okay, there are bonus tracks, 2 remixes and a couple of b-sides. but, you can find all of these in the other gorillaz material. like in their previous single and their new EP, G-sides.<br />2nd, the videos. there are 3. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, and 19-2000. these videos are GOOD, but it is on VCD format and there is NO guarantee it is playable on a DVD player. well, amazon says it can, but I own it, and it is NOT playable on my DVD and two of my friends DVD player.<br />3rd, the price!<BR>it is VERY expensive. go buy G-Sides EP and their single. but, if you are a die hard collector...
B00004U45G|4.0|Overall this is pretty excellent. I'm a Zep freak and a guitar player who plays mostly Zep so I look forward to any new recordings of the master, Jimmy Page. The singer from the Black Crowes does a pretty good job singing, I was impressed. The one drawback to the CD is the annoying [female] in the audience that screams at the into to every song, they should have filtered that out...it ruined some of the intros...Overall though a must have for fans of the Crowes or Zep.
6300213668|5.0|Grease was the first film that I saw more than once in the theatre (6 times to be exact) in 1978.  It was the largest running musical in theatre history and the film was closely based on the 1972 musical play.  The film featured a '50s theme, cashing in on the nostalgia craze that was going on at that time, containing the fashions, the music and the fads of that era plus [desire] overtones expressed by the teenagers.<br />The story revolves around the seniors of Rydell High School and tells of their boy-girl problems, their lack of interest in School, the importance of having a fast car, the loud chaos of dances, pep rallies and the end of the year carnival.  This film really gave me a false perception of what high school should be.  It shows high school to be fun and games and glamorous.  I was disappointed when I began attending high school and realized that it was not was it was like in the movies. :)<br />Produced by Robert Stigwood (of Saturday Night Fever, Tommy and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band fame) the film featured humorous songs ('Beauty School Dropout'), '50s era inspired music ('Born to Hand Jive'), and songs that were also popular during that era ('Hound Dog' and 'Blue Moon').  Some songs had also been featured in the Broadway musical ('Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee' and 'Summer Nights') and some were written specifically for his movie ('Grease' and 'Hopelessly Devoted to You')...<br />There are two highpoints in the film.  The first once occurs at midpoint in the movie, when Rydell High is featured on National Bandstand and the whole school is dancing to 'Rock and Roll is Here to Stay' and 'Born to Hand Jive.'  The other is when the end of the school year carnival occurs where everybody sings and dances to 'We Go Together.'  These two scenes feature large production numbers involving the entire cast and solo dancing featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John...<br />While watching Grease, I found the film to be lively and uplifting that helped people relive the '50s all over again and those who never lived in the '50s wished they had.  Photography, editing and the ages of the cast was completely overlooked once I became engrossed in the plot and the music.<br />The film was a hit not because the film company said it was good.  It was a hit because it appealed to the public, adults and teens and it was a timeless film that will be enjoyed by the public for years to come.ped people relive the '50s all over again and those who never lived in the '50s wished they had.

B00000BKDV|4.0|I consider myself a gentleman and a scholar, and a big fat snob, to boot.<br />Nonetheless, I say this without a trace of irony, and without apology:<br />I love Iron Maiden.<br />They're so lovably pretentious (and genuinely gifted) that I just can't seem to outgrow them.<br />They are SO Spinal Tap, it's beautiful.  Take &quot;To Tame A Land,&quot; for example, when Bruce screams the final bits of the opening verse:<br />&quot;In a time!  When dinosaurs walked the Earth-&quot;<br />Heh.<br />&quot;When lands were swamp and caves WERE HOME!&quot;<br />Why does he scream &quot;WERE HOME&quot;?  Does &quot;were home&quot; really warrant such emphasis?<br />Iron Maiden- grammatically incorrect, painfully earnest, completely bloated...<br />And brilliant.<br />Up the Irons!<br />Heh.
6305603847|4.0|To begin, if you really love Pink Floyd and you haven't seen this movie yet, I am shocked and ashamed.  For those of you who are not very big fans you will think, &quot;what the heck am I watching?&quot;  First you need a good stereo system hooked up to your TV.  There is very little dialogue through out the movie, for the most part just musical bliss.  I must say that I am writing this after reading one persons review that said this was not art.  Of course this is art.  This is someones interpretation of how they feel about dealing with life. The movie goes sequentially with each great song on the album, The Wall.  There are bits of cartoon clips that fit very well with the theme of the movie.  You definitely need to see this at least one time.
B00000DFSK|3.0|The music on here deserves five stars, of course. We can quibble about some songs' absence, but the very best songs are all hear.<br />The reason I gave &quot;Best of&quot; three stars is that U2 is an album band. Most great bands are. Led Zeppelin is, Pink Floyd certainly is (&quot;Echoes&quot; is an embarrasment), the Rolling Stones are, the Who is, the Beatles are, and U2 is no exception. If anything U2's non hits are better than those of the other bands mentioned. In other words, if you like this compilation, you'll love the albums.<br />Take &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; for instance. I have no doubt that Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and With or Without You are the three best tracks on the record (if not three of the greatest songs ever), but Running to Stand Still, In God's Country, One Tree Hill, and Exit happen to be excellent songs as well.<br />Take &quot;Rattle and Hum.&quot; Sure, All I Want Is You made the cut here, but Hawkmoon 269 and Heartland are wonderful songs, and I like Van Dieman's Land a whole lot too. Never mind the nonsense about the movie being pretentious; it has some tremendous live footage, and the accompanying album has some fantastic new material like the songs mentioned above.<br />Finally, buying this compilation at this point might be stupid, because U2 has put together some great stuff since 1989. 1991's Achtung Baby is second only to The Joshua Tree, and All That You Can't Leave Behind is U2's return from an almost ten-year hiatus. Yes, all of you U2-of-the-nineties fans, you can keep Zooropa and Pop. They are not worthy of the band name U2.<br />The music on this CD is incredible. If you really want the guts of U2, though, buy their albums. It's money well spent.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Robert Zemeckis, Academy Award winning director for Forest Gump, and Tom Hanks, the Academy Award winner for Best Actor for Forest Gump, teamed up again for this epic drama.  Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee named Chuck who is stranded on a deserted island after the plane he was on crashes.  Over the span of four years Chuck is on the island, until he devises a plan to get off of the island and return home.  The drama between Chuck and his lone &quot;companion&quot;, a volleyball he calls Wilson, is heartbreaking when he loses him at sea.  In my opinion this is Tom Hanks' finest film, he should have gotten Best Actor instead of Russel Crowe, and the special effects when the plane crashes are great as well.  Helen Hunt is wasted in her role as Chuck's girlfriend, and I would have liked to see more in depth of how Chuck's character develops on the island, and how he coped with the changes when he got home.  All in all though, this is a great movie, and it shouldn't be missed.
0375707972|5.0|I read this book in one day. I don't know what it is about some books, but you know how you begin to read a really good book but can walk away from it for a day or two?  I could not for the likes of anything put this book down.  I was intrigued and destined to find out what was to become of the relationship Mr. Schlink evokes between the young boy, Michael and Hannah. This book is without a doubt, unforgettable and keeps you wanting more. Bernhard Schlink has a simple way with words.  Instead of reminding us how tragic and devastating war can be. He leads  us to this visual rendering of love, passion, betrayl, history, regret, and life lasting memories.
0385503954|4.0|Okay, so now we know that Atonement hasn't won the Booker Prize, but Atonement has won the popular vote. Atonement is a far better novel than McEwan's own Booker winning Amsterdam, and so the publishers must have thought that they had a very good chance of winning (although the bookies correctly opted for Peter Carey's The True History of the Kelly Gang). The Booker Prize panel does have a tendency of awarding the gong to writers they feel should win (and not necessarily for the best book). Margaret Atwood has written some fantastic novels, and although The Blind Assassin is very good, it is definitely not her best. The same could be said for Ian McEwan's Amsterdam: Enduring Love was much better, but McEwan won the Booker for his paltry follow-up. Maybe McEwan has been trying to atone since then? Atonement has received a great deal of praise, if only \\"because it's the kind of novel that wins the Booker Prize\\", but other critics have suggested that he has done no less than reinvent the novel. But can you really make the 'new' more 'new'?<br />The novel kicks off with a passage from Northanger Abbey (for which I recommend the Everyman paperback edition, edited by my cousin, Elisabeth Mahoney), although Ian McEwan omits the scenes that prove incontrovertibly that Jane Austen created baseball. You immediately get the sense that this could be a novel about a young girl on the cusp of womanhood who goes around in a state of near paranoia, so vivid is her imagination. It helps Atonement very much that Briony Tallis, the young girl in question, is a wannabe novelist. She has migrated from fairy tales to plays, although her playwrighting career is not destined to last very long (and there may be a few playwrights out there gnashing their teeth at McEwan's apparent denigration of their art, the screenplays he has written notwithstanding). One immediately notices how polished the text is: McEwan has worked very hard on Atonement, and it shows. Amsterdam closely followed Enduring Love and was poorer in comparison. Although the novel starts off in 1935, McEwan seems to be aiming for the timeless, classic touch, rather than just period detail.<br />Since it's 1935, most of the characters know that something ominous is on the horizon. Jack Tallis is doing his best to prepare for it; Emily Tallis doesn't want it to happen, and Paul Marshall, true to his name, is bellicose and seeks to profit from it, by selling his Amo chocolate bars to the Army. The name of Amo, of course, is derived from the Latin for 'I love', but it sounds like Ammo and looks good in khaki. Briony has her mind totally set on the play she's writing - The Trials of Arabella - and in this, she seems just as opportunistic as Paul Marshall, as she seizes upon the arrival of her cousins to stage her play, never mind that they are distraught by the rather public divorce of their parents. It's here that Briony first encounters the haughty Lola, the older sister of twin brothers Jackson and Pierrot. The twins, it turns out, can't act for fake chocolate, and Lola is indifferent. Also in the house is Cecilia, Briony's sister, and Robbie Turner, the son of the family help, and both these young adults have just graduated from studying literature at Cambridge. Cecilia has always been a bit patronising towards her younger sister's literary talents, but is unaware of how potent Briony's dramatic skills really have become...<br />Atonement is a novel about 'meaning', in all the perambulations of the word, especially since novels are always supposed to mean something. This is where Ian McEwan is very clever, especially in the way he shows how perceptions change over time, as we grow up. If I do read Atonement again, then I'm sure that I will see new things in it, is an obvious observation. But central to the plot is how limited and personal perception is. There's the young Briony standing at the window, seeing the extraordinary scene of her sister Cecilia stripping down into her undies infront of Robbie Turner, and diving into the fountain. And there's yet another and another scene where Briony observes, but does not see. That our perceptions can be so human, so inaccurate, does tend to throw doubt on the whole nature of reality, and on the very basis of human communication. A literary novel is evident of the human desire to communicate at the highest level. Yet McEwan guides us very carefully - he lets us see what Briony does not. However, there's an unsettling \\"B.T.\\" within this book, and we're not talking about telecommunications. As Cyril Connolly might have put it, Ian McEwan has put a lot into the narrative concerning the development of the novel in the twentieth century. A lot of critics have read this, and because they like logical conclusions, they believe and state that Ian McEwan has reinvented the novel, and that he's finally found a new valid model to replace that magic realism and 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' stuff. The Author is not dead, since he was God all along, and had a neat line in resurrection, is what they seem to be saying. Yet I would contend that Ian McEwan has ended with a parlour trick along with a parlour entertainment. If critics really believe that what McEwan is doing is all that particularly novel, then they'll get a nasty shock if they ever come across the similar resolution to James Hoggs' 'The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner'. Atonement is a fantastic, highly stylised read, with a potent erotic charge, and highly ambitious - but McEwan has not reinvented the novel - he's just written a fantastic book.front of Robbie Turner, and diving into the fountain.

6303921248|5.0|I absolutly love this movie!!  it was exactly what i expected from the book because it left out no details and everything looked comepletely authentic.  They did a wonderful job making this movie and it is totally worth the 6 hours!!  During that time I laugh, cry, and totally enjoy myself!!  Everyone should see this movie and read the book!!
0345413377|5.0|This was one of the most incredible books I have ever read.  After I had finished, I just had to sit and think about it.  And while I was thinking, I was also crying (yes, crying).  I almost felt like I knew Will and Lyra after reading the three books and I found the ending to be extremely sad.  This is a very unique series and I still think about even though I read it over a year ago.  I plan on rereading the books because they were so amazing.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This was the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen other than \\"Crazy People\\"! What a disappointment!  Jude Law was excellent as usual.<BR>But the last 20 minutes were nothing less than PAINFUL.  P.U.!!!!
B000058T5E|5.0|As said in previous reviews, this album is one of Jeff's best. While Clapton's new album can be safely played in any waiting room or elevator, Jeff Beck's \\"You Had It Coming\\" will send you to guitar heaven. Jeff Beck is guitar bliss. A song on this album won a grammy...and it was well deserved... But this time, one award went home deserved and the way the grammys should be. Best Instrumental Rock Performance: Dirty Mind. Dirty Mind has a solo on it that is absolute bliss...much like the rest of the album. <br />As mentioned before, you have to give this a listen a few times before you take a liking to it. When I first got it, I was quite amazed, and surprised. Jeff with drum machines? But then I gave it a few more listens. It's now one of my favorite albums. Jeff's tone is superb. The tone is rich, yet raw, and massive! It's pure Jeff Beck. If you like nothing else on this album, you'll love the tone.<br />No one can't see and be overwhelmed by the talent on this album. Jeff Beck is the greatest guitarist ever...and this proves it. Nadia runs through my head often. While it's a difficult melody to hum, the tone is so awesome and Jeff plays it so gracefully and emotionally, that I can't help but think about it. Nadia is the most awesome cut on this album. However, Suspension does not lay far behind. It's mysterious, yet awe-inspiring by Jeff's talent, much like Nadia. And Left Hook, as mentioned...wow. The solo on that makes your sweat run freely like water. At the end, you'll beg for it to go on as it fades out. Classic Jeff Beck.<br />Loose Cannon is another. His solo on this is most excellent...and the guitar tone, like in Nadia, is worth it alone. Dirty Mind, as mentioned above, is another great cut. And of course, no Beck album would be complete without a song dedicated to cars and hot rods. Roy's Toy has a great solo and showcases some of Jeff's humour later in the song...but I'll let you hear that for yourself. Rollin' and Tumblin' still proves Jeff hsa the blues inside. And he plays it like everything else...Godlike.
6304504012|4.0|...although perhaps not as great as the original stage version.  But I supposed that is not a fair statement to make as they are two completely different mediums.  Actually, the original concept album was best if we want to get picky about it.  As for Madonna being cast as Evita, I thought, &quot;Of course, who else?&quot;  After all, Patty Lupone would have been too old for the part unless they cartooned away her age via CGI as another reveiwer suggested.  I enjoyed this movie and Madonna did a fine job.  It has been a long time since any musicals, let alone psuedo-rock operas, have been made into movies.
0789723107|5.0|Don't Make Me Think will help you think more about usability when you're designing sites.  It doesn't include any information concerning current web technologies, but has some great explanations about how techies, managers, and designers can go awry in their project decisions.  The chapter called the Farmer and the Cowman is worth the money in itself.
B000001FQQ|2.0|There are many things that are wrong with 1989's Hot in the shade, but let's start with the good first. Paul Stanley's \\"Forever\\" and Eric Carr's \\"Little Caesar\\" are both gems. The former being one of KISS's biggest hits of the 80's and the latter being one of Eric's best contibutions to a KISS album.Now for the bad: The album suffers from having too many songs on it (15), and being too long (about an hour). Most of the album sounds like filler, with no real heart or effort being put into the songs. This tends to give the album a 'labored' feel to it. Another problem is that there is no producer, and it was recorded at bascially a demo studio which again points to the lack of soul this album has to it.Had the album been cut down to about 10 to 11 songs, been around 40 to 45 minutes, had a real producer AND kept the two songs mentioned above, this would have been a great album.Don't get me wrong though, it's not a horrible album, some songs are rather enjoyable to listen to such as \\"Hide your heart\\", \\"Silver spoon\\" and \\"Betrayed\\", but compared to the KISS magic these songs sound like nothing more than glorified late night jams from a 'B+' bar band.Then there's the ugly: Most of Gene Simmons contributions are weak. \\"Somewhere between heaven and hell\\", \\"Cadillac dreams\\" and \\"Boomerang\\" are just as bland and boring as they sound.So Unless you're a hardcore KISS fan, I wouldn't suggest purchasing this album.
B000002KDO|5.0|Master Of Reality is black sabbaths best ablum to date. This ablum contains some of sabbaths heaviest, best, and underated songs of their career. This ablum was right after Paranoid, which is another one of sabbaths best, and therefore i feel got overlooked. it opens up with the almighty Sweet Leaf. this song is awesome fro the opening distorted chords to the brutal solo. the following song After Forever is even better. Featuring not only awesome guitar riffs, a great solo but also amazing bass. I think Ozzy's vocals and tony's guitar really stand out on this ablum. Embryo ,Sabbaths best instrumental,a great acoustic/instrumental guitar song flows into the great Children Of The Grave, which features one of tony iommi's most complicated solos to this day. Then goes into another instrumental. Lord Of This World is next which is a mind blowing song. Then the slowest song on the ablum Solitude kicks off. It is a great slow song for sabbath ( personally reminded me litely but still of planet caravan). then going into the best song off the ablum Into The Void. this is a great tony iommi guitar song and the lyrics are great. this ablum was a step no matter how small from the masterpiece paranoid. The insturments sound better and ozzy's voice and the songs sound fuller. this is a must-have for any fans of music. you cannot call yourself a sabbath fan and know truly without a listen to this ablum.
6304143184|5.0|You are probably like me, rushing to get an untampered-with copy of E.T. before the bastardized version hits the screens this summer.  I am distraught that movie makers can go back and ruin classics by digitally adding \\"new\\" footage that adds no merit to the movie, or editing out shotguns in the effort to appear more politically correct for the masses.  This is yet another classic film, like the ruined \\"Star Wars\\", that is one that we will all wish that we could get our hands on in it's originally released state.  Please release this classic film in it's unblemished state at a price that we can afford.  The digital age has done nothing to enhance these movies, it only takes away from the beauty of the special effects that were available at the time, and are therefore superior efforts than that we see today. The realism that was accomplished by the special effects available at the time is what makes this film a classic.  The added computer animation cheapens the efforts of all the geniuses that worked so hard to make that movie and the character of E.T. real to us in the first place.  Tampering with the film, adding new and un-needed footage, altering the film as it originally appeared cheapens the experience for us all.  I am saddened that my children will not be able to see this classic film as it originally was screened, and as I originally experienced it as a child in the movie theaters.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This is a great early rush ablum. Definitly a great follow up to the masterpiece 2112. Xanadu is the highlight of the ablum. A Farewell To Kings the title track which is amazing and beautiful(classical guitar in the beginning)at the sae time. Cinderella Man is another great rocker. The only slight problem with the ablum is Madrigal. It is an alright song but it doesn't belong on this ablum. Cyngus X-1 is a great masterpiece that ends in the middle of an enchanting story that is continued on Hemispheres. Closer To The Heart the biggest hit off the ablum another awesome song with (again) beautiful guitar in the begining and thoughout the song. This an awesome ablum and if you like\love rush it is a definite must have.
B000002H72|5.0|This album is easy to rate. It's one of those albums that you start to hear on the radio, but not sure who it is. Then you start to read about this awesome band that has just put out a lightning-brilliant album called \\"Doolittle\\", but you think you haven't heard them at all, and then you hear those same catchy, but weird songs \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven \\" and \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", with a singer that sounds like he's got one too many bright ideas in his head, the kind of voice that belongs to the kid at the high school lunchroom who was always staring at someone or staring into space when he wasn't reading those Philip K. Dick novels, but then you realize that the band you have been hearing and the one you've been reading about are one and the same.<br />Great albums are made up of excellent moments - moments like<br />1) The feverishly cool guitar break in the middle of \\"Hey\\" just  before Black Francis sings \\"Uh! Said the man to the lady....\\"<br />2) The glorious outro of \\"No. 13 Baby\\" as Joey Santiago's ice-edged guitars loop over each other and for containing the lyric:<BR>\\"Six foot girl, gonna sweat when she digs, stand close to the <BR>fire when they light the pig...\\"<br />3) The opening bass and joyful, thrash pop of \\"Debaser\\".<br />4) The darkness of songs like \\"Tame and \\"Dead\\"<br />5) The inclusion of God, Man, Satan, and garbage all in one song in \\"Monkey Gone To Heaven\\" possibly inspired by the tale of the garbage barge floating around the East coast around that time (late 80's) looking for a home...<br />6) \\"Silver\\" with Kim Deal and Francis combining eerie vocals to make the song sound like a Western-Horror movie.<br />7) And the closing \\"Gouge Away\\" with it's disturbing imagery<br />And of course the most refreshing thing about the Pixies was that they never considered themselves more important than the music, the songs. They appeared on stage with just normal street clothes, no wild hair or makeup. They had a sense of humor that they injected into their songs from time to time. They arrived, put out five albums in five years and then blew town. <br />Yes, this album is very easy to rate. Five stars. It's outrageous, loud, scary, weird, and just what we needed back then in the spring of 1989.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Matt Drudge and others like fox news have undertaken it upon themselves to smear \\"A beautiful mind,\\" echoed previously by reviewer sarah. ... This is better than simply dittoing someone else with his or her own agenda. Murdoch, owner of fox news has his own picture up for an Oscar, \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" so it does not surprise me the tactics that were used to discredit \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\"  I liked \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\" I liked Russell Crowe's performance. Ron Howard should win this one. finally. What do you bet Fox news Titles his win: \\"opie strikes big?\\"  I didn't want to see this movie, was dragged to it, not quite kicking and screaming, but very glad to have gone. I will buy the dvd when it comes out. James Horner once again amazes me with the gift that comes from his beautiful mind.
B00005KHEU|3.0|Y'know, if one had predicted, back in 1969, that Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's little Move spinoff side project would wind up sounding like the Beatles on helium (or to be more precise, the Bee Gees), he or she would have been laughed out of the room. However, time and tide being what they are, that's precisely what happened by 1979. When I was a teenager, about the time of ELO II, On The Third Day, and Eldorado, my admiration for ELO was so great that I often listed them as one of my favorite groups. I loved Roy Wood's stuff, too, but that's another review...as the years went by and their sound morphed into something like a cross between Kraftwerk and the Four Seasons at Studio 54, I finally gave up on them roughly at about the same time that you couldn't turn on the radio without hearing &quot;Dont Bring Me Down&quot;. So as a result, I declined to pick this album up back in the day.<br />As time has gone by, though, my distaste for this hopped-up post-disco ear candy has mellowed to the point where I actually purchased this a few years ago, based on a chance listen to &quot;Need Her Love&quot;. I was so impressed with that drop-dead gorgeous, aching ballad that I thought it was high time I re-evaluated the band that I considered one of my favorites in 1974. And my verdict?<br />Well, Discovery's not nearly as cringe-inducing as I remembered from 1979, but it's not strong enough, cut-for-cut, to be included as one of their best. Simple as that. One thing that never deserted Lynne through all those years was his way with a melody, and it's that gift that gets songs like &quot;Confusion&quot; and &quot;Last Train To London&quot; by. There's so much synth squiggling and fa-fa-falsetto vocalese going on that you're distracted from the say-nothing lyrics, which are effective only on the aforementioned incredible &quot;Love&quot; and the Fabs pastiche &quot;Horace Wimp&quot;. There are several songs that didn't make much of an impression on me, sorry to say, like &quot;On The Run&quot;, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, and &quot;Wishing&quot;, but they're not terrible, just forgettable.<br />So should you buy Discovery? Well, sure...if you're in the mood for catchy, breezy, 70's style pop. And if nothing else, to hear &quot;Need Her Love&quot;, like I did. As ELO albums go, it's not as good as the first 6 out of 7 (I still have no use for Face The Music), but much better than the ones that followed it (until Lynne's great solo album).
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album is one of my all time favorites and I suggest you go buy it. :)
0754053385|5.0|It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible.  Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.  <br />The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing.  Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize.  Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed.  Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.  <br />Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable.  How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt?  I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley.  How did it begin?  It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.  <br />Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership.  Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly.  Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours.

B000002MX7|5.0|I have been in love with Chaka Khan's infectious cheerful spirit since, oh, what, 1975?  This CD really shows why.  Hearing &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; &amp; &quot;Ain't Nobody&quot; take me to a place where I know that certain guy is going to fall in love with me &amp; I'm enjoying the trip getting there.  (There's a lot to be said for anticipation.)  When I first heard Whitney Houston sing &quot;I'm Every Woman,&quot; I enjoyed her vocal acrobatics.  Then I heard CHAKA sing it &amp; I was hoping she WAS every woman because I'd be proud to be her.  But she's not, of course.  She's a goddess!  Get this &amp; get happier right away!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a very good movie.  It was funny and entertaining.  This film was not very realistic, but I enjoyed it any ways.  It was not meant to be taken very seriously, but paints a very real picture of life in the south during the 1930's.  The music is good too--blue eyed blues.<br />The DVD was a good purchase as well.  It includes the video of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\", as well as other footage.<br />This is clearly a good movie about three men who escape the chain gang in order to seek treasure.  The mastermind, Ulysses (George Clooney), appearently lied about this treasure in order to reach his ex-wife before she remarries.  His lie was necessary since the two others were clained with him.  On the way they get into all sorts of situations, including rescuing their friend from a mob and assissting in a bank robbery.  All this in order to remarry an overbearing woman, who seemed disinterested in the father of her own children.  Only after they realize their own popularity as an old-time country act does their fortune change.<br />The movie is 103 minutes, and 24 chapters.  It was orginally released in 1996.  I suggest you go into it with no preconceptions or expectations, and lose yourself in it.
B00000583F|5.0|Just for the record, this was recorded in 1992, but it wasn't actually released until 1994. A lot of love was lost between Sleep and Earache Records over this. Sleep had a lot of bad luck with their record labels.<br /><br />When I first heard this, I hated it. I already considered Sleep to be one step away from being a Melvins cover band due to their first album, Volume One. The other reviwers aren't kidding, this literally sounds like Black Sabbath outtakes circa 1970. Being a diehard Sabbath fan since childhood, I practically felt personally insulted. (Yes, I know how dumb that is.) But as can happen, the derivitiveness is outweighed by the execution. And as the years have gone on, the Sabbath contrasts have made themselves as apparent as the similarities.
B00005B36H|5.0|&quot;Lateralus&quot;...As a long time Tool fan, I awaited this album for a long time. This is exceeds all expectations for a seasoned release. Maynard has delivered some amazing vocals yet again and I find myself enthralled musically in this CD. In fact I still have this playing in my Car every day since the release. I can't stop listening to it.<br />It truely is amazing. And I find this more musically and vocally exciting than any CD released in the past 10 years. There is simple no better CD released since the mid 90's. Tool has not had the overwhelming popularity yet has maintained Platinum status. And I find that this CD is the finest and has a severe passion to it. You find yourself enthralled in this CD more than any other.<br />I attended the Tool concert at a moderately filled stadium at Tacoma, Washington and the music was overwhelming to me. Simply said, the stage performance was odd, but musically, Tool is the best there is and &quot;Lateralus&quot; is the best CD released since the mid-90's. <br />My recommendation...Buy a copy for Home and glue one in your CD player in your car...
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I own.  Even though many people now view the band as &quot;trendy.&quot;  At the same time though just because a lot of people like them now, shouldn't be an excuse not to like them.  In fact, a large ammount of people liking Limp Bizkit might just mean that they actually are a good band.  This album is very good.  I like every single song on it, and it's not too often that you find one of those cds.  The way they mix funk and metal on this album is pure genious.
B0000508U6|5.0|I just want to say that every time I hear the opening strains of any of the songs on this cd, I am instantly relaxed. This band has an amazing ability to reach out and touch me with their music. No, really, it's almost like physical contact, it's so good.<br />There IS one thing better than listening to \\"Yellow\\". Watching the video for it.

B00003CXRP|2.0|It is unfortunate that Tom Hanks gives such an excellent performance in such a huge waste of a movie.  This is as much a commercial for Federal Express as it is a compelling character drama.  The unrelenting product placement is too heavy handed and proved a major distraction from the story.  I hated it!  I give it two stars reluctantly.  Both stars go to Tom Hanks performance, the rest of the movie is a waste!
6302424739|5.0|This film is watchable a hundred times over.  It is one of the Most Romantic stories ever told.  If you cherish the written word and find unrequited love unbearable but  intriguing,  then this Anthony Hopkins/Anne Bancroft movie is for you!  <BR>As you watch two strangers fall in love through letters (and over twenty years of time),  you will realize that the epistolary relationship these two had was incredibly special and bittersweet as they never got to meet face to face.  A heartbreakingly true story,  let us hope that Helene and Frank have now met on the &quot;other side&quot; as both of them have passed on.  Beautifully acted,  well directed,  and as a nice touch, the occasional speaking to the audience makes you feel privaleged to know them.
B00000IQW3|5.0|Alright, there's no real use in going into the plot of the movie here because everyone should have seen this by now and if you haven't, there are plenty of other places to find reviews on the plot, characters, etc.  Let's just say that this is a very charming and fun science fiction film from the 80's that I loved from the very first time that I saw it.<br />Now, let's talk about why you should or should not buy this in it's DVD reincarnation.  First off, the picture quality and sound are not fantastic, but it's important to note that they never were.  This movie is old!  However, they're not horrible by any stretch.  The computer animated sequences have fantastic detail.  It's in the widescreen format, which is slightly annoying.  The top and bottom margins are very wide.  I think they should have taken less room for that, but I'm not sure if there's a standard format for widescreen movies.  I'm watching it on a 27&quot; TV, so I'm guessing that's fairly average for the size of a TV.  Watching it on much less would be like having no picture at all since a good 35% of the screen isn't used.  Still, I did enjoy it very much and I only noticed it a couple of times.  It's just a warning for those who have smaller TV's.  The infamous &quot;extras&quot; actually turn out to be truly extra in this case.  There's great documentary-type footage on the making of the film, which goes into great detail about the trailblazing effects that went into making this great movie.  Lance Guest, the star of the film, actually hosts this as well, which is a nice bonus.  They've also included the movie trailer, which is pretty standard.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this be added to your DVD collection.  It's a great movie that can still be enjoyed today, almost 20 years after its initial release.  It's definitely something that you should see if you have not done so before.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Absolutely the worst movie in a long time.  <br />A.I. is awful.<BR>  <BR>The plot is thin.<BR>  <BR>The special effects are there just because Spielberg was the producer, and they are mostly pointless.  <br />Lots of loose ends, very slow moving.  <br />A true waste of time.  <br />A.I. = Awfully Idiotic.<br />Spend your money on The Matrix, or Dogma.
B00005B36H|5.0|I had only been a Tool fan for about a yera and a half before this CD came out, but after Aenima, Undertow, and Opiate, i was DYING to get my hands on Lateralus. The day it was released, I ditched school and waited at the local music store untill it opened, along with 10 or so other people, and was in the first 10 people to buy it in my town. I listend to it nonstop for probably a month, with zero play of any other cd :)<br />As with the rest of Tool's cds, there is audible difference in the sound from the rest of their albums. But, just like the rest of their CDs, this kicks...too. Lateralus combines a more modern mix of sounds with the same heavy rippin' of Aenima. The intermission songs arnt as, well lame, as the ones on Aenima, and are actualy good listening. An aucustic short follows the first track, leading nicely into the 3rd track, the Patient. Following the Patient, an odd track plays, that sounds like Whale calls or something, that fits in with the hit Schism. Parabol, a slow gentle song suddenly screams into Parabola, the heavier version of it. Later on, Triad tears it up as a fully instrumental song that isnt an intermission. A great collection of awesome songs, crafted beautifuly by Maynard and the band. Once I start playing this album, I cant stop listening untill its done. <br />So if you enjoy Tool's previous almbums, I know you will like this cd. Go buy it now! the reviews over! chop chop!
0783211856|5.0|Yes, the Holocaust happened over 50 years ago. Yes, it is a well-covered topic in literature. However, this is still an important movie, especially for my generation, which has not known any large-scale war. Such excellent works as this remind us of the horrors that can grow from hate, and encourage us not to repeat them.<br />Why is it so abominable that Mr. Spielberg make a film on the holocaust? Is he unqualified simply because he is Jewish? The film is not propaganda, nor exploitative, as the events that are depicted are very thoroughly grounded in reality. They are not sensationalized in typical Hollywood fashion. If Spielberg were only after another blockbuster hit, he would have made the movie much differently (e.g. shorter, more entertaining, with a more likeable protaganist). In fact, this movie is his way of remembering and honoring the victims and heroes of this dark period, through as honest a portrayal as is fit for the big screen.<br />I do not understand the accusations of racism against Germans in this movie. After all, Schindler himself was German, even considered highly by the Nazis in power, before his disapproval of their philosophies developed. In reality, the movie is not racist. Rather, it lays bare the evils which arise from elitism and racism, in this case demonstrated by the Nazis. An intelligent viewer will take this lesson and expand it to apply to all such evil in the world.

6304539258|5.0|I would like to have reviewed this movie if it were on DVD, but since George Lucas will not do that untill Episode III is finished by 2005, I'll just go ahead. This is pretty much a ground stone in science fiction fantasy action movies. While Lucas updated the era of Flash Gordon for a new age, he created characters we love so well. Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) has always been my favorite hero, but yes I love the others as well(giggle). A wonderful story set around the time when the evil Empire led by Sith Lord Darth Vader plan to finish off the Rebellion forces with the ultimate weapon called the Death Star. After Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer)hides the stolen battle plans in lovable droid R2-D2, Luke Skywalker discovers them, and with the aid of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness)and rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford), embarks on a thrilling quest not just to save the princess, but the hope of the entire galaxy. Great fun and entertainment in a true Saturday matinee fashion told by the great Jedi master Lucas himself. With wonderful special effects that were a milestone in movies it will always remain a classic of all movies.
B00004YKUY|4.0|After seeing a Journey story on VH1 and seeing a few of the new songs from Arrival, thought I would give it a shot.<BR>Familiar with \\"Higher Place\\" and \\"All the Way\\".<BR>This is a great, and refreshing CD.<BR>There are ALOT of really good songs.<BR>It has been a while that I was able to buy something that had this many good tunes.<BR>Unfortunantly with todays tast (or lack of it) with artist like <BR>\\"Lil Bow wow\\" Britney spears, and the Backstreet chumps, this music gets bypassed.<BR>I however am having a good time.   Rock on
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie was very good, with excellent acting and outstanding special effects, but perhaps a bit too dependant on the movie. The movie doesn't quite follow the book, and the book is undoubtably better, however the movie had some wonderful points. The much refered to Quidditch scene and 5 star cast continues to amaze me - i went and saw the movie again after the first time, and am planning to buy the movie when it comes out. I would definitely recommend this movie to others. Just make sure you read the book first!!!!
630027120X|4.0|this movie is fine for the non Christians and it may be a good movie i don't know we shut it off about 30 minuts in to it there's alot of nudeity in this movie and parshall nudity so that not to great so if you a Christian looking for a good movie or a good family movie this is not it try Touched By A Angel thats way better than this.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|There is a ten year cycle with Rock Music.  Bands of high-caliber enter the arena every 10 years, there's a new sound movement every 10 years ... and every 10 years, there comes along the quintessential frontman who spikes the punch, lits up a cigarette, raises eyebrows, and pisses people off.  Jim Morrison, Jonny Rotten, Axl Rose, the Gallagher brothers .... and Ryan Adams?  It's far too early to say, but the antics (and music, more importantly) of this braggadocious alt country musician are an impressive start.<br />Three parts Beck, two parts Elton John, and one part Jagger, this is a musician with roots as a child of the eighties.  When is the last time a band has vamped to the theme song from Star Wars, or had cut-out posters of Darth Vader and Chewbacca?  For God's sake, the man read John Milton on stage (largely an obscure reference to most twenty-somethings who flocked the audience, although the initial interpretive reading was well received: \\"Nightingale, where do you put my pic when I'm on a solo?  If I was intergalactic I'd be no Han Solo, but Yoda.  Short, green, slender, looking cool with my light saber shining it's ... all over the place.  damn.\\")  Barefoot on stage, prancing around pliable enough to be plastic man, stepping on lit cigarettes and requiring medical attention between songs ... you love or hate his personality, but you always respect the music.<br />With accompaniments like a sitting slide guitar, harmonica, and blaring wurlizter, Adams' roots run deep into the decades.  As XRT introduced him, \\"A musician who's taken some of the best highlights of the past 35 years and put into a great album.\\"  The Honkytonk derivation is clear, but so too is the folk.  Mixing up songs from Heartbreaker and Gold, and occasionally spilling into the Whiskeytown repertoire, a set that runs 165 minutes drifts in places (similiar to how his cds tend to taper at the end).  When you're lulled, that's when he pulls the ace from his sleeve ... \\"Brown Sugar,\\" and all it's Jagger-esque vocal charades.  Despite this, there's never a doubt that the music is nothing short of some of the best music around .... that, and the fact he isn't afraid to tell you.
B000001FO4|4.0|This was one of the better &quot;Glam Rock&quot; CDs of the era. Good mood swings and the album kicks off with the too cool Bad Seamstress Blues / Fallin' Apart at the Seams. Saw these guys open for Judas Priest in '88 and they kicked it off with that song. Awe inspiring. Since most of you who are reading this probably own the CD or have owned it in the past, I recommend you put it back in your rotation for a few weeks. Not every song is great, but you don't have to skip too many to enjoy it. You should buy this if you live anywhere it snows between October and April.<br />Anybody remember when Britney Fox came out after these guys? HILARIOUS! Cinderella with bigger bangs, frillier shirts and mediocre songs. MTV used to be so fun!
0805062971|5.0|Fight club is a fast but exciting read about what we do to feel alive.  In a world of excessive consumerism, there is very little emotion.  Tyler durden is the split personality of our protagonist who leads him ultimately through a world of real emotions.  These emotions are achieved through after hour boxing matches and a plan to destroy structered society.  However, the protagonist quickly finds that he is not as free as he thought, and is now being controlled by the other side of the spectrum.  AMUST READ!
B000002GA8|5.0|Everyone seems to hate the singing on this album. Its fine. Itss really good once you hear it about 5 times. The vocals are what tell the story in this album and no matter what people may say they do a wonderful job at it!<br />As for the music, it helps tell the story and adds to the picture the album trys to create. the whole album is HG Well's Journey to the Center of the Earth remade and put to music. Its done perfectly.<br />THE ALBUM IS WORTHY OF SIX STARS!!!
0793518326|5.0|OK, This is not a perfect translation of the best pop songs ever written. It is however pretty damn close. There are small micro details missed and some typo's. Other than those tiny problems, this book is damn near perfect. Remeber when we were young pups learning to play guitar? Those lame Beatle music books had all the wrong chords so trying to play along with the records was futile . This book corrects that problem and tries to teach us the correct way to play these songs. <BR>BUY THIS BOOK, PLAY ALONG, YEAH YEAH YEAH

B00005T30L|5.0|I never saw this film when it was first released, but I bought the graphic novel at the time(both excellent in their own different ways) to be ready for when the DVD came out.<br />Now, the film may be based on the graphic novel(BIG Clowes fan), but they are pretty much two separate pieces of work.  While the film focuses heavily on Enid and Seymour, the graphic novel does feature the 50's diner scene where they set up Seymour, but that's his only appearance.  Instead, it is rather more about Enid and Rebecca.  There are a number of key scenes in the film though, just not in order that they were placed in the book(the one scene I really would've liked to have seen in the film, is Dan Clowes book signing)<br />The performances given in this film are top-notch.  Thora Birch is amazing.  She looks like she stepped right out of the graphic novel, they are so alike in appearance.  Steve Buscemi gives off what must be the finest role he has done yet.  Brad Renfro is great as the unfortunate target of Enid and Rebecca, Josh, and Scarlett Johansson is superb as Enid's best friend, Rebecca.<br />When it comes to DVD extras, unfortunately, this disc lacks in them.  It has the following:<br />Deleted and alternative scenes<BR>an 11 1/2 minute featurette with cast and crew<BR>Full length video that is used to introduce the film- \\"Jaan Pehechaan Ho\\" - Gumnaam(1965)- which was the best extra.  I just love it!!<BR>Trailer<br />It would have been nice if there was audio commentary by Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff as well as a gallery reprinting the original covers to the Eightball comics as well as the collected editions.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|An OK film, bit much in places but full of action. Action all the way through, never get bored, especially if your a Angelina Jolie fan.
B000059MEK|5.0|&quot;Discovery&quot; is probably one of the best albums in the techno gene that i have bought in a long time. It mixes 70's and 80's grooves with hard hitting dance tracks as well. This album will put you in such a good mood, all the songs are so curious and high energy. I bought the album after hearing &quot;Digital Love&quot; on the ad from GAP. I expected that it would be the only song that I liked, but boy was I wrong, every song on this album is great! A few of them have lyrics, but most don't; either way, they are fun to listen to. Don't miss out on this album, its definitely worth the money.
0446677450|4.0|This book is great for revolutionizing the way you think about finances.<br />Robert Kiyosaki has a excelent writing style that makes this book humourous and easy to read.  By placing emphasis on changing thought patterns about money over specific details makes the reader want to find out about how to capture the wealth they are capabile of.
B00004U8JV|1.0|Someone should take the writers of this movie and feed them to a T-Rex.  This movie ranks as one of the worst movies I can remember.  There are so many things wrong with it I don't know where to start.  I suppose the most annoying thing about it is the way the characters in the movie practically throw themselves into the jaws of the dinosaurs.  You have all these mercenaries loaded with weapons and not one of them can even hit one dinosaur.  They all flee in panic every time one shows up. Gee whiz, didn't they think they were going to see any dinosaurs on Jurassic Park???  These people rarely act like someone who is on an island filled with man eating creaturs.  And of course, it wouldn't be complete without the annoying kid tagging along, as usual.  Jeffrey Goldblum and the hunter are about the only characters that act in a serious manner.<BR>Don't even waste your time with this trash.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|I'm wondering if all the people who gave this great reviews really watched this movie . . . it's long and draggy - it should have learned from the A&amp;E Pride and Prejudice - that movie was 5 hours long, but it never lags. Rent Persuasion, don't buy it.
B00005JL8C|5.0|I saw this film in Paris last October. Director, Michael Haneke has delivered an incredibly powerful film based on a controversial Austrian novel. Isabelle Huppert plays Erika, a brilliant piano professor at a college in Vienna. At work she is respected among her peers and indimidating to her students. At home, she lives with her tyrant mother (Annie Girardot). Erika and her mother have an emotionally abusive co-dependent relationship to the point where they share the same bedroom. Erika's sex life consists of eerie visits to porno shops and sadistic self-mutilation. When one of her students (Benoit Magimel) attempts to seduce her, she agrees but on HER terms. <br />A family film this is not. There are some very disturbing scenes of emotional and physical abuse. But as difficult as the subject matter is, it does help the viewer to understand the psyche of a woman who has been denied happiness all her life. Isabelle Huppert is fantastic in a very difficult role. Her performance of the tortured Erika is the only time, I've seen a character so disturbed and cruel who I found pity in and wanted to see succeed. Forget the Oscar nominations, this is the best female performance of the year! Annie Girardot and Benoit Magimel are wonderful and very convincing in their roles as well. Lastly, the director, Michael Haneke. I've never seen any of his previous work but few directors have the ability to take complete control of my attention and keep it long after their film is over. Haneke is one of the very few who did. \\"La Pianiste\\" is a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for European cinema.
0425170349|1.0|One of the things that made Clancy's best novels great was the way he kept 20 interlinked stories going at once in descriptive, but not excessive detail that kept your heart racing.  He had an amazing ability to protray each group from their viewpoint without judgement, and with some accuracy.  He did the best and the worst of society. Apparent his hate of even the mildest of Environmentalists is too great to allow this type of protrayal, or he just didn't have time to do any research on Environmentalist any place other the National Review.  His protrayals of the groups involved is shallow and unbelievable, and he has conpensated for only involving a few groups by increasing detail about things he clearly doesn't understand.  This book is so bad it goes on the very short list of Books that I can't finish and plan to throw in the garbage to avoid punishing others with its poorly written drivel.
B00005OM4N|5.0|OMG- Britney's selftitled album is the BEST album ever.

B000003CKH|5.0|Hanging out at the juice shop before teaching class, most of the &quot;alternative&quot; music that the establishment plays goes in one ear and out the other. But this recording caught my attention for its originality, creativity, and honesty. Cake takes an interesting blend of various styles (from Miles Davis to the Beatles to Lou Reed) and puts them together to form something fresh. Glad to know such bands still exist.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|If you think all fairytales should feature a tender-hearted, beautiful heroine and a handsome prince, both almost perfect and even their imperfections attractive to us (like Ariel's stubborness, for example) than this movie is not for you. Our hero is an ogre who shuns people and eats eyes. Our heroine is a princess who is well-trained in the martial arts and hasn't got any voice. <br />Many facts in this movie will offend the tender-hearted -- I'll admit that one scene was too much even for me, when Fiona's  singing kills a bluebird whose eggs she cooks afterwards ... ugh, that was TOO much. Also, it ridiculizes many other cartoons with its backwards humor, or movies like the Matrix. All these facts sum up to a little bit -- or more -- kitsch. <br />The ever present funny character - in this case the talkative donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice - is another cartoon cliche, but somehow it is not as annoying as others -- see Mushu in Mulan, also voiced by Eddie Murphy, now *that* was an annoying character.<br />Still, the movie IS funny and very, very enjoyable. And the basic meaning of the story, that is that you do not have to be physically perfect in order to find true love, is a very, very welcome change and very, very true. It warmed my heart.

079073639X|5.0|In my opinioin this is the best sci-fi horror movie ever. It has a great story in which an alien space ship crashes in the ocean and the most unlikely characters get sent to investigate. There's some of the best acting around with hoffman as the main character. He plays as a shrink and darn doesn he do a good job. There's also that guy who plays as one of the council members in Episode:1.<br />I don't want to get in-depth with the story because it would ruin it for you but bieleve me, This is a movie you don't want to pass up (plus It's 2 hours long!)
B000005HLV|3.0|Before I bought this album everyone told me that it was the best album by Mayhem. Well, it isn't. Sure, the guitar and drum parts are good, but the vocals are so terrible! I do not know what posessed Euronymous to ask this guy to be in the band. I'm listening to the guitar solo in  Freezing Moon, it's great, and then all of a sudden you hear the worst sound you've ever heard when the vocals come in. It's not the worst album, but definitely not the best of Mayhem.
B00003CXXP|5.0|When I first heard of A.I. Artificial Intelligence early last year, I thought that perhaps Spielberg is making a quasi-sequal to E.T. Later I heard of Pinocchio theme within the movie, then I thought that Spielberg is making a live-action version of Pinocchio. I didn't see it in the theater, with less than spectacular box office receipts...<br />Then I saw the DVD.... I was so wrong about the movie in every single aspect. This is not E.T.. This is certainly not a live-action version of Pinocchio (although Pinocchio motif is used very heavily), and above all, this is not a ho-hum movie. It is a true masterpiece, and you owe yourself to at least rent this one to view it without any prejudices that you may have of the movie. Many of you will end up buying this one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was very skeptical at first, due to many of the positive reviews, but I would have to side with them.<br />First, is there really a concept to OK Computer?<br />My feeling is it's based on the ills of society, as well as what society has become, noticed or unnoticed. Have we all entered the &quot;Computer&quot; when we were born? Are we all computerized to act, think and feel a certain way? Think about that.<br />It seems when listening to the album, you're stepping into the mind of a paranoid schizophrenic. The lyrics seem to be written in a series of multiple thoughts spliced together, which makes it enigmatic and more compelling. The album artwork is no different either.<br />Musically, the album is mulit-layered in soundscape, so it may take a few listens to digest. It's emotional, thought-provoking and disturbing. If tracks like Airbag, the Bohemian Rhapsody-ish Paranoid Android, Let Down, Karma Police, Electioneering and the achingly beautiful Tourist leave you disheartened, sour and tearful, then I believe Thom Yorke and the boys have done their job. This is nothing short of a brilliant and emotional masterpiece
B000002JS6|4.0|back in black has in my opinion 4 amazing songs.  They are, in order of best to worst, back in black, you shook me all night long, rock and roll aint noise pollution and hells bells. The rest of the songs are pretty good but sound like bad imitations of the four classics. i would recommend buying this cd just for those 4 songs because they are so amazing.  back in black is great for any fan of great music, particularly classic rock, who wants to get into ACDC.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Typical movie where morons can't mind there business, they just had to be nosy! There was a few minutes of scare, but I was too busy laughing, or nodding off! If you like the type of movie, where 2 teenagers are being chased all around back roads, by a psycho who never is going to die.....then you should like this movie. But I still say they should of added more to this movie, at least in Halloween we knew the killer was psycho kid!
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie was spectacular <BR>definatly the best star wars made
B00003CX5P|5.0|Yes, this is a very good movie.  I am continually amazed at the amount of criticism that is dished out at George Lucas and Episode 1.  The core group of fans consists of a twenty-something crowd that grew up with these movies.  They were a part of our young lives and the effect they had on pop culture simply can't be measured.  So, George Lucas is faced with making these prequels under the pressure of &quot;hey George, make me feel like a kid again.&quot;  It is simply impossible to settle everyone's demands of what these prequels should look and feel like.  After 22 years, it is natural for us to have our own views of what this &quot;beginning&quot; should look like.  You have to take into account that we know how the stories ultimately end.  These prequels are a means to that end.  SW1 was a very well-done movie that will come under more scrutiny than any film in recent memory.  <br />George Lucas does spend a lot of time on the fx in the movie.  He is also the Godfather of Sci-fi special effects.  He is the pioneer of the craft.  In 1977, no one thought anything like that could be done and look even somewhat realistic.  So - again - I think people spend too much energy saying what looks too &quot;CG&quot; or not real enough.  It's a fantasy environment!  Look at Yoda in the movie.  He looks like a puppet from K-mart.  That's how far the technology has come.  In 1980 Yoda was a marvel of creature creation.  Now, things are going to be computer generated (note that Yoda is completely CG in ep. 2) to make the film seem more other-worldly.  Whenever someone presents something brand new - it comes under fire and the next guy down the street will top it.  Still - Lucas takes too much heat for his interest in creating a realistic environment.<br />Lucas also answers fan demand.  It's no coincidence that Boba Fett and Jango Fett are in Ep. 2.  He knows they are the characters we want to see - and there they are. Lucas just can't answer every fan's demands.  <br />Raggingon Star Wars 1 is something that is currently en vogue.  I expect Ep. 2 to come under the same scrutiny.  However, just try to sit back and enjoy the movie!
0385312083|5.0|...SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE ranks as one of the greatest war novels (anti-war novels, I suppose) of all time.<br />Vonnegut is a genius, of course, but there are novels where he lets oddity take over for story.  That's not the case here.... SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE is horrifying, hilarious and profound simultaneously.

B00003CXXP|3.0|This is a magnificiently flawed movie and who could expect anything else? It had been in development by Kubrick for a number of years and completed on his death by Spielberg. It would have been better for Spielberg to have just dedicated a movie to Kubrick than to actually try to capture what he may or may not have done. <br />But in his doing this Spielberg's failure is without parallel. Where Kubrick would have given us edge such as in Rouge city Spielberg gives us a sanguine alternative. Where Gigalo Joe would have been... well a gigalo, Spielberg gives us a dancer. And where Kubrick would have given us primary colours to knock our eyes out, Spielberg manages only a portion of the palette. A Kubrick movie that would have been about love, sex and relationships was turned by Spielberg into what he always does - a movie about a boy and his mother or a movie about a boy and his non-mother (maybe this was both).<br />The performance of Jude Law is excellent and an important counterpoint to Osment and I think the ending fails because his character disappears about a half an hour before the film finishes.<br />We should celebrate this movie on a number of levels but foremost is that this failure by Spielberg proves that no one can make a Kubrick film but Kubrick. Hopefully Kubrick wantabees will take a page from Spielberg's experience and find a different way to pay homage to this great director other than by copying him.
0380733358|5.0|I'm not a fan of spy novels because the ones I've read to date have been big disappointments. But Follett is in a league of his own! He doesn't drag you to the end but manages to make you want to race with him to the finish line! A very interesting read!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I purchased this album on a recommendation from a friend and I couldn't be happier that I took his advice. They really know how to pack each song full of hooks. Where most bands have one, if that many, per song, The Strokes have three or four per song. It never slows down. That's the very good news. The bad news is that every song has the singer sounding like he's using a Mr. Microphone to record the vocals. I found this fairly annoying during my first run though but I got used to it. It was very hard to understand the words but, hell, look at Murmur.  Also, at first I thought the songs sounded too similar but after hearing it a few times, I'm find that isn't the case. They are actually quite different from one another, but the pace and the energy is similar and sustained throughout the album. The rhythms lean towards new wave while the guitars tend to have a clean, post-punk sound. You can hear the influences from early The Cure, to The Ramones, to The Beatles, to Elvis Costello, and even Weezer. I'd give it 4.5 stars if that were possible.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I was riveted to this movie for the first half of it. The idea of the robot boy giving and recieving love was so intriguing. You had to feel so bad for David as he was continually abused and misunderstood. That was the charm of the movie and it tied into the \\"can robots give love and can we give it back?\\" theme. So, when David was left alone - he becomes the tragic figure that strives for love and redemption.<br />However, the plot changes into a moral message and I was left twisting in the wind. Spielberg kind of goes off into a \\"we should take care not to abuse technology and A.I.\\" diatribe. What is lost is the original story and the compassion for what happened in the first segment of the film. I was expecting a reunion with his mother in the present-day, I suppose. Was that too much to ask? <br />I am a big fan of story-telling. This one had me and then lost me. I came away feeling lost and sad. Yes, the effects are brilliant - but that's beside the point in my opinion. The absence of the original storyline and characters hurt this movie.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I've only recently heard of Shakira, in Britian we didn't get her spanish albums, but this album is fantastic. The way she blends different styles of music is excellent, this album is so different from anything else i've heard.<BR>My favourite songs are 'Underneath Your Clothes','Objection', 'Whenever,Wherever' and 'The One'. But there aren't any songs that i don't like, even the spanish songs are great. And I can't understand a word of it.<BR>If you do anything smart this year then it should be buying this album you won't be disappointed.
0805047905|5.0|My daughter is 24 months now and has been interested in this book since she was 8 months old.  She loves to say me at the end of each page and repeatedly tells me what each animal is.  In fact sometimes she likes to just go to the end of the book so she can point and tell me all the animals she sees.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, even to newborns.  The colors and animals seem to be very attracting to children as well as its repeative words.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I just wanted to say real quick that this is the best anime I have ever seen.  I have watched many great animes including: ghost in the shell, macross plus, sin and others and this is by far my favorite.  It has an incredible story line and the voice acting is incredible.  I watched this movie in excess of 12 times the first time I rented it and then bought it and continue to watch it almost every weekend.  Just thought I would let everyone know of this movies gret storyline and acting.  If you are even thinking about it, buy it.
B00005JKQX|4.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" tells the story of legendary mathematician John Nash, widely credited with inventing \\"game theory\\" and cursed with paranoid schizophrenia.  Arriving in Princeton university in the late 1940's (the film makes the point of that these were pivotal days for mathematics - with theoretical mathematicians taking credit for winning WWII by breaking enemy codes, cracking the secrets of nuclear fission and inventing the economic theories that put the world back together again.) Socially awkward, Nash struggles to craft an original mathematical idea - suffering a sort of mathematician's block while his peers churn out successful, if derivative work.  Nash seems consumed by the idea that a hidden mathematical order can explain seemingly random or chaotic events - the feeding patterns of pigeons, the mating habits of drunken Princeton students or how badly a person's taste in clothing is.  With the help of a free-wheeling roommate, Nash appears to overcome some inner demons and publishes a thesis which brazenly offers a statistical and theoretical model for explaining these seemingly spontaneous events.  The theory, which Nash hits on trying to explain how one of five guys will manage to get a beautiful blonde's attention in a local bar, has larger applications - everything from macroeconomics to the strategies of nuclear war - and flies in the face of traditional economics.  <br />The film cuts to Nash a few years later - now more suave and successful crunching numbers at MIT and occasionally for the Government.  The script makes the point that not all is right with Nash, but counterbalances with hints that Nash is merely a forceful personality (teaching calculus in an undershirt because it's too hot not to) with a broad imagination (picking out shapes formed by stars, or recurring patterns among large number groups in Russian transmissions).  Despite his quirks, Nash manages to maintain respect among peers who shunned him in Princeton (where he never attended class) and the love of Alicia Nassar (Jennifer Connelly), his future wife and biographer.  He also finds himself under the attentions of Parcher (Ed Harris), a shadowy cold warrior who runs a secret decryption program in an abandoned warehouse on MIT grounds - one that everybody thought empty.  Parcher chills Nash with a tale of a Nazi A-bomb stolen and smuggled somewhere into America by a soldiers of a radical faction of the Soviet Army.  Ordered to scan seemingly meaningless newspaper and magazine articles for clues (the media is apparently part of the conspiracy) Nash papers his office with hundreds of pages linked by his red pen and arcana.  In a film about schizophrenia (a decreased capacity to distinguish what is real from what is not), it's no surprise that Parcher's story (one that others would easily tout as \\"frighteningly plausible\\") is merely the latest and most elaborate delusion Nash suffers.  Diagnosed a schizophrenic, subjected to insulin shock-therapy and a seemingly endless stream of other drugs, Nash takes a long fall from his exalted position as master-mathematician.  Trying to avoid both drugs (because they inhibit both his intellect and his passions), Nash is tortured by his delusions which reduce him to a seeming cripple (students at Princeton lampoon his distinctive limp).<br />This was a heartbreaking film that makes a very simple point - that love can't be theorized.  Numbers create logical but entirely delusional constructs while Nash's love for his wife offers him some link with reality.  That said, the film - brilliantly lead by Russel Crowe - makes some missteps.  (I'll let others deal with the supposed factual oversights like Nash's sexual ambiguity or his abandonment of an illegitimate child) Crowe's love keeps him from sliding deeper into madness, but it's a chance meeting with a promising student in Princeton's library that truly unlocks Nash's sanity, and reveals that teaching may set his mind free.  Also, the script glances overthose most important years - those in which Nash had dealt with his problem without resprting to debilitating medication.  Was he truly able to manage?  Was he productive?  We just don't know.  The script, much like Nash himself, also has a decreased capacity to tell the true from the imagined - real characters like Nash's colleagues and his son, and the forceful Dr. Rosen (Christopher Plummer) have little substance when compared to those the film quickly identifies as inventions of Nash's wounded psyche.  Plummer's character stays long enough to warn Nash of his problem and convince his wife that those people her husband had mentioned never existed, then he disappears like a phantom. While we may suspect Ed Harriss's character, others have more urgency and plausibility than the real characters. Nash's delusions themselves remain confined to several characters whom he understands to be delusions yet continues to be plagued by.  Also, there's little irony to those delusions - an imaginary friend, an imaginary young girl - or any inner explanation for why or how he his mind has constructed them. The film doesn't even explore the cautionary moral of the end of WWII, when outrageous advances in technology and the cold war combined to alter reality as never before and engender a sort of paranoid detachment among everybody.  Still a triumph for Russell Crowe.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is, without a doubt, the hottest band on the planet.  They get absolutely no airplay by MTV, who is too busy with Rap to play anything good.  And they get panned by critics who say their sound is too redundant.  Scott Stapp can't help the fact that he sounds a bit like Eddie Vedder, but I don't hear the striking resemblance most people describe.  And Creed can't help the fact that they do great rock music, but then again they wouldn't want to change that.<BR>     Creed first broke onto the music scene with their independently produced &quot;My Own Prison.&quot;  This was an excellent record, and spawned them 4 modern rock No. 1 hits.  So to follow up their huge debut, they did even more great rock music.  The songs on Human Clay flow very well from one to another, especially the transition from &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; to &quot;Higher.&quot;  Mark Tremonti combines searing guitar riffs with hauntingly beautiful melodic hooks that nobody in music can compare to.  And Scott Stapp has the best voice currently in music today, which is no minor statement coming from me.  The songs on Human Clay flow, and each song is a good song alone as well as on the record.   <BR>     The highlights of the record are &quot;What If,&quot; which made an appearance on the Scream 3 soundtrack, &quot;Higher,&quot; which was mysteriously not nominated for any Grammys despite being the best rock song of the year, and &quot;Inside Us All,&quot; which creates a peaceful state of mind until Tremonti's screaming Les Paul tears into a guitar solo that scorches the hair off of your head.  <BR>    Simply put, Creed rocks, and it's sad that they are getting absolutely no credit from anyone when they sound so good.
B0000256VK|5.0|This summer (2002) &quot;Avalon&quot; will be twenty years old.  It's hard to believe!  The album sounds as fresh and innovative today as it did then. &quot;Avalon&quot; is one of those albums which was designed to be listened to in its entirety.  It can quite literally transport you into another world.  <br />The '80s was known for its synth pop.  No synth pop band, regardless of decade, ever matched the beauty and passion expressed on this recording.

0930289455|5.0|This is the most in-depth Batman comic I have ever read, and has become my favourite Batman story of all time. The story deals with Joker escaping, paralyzing Barbara Gordon, kidnapping Commissoner Gordon, and trying to prove that any man can go crazy in a single, bad day. As Batman hunts the Joker, the reader is treated to the Joker's origin story, and sees how thin the line is that seperates Batman from the Joker.<br />I won't try to get into the psychological aspects of this story -suffice it to say that other reviews have covered it throughly and any attempt on my part would only make me look foolish. However, I will say that the most chilling part about this book is how, if you replace Batman and the Joker with two everyday people, the events still feel horribly real. This is not escapist reading as all comic books have been labeled, in fact, this is the book to show people who don't believe that powerful stories can be told in this medium. Both Batman and the Joker had a single bad day - so why didn't Batman go insane like the Joker did? The reader wants to know the fine line that seperates these two characters, partly so they can realize how close to crossing that line they are in their own lives. The art is truly amazing -detailed, moody, and brilliantly inked - the scenes in the Joker's funhouse scare the reader as much as they scare Gordon. The flashbacks are also impressively tied into the present, with similiar situations bookending each scene. The story begins and ends on the same note, like a vicious, never-ending cycle. Plus, you know you have something special when, after all the vicious, sadistic things the Joker has done, you still feel sorry for him.<br />&quot;The Killing Joke&quot; is a true masterpiece, and earns its place as one of the best comics of all time, and a true work of fiction.
0140185232|4.0|I really like Maugham's work, especially \\"The Moon and Sixpence,\\" and enjoyed this book.  The basic plot concerns a writer (Maugham himself serves as narrator) who becomes acquainted with group of wealthy Americans.  They come into and out of each others lives over a period between WWI and WWII.  One of these Americans, Larry, decides to drop out of society.  At first it is unclear why he does so, but eventually it becomes apparent that he is seeking spiritual fulfillment.  Equal parts mysticism and social comedy, the \\"Razor's Edge\\" is well-written and thought-provoking.<br />I'm not a fan of novels that deal with religion or philosophy, but I was intrigued nevertheless by \\"The Razor's Edge.\\"  It's the type of novel that sticks with you after you've read it and the characters remain vivid.  I did however, think that Larry is more of a literary device than a fully fleshed out character.  He seems to pop in at convenient times, drop some spiritual wisdom, remain mysterious, and then vanish.  Maugham also spends a disturbing amount of time describing again and again what a wonderful smile Larry has.  The use of Maugham as the narrator is also a bit suspect at times, as he frequently (and needlessly?) elaborates that he is simply relating stories that others have told to him, that he is reconstructing these tales, that he is adding details, etc. - very repetitive.  Despite these flaws, the book is a very worthwhile read, and I highly recommended it.
B00005KA97|1.0|Everyone involved with the making of this film should be put under house arrest and kept away from cameras for the rest of their lives.  The dialogue is garbage.  The music is sappy, ethno-philiac garbage.  The actors--all of them--are garbage.  Let's not talk about the lighting.  Let's not talk about the makeup.  Let's not talk about the absurdly horrendously stupid cooking subplot.  Or about how all Latins, apparently, do nothing but cook and dance and sing and make lo---ve all day long.  This isn't bad like, Boy you have to watch this movie to see how bad it is.  It's bad like, Please don't ever watch this movie, because you won't be able to forigve yourself.
B00005Y228|3.0|Kylie Minogue may be a relative unknown here in the States, but her eighth and latest album \\"Fever\\" and first single, \\"Can't get you out of my head\\" is set to change all that.  With no apparent room for ballads, \\"Fever\\" barrels through 12 whirligig tracks replete with indelible hooks and dazzling production values.  A technically limited singer, Kylie croons in a smoldering coquettish register that buoys the album when more conventional lyrics threaten to bog it down.  Of course, it helps that some good old-fashioned, chest-rattling bass and heavy dollops of Daft Punk techno sparkle back the music.  Kylie may not be looking to break any new musical ground here, but that's beside the point for an album that simply aspires to be and succeeds in becoming pure Disco exuberance.

0838577016|2.0|It was required by many of our introductory neuroscience classes.  But the fact remains it is a comprehensive introductory text that deals very little with the actual physiology.  It may be useful for psychologists or other non \\"hard-core\\" neuroscientists, but for physiologists, especially those trained in molecular biology or biophysics, I would not recommend this book since it does not present any topic to a significant depth, thus most of the time lacks insights.  I recommend Shepards book on Neurobiology as an introduction for neurobiology and Johnston and Wu for a more in depth introduction to the physiology of the nervous system.
0451457994|4.0|I saw Kubrick's film (1968) several years ago and I thought it was simply too ambiguous to understand or appreciate. However, the novel clarified things greatly.<br />Granted that some of Clarke's ideas have been falsified (e.g. in the novel, the Chinese visit the Moon three times by 2001, over 30 nations have nuclear weapons, a permanent base is established on the Moon and the Soviet Union still exists), the novel still remains remarkably plausible. Clarke thought that the space race of the 1960's would continue at the same feverish pace throughout the late 20th century, alas, he was wrong. It is true that the International Space Station is due to completed soon, there have been no further manned ventures to the Moon. Clarke is the typical writer of Golden Age science fiction in that respect.<br />The description of Discovery (the space ship of the novel) is entirely realistic with its limited food reserves, sublight speeds, hibernation and A.I. computer that controls the ship. The computer that runs the ship, HAL 9000, was well executed in the novel and the sudden betrayal of the computer is explained much better than in the film...<Clarke explains in the introduction that was completely coincidental and that HAL stands for Heuristically ALgorithmic computer, it is nonetheless amusing to compare HAL to Big Blue and the general suspicion that many people seem to have that big corporations are evil. That said, the fall of HAL is beautifully explained in the novel and compared to the film, which if I remember correctly, simply has HAL suddenly attacking with no explanation.<br />My overall impression in comparing to the novel to the...It strove to evoke wonder but it failed because it was simply too mysterious. The ending makes much more sense; it is amazing how much difference narration makes. There does seem to be a theme in Clarke's works of humanity maturing and then growing into something completely different (e.g. see Clarke's \\"Childhood's End\\"). In both works,humanity, under the guidance of aliens, transitions into immaterial existence and fondly regards it time on Earth as an adult looks back on his childhood.<br />However, the ending in the novel drags somewhat due to the lack of dialogue. Clarke has obviously done some research into astronomy for he describes stars, and other astronomical phenomena with great accuracy. Yet, it feels like it is degrading into mysticism laced with astronomy. <br />It is an interesting novel and it is a good treatment of a perennial SF theme; first contact with aliens. The aliens of the novel are loosely described as paternal as one of the most memorable passages of the novel says, \\"And because, in all the galaxy, they had found nothing more precious than Mind, they encouraged its dawning everywhere. They became farmers of the stars; they sowed, and sometimes they reaped.\\" (pages 243-244)<br />Given a choice between a grand, ambiguous film and comprehensible novel, the choice is clear.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is one of the most beautiful movies I ever saw. And the soundtrack is one of the most breathtaking movie soundtracks I ever heard. Braveheart is a must-have in every collection. <BR>A hell of a job Mel.
1559409010|5.0|The Criterion Collection does it again, with the best possible version of Life of Brian. <br />First of all, the film itself looks and sounds as good as it will get. Many of the original materials on this film were sadly destroyed in a dispute over Handmade films, which is sad, as this also wiped out all the outtakes from the film, at least all the original materials, negatives, soundtracks, and such.<br />Luckily, Terry Jones had a 3/4&quot; videotape of a rough edit of the film, and apparantly some film footage survived too. These materials are used as bonus scenes, and are very enjoyable. Sadly, parts of this videotape seem to have decomposed dramatically, but it is still very interesting watching. <br />The other features are all very enjoyable. The commentaries are interesting and not self-aggrandizing, as so many commentaries end up being. We get a real insight into the creative process. <br />There is a documentary here, filmed on location, and it is interesting viewing, though a bit choppy as far as editing goes. <br />The only part of this dvd that might disappoint is the fact that it doesn't have nearly as much wierd add-ons as the Holy Grail dvd. It's an excellent disc, and well worth owning, but if you are expecting the huge amount of bonus stuff that the Holy Grail has, you will be disappointed.<br />Enjoy!
034537410X|5.0|Extraordinary Book!!!<BR>If you practice the techniques, you will have success.

0783225792|2.0|In almost every Joe Pesci movie - he either gets beat up or killed. Not only did he get beat up in this movie, he got killed too... something that was long overdue! It seems as though every movie Martin Scorsese has to make - it has to have Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in it. <br />This movie - has to be one of the worst films of all crime movies (other movies that share my award are: The Last Don I-II). Scorsese who has finished another movie GANGS OF NEW YORK, but to tell you the truth, it'll probably be the same movie only in a different time period.<br />At least Francis Ford Coppola knows that he cannot top the Godfather series. But unlike Coppola - he keeps on going on the one topic that once gained him much success.<br />So at least Joe Pesci hasn't been any films recently (I think that movie audiences are tired of his voice), and Scorsese isn't the biggest successful director.<br />The only two actors that are doing well from the movie are: Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and James Woods. <br />And another part of the movie that is annoying is the trading of narrating! It's Pesci and then it's De Niro - he basically sounds like he's doing the commentary for a movie on the DVD, but only sounds more excited and interested.

B00003CXCQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent dvd set, but...<br />There are moments that make me wonder, is this all really necessary?<br />For instance, the film looks good. Very good. Too good. There is not a flaw to be seen, no specks, no dirt, no dust. Nothing. It's simply too clean. I get this horrible feeling sometimes that I'm not watching the original film, but a remake!<br />Yet the restoration is well done, and the colors are simply phenominal. This is how the film must have looked the first time it was shown. <br />There are many bonus materials here, almost all of which are excellent. The lost scenes are fascinating, the additional music and film materials are interesting, and the development ideas are well presented.<br />Then comes the scariest moment of all - a history of the Disney company. <br />It starts off well enough, and we get to see all the artistic acheivements that happened in the 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's, but when we get to the 80's, it gets scary. We basically have a laundry list of everything the Disney comapny owns, parks, baseball teams, hockey teams, boats, and on and on. I was waiting for Angela Lansbury to pull out the deed to the country. What was sad was how blunt the presentation was of what is basically corporate propaganda. It ruined the spirit of the whole set for me, as I realized that these dvds weren't made to celebrate art, they were made to celebrate the beginning of a corporate monolith. <br />Ah well, the rest of this set is great, and by buying it, I've increased stock values.<br />Enjoy!

B000002OAZ|5.0|The gold has a number of bonus tracks from the session and the remastering has really cleaned up the recording.  One such bonus track is a studio conversation of the Wolf teachin Clapton the chords to Little Red Rooster.  classic!  The story goes that in the middle of the night Bill Wyman got a phone call and was asked if he wanted to jam with the Wolf.  He showed up in a red hot minute.  And what a night, and a testament to the brilliance of the Wolf, he got darn close to getting the best of British rock with Clapton, Wyman, Watts, Winwood, and bunch of others.
B00005UKE0|5.0|George Harrison's Album is wonderful! If you are a fan of the Beatles you will be a huge fan of this album.  32 years after the origanal relaese date the songs are still great.

B000002H97|2.0|I've had a dislike for Metallica ever since I first heard their name, which has to be one of the cheesiest names for a band ever.  I'm hardly qualified to judge all of their material, since the only albums I've heard straight through are the self-titled, Load and Reload.  Well, Load doesn't really count, because after getting about halfway through it I had to rip it out of my CD player and burn it.<br />Anyhow, based on the 10 or 11 songs that I have heard off the older Metallica albums, the black album seems to be a huge sellout.  They dumbed down the songwriting majorly, slowed down the songs way too much, and used way too heavy production.  One of the reasons why most heavy metal is garbage is because the emphasis is on heaviness and not the songs.  Metallica make the drums here so sickeningly heavy that the songs just get ruined.<br />Plus the fundamental lameness of it all should make you feel embarassed to even own this album.  Take the lead single, Enter Sandman, which tries to be scary but lyrically sounds like something a 10 year old child still afraid of the dark would come up with.  Come on.  And how about song titles like &quot;The God That Failed&quot; and &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot;?  I mean I know that this album is like 10 years old already, but those titles would have been cliched even 30 years ago.<br />The one song on here I can tolerate is &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot;, which has a really cool riff.  But like all the other songs on this album its still marred by the overly metal guitars and drums.  As for the rest of the album, there is no reason whatsoever to buy it unless you live in a Jerry Springer-esque town and want the rest of the trailer park to think you're as cool as them.  Even the horrible Reload is better than this, because even if its mostly filler and probably an even worse album overall, at least it has 3 semi-decent songs &quot;Fuel&quot;, &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, &quot;The Unforgiven Two&quot; as opposed to the onesemi-decent song here.  Note that I said semi-decent, as in tolerable but still not worth actually paying money for.  If you want Metallica, look for the older stuff, because this album is garbage.
034537410X|5.0|Excellent information on lucid dreaming.  If you are facinated by dreams like I am, why not take them to a whole new level.  Within 2 weeks of practicing I have already experienced 2 conscious dreams.  All I have to say is exhilarating!!!  Stephen's MILD technique works great.  My key was MILD, extensive state testing and of course strong will.  But first you must remember your dreams fairly well.  Before getting the book I was writing dreams down for about 2 weeks, sometimes 6 a night.  Great book Stephen, when will I see another???
B00003CXZ4|5.0|imagine this buy the time you finish reading this sentence you will have forgotten why your even sitting at your computer.this is what Guy Pearce character is like all through this movie,he suffers from a type of memory loss due to a tragic accident.this memory defect only prevents him from remembering what happens now,everything before the accident he does remember.the movie involves him trying to find out who attacked him and killed his wife...i'm not givin nothin else up,oh i will tell you this the movie plays backwards,its hard to descibe but it relly draws you into the film making you fill part of the story as lost as the main character but picture this you suffer from this condition which only ables you to remember for a quick minute, a man calls you tells you the mans name who killed your  wife all you have to do is remember the information he is telling you case closed you are drasticly looking for a pencil to right down the killers name when all of the sudden the man on the phone is gone you keep saying...remember..remeber all the sudden your dog lets out a bark..as you turn to your dog you forget you had even spoken to someone on the phone much less someone who had told you the killers identity.frustraiting heh.The director Christopher Nolan is the greatest screenwriter in hollywood,now also on my top directors list.nothing irritates me more that this film was only nominated for two academy awards(screenwriter and editing)which should win hands down but what about best diretor or best film they would definately be my choice this year.anyway if you only watch one movie in your entire life watch this one

0553579908|3.0|I might have given 4 stars if I were comparing it to other fantasy (Forgotten Realms or novels based on video games being 1 star, Tolkien being 5). Martin's characters are interesting, for the most part. He is not tied to convention. His plot is good, and he's not scared to kill off a main character or two or three or four. . .<br />Here are my gripes. The series is fun reading, but it's not litereature. It teaches us nothing. That's ok; I read the book, I enjoyed it, but I did not learn from it.<br />Martin's originality derives itself painfully from everyone else who writes fantasy. I see copy cat themes from Robert Jordan, from Tad Williams, from Stephen King, and even from Anne McCaffrey. That's ok too; he mixes them well, and there's enough originality that it still feels unique.<br />Martin's pacing is better than Jordan's, but his world is not as detailed nor as textured. Jordan's cultures and prophecies and legends and nations are a tapestry unrivalled in epic fantasy. Martin doesn't match him. No one will match Jordan's world for a long time. Where Martin excels, however, is getting us into the heads of his characters. Not many authors do this so well. His characters are complex, and one is never sure which side one would like to see win.<br />One final complaint. I have never read [more cuss words] in a fantasy novel. I don't need to read vulgar and detailed descriptions of sex to get the idea. It does nothing to advance the story, and it's far from being shocking anymore. Leave it out. Trying to shock us is getting old.<br />To conclude, it was a very entertaining read, and I will finish the series, but it's still pulp, and I want more from the fantasy genre.

B000002U82|5.0|I am only sixteen years old, and i have only been a true Pink Floyd fan for a year or two, and i would have to say that Pink Floyd isn't a band that you can simply half listen to, and appreciate them.  You have to think about what you are listening to, which i feel really separates the album from most others.  When i finally sat down and listened to this album, i was absolutely amazed at the brillance contained in this classic album.  I would highly reccomend this album To anyone who has good taste in music, because if you do not like this album, you obviously have TERRIBLE taste.  Since i purchased this CD a year or two ago, i have listened to it hundreds of times, and each time, i never find myself bored, or not completely involved in the music.  I still get goosebumps during the absolutely amazing Money solo.  GO BUY THIS CD NOW!!!
B000000H66|5.0|Unreal....Completely unreal!!!    This is one incredible release from Chuck and the Death boys. I think this is by far their finest hour. The production is flawless, and the music??.....This is just pure genius!!!    \\"Symbolic\\" has the coolest riffs, and the most melodic guitar solos I've ever heard from Death. It's one of those releases that you can NEVER get tired of listening to. Everytime I listen to this I like it more and more....The melodic guitars are just incredible!!!    This isn't like any other Death release yoy may have heard in previous years. It's without question my favorite Death release, and I've got them all...    One thing that I love about \\"Symbolic\\", is the flow it has. It's not one of those ALL OUT SPEED oriented Death Metal releases that so many other bands try and display. It's got some fast parts, but as a whole, it's steady, straight ahead, in your face METAL. It's got a killer groove, and back-bone to it, and I think that's what makes this so much more enjoyable.     Chuck and Death have really outdone themselves with this release. It's undeniably one of the \\"BEST DEATH METAL RELEASES OF ALL TIME\\". I can't make you buy this, but if there were only one Death CD I could recommend, this would be the one.....    ~MJ~
B00003CXXP|2.0|Forget that the desire to be loved and to feel \\"real\\" is a universal emotion, but Kubrick/Spielberg give no reason why these feelings should have any special meaning when applied to a robot.<br />Forget that \\"The Velveteen Rabbit\\" does a better job -- in just a few pages -- of exploring these themes.<br />The fact is that the first two hours of this film are absolutely magical -- but the \\"aliens ex machina\\" ending is an arbitrary, pointless, tacked-on (non-)resolution that has no dramatic or philosophical connection with what came before.<br />For those interested, here's the letter I sent to Steven Spielberg.<br />I saw AI at its premiere. As an only child raised by incompetent parents - a goofy, wise-cracking, ineffective father, and a self-centered mother who actively disliked me - I found parts of AI extremely disturbing. Had I been alone in the theater, I probably would have broken down and had to have been helped out.<br />But although AI provoked a legitimate emotional reaction, it still has problems. Attempting to get a handle on my feelings about AI, I browsed the Jerome Agel book on 2001. (I was born May 14, 1947, exactly one year after George Lucas, and saw 2001 during its first New York run.)<br />Much was made of 2001's \\"disruption\\" of the conventional narrative flow of film. But 2001 is a conventional narrative film. It has a plot - an extraterrestrial intelligence is interested the development of humans and desirous of promoting their evolution. It influences proto-man's evolution sufficiently to prevent his extinction. Then, when it is able to obtain a specimen (who's proved his worthiness by ascending from hell through his own efforts), it transforms him to a higher life form. There's no need to \\"force\\" an ending to the story, because the end is implied by the concept.<br />AI has no inherent plot. It is a study of basic life questions: What is love? What does it mean to love and be loved? Does human love have any real value, or is it just a self-serving reaction to the way others treat us?<br />There's nothing wrong with a book or movie that asks questions without answering them. Up to the point where David finds the Blue Fairy, AI does an exceptionally fine job of exploring these questions.<br />The film might very well have ended here, albeit on a dark note. Joe's remark about the Blue Fairy being the embodiment of the human failing of wanting unobtainable things was good preparation for such an ending.<br />But AI isn't an intellectual discussion - it's a story, and we like stories to have plausible resolutions. In good drama, this resolution grows out of personality and character.<br />Unfortunately, AI's alien ex machina resolution is arbitrary. It doesn't evolve out of what came before, but (like Teddy stitching himself) is merely a way to patch up the holes. The tedious and unconvincing explanation of the persistence of an individual life-force and its brief attachment to the regenerated body (which seems to be swiped from Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer) not only brings the film to a dead stop, but is an obviously clumsy attempt to force the story in the direction the writer wants it to go, not where it \\"should\\" go (wherever that might be).<br />This might not be bad if there were some ambiguity or even unhappiness to the ending. But David appears to get what he wants (his mother saying she's always loved him), and is happy with it. Do you believe that nothing else is required to fulfill our lives than our mommy telling us she loves us?<br />AI's resolution is neither logically, dramatically, nor emotionally satisfying. It undercuts what preceded it, and looks too much like a Spielbergian \\"happy ending.\\"<br />There's another philosophical point AI neglects to explore. If you've read A Clockwork Orange, you're aware of the scene Stanley Kubrick omitted, because it would have undercut his conscious perversion of the book.<br />Alex's Nietszchian point of view is that he has the right to steal, rape, and murder, because (unlike the sheeplike mass of society) he chooses (wills) to do these things. When robbing the house of a college professor, Alex finds an essay titled \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Said fruit is  something that looks \\"real\\" on the outside, but is internally nothing but mechanism. This cuts right to the heart of the question of whether there really is such a thing as free will, and Alex tears up the paper in a fit of rage.<br />Ditto for David. Is he or isn't he a clockwork orange? The film's tag line - \\"His love is real, but he isn't\\" - is clearly self-contradictory. How can an \\"unreal\\" being have \\"real\\" emotions?<br />Programming a robot to express \\"real\\" love implies that the human mind contains (or embodies  ) a mechanism for love that can be duplicated through some combination of hardware and software. So doesn't that make David's ability to express \\"real\\" love proof that human love is merely the mechanical operation of a neural mechanism, and that humans aren't truly \\"real,\\" but merely \\"clockwork oranges\\"?<br />The belief that the human mind is nothing more than the electro-chemical workings of the brain is a \\"given\\" of science fiction. These workings can be analyzed and the observed patterns transferred to a machine (or vice versa). Truly advanced aliens would have the power to transfer David's mind into a biological entity, thus making him \\"real.\\" Moving the story in that direction might not have been any more satisfying, but it would have made more sense.<br />AI has an obvious relation to The Velveteen Rabbit. When the horse explains to the rabbit that, once you are loved, you become real, the author isn't talking about toys - she's reflecting on the human condition. Don't we all long to have our existence and purpose justified by being told that someone truly needs us?<br />David's problem is one that all human beings share. What is the point of showing it from a robot's point of view, and why should his experience have meaning for a human viewer?<br />Alas, the film doesn't say.<br />PS: My AIBO's name is Mr. Peabody. What did you name yours?ause (unlike the sheeplike mass of society) he chooses (wills) to do these things.

B00005JKYS|5.0|My wife and I went to see this movie the other day.  I'm a history nut, and I cannot say enough about how accurate everything seemed-down to the correct color for the North Vietnamese tracer bullets!  It is also very very graphic-necessarily so.  My wife cried at one point, and this is the first movie that I almost walked out of because of the graphic images.  That's saying a lot since I had no problem with Saving Private Ryan.  Still, I stayed, and I'm glad I did.  It sets a new standard for 21st Century war movies/semi-documentaries.  Go see it, but be prepared for some sad and shocking moments.
B00005YTFG|5.0|I've been waiting impatiently to see this since it came out and I'd have to say for all my expectations I was not disappointed at all.  The cast is great, the music is great, and the story is amazing. It's definitely my favorite
B00003CXI1|3.0|This Movie had great special effects and all, but it did not do the book justice. It cut out way too many scenes. Still, It was a good movie as far as movies go, but nowhere near as good as the book. The worst part about it is that they had to cutout so much of the book. Overall great book, good movie.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I got the soundtrack before I saw the movie and absolutely fell in love with it.  I've put the CD on repeat and listen to it three or four times a day practically.  Usually I'd get sick of a CD, but this has so many different kinds of songs on it that it's impossible to not love it.  If you liked the movie you'll love the soundtrack and if you didn't see the movie you still probably will.  &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Come What May&quot; are the best gushy love songs.  I think it's awesome that Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor actually sang.  They did an amazing job.
B000058983|5.0|I love this album!  It's gorgeous: completely, utterly and absolutely. It's one of the most perfect pieces of music ever committed to tape, vinyl or CD.  Out of all the summer of love albums to have come out, this is the one that strikes the strongest chord of kinship inside me.  I don't know what it's like to have cavorted about in dippy-hippy peace, man style, but I DAMN sure know what it's like to be lonely and to be the man who sees things from the outside.  <BR>     But do not be fooled.  This is not a sad album in any way.  Like how that totally awesome album cover portrays, it is life itself, a swirling menagerie of colors, moods and emotions.  Can anyone doubt this after the way the first song, &quot;Alone again or&quot; begins with that quiet accoustic guitar and then knocks you right out in the middle with that majestic horn solo?<BR>     Throughout the album, our singer is sad, but never downtrodden.  There is a perkiness even in the really delicate songs like &quot;Andmoreagain&quot; and &quot;The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This&quot;-the latter one of the most gorgeous songs about summer ever written.  Even with the two rockers, &quot;A House Is Not A Motel&quot; and &quot;Live And Let Live&quot;, the mood is subdued, the anger is controlled and aimed carefully like a pointed finger.<BR>     Then there are the really bubbly songs: &quot;Between Clark and Hillsdale&quot; makes you want to cha-cha past your own local bunch of sidewalk stores right after you get out of work while there're still a couple hours of summer sun left; and &quot;You Set The Scene&quot; has to be one of the greatest signature songs of the era.  It's one of those majestic march of life songs.  Our singer, even in his darkest moment of loneliness where he is talking/longing to an old photograph of a girlfriend (and who among us has never experienced this?), is able to rally an existential optimism of being part of a greater whole-life.  Well, when you listen to the song,you see what I mean.<BR>     Do the bonus tracks do it for the album?  Yes, and no.  They do not in manner flaw the original integrity Forever Changes, I'm just not sure if they enhance it that much.  &quot;Hummingbird&quot; is excellent, because we see something already great on its way to greatness.  &quot;Wonder People&quot; is intersting, because it's an outtake and you have to wonder how many of those are still floating around.  &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; is a pointless addition; I never liked that song very much in the first place.  &quot;Your mind and me belong together&quot; is noteworthy because it was the last song the Forever Changes lineup recorded before they disintegrated into memory.  The guitar solo is pretty cool, but once again it does nothing to enhance the album.  As for the remixes, I can tell no difference, except for that bizarre rap sequence they tagged onto the alternate version of &quot;You Set The Scene&quot; and the couple extra seconds of strings at the song's end.<BR>     Haunting, eerie, chirpy, and bubbly Forever Changes is never a let-down; only after that final horn section marches off from your ears do you feel the come-down.  <BR>     Rolling Stone said it the best:  Forever Changes is &quot;indescribably essential&quot;.
B000021YQV|2.0|Listin to The velvet underground's Murder Mystery and then listen to chop suey. You can not tell me they didn't rip that intro from the velvets.I Dont care about this CD I just felt like saying that they ripped the velvet underground's murder mystery off.
B00005NW02|5.0|system of a down's toxicity has a beat no one can defeat. if you like metal rock with a bit of personality and meaning then this is for you. the album does not fall short of their first and can be thought of as (hopefully) a promise of things to come.<br />daron's work is excellent and i am quite sure no one is as talented as him at what he does. the other members are equally talented at what they do. i hope to see many, many years of SOAD to come and i am forever in debt to them for opening my eyes to what is most important, the love of music.
B000021XS0|5.0|Prog rock fans that enjoy Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime will love this CD (probably more). I've been a DT fan since the \\"Images and Words\\" CD came out in 1992, and \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" is easily the band's best CD since I&W was released.    This is not just a group of songs, it should be considered a progressive rock opera--in fact an artistic masterpiece in one reviewer's opinion. Blend a continuous melody with a cast of characters and a story of reincarnation, politics, forbidden love, and betrayal, and you have Scenes from a Memory.    Like most DT music, a listener needs to appreciate technical difficulty in his or her music in order to tolerate DT's style. Those who love N'Sync or John Denver probably won't sidle up to the Dream Theater bandwagon. But rest assured that any person who has ever learned an instrument will at least appreciate how tight these guys' chops are. Those who appreciate mid-melody time changes, surprising riffs, and some harder rock to boot will love Scenes from a Memory. But this CD is not just a jumble of notes. The music, though complicated, makes sense and supports the tone of the lyrics. The lyrics weave a fantastic and emotional epic tale. And after several dozen listens, anyone who purchases this CD will appreciate the complexity and artistry of the whole package. If you've never heard these guys before, but you've enjoyed Rush or Queensryche, do yourself a favor and take a listen to one of the most talented group of musicians ever assembled in their genre.
0684853523|4.0|It's clear that King had fun writing this. It took me back to the days of my College English and Journalism classes, and the amusing asides were a nice diversion. King can get a bit windy at times, and the stream-of-consciousness romps through his memories can wear on you a bit, but overall, it's a good read and a great deal of fun for the reader.
B00005N53P|1.0|To all the fakers out there - shake it all off you; the Strokes is like an old white smelly t shirt - nothing new, nothing special, just one of those t-shirts we've all seen too many times, with a little dirt on the sleeves to remind us of the good old days when the not so innocent eyes of rock music first gazed at the stars.<br />Oh yea, it used to be good back then. That's what I've been told. But isn't it  just amazing how you can come up with this kind of stuff thirty years after its time and how people actually seem to think you've created something new and totally brilliant???<br />The Strokes - nothing but a living proof of the fact that there is lack of passion in the music scene nowadays. This is why an ordinary bunch of rock stars ... without talent and great songs - but with poodle hairdos and smelly t-shirts - can make it happen - cause there is no one out there to conquer at the moment!<br />The thing is - a t shirt is just a t shirt. It's a bloody surface. You need to put something into it, add some spice, to make things clever. The concept behind this music is so thin - it is a copy of a copy of nothingness - it is more mainstream than mainstream itself.<br />So stop faking and get rid of this white slimy t shirt! Don't you see?! This music is totally boring. <br />Yeah!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I am a really big fan of the Cohen brothers. They are one of the most original and wickedly funny filmmaking teams to come along in some time. I've seen just about all of their movies, but of all their great films, I think this has to be my absolute favorite. I didn't go see this in the theater, because I had read some negative reviews of it, but when this came on video, my cousin who works in a video store told that it was hilarious.    <br />So one night while his wife was working third-shift, he brought it home and I came over, we ordered a pizza, cracked a few brews, and watched this movie. Let me say that I don't know if I've EVER laughed so hard in my life. It's just a fun thing to watch and listen to.  So many great one-liners and oddball humor, the dialect, the ridiculous situations, the way Clooney sends up his own dapper image, as well as his hopeless attempts to lead the trio.  I just can't get enough of this, fa'real.  They play a group of escaped convicts who are determined to find some buried treasure that Ulysseus CLAIMS he knows where is.  The film is loosely based on Homer's 'The Odyssey', but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy the movie unless you're familiar with the book. I haven't read it since like the 9th grade, so I'm a little dusty on picking up all the references myself, but I still thought this movie was hilarious. I'm gonna have to go back and re-read it someday. The scene right after their encounter with the singing muses at the lake, when Ulysseus and Delmar think Pete has been turned into a toad is absolutely gut-busting.  Then when they come across him in the movie theater... damn, I can't even finish explaining the scene because I'm laughing so much right now just thinking about it.<br />The acting is absolutely superb, particularly John Turturro as Pete who proves once again that he is one of the most underrated and multi-faceted actors working today. The story is comical and always interesting, and the cinematography looks fantasticperfectly re-creating the bleak, dusty, bone-dry Depression Era South of the 1930s. The Cohen brothers are absolute cinematic geniuses and have proven it time and time again over the years. It's just all in good fun. They don't take their art too seriously, and therefore they make TRULY GREAT art.<br />'O Brother Where Art Thou?' is a modern classic, and if you don't get into upon your first viewing, then watch it again and I guarantee you it will grow on you. After my first viewing at my cousin' house I immediately went out and bought this movie, and since then I've watched it probably a good thirteen or fourteen times at least. I mean, I just can't get enough of it. The only recent movie that can even compare to it in terms of originality and entertainment is probably 'Snatch' which incidently I also have watched a ridiculous amount of times. And, on a final note, the bluegrass tunes in this movie are wildly addicitive, even if you don't like that kind of music. I find myself humming 'A Man of Constant Sorrow' to myself all the time.
0380799006|4.0|This book is well written and presented in a manner that provides simple, common sense approaches to the anarchy in your home.  Many of the scenarios described in the \\"sessions\\" could be happening in your very own homes, and instead of pulling your hair out in frustration you could be making an effort to learn alternate means of conflict resolution.  I read this book and saw myself or my mother (mostly my mother, of course! :)) in most of the situations where an action or phrase would only serve to exacerbate conflict.  Especially useful for those parents who are afraid of showing favoritism or trying \\"too hard\\" not to.
6304078102|5.0|Mr. Holland's opus is a brilliant and moving production which is very remiscent of Frank Capra's &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;.<br />The similarities between the two movies are limitless but here are a few.<br />1)  Both of the protaganists give up their life's dream and become trapped in what they perceive as boring and mundane work after having been driven there by a series of circumstances beyond their control.<br />2)  Both Mr. Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) and George Bailey (James Stewart) believe that their lives have been wasted.<br />3)  Both characters eventually come to understand the impact that they have made in the lives of others as a result of a tramautic event which is caused by bureaucratic overseers who are each in their own way driven by money.<br />4)  Both movies appear to be set in small towns that could be &quot;Anywhere, USA&quot;<br />In short, I think that Mr. Holland's Opus is the 1990s version of &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; remade with a modern theme.  The soundtrack of this movie is exceptional and covers music from the 1960s to the 1990s which not only enhances the movie itself but also serves to generate an underlying atmosphere highlighting the milestones of Mr. Holland's life.<br />Without a doubt, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone.<br />The ending of this movie is just as uplifting as Capra's and I am sure it is no coincidence that both movies have a musical finale.
0441172717|5.0|The book, Dune, by Frank Herbert is a futuristic science fiction novel involving loss and gain.  The protagonist of Dune, Paul Atreides is the son and heir of the Duke Leto Atreides.  In the beginning of the novel Paul lives very comfortably on his home planet of Caladan.  He has the very best that his planet, similar to Earth, has to offer.  Everything changes, however, when he and his family move to the desert planet, Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Arrakis is one of the most inhospitable places inhabited by humans.  The temperature is so great, and water so scarce that its inhabitants must wear stillsuits, gear that channels all of the human bodies released water into reservoirs that can be deducted from if necessary.  Even the smallest amount of water is precious to the populace of Dune and its people have learned not to waste anything.  Although Arrakis is extremely harsh to organisms that opt to inhabit it, there is one element that makes it special and preferred above other planets.  It is the only source in the known universe of the essential Spice, a cinnamon-like substance used in foods that prolongs life.  This Spice is the reason that Arrakis is a coveted planet among the houses of power in the universe.<br /> Only a short time after the Atreides arrival on Dune, the Atreides were betrayed by one of their own and a rival house, the Harkonnen, captured Paul, his father, Leto, and his mother Jessica.  Duke Leto Atreides was killed but Paul and Jessica, a member of the ancient Bene Gesserit order, (a group of women who have special strengths and mind reading powers) escape into the desert.  Paul was left stranded with only his mother in the middle of the harshest place in the universe, fleeing from the colossal sand-worms, organisms roughly the size of a space frigate who inhabit the sands of Arrakis and react to and kill anything that they sense moving on the surface of the sand.  In this harsh position, Paul begins to think up a plan for him to regain his title and all that he had lost.  His mission was to rally the Femen, the native nomads of Dune and unite them to fight against their common enemy, the Harkonnen.  Rallying the Femen would prove to be no easy task however, scattered throughout the planet in different tribes, Paul had to gain their highest respect in order to gain anything from this venture.  Although Paul is very smart and skilled in battle, it would prove a daunting task to unite the Fremen, defeat the Harkonnen, and regain his position as Duke of Arrakis.<br /> Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written, in my mind comparing only to The Lord of the Rings in its greatness.  Dune is a truly timeless epic to be treasured for all eternity.  I am currently enrapt in Dune's sequel, Dune Messiah, and am thoroughly enjoying it.  Another aspect of Dune is the variety of excerpts from other made up books and biographies relating to Dune such as this poem,<br />\\" `Do you wrestle with dreams?<br />Do you contend with shadows?<br />Do you move in a kind of sleep?<br />Time has slipped away.<br />Your life is stolen.<br />You tarried with trifles,<br />Victim of your folly.'<br />-Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain,<br /> from `Songs of Muad'Dib' by the Princess Irulan<br />Even this little aside, irrelevant to the story, adds to the feeling, the mood of Dune.<br /> Frank Herbert's Dune is an incredible story with superb writing.  It is a great science fiction novel ranking in my mind up with the Lord of the Rings and other classic sci-fi tomes.  Overall, Dune is a timeless epic that will leave its mark on our society for generations to come.
B00005JKQX|2.0|This is not the most beautiful movie. Sadly, though, it may be the most of the whole year. When I went to see this film I hadn't<BR>know much on John Nash. I still do not! After sitting through (*shudder*) Russel Crowe, who you cannot escape anywhere, for 2 and a half hours, I had to find out the whole thing was a down-spankin'-right evasive flick with tomfoolery! Ron Howard is one of those... directors who loves to play around with real life and switch it' into an innocent, benevolent and tender motion picture. I urge you to take a look into his recent films: The Grinch. (His heart grew from 10 sizes to small to 10 sizes too tall--or something dippy like that.) Cocoon. Why, even Apollo 13 HAD TO HAVE Tom Hanks, and well, we all know the outcome of that. This movie is not about who you think it is about. It is about the little man inside Ron Howard's head telling him who and what to exploit and how. I doubt John Nash--the real man would have come close to saying Russ's speech here. There were so many distortions. John Nash had a child from formerly. Not utterly essential, but did it seem like the man in the here would have? John Nash engaged umpteen affairs and was arrested for incontinence with men. John Nash and his wife were divorced once--only to get back together. (Sound like the recent episode of \\"As the World Turns\\"?) He never made the cockeyed speech he did at the end, instead he pronounced, \\"The money could have been better\\". I'm sure already people have addressed this on here, but so, now I shall be. Okay, this movie was to be a piece of fiction with the fundemential basis of Nash's life. Well, paint the toad houses green, 'cuz it didn't work! This movie proved to be drawen out in many ways--so many times. One sleeper scene after another full of gush. Personally, I think this movie would have been much more interesting, if not appealing if it documented his real life. So people don't want see that they think? Well wake up to life! And what about the innumerable number of other films discommoding? This movie had no subplots. The only probelm seemed to be his schizphrenia. Big, it may be, but as we can see--it wasn't the only thing in his life. I found the characters to be 2-D. Where was Nash's past? Alicia's past? Any other fears, anxieties? Maybe it was about love's strength and depth. Maybe it was about his man's obstacle. Still, couldn't they have kept this with a little more dimensionality? Tricks, other than falsifying the truth were played on us to make us feel responsive to the illness. It was a repeat of ideas and twists long played out in Hollywood. By the time we found out the authenticity of the whole thing, Charles, the most compelling character of all wasn't even real. It took me more time that it should have to believe this man was conjuring up these people in his mind, for the fact I can't believe someone could envision anyone as horrendous as Ed Harris. Russel Crowe is vastly overrated, and he is everywhere, consuming chicken or reciting crippled poetic verses. Jennifer Connelly is as well, for I saw nothing distinct in her acting. I am telling you this movie did have some potential. It made it through at last. It may win the Oscars. In my opinion, though, it would take a bit more advancement. It completed well, we saw Nash's acheievements, but they did not even elaborte his work sufficiently! As for the title, there are many mental irregular people I know, and most of them can do things the universial joe can't--perhaps a lot more, such as we see here. These people can be beautiful and are--so kudos to that. I am done.

Everything changes, however, when he and his family move to the desert planet, Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Arrakis is one of the most inhospitable places inhabited by humans.  The temperature is so great, and water so scarce that its inhabitants must wear stillsuits, gear that channels all of the human bodies released water into reservoirs that can be deducted from if necessary.  Even the smallest amount of water is precious to the populace of Dune and its people have learned not to waste anything.  Although Arrakis is extremely harsh to organisms that opt to inhabit it, there is one element that makes it special and preferred above other planets.  It is the only source in the known universe of the essential Spice, a cinnamon-like substance used in foods that prolongs life.  This Spice is the reason that Arrakis is a coveted planet among the houses of power in the universe.<BR> Only a short time after the Atreides arrival on Dune, the Atreides were betrayed by one of their own and a rival house, the Harkonnen, captured Paul, his father, Leto, and his mother Jessica.  Duke Leto Atreides was killed but Paul and Jessica, a member of the ancient Bene Gesserit order, (a group of women who have special strengths and mind reading powers) escape into the desert.  Paul was left stranded with only his mother in the middle of the harshest place in the universe, fleeing from the colossal sand-worms, organisms roughly the size of a space frigate who inhabit the sands of Arrakis and react to and kill anything that they sense moving on the surface of the sand.  In this harsh position, Paul begins to think up a plan for him to regain his title and all that he had lost.  His mission was to rally the Femen, the native nomads of Dune and unite them to fight against their common enemy, the Harkonnen.  Rallying the Femen would prove to be no easy task however, scattered throughout the planet in different tribes, Paul had to gain their highest respect in order to gain anything from this venture.  Although Paul is very smart and skilled in battle, it would prove a daunting task to unite the Fremen, defeat the Harkonnen, and regain his position as Duke of Arrakis.<BR> Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written, in my mind comparing only to The Lord of the Rings in its greatness.  Dune is a truly timeless epic to be treasured for all eternity.  I am currently enrapt in Dune's sequel, Dune Messiah, and am thoroughly enjoying it.  Another aspect of Dune is the variety of excerpts from other made up books and biographies relating to Dune such as this poem...Frank Herbert's Dune is an incredible story with superb writing.  It is a great science fiction novel ranking in my mind up with the Lord of the Rings and other classic sci-fi tomes.  Overall, Dune is a timeless epic that will leave its mark on our society for generations to come.

6301744160|5.0|\\"Fantastic Voyage\\" is certainly worthy of its name, with imaginativeness, creativity and beauty (From Raquel Welch in particular). It also has a rather simple plot, which I shall outline for you. An eastern bloc scientist, who holds the knowledge to perfecting miniaturization warfare, is defecting to the Americans. However, an attempted assignation leaves him with brain damage. The only way to save the scientist's life is to miniaturize a team of surgeons and send them into the body. But they have only one hour to complete the mission and have to face threats such as the body's natural defenses and sabotage from within. <br />If there are complaints with \\"Fantastic Voyage\\", it is in some plot holes (Smart Alecs, in my opinion, should stay away and look elsewhere). Firstly, although it's extremely obvious who the saboteur is (He tries constantly to get the mission aborted and is always frantic), no one on board really seems to suspect him. The ending was also somewhat empty and unsatisfying (We never learn what happens to the scientist). Some will also love pointing out the plot clichés (The people in the control room always seem to know what the Proteus crew is thinking, even with no radio, and the sub crew always finds a way out of a problem). Many will also find scientific inaccuracies (My dad pointed out how well lit the human body was depicted) Then there is the impossibility of shrinking matter and placing it in other matter. Also, in terms of ideals, this film shows age. People in the 1960's believed that the future would be like it was in here and Kubrick's \\"2001\\". They thought one-day that humans would have established bases in space and would be able to miniaturize. How could they have known that computers and the World Wide Web would be the tools and thoughts of the future? <br />Some reviewers have suggested that \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" should be remade. I think that is a lousy idea. Sure the special effects and set design would be better. But a new version would be colder, darker, more violent and full of foul language. The heart and joy of the original would be gone. Also, notice that despite being the only woman onboard, Raquel Welch never seems to have interest with anyone else on the sub (Most of them are past her age, anyway). While she may not give the best performance, at least she is professional and knows her priorities. Would that stay the same in a remake? <br />So, while not without some problems, I wouldn't mind owning this movie. But I would especially love to see a widescreen edition (DVD preferably) released sometime soon.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|This film is simply the last Connery Bond film, unofficial or not, trademark opening sequence or not, it's still the last Bond film Connery made. For that reason alone I bought it, and for [the price] it was well worth it, considering the ridiculous price of most Bond DVD's. It's an entertaining movie, period.<br />I fail to see any problems with the acting at all, ecspecially compared to the Moore films and campy, but unbelieveably great, 60's Connery films.<br />The DVD is of very average quality with no real extras, but very adequate, ecspecially if you have good software to run it on a PC system or home entertainment system.<br />I thought NSNA was one of the most humorous Bond films and didn't really think of Thunderball too much at all through the entire thing.  Thunderball is in it's own class, and gave me an entirely different feel and experience.<br />For those that are \\"offended\\" by this \\"unofficial\\" film, that's too bad, I really don't put that much emotion into the Bond series, they are all tacky, campy and silly in one way or another while at the same time being highly entertaining and stylish, as well as classics in their own right.<br />I'm simply not going to sit here and yell and scream about all of the geeky drawbacks over a[n inexpensive] DVD, it's really not that bad at all and the cast is great as well as the intrigue and plot twists.<br />Forgive me, I like James Bond movies, I love Connery, and I even liked Lazenby and Moore in his early roles.  As such I enjoyed this film and probably never would've purchased it on DVD if it were priced like the others.
0425180638|2.0|Does Kay Scarpetta not age?  In Postmortem she was in her mid-forties, yet 18 years later in The Last Precinct she is &quot;not yet fifty&quot;.  I don't get it, or how huge errors like this get past an editor. Anyway it bothered me throughout this book (as did the whole plot). I hope this is the last book in the series, either way, its the last for me.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I have read many reviews of this CD and I must say that I disagree with most of them.  When I heard Shakira was making a crossover CD, I was excited, but I never expected it to be as good as her Spanish albums.  English is not her first language, so why would her first attempt at singing in English be as good as her Spanish records, a language in which she has been writing songs since she was 8 years old?  When I heard the CD, however, I was pleasantly surprised.  The songs are catchy and have some substance to them.  Add to that that she actually wrote or co-wrote all of the songs and produced the album as well, and I say she did pretty well. Sure, the Spanish songs in the album are better than the English ones, with a few exceptions, but I trust she will get better with practice.  Either way, the English songs are not bad, they just need a little polish.  I agree in that I am not too happy with the makeover this crossover album has brought with it, but I won't penalize the album because of it.  Shakira is an excellent artist, of a far better caliber than all those teenyboppers so popular now (Christina, Britney, etc.) who make a living out of singing other people's songs and dancing other people's choreography.  I can listen to Laundry Service over and over again, and that, to me, says a lot about the quality of an album.  Congratulations on this English debut to Shakira. Can't wait to see what experience in this new language will bring.  Spanish or English, I will still buy her next record.  I really enjoyed this album.  For people who are new to her music I say, listen to it, enjoy it, and know that this artist only gets better and better.  I also recommend &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot;, &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones&quot; and the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;.  You just can't go wrong with Shakira.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is an incredible, very descriptive and breath taking story of a Silician Mafia operating in the region of New York City. This is a book you must read. You will take it to bed to read because it is simply that good of a book. It is one of the only books that I read in my life which i couldn't put away. The story is fast paced but with a lot of detail that serves the book very well. Something is always happening in the book and you just can't get enough of it. Mario Puzo did a great job. The book deserves more than five stars.
0792157850|1.0|As terrific as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was, that's how bad this ... is. Poor plotting, a mediocre score, and Kate Capshaw \\"screechs\\" her way thru the film. She is truly awful in this movie. Forget this ..., and watch Raiders I or III.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Thuddingly literal adaptation which races so hard to get every famous incident into the movie that it has no time for characterization, magic, humor, any of the qualities that made the books charming.  The kids are relatively colorless and adults who seem perfectly cast (from Alan Rickman to John Cleese) are given next to nothing to do.  A more joyless example of how British wit can be turned into expensive American product can hardly be imagined-- this is the kind of movie that, given a choice between showing us a magnificently designed set for Gringott's Bank or a pile of phony gold, encourages us to ooh and ahh over the pile.  Well, don't add to this movie's pile.
B000002H8F|5.0|Sorry  for those people who think that this album is [stinks] or boring. But it's not bad for me at all, it's so great. It's depends on <BR>what u love in pixies 's music. If  u like rockin' , or angry punk rock sound....then \\"Come on pilgrim\\" , \\" Surfer rosa\\" are for you. But if you<BR>love Frank black's pop and melodic sound this album is the answer.<BR>  \\"Allison\\"  is the nice catchy punk rock  while \\" dig for fire \\"      ,  \\"The happening\\" , and \\"  Blown away\\"  are so great !!! My favorite song on this album is \\" havalina\\" .........so  so   SWEET !!
B00003CX5P|1.0|If not for the two above this movie would be a total waste of time and Portman is so so.  Our good friend Lucas decide to flush the whole thing.  The actor are so wooden i'd rather watch a kids play with the action figures. Hell, Frank Oz as yoda gives a better performance than all save darth maul.  Speaking of which he is the only character that i would care to learn more about.  Obi-wans okay, but to jaded to be so young.<br />fortunately the final lightsaber battle rocks. however, it is short and lacks the whole feel of luke Vs. vader.<br />bum it from a friend if possible.<br />i'll go see the others just to see what they are like.<br />don't waste money to rent or buy.
0307162095|5.0|My son has enjoyed this book for months. I agree that it is a bit flimsy in the binding, but this shows that it is read alot. It allows young ones to touch, smell, and see objects, and also teaches other concepts (peek-a-boo and bye-bye). Has a British touch to it (\\"Mummy\\"), which we like, as well.
B00005UQ9F|2.0|After witnessing the utterly disappointing, disjointed mess that is &quot;Session 9,&quot; I think it's safe to say that Brad Anderson's psychological thriller is one of the genre's biggest letdowns. On the outside, the movie has the look and feel of a wonderfully different venue into horror, with its story of possession amongst an atmosphere of growing dread. But once the end starts rearing its ugly, ludicrous head, things start going batty, leading us to wonder what asylum Anderson himself was released from before penning the script. <br />The film starts out well enough, introducing us to Gordon Fleming (Peter Mullan), who runs an asbestos removal company comprised of a small group of men. His top man, Phil (David Caruso), tags along for the ride during a preliminary visit to Hazmat Elimination's latest project: the Danvers State Mental Hospital, abandoned for over 15 years, chosen to undergo renovation for the municipal offices of the nearby town. <br />Anderson scores his big points (his only points, in fact) from his setting. Filmed on location at the actual site of Danvers, &quot;Session 9&quot; benefits from having a structure that evokes a sense of doom from the very first frame. The film captures various shots of the complex, its aerial overviews reminiscent of the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's &quot;The Shining,&quot; it's ground shots recalling the looming, oppressive Hill House in Robert Wise's &quot;The Haunting.&quot; <br />Even the insides of the complex are seen in the film, as the majority of the story takes place within spaces that range from expansive to claustrophobia-inducing. Sunshine floods into certain areas of the hospital, filling the now-decrepit rooms with brilliant white light, while the lower, far-more deteriorating levels are cast into darkness, pierced by the flashlights of the men about to enter. I must say, I've never seen anything quite like the setting of Anderson's film, and in spite of the various shortcomings, the visualacuity of the film is a remarkable achievement in itself. <br />It's only a shame that the plot is more of a mess than Danvers itself. After Gordon agrees to get the job done in one week, the five-man crew find themselves cast into another world, and soon, what the movie would have us believe is another dimension. After some preliminary spooks resulting from offscreen sounds, one of the workers turns up missing. Later, fingers start pointing between Phil and Gordon, who is apparently becoming unstable as a result of- well, what? Is it his own personal demons? Or those conjured up by the tape recorded therapy sessions that another crew member listens to incessantly in one of the hospital's decrepit archival rooms? <br />Gradually, the film starts to lose its appeal, evolving from what appeared to be engrossing into just plain off-putting. Whatever tension was generated in the beginning acts founders as we start to ponder the psychological logistics, who is responsible for what, etc. By the time the &quot;surprise&quot; ending rolls around, revealing everything that we pretty much knew five minutes ahead of time, audience members may be more inclined to roll their eyes in disgust at Anderson's surrender to violence and gore, senseless tactics he was able to stray from for much of the film's duration. <br />The feeling I got from &quot;Session 9&quot; was a goal of originality that just wasn't met. There's an aura of unfamiliarity to the work, but the lack of achievement in the story and character departments is not easily overlooked (at times, the peeling paint and deteriorated ceiling panels obtain more interest). Anderson is too confident that style can pass as substance, providing us with a film that is visually enticing, but may drive some people clinically insane just thinking about its hackneyed premise.
0618164413|4.0|I purchased this book before the birth of my first son, and began reading it to him at a very early age. It quickly became one of his favorites, and at two-and-a-half, it's going to be with us for awhile. Like most of those purchasing this book, it was probably bought for the adult more than for the child, but it certainly is enjoyable when the child develops an appreciation and love for a character that the parent affectionately remembers. <br />The book includes several stories of Curious George, a monkey who is befriended (?) by a man wearing a yellow hat and suit. Being from Kentucky, I was stunned that so many reviewers were shocked, surprised, or \\"put off\\" by the use of tobacco products by so many characters in the book, including George. I personally didn't like George's illustrated expression when he was shown the needle immediately prior to receiving an injection, and I usually try to awkwardly skip this page in that particular story. It is also surprising that so few were saddened by George's capture from his freedom in Africa, placed in a bag by the man with the yellow hat, and taken to live in captivity in a zoo. Let me say, however, that these stories are, and rightfully should be, endearing to preschoolers, while perhaps innapropriate for older children, for those extremely inclined to political correctness.<br />The tales of George's curiosity (and misbehavior) landing him into trouble, but with a good ending always, are treasured by children and parents alike. We need more books such as this.<br />Buy this for yourself and child or grandchild, and share something special with them.
B00004YWEB|5.0|There a lot of people that think this cd as well as Fly On The Wall are AC/DC's weakest work. Well, I beg to differ. This is a really good cd conisdering the time frame that it came out. I prefer to listen to this or Fly On The Wall over listening to The Razors Edge. From the opening track of Heatseeker to the closing of This Means War, it's nothing but good solid rock. If you don't have this cd, give it a try, it's worth the money.
0399226907|5.0|This is the story of a caterpillar who emerges from his egg with an amazing apetite.  During his first week, he eats a hole (the board pages have holes in them) through various fruits and other foods familiar to toddlers.  My two year old son enjoys the pictures and naming the items consumed by the very hungry caterpillar.  Without revealing the ending, the book is also educational in its depiction of the morphing of the caterpillar into its later stages of development.<br />The board book version is durable, and the pictures are appealing to children.  This book is a great one to be included in your collection for children of this age, and perhaps older.  I recommend it.
B00004Z459|4.0|I'm impressed.  I was in search of something heavy to listen to and I had heard a few Linkin Park songs on the radio.  So I figured I'd give them a shot.  What I expected was a typical rap-rock album (and I'm not a huge fan of that new genre) but what I got was really very impressive.<br />Linkin Park deviates from mainstream metal in that they're able to combine excellent instrumentation, melody, sampling and common elements of metal to form a fairly unique sound.  They're not afraid to be aggressive yet they maintain a melodic sound and pack an emotional punch at times.  Unlike many bands out there, Linkin Park's got a solid vocalist as well.<br />All-in-all, check this one out.  Its definitely worth a listen.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Ok, the Band and the CD isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it sure is a ton of fun to listen to...  Just forget about what people say about the album, and just listen to some of the songs.  If you can get through the song Hot Dog, you can stomach anything in this world.  Boiler is the best song on the CD.  The hidden track with Ben Stiller is hilarious!<br />/thybart/
0062502182|1.0|If you are looking for material that will make you think prepare to be deeply disappointed. This highly advertised spiritual book proved as deep as half an inch, or the sum thickness of its 170 silly pages. Each brings new lows of patronising teachings about as profound as fortune cookies wisdom. If that's what you're after you'll love it. And retreat further into mental hibernation.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Ok.  Every review I've read of John Mayer's CD, Room for Squares, likens his voice to Dave Matthews, Sting, Stevie Ray Vaughn, among others.  While I don't entirely disagree with any of these comparisons, there is a lead singer of an 80's pop band who I believe more closely compares to John Mayer's voice styling.  Do any of you folks who came of age in the mid-80's remember the British band, Go West?  If you can find a sound clip of the band (or if you still happen to have the tape), listen and compare.  Especially the songs, Neon and Love Song For No One.  Even some of the music is similar.  Catchy, pop-type tunes.  Granted, John Mayer's music has much richer acoustic sounds (less of that techno-beat that 80's music is known for) and is seemingly more developed as a musician.  I truly enjoy John Mayer's CD but it causes dj vu back to my high school days.  Not necessarily a bad thing.

0451191153|4.0|This book is the \\"Louie ,Louie\\" of literature. There are flaws and mistakes but the overall work is compelling. I have read this book 6 times and each time I see more flaws but something always brings me back.  The Flaws: first Dominique Francon's motivations are unrealistic and stupid... Which brings me to the second flaw:Ayn Rands view of ...[intercourse]. The whole rape thing is present in both her Big(and I do mean Big) books . Ayn Rand has some ....interesting ideas about... [intercourse]. Lastly Ayn Rands writing style is peculiar. Her metaphors are odd . People dont talk like this and writers dont write like this. Not in the English language. That said this book is hypnotic. Why because ofthe ideas it presents . This book is like A comic book in that you have to suspend dibelief or ignore certain things to read and get to the main pointS :\\"Collectivism is bad. Individualism is good.\\" \\"Think and verify for yourself\\" \\"Dont compromise your principles for the crowd\\". Fact is, nobody is saying this stuff in fiction so if you are of libertarian bent ,if you are the weird girl in high school who writes poetry and smokes clove cigarettes and have no boyfriends , this book says its okay . At the time it was written it was totally against the trend of the times and gets credit for existing at all. Honestly You should read this book. \\"Whoah NO ,Me Gotta Go\\"

0783225857|5.0|What more can be said about this classic? A great novel turned into an even greater film! How often does that happen? Gregory Peck's usual wooden acting style is perfect here as Atticus. The three children are wonderfully natural, as are the other actors, but the real stars are the novel itself, Horton Foote's screenplay, Robert Mulligan's direction, and Elmer Bernstein's haunting score.    Has there ever been a more effective scene than when at the end of the trial the Black minister turns to Scout and says \\"Miss Jean Louise, stand up, your father is passing\\"? Or a better ending? Or a better object lesson about race and class? I don't think so. Citizen Kane may be a better movie, from a technical sense, but for me, I have never been more affected by a film emotionally than by To Kill a Mockingbird. After 40 years the film has lost none of its power.     And then of course there are the additional little nuggets of gold such as that the film includes the debut of one of our greatest actors, Robert Duvall as Boo and that Dill is based on a young Truman Capote.  Then (without the children) go watch the film Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman's mesmerizing performance as Capote with the help of Harper Lee and see what Dill grew up to be!
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith is one of my all time favorite Rock bands along with KISS. This album is what started it all. My favorite song on the album was \\"Dream On\\". That song is what Aerosmith is best known for. This is how they became one of the biggest American rock bands. Great hits also like \\"Write Me A Letter\\", \\"Mama Kin\\", \\"Movin' Out\\" are awsome. Get the album to know how it started.
B000050XEI|4.0|Yes, it IS wonderful. It's the next step in Enya's evolution, which continues to point towards the heavens. And I never get tired of listening to ALL of her music. And I hesitate to say anything negative since the CD is so brilliant, but I must. This is one of the shortest albums/CDs I can remember. It's not just &quot;a little on the short side&quot; as a previous reviewer suggested, IT'S A LOT SHORT. It would be short by vinyl standards. It seems that the high cost of CDs today, along with their longer playing times, might give an artist cause to bring forth a work that was a bit longer than 34 minutes and 20 seconds. Yes, I suppose that means I'll hear the songs it yields more often, since there aren't so many of them, but next time I'd like a little more meat. Very pretty, though.....what there is of it.
B000001FQQ|5.0|This last KISS album of the 80s and with Eric Carr was a major success. Great songs from Gene Simmons like \\"Cadillac Dreams\\", \\"Boomerang\\". Eric Carr's first lead vocals song which kicks... called \\"Little Ceasar\\". Paul came out with another bang and terrific ballad called \\"FOREVER\\" that is one of my alltime favroite KISS songs. other great songs like \\"SILVER SPOON\\", \\"Rise to It\\", and \\"Hide Your Heart.\\" This is a KISS album that is a must buy.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|If you thought TIME OUT OF MIND was Bob's best since BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, you shouldn't be disappointed with this one. Its just as energetic but more diverse. The lyrics are a s complex & playful as anything off of BLONDE ON BLONDE. And on BYE & BYE & MOONLIGHT, he even sails into Hoagy Carmichael territory.<br /><br />Like alot people, this came into my possession shortly before September 11th and being a New Yorker, I didn't listen to it for a month. Once I did, I was pleasantly surprized.<br /><br />Personally, I've always liked Dylan's grizzled singing and alot of quote, \\"legit singers\\" could learn a thing or two in phrasing by checking out the likes of LONESOME DAY BLUES or CRY AWHILE. It's enough to make Sinata do a double take.<br /><br />Lyrically speaking, Dylan's in fine form, drawing even more on Delta Blues. Lines like, \\" called room service & said send up a room\\" won't make you wince if you ever spent anytime on the road Then you get a song like, SUGAR BABY with a line like, \\"every moment of existance seems like some kind of dirty trick\\".<br /><br />Needless to say, I don't think there's a bad song on here and the more I listen, the more I discover. Which is how it should be.<br /><br />HIGH WATER blew me away and SUGAR BABY haunts me in my sleep. TWEEDLE DEE & TWEEDLE DUM continues to entertain & confound. PO'BOY still moves me & I love the sly reverie of MOONLIGHT.<br /><br />Though he's playing the part of a song & dance man her, there's more than enough to live up to the standard set by TIME OUT OF MIND. Just sit back, let him tip his hat, and don't read too much into the moustache.
B00003CWL6|5.0|A fun, and thought provoking, bit of viewing for sociology students interested in studying processes of deviance and their affect on both the deviant and his social structure.  I've used the film as an extra opportunity for my students to improve their overall grade.
B00005B36H|5.0|basically if you are like me and love your music [any type] - buy this album. thats all i can really say. its a truely amazing arual experience. the drumming is the best i think i've ever heard and Keenan's vocals are just so spot on. AENIMA is a classic in its own right, but this album is something else. an album that really makes your mind flow.<br />as many are saying, LATERALUS is one of the best recordings of all time.<br />i really hope you get this album. for your sake.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I've liked Pink since I first saw her in that terrific video with the motorcycle, and I think she's quite a talent.<br />Her performances always capture my attention, she has a growing gift for songwriting, a unique singing style, and I just love that little wobble in her voice.<br />This CD has its ups and downs...I can live without the first 3 tracks, but it also has some exceptional ones.<br />With &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; and &quot;Respect&quot;, Pink is at her brassy-sassy best, and &quot;Misery&quot;, a duet with Steven Tyler, is a down home bluesy number that really works well.<br />The gems on this CD to my ears are &quot;Family Portrait&quot; (writen by Pink and Scott Storch), which is a really moving piece that I don't think could be sung better by anybody, I like &quot;Eventually&quot; (written by Pink and Linda Perry) more with each hearing (nice lyrics), and &quot;Gone to California&quot; (Pink and Perry again) is great. Her phrasing on this song is superb, and there's the added bonus of a jazzy A-1 sax solo by Jimmy Z, and David Siegel on organ adds a lot to it too.<br />These three songs are some of the slower ones on this CD, and show a lot of artistry. Out of the current crop of young singers, I wouldn't be surprised if Pink is the one we'll be listening to 10 years from now.
B000002B1M|4.0|Nas, one of the top 10 greatest emcees of all time with no question...<br />\\"It Was Written\\", slightly a step below the all time classic \\"Illmatic\\" was delivered from Nas with close to perfection intentions. \\"It Was Written\\" is more of a grown up Nasty Nas with more of a thug persona. More dangerous lyrics with more dramatic vocals. Nas slightly escapes reality with this album, that is the only downfall compared to \\"Illmatic.\\"...On \\"It Was Written\\" there is still that street mentality Nas but not like the Nasty Nas.<br />Tracks that shine \\"The Message\\" \\"Street Dreams\\" \\"I Gave You Power\\" \\"Take It In Blood\\" (samples Ultramagnetic Mcs) \\"Black Girl Lost\\" are some of the more colorful cuts. <br />Tracks that lower the status of the album include \\"Watch Dem Niggas\\" \\"Live Nigga Rap\\" and \\"Nas Is Coming\\" these tracks are not bad, but do not help the album when being compared  \\"Illmatic\\"<br />Overall \\"It Was Written\\" is an album that is something that 95% if the hip-hop material out there can't compare to. If you are reading this, then you probably already own this close to classic, but if you don't then you are...just getting into hip-hop. If that is the case show some love and cop this LP.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Man can not tell the truth.  The truth exists only for an instant, after that it is only a memory, a memory filtered through human perception.  Does this make man evil?  No, it only makes him human...<BR>   \\"Rashomon\\" deals with such themes.  Akira Kurasawa's thought-provoking, meditative, and inovative film asks philosophical questions about the nature of truth, by showing one act of fatal violence as seen through the eyes of four different people.  The results are varied, and obscure the truth.  But this is far more complex than one would imagine, for the characters do not, as it is often said, tell the story to make themselves seem the more innocent.  In fact, 3/4 claim to have commited the murder themselves.  This results in a profound, but delightful psychological and philosophical puzzle of a film.<BR>   The visual aesthetics of Kurasawa's film are beautiful, and most innovative considering the very low budget.  As a whole the film has a soft, meditative, and very Japanese feel.  Scenes of the sun playing through the trees, dappling the ground in dancing shadows, come to mind as being most effective.  But what is most impressive, is that the pacing can be so lively, and entertaining, despite the fact that the majority of the film is made up of variations of the same scene.  <BR>   Kurasawa's pallete of truth and humanity introduced western culture to Japanese cinema, and is still a fine introduction to the film of that culture.  All in all, \\"Rashomon\\" is most interesting, and satisfying fare.  World cinema at its finest!

You will never ever forget it and will want to watch it all over again...and again.<br />It starts out as a simple crime cop/robber movie. But quickly morphs into a modern day urban legends movie that simply rocks.

B00000K19E|5.0|This movie was so dang good. I JUST CANT STAND IT!<br />I can watch this movie all day every day.<br />The special effects are great, the plot is strong, the acting is enough to keep you interested, and the movie as a whole was just superb. Sure it takes a lot from the Hong Kong movies, but its SUPPOSED to.  Its a great mix of Hong Kong goodness and American fun and sci-fi fun.  Watch it and judge for yourself.
0446525537|5.0|Could not put this book down, even though I could hardly read the words through my tears.
B00005YT8U|4.0|For me, this is a great CD! I have listened to it several times and only skip one or two songs. Considering that there are very few discs that I listen to start to finish, this is a hit in my book. Should every Chieftains fan rush out and buy it? NO! If you didn't like \\"Long Black Veil\\", you won't like this. For anyone who just loved LBV, this will be another hit. For newcomers, I (personally) think that this is a good way to learn about the Chieftains. By reading the cover notes you can decide which discs appeal to you and which you'd rather skip and get a little bit of each in the process.<BR> <br />I found the collaboration with the Rolling Stones on \\"The Rocky Road to Dublin\\" to be brilliant! \\"Cotton-Eyed Joe\\" with Ricky Skaggs was just a ton of fun. The very first track on the disc, \\"March of the King of Laois\\", made me want to pack my bags and head to Dublin! And \\"Mo Ghile Mear\\" with Sting has always been a favorite.<br />For those who would just as soon the Chieftains stick with their roots, this is not the disc for you...you will probably be put off by Ziggy Marley as well as the Linda Ronstadt/Los Lobos collaborations. There will however, be a few tracks that will appeal. <br />I love the variety - the styles, performers and venues...
B00005ABX0|5.0|I'm so tired of hearing what a big dissapointment Smiley Smile is supposed to be.  Perhaps many Beach Boy fans are just waaaaaay too conservatve for their own good.  If you like far out, experimental music  (Sun Ra, Velvet Underground)  you're absolutely going to love this album!  People often complain about the minimal production on this album, especially in light of Pet Sounds and the famous SMiLE sessions, whch feature very elaborate production.  My response is - So what!?  Production is not the only reason to listen to an album.  As long as their are good songs with creative arrangements, who cares how the production compares to Pet Sounds?  To be honest, I find the understated beauty of this album to be extremely refreshing.  The sparse arrangements anticipated the \\"back to basics\\" movement that the Beatles and others would adopt soon after.  Despite the hype of SMiLE, some of the songs on Smiley Smile are actually better (if not as grand) than their SMiLE counterparts.  Please don't make the mistake of listening to some of the more conservative reviews about this album.  Buy Smiley Smile and partake your drug of choice.  This is simply an awesome listening experience!Wild Honey continues with the low key production.  Only this time the boys are embracing R'n'B music instead of artsy experimentalism.  Wild Honey is simply unpretensious good time rock'n'roll music!  While not as sriking as Smiley Smile, Wild Honey stands up to any other Beach Boys abum.  Simply great, uncomplicated fun!  Buy these two albums and embrace one of the most creatice bands of all time.  A must!!!

B00003CXPJ|5.0|Let me say this first, this movie is one of the dumbest movies to come out in awhile and if you are a homophob this movie just might touch you in the wrong way.....so just turn away now.<br />With that out of the way...I must say Zoolander is one of the better comdies I've seen in awhile.  Ben Stiller is at his best as Zoolander.<br />As for the story it's fairly simple:<br />Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), VH1's three-time male model of the year. His face falls when hippie-chic Hansel (Owen Wilson) scooters in to steal this year's award.<br />The evil fashion guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell) seizes the opportunity to turn Derek into a killing machine. It's a well-designed conspiracy and only with the help of Hansel and a few well-chosen accessories like Matilda (Christine Taylor) can Derek make the world safe for male models everywhere.<br />Simple right.  What insused is a funny and fun trip on the modeling industry.<br />Even if dumb and stuipd comdies are your thing...you owe it to yourself to at LEST rent this great DVD because the feautures are one for the books:<br />Features:<br />Interactive Menus<br />Scene Selection<br />Commentary by Ben Stiller and Writers Drake Sather & John Hamburg<br />5 Deleted Scenes with Commentary by Ben Stiller<br />5 Extended Scenes with Commentary by Ben Stiller<br />Outtakes<br />2 Original Skits from the VH1/ Vogue Fashion Awards, 1996/97<br />Music Video... \\"Start The Commotion\\" - By the Wiseguys<br />Promotional Spots<br />Photo Galleries<br />Alternate End Title Sequence<br />One of the best things about this DVD is the introduction by Zoolander on what all the buttons do like \\"This is the Play button...this button is to start the movie, I know what your thinking it's a movie not a play so why not call it Movie Button.\\"......good and funny stuff to say the lest.
B000002UXZ|5.0|This is a great departure from the mainstream Hendrix that we are all familiar with.  There are no Top 10 Hits on this album - a good thing.  With the different line up, Jimi seems to let loose with more blues/funk than heavy/acid rock.  Overall, he seems relaxed which brings out an incredible amount of creativity in his playing.  Not to mention, the other members of the band are smooth as silk.  I'm probably the only one who listens to this CD for the rhythm section!  This album is a great representation of live Hendrix in an intimate setting.  Every music fan will be very pleased to listen to Jimi and his band mates jamming without having to endure Purple Haze for the 8 millionth time.  Speaking as a musician having played guitar, bass and drums, there is so much this album offers beyond screaming guitars.
6305137293|3.0|It was pretty clever to pick up exactly where Halloween left off.  Michael continues his spree in a hospital albeit in a more Friday the 13th sort of way.  In Halloween, the murders are so stretched and dripping with suspense that there are only three onscreen murders!  I guess he's more efficient now because he doesn't waste time with all that creepiness and taut anticipation.  That being said the last thirty minutes or so are right on par with the original.  Try not to hold your breath as The Shape walks slowly toward the open elevator door.  I dare you!<br />Like all sequels it is often compared unfavorably to the original.  That's okay.  If you're a slasher fan, what would you rather watch Halloween II or Sleepaway Camp 2.   See.  It doesn't compare with Halloween, few do.  But it is so much better than any other horror sequel (and most originals) that it stands on its own in that way.  Check out Visiting Hours for a hospital slasher made at roughly the same time.  Do they compare?  No, they do not!<br />The Goodtimes DVD has few extras.  For instance, in the TV version there are several differences in certain scenes.  The girl killed at the beginning her throat slashed in this version, but in the TV version Michael jumps out at her and engulf the screen in black.  Also, the deputy's death in the hospital is different.   In one version Michael stabs him with a knife and lifts him off the ground, in the other Michael turns him over and slashes his throat.  In addition, there are several scenes missing like Jimmy returning with the Coke that he promised Laurie and Jimmy being reunited with Laurie at the end of the film.  I don't know much about the Universal disc so I won't comment.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I can't begin to tell you how good the movie is! I've read the books five times each and I was sceptical of the movie. But once I got into that theater I felt like I entered Harry's world.The casting was superb. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson make the trio come alive! The graphics and setting designs were magnificant. I felt like I was watching the book. It was fast paced even if it was two hours and 40 minutes. I've seen it two times and I'm dieing for the DVD. If you think the book is always better than the movie, this film will make you question your accucation.
0800130189|5.0|Some people claim that this movie is specifically about angst and the the loneliness one feels when you reach middle age. I DISAGREE however. This movie is actually based on several pyschological factors that involve &quot;becoming&quot;. Maybe another psychology major might read this and think. Yeah. It's a great movie. check it out.
0451197968|5.0|The running man is the best of Stephen Kings Bachman books in my opinion. It reveals a gloomy and depressive future scenario where poor people take part in bizarre TV-shows to earn a few bucks. <br />The main character decides to enter the worst of them all - the Running Man contest...<br />Now...<BR>The movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger is an abysmal attempt to make a movie out of this book. The overall tone of the book is completely lost and the Hollywood way of rewriting everything to fit the &quot;Lowest common denominator&quot; makes me outright sad.
B000002U82|5.0|How often does a relatively frugal and unassuming beginning, goes on to achieve the gargantuan juggernaut of Dark Side of the Moon?? It stayed on the charts for fourteen long years and showed no signs of slowing down until Billboard themselves changed the format ostensibly to end it's monopoly. Every 5th household in the UK reportedly has a copy of the record which ranks just below Thriller, Saturday Night Fever, and Rumours, as the highest selling album of all time.     Just an album that predominantly revolves around the theme of the approaching middle age crisis, peppered with the likely causes of insanity!!    Moving through the haze of mysticism and legend that surrounds the record, if one tries to discover the real reason for the apparent popularity it enjoys, one is confronted with the eternal theme of life itself. Throughout the album there is an underlying current of hopelesness and the eventual submission to fate. The life weariness of Waters, is the echo of the listener himself or herlself, as he/she wades through the quagmire of dark segues, bridges, choirs & overtures.    Infact more musicians/bands of the 70's toyed with the idea of life weariness as experienced at a rather early stage of life; than has ever been heard before or after, in planet rock & roll. The immediate names that come to mind are of course Steely Dan (Gaucho), Neil Young (Harvest) and GratefulDead. Waters & Co carried on the same vein but in possibly a more expansive sense than any of the aforementioned musicians have done.     Then there is the music. This record marks the zenith of avant garde musical achivement of the noir music, that the band started dabbling with since Atom Heart Mother (& a battery of sound engineers from Ron Geesin to Alan Parsons). With almost primitive recording equpiments compared to today's standard, the band managed to achieve a level of productional finesse of the sound, that has seldom been matched except to an extent by Steely Dan.     The record essentially continues from where they'd left off on \\"Echoes\\" from Meddle - their last studio album, but now they'd added word to the feelings, and have narrowed down the focus of their music to have a devastatingly sharper effect.     From the fearful \\"Time,\\" and the apparent contradiction of \\"Us & Them,\\" to the chilling \\"Brain Damage,\\" this record has no dearth of genius, a feat only matched in part by the band's another monumental concept \\"The Wall.\\"    Finally, this record is often coined as a hippie record; I do choose to differ. I have never done grass, pot, acid or any of the hallucinogenic stuff ever for the twenty five years of my life yet, but I do enjoy the record with all it's subliminal messages, and the crispness and the indulgence in multilayered music as much as anybody; only proves the adage that \\"Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder!!\\" Do i need to say more??
0192547038|4.0|Jane Austen wrote a whole lot of good novels, but Mansfield Park is arguably the greatest. It is darker in tone than the rest of her works. It has a somewhat dark humor to it. The protagonist is put through the emotional wringer (as her protagonists often do, but more so here). There is a depth here that is lacking in works like Emma or Sense and Sensibility. This makes the ending that much more gratifying.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie was audio/visually stunning. Unfortunately I didn't follow my instincts and turn it off after 30 minutes... the film should have been named \\"Abuse of A.I. Children and the Failure of Humanity.\\" I'd compare it to someone who hates porn, and is suddenly faced with a well made porn film, and then throw in children, and a couple close relatives... very disturbing. I highly recommend avoiding the film!
B00003CXCQ|1.0|I'm sorry, but Snow White (along with the Wizard of Oz) has always creeped me out. All the bells and whistles of this admittedly amazing DVD version only add to my creep-out factor. My daughter and her little friends enjoy this movie. Alas, I never will.
0679746048|5.0|Sanity is something most people cling to like a security blanket. They think the &quot;insane&quot; people of the world don't cling to it also, but in the memoir of Susanna Kaysen, you see that she does.<br />All she wanted was to be a normal girl, but when normality abandoned her, she had to check herself into McLean hospital to figure out how to regain it. After spending a year and a half in the hospital, she left with no great advice to give on how to live her life or with a realization of what the meaning of life is. This doesn't mean that she learned nothing. Far from that. She learned more than almost anyone else did.<br />She learned how to survive. Not how to live, but how to survive. No one can be taught in a hospital about how to live, because the whole essence of the hospital prevents the person from living their life.<br />When the money ran out, she was kicked out of the hospital. This, sadly, is how the system works. Of course, she'd only expected to be in there for a couple of weeks. Weeks had turned into months and months into years, and by the time she was released, she thought she was a forever patient.<br />She made friends with the other members of the ward, because all of them had been doomed to longer than expected stays. They were a tight group. A group of people who cared for one another, took care of one another, but also aggrivated each other in so many ways.<br />I wanted to read this book for two reasons:<br />1.) I loved the movie it was based on. It's a bit different. Some of the scenes are the same, and if you've already seen the movie, you'll be picturing the characters doing certain things as you read about them in the book.<br />2.) Susanna was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is my diagnosis. I wanted to see how she (at the same age) handled the diagnosis. I see many similarities in the diagnosis, as well as differences. I also saw many differences/similarities in our psych hospital experiences.<br />I love this book, and I think it is very well-written. I am glad that Susanna decided to share her story with everyone. Maybe a book like this will better help more people to understand mental illness.
B00005NEUF|3.0|Now, this is in no way to say that i do not like The Strokes.  I do however find it very interesting that they are being held as this new wave of great rock.  Though in this new climate of Nu-Metal and Rap-Rock acts, a band that emulates the Velvets is a breath of fresh air, and it is.  However it is hardly the second coming.<br />The one thing that gets me about The Strokes is how almost disposable their music is.  It doesnt necessarilly leave you with a lasting impression, and once you change CDs your mind doesnt linger with what was just played.  The best song New York City Cops, was sadly left off the US version.  its a nice solid effort.  Hopefully their next venture will be one that is more meaningful and a bit more themselves than Lou, Cale and Nico.
0393312836|5.0|After reading all of the other reviews, I'll probably sound redundant if I were to write my own.  So with that said, all I have to say is that, this is a must read for everyone!!!  This has to be the greatest book I've ever read.  I have just recently finished this book for the second time. That in itself should tell you how good this book is.  On a side note, the movie is also excellent as well.
B000002JEV|5.0|When this was first released, I avoided it, presuming it was just filler material similar to some of the Hendrix and Beatles stuff now being released.<br />When I finally heard a friend's copy I wished somebody had slapped me for my initial presumptions!  Not to put too fine a point on it, this is probably the best document of this band as a live act.  The \\"Song Remains the Same\\" soundtrack is interesting, but ultimately overbloated and disappointing.  And the band's later live acts were marred by chemical use and fatigue.<br />This is a document of four guys who are just oozing talent from every pore.  I honestly enjoy it more than the studio recordings, overdubs be damned!  But that is also probably because I've heard the studio recordings hundreds of times and have only listened to this release a couple dozen times.<br />I particularly enjoy Page's tone with \\"just\\" a Telecaster and a Danelectro.  I tend to prefer it to his better known Les Paul days.  And hearing Jones play live is always a treat.<br />Just get it.  <g>
0380817683|5.0|I have to agree...This is a fabulous novel. Marian Keyes has written a brilliant story about a young woman trying to get through her turbulent 20s.  Rachel's family is nosy, realistic and funny, and while this is no Girl, Interrupted, her lifestyle does merit concern.  This is a touching story that is a startling page turner at times. If you enjoy Brit-Lit but are looking for a little more depth, then this is the book for you.
B000001FTD|5.0|Not as macho as Metallica, Anthrax dared to add humor to their music, while still being heavy.  They were also faster (in general) than the other three members of Thrash's \\"big four\\" largely due to the incomparable Charlie Benante on double bass.<br />This is probably their best overall set of songs from the Joey Belladonna era of the band.  And it's still one of my favorite metal albums.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I can't tell you how long I've waited for the revival of real songwriting, and the inevitable fall of manufactured, simplistic, aural junkfood that permiates the present music scene. Artists like Coldplay, Rufus Wainright, Travis, David Grey and now John Mayer are leading the new wave of sincere, talented songwriters who are crafting songs which are pop enough to be widely accessable, but musically complex enough to keep their fellow musicians from balking at their commercial success. It's almost a return to the early 90's minus the angst and smelly clothes.<BR>   \\"Room For Squares\\" is an amazing accomplishment for such a young songwriter. Mayer's songs turn personal experience into universal feeling, without making it cheap. In the song \\"3x5\\" (musically remmeniscent of DMB's \\"Two Step\\"), Mayer keeps his lyrics vivd enough to paint a beautiful picture, but vague enough for the listener to attach his/her own experience to it.<BR>-\\"Didn't have a camera by my side this time. Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes...\\"<BR>    Musically, the entire album takes broad strokes at different genres (folk/funk/blues/jazz), and it's ALL good. From an influence stand point you can hear bits of Steely Dan, Stevey Ray Vaughn, James Taylor, DMB, and Elvis Costello (just to name a few), but Mayer definitely makes it his own. And the songs themselves are beautifully complex in thier arrangement. None of the songs have just one \\"hook\\", rather they have 3 or 4, or 5. In a world where we usually listen to an otherwise horrible song just so we can get to that one bridge, or one verse, Mayer holds himself to a much higher standard.<BR>    Mayer also deserves kudos for surrounding himself with an amazing rhythm section, and allowing them to showcase their talent on the album. Too often you can almost hear the whip crack in the backround of a \\"solo artist's\\" recording session. The production quality is clean, live, and beautiful. Go buy it TODAY!
B00005UEAR|1.0|Boy, was I disappointed. First thing is first, I love all DT stuff before this one + all side projects. But here is the problem that I mentionned when I reviewed LTE's first album + Platypus, that maybe we're better off with a DT split off since I believe this album is just a filler album where nothing new is or musicaly entertaining is recorded. As opposed to the side projects which are pretty amazing.I can't wait to hear John's solo album to see what he's keeping back.<br />Remember these are great musicians with great ideas but who I believe need new possibilities and new challenges.<br />Also the production has too much drums and too much mindless keyboards. The sound is good but this is the only CD where I continously get a headache after listening to the first CD !<br />So give me another LTE or Transatlantic or Explorers club or Scenes from a memory II, etc but please if this is what DT is heading for...
B00005TT77|5.0|I normally do not appreciate Beattles covers, but this CD is excellent.  I can't say enough about how much I love this CD.  It's a MUST HAVE!  This is a compilation that true Beatles fans won't mind playing.
B0000017CA|5.0|i've been listening to acidbath since i was 12 years old(17 now)and this cd has so much meaning to me. dax riggs is the most talented artist around these days(or ever)his voice is insanely evil one second,then hauntingly soothing the next. sammy duets satanic screams and riffs settle the grave.if you don't own this album(or anything by dax)you don't know what you're missing.
0345440900|5.0|This book helped me figure out why my newborn was crying- it includes a chart on different cries- and what to do about it.  It also helped me with breastfeeding tips.  The tone is reassuring and supportive of new parents.  Tracy Hogg offers sane, practical advice on many aspects of infant care.  I even emailed the author with a question and got an immediate response!  I plan to buy her book on toddlers too.
B000002N3N|5.0|Enya is one of of the most mysterious singers in music today. I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.<br />Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.<br />I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).<br />The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later.<br />So there you have it, another detailed from from me, Michael Carr.<br />I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece. It's gorgeous and an album for the soul.<br />Well I guess I,m out of words to say.<br />BYE!!BYE!!minds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons.

B000021YQV|5.0|Great CD from a gread band...i originally heard system of a down from a friend and decided to check out their main song at the time spiders...and then i heard chop suey and i loved it...so i bought the cd and it didnt disappoint me one bit...usually a band has one or two hits and the rest [are bad] but let me tell you that all the songs are great and worth the money...i actually give it a 6 star but since that is impossible i am stuck with a 5 star...give the cd a try...
B00005N53P|5.0|The Strokes combine great tunes and even better lyrics to make an amazing formula of addictive songs. Some Day and Last Nite are excellent even if I have heard Last Nite loads of times on the radio. It was brilliant that they were awarded best international newcomers at the Brits as now they will go from strength to strength. The only problem with the album is it is far too short, so please bring out album number 2 very soon!
6304118406|5.0|This is got to be one of the coolest films ever made.  I've seen &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; when it first came out in theaters back in 1994. It was a good movie. I've always heard that there was a lot of violence cut out of this movie until the Director's Cut of Natural Born Killers came along years later. I finally saw the Director's Cut last year and it was much better than the theatrical release back in 1994. According to Oliver Stone (the movie's director), there was 150 cuts left out of the theatrical version and it's been restored in the director's cut.  I think &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is a good movie, But with the director's cut, It's even better especially with a lot of graphic violence restored and additional dialogue.  I recommended the director's cut over the theatrical version.  I really think it's that good.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Reading the reviews, it seems obvious that those that like AI somehow think that those that do not are of lower intelligence, or lack \\"class\\".<br />The divide drawn by this movie reminds me more of how much America is big on sentiment. People who dislike AI aren't as misinformed or unintelligent as some may think - given that many of those that dislike it happen to like Kubrick films. But AI is what I like to term an \\"Oscar-whoring\\" movie - it attempts to sell on emotion. It's not so much about conveying vision, as it is about soliciting emotion.<br />AI does have a philosophical background - it surfaces at times. At other times, it's sunk deep below the numerous layers of emotion solicitational goo, to be visible...<br />Overall, AI is an okay movie. However, (as mentioned before) it tries to be too sentimental, and definitely drags on for too long. The last third of the film is disconnected enough to belong in another one. And it's not just the elapsed millenia. The flow of the last third of the film is very irregular - it accelerates quickly, then slows to a crawl, then accelerates again. That's hardly great filmmaking - just proof that there were two highly separated visions involved in making this film.<br />In general, I recommend anyone interested to see this film - it has its moments. It's not \\"the best thing since sliced bread\\" but it's also not irrepairably horrible. It's just filled to the brim with Spielberg's main ingredient - lots and lots of sentiment with little regard to the original director's vision.
0553288105|4.0|With one exception, everyone who has reviewed The Gods Themselves has raved about the middle section, and rightly so.  In part two of The Gods Themselves, Asimov reaches a level of prosaic abilities he never achieved in any of his other works.  Asimov creates a strong emotional attachment between the reader and Odeen, Dua, and Tritt.  The effect he accomplishes has less to do with a well-designed alien culture than with a knack for showing the deepest feelings of these beings, feelings that are based on another culture but which we find ourselves relating to.<br />That we end up caring so much about Odeen, Dua, and Tritt, only makes the other two parts of the book that much more uninspiring.  The human characters, while not entirely cardboard, lack the depth of the aliens.  Mostly it's because of a stylistic change.  We see Odeen, Dua, and Tritt primarily through their own self-introspection.  The humans are developed entirely through dialogue; we are never given a peek into their heads and so, frankly, don't really care about them.<br />Parts one and three aren't terrible, but standing by themselves they are unmemorable.  Part two, however, deserves to be read by every fan of the creative imagination.  Without intending to take anything away from the first three Robot novels (in my opinion, Asimov's overall best fiction works), I submit that part two of The Gods Themselves deserves all of the accolades that have been heaped upon it.
0385503954|5.0|A PIVOTAL MOMENT OCCURS IN ATONEMENT WHEN  Robbie, a family friend of the Tallises, decides to search for their young missing cousins.  He does not want the Tallis family to know yet of his love for their daughter, so he separates from her and sets out through the extensive family grounds on his own.  <br />It is a choice that alters the rest of his life. Part one of the book, that the author builds slowly and carefully, ends with Cecelia Tallis's teenage sister, Briony, testifying that during the search, she witnessed cousin Lola's rape. Robbie is suspect number one. <br />Atonement finds author Ian McEwan turning from the restrictions of the thriller genre to create a literary marvel. He chooses an initial setting in and around an English Country Home occupied by the Tallis family. It is Pre-WWII.<br />McEwan ferrets out the anima of his main characters, most of whom undergo radical change by book's end, and not because of the World War. Emily is head of the household, mother to 13-year-old Briony (who is an emerging writer,) Cecelia, and older brother, Leon. Significant guests that fatal weekend include Paul Marshall, who is Leon's wealthy friend, a beautiful cousin named Lola, and the  bratty mischievous young cousins. Also present: Robbie, a friend to the family since childhood. <br />In a romantic episode, McEwan writes an unhackneyed, and appealingly-fresh scene of Robbie and Cecelia making love for the first, awkward, but passionate time. Elegantly done.  <br />Part Two narrates the characters' war service. Part Three concerns Briony's adult life. <br />In course of the book, McEwan subtly reveals a sibling rivalry theme, and shows the dangers that can spring from snobbery and racism. He also deals with how a writer can attempt atonement for their own misdeeds through writing fiction: surely an unusual theme.  <br />A rich and profound work.
B000050XEI|1.0|acording to me, a day without rain is talk obut the situation for our heart and through to the our emotion deep inside who can not touch by any body, in the other side when lonelyness, passion, wish, is flowed in this song and mixed by the greates instrumentalia and become an imortality song in our heart
0446604844|4.0|By the time I was halfway through this novel, Total Control, I was on the edge of my seat.  This was a page-turner, a book that was tough to put down.  However, what had been a suspenseful, gripping story became predictable by the end, culminating in an almost stereotypical, melodramatic climax - the kind you see in movies.  <br />Indeed, it almost seems like the author wrote this book with the big screen in mind.  This story turned out so much like a two-star movie that you could almost picture it in your mind.  I've already identified the ideal cast for the three main characters: Sharon Stone is the perfect Sidney Archer; Tom Berenger is virtually typecast as Lee Sawyer; and the nefarious Oscar Gamble would be played by none other than Al Pacino.  <br />Though I would envision this as a two-star movie, I'll still give Total Control a four-star rating as a book.  It was, after all, quite engrossing for the better part of the story.  Just prepare yourself for a less than memorable conclusion.

B000002KBH|5.0|The title pretty much sums it up, that this is one of the best CD's ever made (and one of America's treasures)  This Cd follows down the road of Workingman's dead, with concise, structured, and lyrically abundant songs.  The soloing is not as prevalent here as it is on earlier albums, nevertheless each song will leave you wanting more.  My only complaint with this CD is that it's too good and it keeps taking up space in my cd player.
B000002JSR|5.0|As with every Zep album, Coda delivers excellent tunes as always!<BR>Walter's Walk and Bonzo's Montreaux are similar staples of the heavy Zep sound fans are familiar with. It's definately worth it's price!
0790729628|5.0|Some people say it's The Godfather.  Some say it's Citizen Kane.  Some say its Jaws, or Godfather 2, or Casablanca, or even Its a Wonderful Life.  Good movies?  Sure.  But Blade Runner is more than a movie.  It's an experience, a vision of a nightmarish future with brilliant special effects and deep, deep insight on humanity itself.  Almost none of the films on AFI's list fit this.  Blade Runner is an overlooked masterpiece, often regarded by critics as &quot;just are sci-fi movies about a guy hunting androids.&quot;  It's much more than that. <BR>The special effects are some of the best ever.<BR>The &quot;villain's&quot; final speech (tears in rain) is one of the most memorable ever.<BR>The combination of 40s noir and futuristic imagery is nothing ever seen on film.<BR>Everyone in the cast gives an excellent performance.<BR>It simply has the best camerawork, set design, and production design of any film (OK maybe Scott's other masterpiece, Alien, is just as good)<BR>So why not add this baby to the AFI list?  It's clearly a well-liked movie internationally.  It's time it's given the proper respect.
6303965415|4.0|Persuasion is my favorite Austin book, and this movie does an excellent job of bringing the characters to life.  Amanda Root does a persuasive job as Anne.  My only complaint is how the infamous letter from Captian Wentworth (&quot;You pierce my soul&quot;) is read by both voices.  I thought that detracted from the climax.  But well worth repeated watchings anyway.
B000002UAX|5.0|Bolstered by the studio experience gained with Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles set out to record a sprawling double album. What resulted was one of the most eclectic - and arguably best, not to mention best-selling albums - in rock history. Rather than setting out to record the sprawling masterpiece as Dylan had done with his double album, Blonde On Blonde, The Beatles chose instead to create a truly epic effort, embracing nearly every musical style in their spectrum (and some quite beyond what even they were considered capable of.) The Beatles, amazingly, embrace just about every genre of music that falls under the rock umbrella on this sprawling masterpiece. The being the album riskily with a straight-up parody, Back In The U.S.S.R. (a great Beach Boys send-up), that establishes the album's somewhat light-hearted tone. Certainly, some of their greatest stand-alone songs are on here - the angry, driving Happiness Is A Warm Gun; the solitary take on Revolution; early pseudo-heavy metal tracks, Helter Skelter, Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me and My Monkey, etc.; the joyous send up, Birthday; and, especially, what is still my favorite Beatles song of all time, George Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps (complete with Eric Clapton's absolutely wonderful guitar solo.) However, there is also a good amount of considerably lighter tunes - not truly filler, as they were not meant to be intended as such: you didn't pad your album to 93 minutes in 1968 - such as the sing-along, Continuing Story of Bill Bungalow; the mildly amusing, Rocky Raccoon; the witty comedic send-up, Piggies; the wry, Why Don't We Do It In The Road?; and the 8-minute studio experiment, Revolution 9... among others, showing that the band, at this point, was able - and willing - to write virtually anything. Some fine ballads abound on this album as well - Paul McCartney turns in some characterisically valid love songs, such as the touching I Will; but it's John Lennon, surprisingly, who providestwo of the album's finest ballads with Dear Prudence and Julia. Certainly, John and Paul were widely divergent at this point stylistically, and this fact gave birth to the (perhaps not so-) friendly competition that drove them to produce some of their best work. However, as it must certainly be noted, George Harrison - who, despite being in the definite minority in songwriting credits, had been turning in increasingly high-quality work for a few albums now - had begun to blossom into a truly great songwriter of his own by this point, clearly able to be a major creative force on his own, were it not for his prodigious and prolific colleagues, a certain Mr. Lennon and Mr. McCartney. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is surely and undisputed masterpiece in The Beatles's catalog, and a sure testament to his greatness. All these different aspects lead to a somewhat uneven album, in terms of flow; and it is certainly true that the album, in those terms, isn't nearly as smooth as one might expect - certainly not in the precise manner of the preceding Sgt. Pepper. However, it is a collection of masterful individual moments. Taken as a whole, it is a collection of great songs, rather than a great of its own, on the whole, per se.
B000002MFE|5.0|I first listened to this album on a 6 hour car journey to Wales. Music was obviously essential to cure the boredom of the journey (and the depression of the desired location  - Wales.) Before this journey, I had always been a Clapton fan, despite my young age. My father had brought me up on the likes of Hendrix, the Stones, and Cream, from which Clapton emerged as the legend that he is today.  <br />I embraced him as one of the greatest guitarists and all-round talents in the music bussiness. I used to listen to his music for hours, rewinding his incredible guitar solos, much to the annoyance of my parents. However, i had never appreciated his music as being as diverse and adaptable as it was; until I heard this album on that horrible journey.<br />The album presents many of his old and (at the time) new records, but in acoustic. And it really opened my eyes to what true talent and incredible music is. Records such as Layla cannot be imagined played softly, without that most familiar of guitar riffs. However, Clapton pulls it off, again and again on this album.  <br />The record contains an array of superbly addictive numbers, played with an effortless skill which Clapton displays throughout.  Some faves of mine include 'Malted Milk', 'Before you accuse me' and 'Hey hey'. <br />Usually, having an album on tape annoys me. You know how most albums have 1 or 2 weak tracks which you always skip. There is nothing worse than frantically rewinding and forwarding a cassette, especially in a small car on the way to Wales. It is a display of an albums brilliance when this enfuriating track skipping is unneccessary, because every song is superb. Unplugged fits into this category. Added to some lovely inbetween track 'band talk' and you have a very special album. <br />Make it your next record. It even makes trips to Wales enjoyable.<br />Adam

I love her music, both in english and in spanish. . . <br />Shakira has an amazing voice and a cultural background that no other pop singers can compare to.<br />I would encourage her to continue singing in both English and Spanish. Therefore, both audiences would be happy . . . and those of us who listen to both, we'll keep supporting her through whatever paths she takes.<br />Love you! Me amo, Shakira.<br />Felicidades. Congrats on being the success that you are today.<BR>Buena Suerte en el futuro . . . Good luck in the future.

B00005QGAT|5.0|This album(Off The Wall) is from way back when....1979.Although I wasn't born until 1986, I managed to reach back and discover a true classic. This is the Michael Jackson before  vast commercialism and OVEREXPOSURE. The album opens with Don't Stop (T. Y. G. E.)by far the best track on the album. Michael sings soulfully and the percussion and orchestra add the extra touch.It has the elements that 1982's Billie Jean  did R&amp;B,rock, and classical,but the pop was less evident on this one.The incredible bassline's effect is also reminiscent to the aforementioned &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.The next track is a smooth, funky love/dance ballad, &quot;Rock With You&quot;. This song written by Rod Temperton of Heatwave is a sign of the rapidly fading disco sound of the era.It is done well but feels too short. Workin' Day and Night&quot; is a show case of guitar, and horns that is executed perfectly carrying the album along. Another standout song is the title track, &quot;Off The Wall&quot;. This track begins with subtle screams and chills, or a sample of &quot;Thriller&quot;.This song though is really about having fun and hitting the disco after the week.&quot;Girlfriend&quot;, penned by Paul McCartney of the Beetles is mellow like, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, from Thriller.The jazzy,groovy track,&quot;I Can't Help It&quot;, penned by Stevie Wonder flows well and is one of my favorite songs on the album. It is executed perfectly also with hints of strings in the background.&quot;She's Outta My Life&quot;, is an easy song that passes freely and quickly. The last song titled, &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;, is another sign of the era.<BR>Overall I appreciate the excellent flow and vocals by Michael. Quincy Jones' sound is also very polished which helps. A<BR>Any MJ fan should pick this one up, and see his metamorphosis over time.I love the album and I am only 15.....
0688172377|3.0|This ghost-written autobiography of a Somalian nomad who became an international fashion model is certainly an interesting read.  The story in broad terms is quite extraordinary and eye-opening.  However, there were several sections of the book which just didn't quite ring true.  For example, her initial (solo) arrival in London as a young illiterate teenage who spoke no English and who until 24 hours before had never seen a flush toilet or an airplane.  There is simply no way that she could have gone through Heathrow arrivals without any questioning.  She would not have had any clue how to navigate her way from the plane, through immigration and customs etc.  All I am saying is, that I believe there were many embellished stories in this book.<br />However, the book did serve one very important purpose - drawing attention to the abominable practice of female genital mutilation.  Waris Dirie now works with the United Nations to stop this atrocity and if her story can help achieve this goal in any small way, then this book has achieved its purpose.
B000002552|5.0|The Basement Tapes by Bob Dylan and the Band is one of the best albums I have ever heard. <BR>There is just something about this album that draws me to it. Songs like: Please Mrs. Henry, Open the door Homer, Yea heavy and a bottle of bread, Lo and behold, apple suckling tree, etc. Dylan and the band recorded these songs in the big pink house in upstate New York in 1967 while Dylan was recovering from his motorcycle accident. Dylan and the band were just practicing in the basement and never intended for any of these songs to be heard by anyone outside the big pink house. Each song I think tells a story about the people in the house and the surrounding area. There is a song for example about Mr. Henry (Don't ya tell Henry) and Mrs. Henry (Please Mrs. Henry) and many other people most of which have nicknames. Don't ever let anyone tell you that Dylan isn't funny. These songs are about close friends having fun with the people and music they enjoy. <br />I heard Dylan play one of the songs in concert. Listen close the next time you hear him live, he may play one of them. \\"Please Mrs. Henry\\" is my favorite.<BR>This is my favorite Dylan album and since he has over 40 albums out that is saying a lot. This is a once in a lifetime recording session that can never be repeated. If it wasn't for all the bootleg recordings this album would never have been heard by the public. Since it was bootlegged so much, Dylan and the Band decided to release it to the public and get some credit.<BR>If you had to buy just one Dylan album I wouldn't recommend this one, but if you already have some Dylan albums and want the best<BR>This is it.          ***** Five out of five stars *****
B00005OWIU|5.0|This was the most amazing way to spend 73 minutes and 13 seconds on the 18 hour drive to Florida! I was absolutely astounded. &quot;Prologue&quot; is so short and sweet, it was like a lullaby. &quot;Quidditch Match&quot; was the centerpoint of the CD, for me. &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot; was scary at times and was for the  most anticipated appearance of any character in the movie. &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; was &quot;lullaby-ish&quot; at the beginning then raises and raises and then.....BAM! The grand finale! An amazing score for the best film of 2001. We needed something to calm us down and take us to &quot;Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters&quot; and lead us into the &quot;Great Hall&quot;. It was beautiful and amazing and I'm glad I bought it.
6304366078|5.0|Grand Prix, the film, is an amazing documentary portraying grand prix racing in the late 1960's.  James Garner plays an outstanding role as American driver Pete Aaron.  With little dialogue and plenty of authentic race footage, Grand Prix can eaisly be quoted to be the best racing movie ever produced.  John Frankenheimer took the racing fans image of early grand prix racing to it's greatest extreme and and made it into one of the first auto racing films ever to be produced.  A production of this quality will never be recreated because of the manner in which it was made.  The footage is real racing, not acting.  Helicopters were flown down the straightways 15-20 feet above the cars during races.  The FIA these days wouldn't let an aircraft within miles of the circuit, making a film with the action of Grand Prix impossible to duplicate.
B00004TH6O|5.0|I've had this one for about 6 months now(and heard it even longer ago from a friend). Though I loved if from square one, I've been running out of material to review. Thank God I listened to just a few days ago.<br />So what is there to say that hasn't already been said about Rated R? Not much. What you have here is what I like to call is \\"trance rock\\". Josh Homme's signature guitar-played-through-bass-amp crunch is still here but more stripped down(i.e. not nearly of the Kyuss technicallity). Its repetetive but at the same time easy for one's self to get lost in. Everything else on here is played in a very simple, user-friendly manner(bass, guitar, piano, bongos, kitchen sink, etc...) but never comes even close to becoming MTV rock. To say the least, Queens have managed to carve out their own style on this CD. Its like stoner rock with pop elements. Its like rock with stoner elements. Its a total mind melt-down. Heck, its worth it just to hear the first 5 songs!
B00003CXXP|4.0|Steven Spielberg's &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; continues its quest to become a real success with an ambitious two-DVD set. The discs lack a director's commentary -- Spielberg doesn't like them -- but is packed with details of the science fiction drama's three-decade history, from its genesis with Stanley Kubrick to its realization by Spielberg.<br />Laurent Bouzereau's DVD team had liberal access to the filmmakers during production, with key craftsmen emerging as the supplemental disc's stars. Interviews and docu footage are segregated into unusually specific craft areas -- sound editing, lighting, costumes -- along with the usual categories: visual effects, production design, animation, etc. (The short and specific extras follow a trend in studio DVDs away from lengthy film docus that could trigger additional talent costs.)<br />Picture quality is more than up to major studio standards, with detail apparent throughout, even in some of the dark soft-contrast scenes. The many scenes with CG and blue-screen composites appear vibrant and convincing, especially in the much-maligned third act. The DTS audio setting provides more punch, bottom and dramatic effect than the Dolby, as usual.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|It's frustrating to sit and read some these reviews.  I think it's time people like me actually review some of the reviews since some people have no idea how to voice a proper opinion without saying something wrong with a completely brilliant production!  First off, a good reviewer will know how hard it is to get a movie off the ground as well as how much work it really takes to ensure it becomes a hit.  Be reminded that thousands of people worked countless hours to make this thing come to life!  Based on some of the serious grammatical errors I see on some of these reviews, they probably don't work near as hard in their own lives so I guess they digress to harping on other peoples work.  That's the nature of the beast, oh well.<br />What's really engaging about this movie to me is that it was shot so beautifully and so eloquently who gives a hoot where the story is going?  The movie gets the job done!<br />So, they have a love triangle-that's cool, you appeal to the lovesick teenage girls who just can't get enough of Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett, not to mention the guys who love watching Kate Beckensale-WOOF!  Bottom line, see, \\"From here to eternity,\\" and you'll see that Hollywood has been using similar formulas for years in war movies!<br />So, you have flawed historical accounts in a movie-sorry to say it folks, but EVERY movie has that, it keeps continuity to the STORY, not HISTORY itself.  We already have read the \\"history\\" of Pearl Harbor a million times, why not take a tangent here and there?<br />So, you have bad acting, almost every film that has been a success did not become a success on Oscar winning actors alone.  No one really knows why some things work and some things dont, why speak your mind about something already said?  Get over it!  It doesn't say anything about the DVD product!<br />So, it was PG-13, ah ha!  Look what we have coming down the pike!  Low and behold AN R RATED VERSION COMING TO DVD MAY 16TH!  Personally I liked the PG-13 version myself because I felt comfortable taking my twelve-year-old nephew to see the film.  He loves me talking about my adventures in the Navy and I felt at ease that there wouldn't be a ton of gore to make the attack scenes even more horrifying.  Keep in mind, this is a Disney flick and even though it doesn't have Disney written all over it, they still have a rep to protect.  Again, most reviews are not focusing on the DVD itself!<br />When doing reviews on Amazon, people need to keep in mind that the movie has been reviewed a million times and considering how popular of a movie Pearl Harbor was, most everyone has in one form or another-SEEN THE MOVIE!  Get off the high horse of opinionating the movie!  Reviews have long since past!  Review the product! That's what a consumer will want to read!  For instance;<br />How is the sound of the Pearl Harbor DVD?  Phenomenal if you ask me!  My home theatre system is peaked when I put this DVD in!<br />How is the picture of the DVD?  First rate, not a blemish to report here and actually the colors are far more vibrant on the DVD than they ever were in the theatre.  With the exception of a slight pause around the middle of the film, this DVD picture is flawless.<br />Does the DVD have extras?  You bet!  Lots of them!  The new Vista Series DVD (which by the way has released several great versions of previous movies including \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"Unbreakable.\\") will include even more extras as well as the R-rated version on two discs.  TOO COOL!<br />These are the things consumers want to know before buying a product.  I could care less about your opinion of a film!  Let the consumer be the judge of a film!  Consumers need your input on the product!  I would hope Amazon improves the review system by deleting unnecessary reviews and highlighting the ones that really \\"work\\" for the product they are selling! To all of you reviewers out there (including me), focus on the content of the product and leave the movie reviews to the realcritics, since that's what they get paid for!  Keep writin!o the real critics, since that's what they get paid for!  Keep writin!
B00005RFAI|4.0|I am not really a Pink fan but I must say that this cd is impressive! I decided to buy after I heard the single Don't Let Me Get Me which is in my opinion the best on the album. The song is like my life story and I could relate to it so much I just knew I had to buy it! I was surprised to see that the rest was very good too. I love other songs like Just Like A Pill, Get This Party Started, 18 Wheeler, Family Portrait, Misery, and Lonley Girl.
B000005HBI|5.0|...sista cassandra is hummin them deep, bluesy lullabies with this one here...makes me wanna lay my head in her lap and take a nap...this is that late night thing...both smokey and lush...<br />no candles...no wine...<br />jus me and her slumped back on the couch in the shadows talkin about heaven, heaven on earth and if we both gonna skip work tomorrow...
B00005YW4H|5.0|Must you break my heart with your smoky, wistful voice? I thought they stopped making music like this a long time ago. Norah Jones's &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is fantastic. Some of these torch songs could so easily be overdone, by an insecure artist eager to  wow us with her sultriness, but this is a remarkably self-assured performance. I'm not so crazy about her version of Hank Williams 1st's &quot;Cold. Cold Heart&quot;, but the rest of the material is smashing, especially &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; and the title track. How can you NOT want to come away with her?
B00000HYXB|5.0|Few are able to write music like this.  Most artists that attempt to combine speed metal with themes such as those used by Blind Guardian are usually difficult to take seriously on any level.  For this reason, I have to give Blind Guardian a lot of credit for rising above, as well as for stepping outside of the box and doing a great job at it.<br />One must still be open minded to appreciate their work.  If you're not dissuaded by the operatic nature of bands such as Queen, the vocal layering, technique and style shouldn't present a problem for you.  There is in fact a lot to be said for Kursch's voice in general; if you grow weary of typical metal singers that have powerful voices but sound like every other trained set of chords, you won't be disappointed with Kursch.  While not as distinct as someone, say King Diamond, Kursch's voice is definitely unique, interesting, and a powerful instrument that mixes well with the overall harmonics of the music. <br />I find the latest album, A Night at the Opera, over the top, though Nightfall on Middle-Earth and the previous albums are done quite tastefully.  Nightfall in Middle-Earth should be the first on your list if your ears are looking for something new.  I would also recommend &quot;Imaginations from the Other Side&quot;, followed by &quot;Somewhere Far Beyond&quot;.
1587990717|2.0|I felt dissapointed by this book. It contains indeed some interesting nuggets, like the digressions on \\"lucky fools\\" (those favoured by luck see causality rather than randomness), \\"survivorship bias\\" (we never see the losers) or \\"black swans\\" (those extremely unlikely but devastating events). But the book is, by and large, an unsuccessful blend of Mr. Talebs personal biography with his musings about how financial markets behave. There is much truth in the concept of lucky fools -the fundamental theme of the book - , but the point becomes repetitive and overdone. The book is also peppered by continuous allegories to History and Literature (Solon, Carneades, Proust, Baudelaire...), which make clear that Mr. Talebs personal interests, rooted in his French education/Middle East background/Anglosaxon professional experience, go beyond finance and which demonstrate that he is much more cultivated than the average finance specialist (Mr. Taleb informs his readers, for instance, that he'd rather read Baudelaire than listen to the CNN or George Will). But my guess is that many of those passing remarks on History, Literature and even economics (e.g. Mr. Taleb's cursory reference to \\"behavioral finance\\" or \\"network externalities\\")will be understood and ejoyed only by those already familiar with them.
0385503954|5.0|I think, at first, some people may be put off by the protagonist of Ian McEwan's wonderful novel, &quot;Atonement.&quot;  A precocious, privileged, thirteen year old dramatist may not seem like the perfect person to narrate this story, but believe me, she is.<br />Briony Tallis is an overly-imaginative young woman who keeps her eye glued to too many of the happenings in the large English country house where she lives.  And  there is a lot going on in this house which Briony doesn't completely understand.  When she falsely accuses an innocent man, both his life and hers will be forever changed.<br />Briony can't really be blamed for her overly active imagination or for her propensity to see things that really are not there.  She is the offspring of a mother who spends most of her days in bed and a father who can't be bothered to leave London and his mistress.  Briony's older siblings are the &quot;adored&quot; children in this family and the ones who get what meager attention their divorcing parents dole out.  Briony turns to the writing of plays to gain attention and gain attention she does, though not in the manner in which she expected.  This book is, most certainly, a first-rate page-turner.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a book written in three sections that cover a span of sixty years.  The first takes place on a hot summer's day in 1935.  It is in this section that a crime occurs and lives are forever changed.  There is so much tension in this first section (and, strangely enough, this is the longest section), that the pages simply fly by.  Before you know it, you are reading the second section, which takes place several years later and in a different setting (Northern France) and focuses on the primary male character of the novel, Robbie.  The third section brings us to an elderly London writer on the eve of her birthday and offers several surprises.<br />The second section of the book, which takes place during WWI, details very graphic images of war.  Havingnever been in a war, I can't vouch for the accuracy of these images but they certainly seem alive enough.  There are horrific images and heroic images alike and both seem equally integral to the story being told.<br />McEwan has devised an ingenious ending for &quot;Atonement.&quot;  I am not sure all readers will like it.  I think some will wish it had been a little different than what it was.  I had mixed feelings about the ending and the surprise it afforded.  On the one hand, I enjoyed it, but on the other, it made me distrust the entire story...just a little.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a more complex work than McEwan's previous books.  There are more strands interwoven into the braid of the plot.  Yet, McEwan resists the urge to become dark and melancholy; &quot;Atonement&quot; is a book that contains all the energy and fire of his earlier achievements.  It is a wonderful book, filled with believable characters and meticulous research.  If you choose to read it, I don't think you can go wrong.
B000002J20|4.0|This has to be the most \\"classic\\" storyline type albums<BR>ever created for this time period. The combination writings<BR>of Anderson and Howe (which believe it or not,this album was written in 3 evenings at their hotel, where YES were staying at,on the road) plus Squire\\"s driving,syncopated bass lines.and White<BR>is following Squire,or is it the other way around. On this<BR>2 disc set try to listen to the first song,then listen<BR>to the last song. Dont just hear what is going on,but what is<br />going on behind \\"the music\\". Sometimes,example on the 2nd song ,second disk,<BR>you will hear Howe play riffs that come from the past,some<BR>are from Fragile and Close to the Edge. When this first<BR>came out ,it was booed by the critics and downgraded by<BR>the true YES listener. Buy this CD, give them another<BR>listen,you will be quite surprised.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This dvd is packed with good extras and stuff like that, the usual making of the movie aswell as some special DVD ROM content.<br />The movie is not as good though.  Its definetely aimed at younger audience and it takes some steps out of the usual star wars style (why does Anakin call his mother &quot;mom&quot;?  And why do they call him Ani?!  Thats just not Star Wars!).  The &quot;comic relief&quot; was a bit too much.  Jar Jar was annoying as hell and probably did nothing but drag this movie right to the level of that ET atari game (you know the one that sold absolutely no copys and even bums wouldnt accept free cartriges?  And then after they tried doing that they had to put every copy in some landfill in Mexico?)  Uh, well anyway, at least hes not going to make a huge appearance in Episode II!<br />If Phantom menace stays true to something of the star wars legend its the figthing.  The lightsaber battles were awesome, as always and I'm looking forward to seeing Episode II (even more so after seeing the new &quot;Clone Wars&quot; trailer).  For star wars fans this DVD is a must buy.  For general movie watchers you might want to think a little bit before purchasing the dvd.  I still recommend it, because Star Wars no matter what, is a classic.
B000002J1S|4.0|This  was my first exposure to Genesis. It was kinda,werid,<br />reading the album cover,who is Rael? Being a musician I marveled<br />at it. The songs may have been avarage sounding, but the meter<br />and lyrics,just wonderfull. Collins drumwork, for all you<br />drummers that have a double pedal,listen to Collins doing<br />12/8 and 11/8, doing a single pedal form of  this syncopation!<br />(Side 1, 3rd song) Wow!! Rutherford's bass lines are not<br />to shabby either. At that time we had big speakers in our<br />stereo system,so those bass pedals came out!!! I went out<br />and bought a set of bass pedals. Getting back to the music,<br />you have to remember ,this was a very difficult time for Genesis,<br />plus Gabriel's wife was expecting and those instrumental<br />parts are Banks all the way.Its worth the collection, a grounbreaking effect for this great band.

B0000542D1|5.0|In 1963, The Beatles were at their peak of popularity in England. This wave of \\"Beatlemania\\" was witnessed by George \\"Bud\\" Ornstein who worked for United Artists film company in Britain.  He thought this hysteria would be great to catch on film.  So, he asked Walter Shenson, who had a reputation for making low-budget comedies, to produce the film and Alun Owen, a British dramatist, to write the screenplay.  Together with Richard Lester directing, A Hard Day's Night captured The Beatles' individual personalities and scouse humor along with the hysteria generated by their fans over a fictitious two-day period in their lives.<br />\\"The Beatles' music obviously played a major part in the film and it was introduced in a refreshingly natural way unlike the forced musical breaks in so many previous rock'n'roll films\\" (\\"The History of The Beatles on Film\\" by Bill Harry).  The Beatles were not actors.  They were performers, singers and songwriters and the music was used to stress that point.  The music was an added attraction next to seeing The Beatles in their first film.  The music did nothing to move the plot, in fact in most cases, it had nothing to do with the plot (if there was one).  However, were it not for the musical interludes, it would have been a wasted movie.  The songs in the movie showed an outburst of humor (\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" played while The Beatles run rampant in a field), the fast pace of the film (\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - played while The Beatles are being chased through a train station by their adoring fans), and a rehearsal number for the show (\\"And I Love Her\\").  The climax of the film is The Beatles' performance in front of a live audience for a television show.  A medley of their songs was featured that included \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\" and one of their biggest hits, \\"She Loves You\\" ended the concert.  Each song was placed in the film in a way that it didn't have to be set up and was naturally eased into without any long breaks before the song starts or any waiting such as setting up the band.  There are also no leads playing before the song starts.  The audience is unaware of what song will be next or when one will appear.<br />Released in England on August 2, 1964 and in America on August 12, 1964, A Hard Day's Night was praised by critics and fans alike.  Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice called the film \\"... the Citizen Kane of Juke Box musicals\\" and The Daily Mirror critic, not a Beatles fan, said that they were \\"cheeky, irreverent, funny, irresistible\\" as quoted in \\"Billboard's Book of Number One Hits\\" by Fred Bronson.  This film introduced the world to The Beatles (since their popularity and phenomenon was just beginning).  The film grossed  million in its first release, was nominated for two academy awards and was released in different countries and translated into different languages.<br />I love this film (because, of course, I'm a huge Beatles fan).  I found this film to be amusing (it's amazing that none of the lines were ad-libbed) and enjoyable.  Most critics felt that Ringo's performance stood out from the rest and stole the show, but I feel that John's performance and lines were better (and I am more of a fan of Ringo than John).  Overall, the film kept me moving (with its fast pace) and anxiously awaiting for the next song to appear or what type of amusing remark each Beatle would say next.<br />As Paul McCartney said in an interview in 1984 (as quoted in \\"Billboard's Book of Number One Hits\\" by Fred Bronson) \\"I hate to say it, but when you see the girls in their mini-skirts and white floppy hats it does look dated.  I think the general opinion is that it was funny and entertaining and I'm still proud of it.\\"<br />We are too Paul!starts or any waiting such as setting up the band.

0140195076|2.0|Hart DeFouw and Robert Svoboda are both very talented writers and astrologers, so this book review is not taken lightly, but I wanted to &quot;set the record straight&quot; or balance the perspective. Although the book has quite a few good sections--the nakshatra discussions are very interesting for example--parts of the book are really quite at odds with most mainstream authorities on Jyotish and provide information which is not really helpful in chart interpretation. For example, the entries on the grahas are weak and general, and the chapters on the signs pull us back to the worst excesses of personality analysis based on sign--not a good thing for astrology, because it ignores the basic principle that the signs will manifest differently based upon the placement of the lord of the sign, a basic principle in Jyotish. Also, the analyses (particularly that of Einstein's chart) stumble all over themselves trying to prove principles that really don't fit the charts very well. Any time the analysis in Jyotish needs too many roads to get to a conclusion, you have picked the wrong technique. In addition, the overview of different types of Vedic astrology looks very speculative--no real analysis of origins or any scholarly work in this direction. Finally, some of the radical techniques taught by their teacher are intriguing but are not validated. For instance, what does it MEAN in chart interpretation that Rahu is exalted in Scorpio? How does this affect how one would work with a client?  <br />There are some interesting parts, such as the discussion on planetary war (which has been further amplified by other Western authorities).<br />The writing is entertaining and easy to read, but I would be extremely selective in using the techniques promulgated under this book for chart interpretation. I would recommend starting the pursuit of the study of Vedic Astrology with the books of James Braha or William Levacy. This book only acts authoritative.

B000005DQR|5.0|I first go this album in 96; I was still in high school and didn't know much about sampling, beat production, etc. I thought it was one of the most amazing things I'd ever heard. Now, as a senior in college with more musical experience under my belt, I can still say this is one of the best albums I own. DJ Shadow revolutionized the way I and many people thought about sampling. As he takes a record from his insanely deep crates, he doesn't simply loop a catchy cut a la Puffy, he manipulates and recontextualizes these sounds into something completely his own. Like his track &quot;Organ Donor,&quot; where he uses a sample of a church organ and turns it into a beat. Shadow in my opinion is the epitome of the postmodern musical artist: taking what's already out there in the world we live in and breathing new life into it. I highly recommend this to any electronic or hip hop fans. Oh, and by the way I heard he has a new album coming out soon; he's on MCA now, so his access to production equipment is gonna be insane this time. I'm expecting a truely remarkable album.

B00005R2M3|5.0|I can not say that Shakira is at her best at Laundry Service but i'm rating this album 5 stars because of her courage singing in English and for such great melodies that will defintely break new ground in World Music Scene.Shakira finally arrived to The States but for sure they are missing such great albums of her just like her full-hit-complication album Dondes Estan Los Landores.Now let's see Laundry Service track by track:<BR>*Objection (Tango): A great opening. An outstanding melody with fab lyrics. A definite hit with a suprise rap part 10 out of 10<BR>*Underneath Your Clothes: A slow song with a great performance from Shakira. The lyrics are not that strong in chorus part but still the song has an amazing melody that is ideal for a good snog. 10 out of 10<BR>*Whenever Wherever : What can i say more? A hit for sure. With shocking lyrics to a great melody that make you dance all the track long.Shake ya ass girl 10 out of 10<BR>*Rules: Hits seem not to stop. An awesome track with cute lyrics.Another definite hit 10 out of 10<BR>*The One: A great track with outstanding improved vocals by Shakira. Watch out for the chorus 10 out of 10<BR>*Ready For The Good Times: A good follow up to previous tracks but not as awesome as them.Still a pretty good track that make you cheer up till the end.Especially in oh oh part watch put for Shakira's sexy voice. 8.5 out of 10<BR>*Fool: Another definite hit with a catchy chorus. Obviously she is not a fool but Shakira seems making some confession. 10 out of 10<BR>*Te Dejo Madrid: What i like about Shakira is all in this track.Her unique sound in her Spanish tracks and for me it is a great song.Maybe out there most of you do not enjoy it because it's Spanish but i can assure the melody will catch you in the first time you listen it. 10 out of 10<BR>*Poem To A Horse:I like this track too.It's pretty good 9 out of 10<BR>*Que Me Quedes Tu:The weakest track in da whole album.Although i prefer Shakira singin in Spanish , this track has something missing.The chorus is so slow that you can fall asleep anytime.And the melody has nothing to do when it's compared with other slow tracks in da album Underneath Your Clothes and The One.Not very bad but not good. 5 out of 10<BR>*Eyes Like Yours: The English version of last year's unbeatable hit Ojos Asi but the english version is not awesome like Ojos Asi.The lyrics just not as catchy as the Spanish one whereas this is less enjoyable. 7 out of 10<BR>*Suerte: The Spanish version of the hit Whenever Wherever.The chorus will stuck in your head for the first time you listened it although you do not know any Spanish.Great 10 out of 10<BR>*Te Aviso Te Anuncio:The Spanish version of Objection.Still catchy as the English one but i'm giving one less point for the lyrics. 9 out of 10<BR>Hats off for SHakira.Congrats
1565847032|5.0|This is Chomsky at his personal best.  He is more funny and animated in this book, because of the intimate nature of the gatherings posted.  It is less academic but an amazing look at so many of Chomsky's beliefs and theories in one book.  <br />  I was surprised there was so much here that seemed like new information.  Chomsky is really more biting at these teach ins: You almost wish all of his books had this concept.  <br />  There is also his use of four letter words, which you seldom see from him.  He interacts with other people, and that seems to get interesting answers that Chomsky usually keeps to himself.  <br />  Need I say it:  Chomsky's first, &quot;entertaining&quot; book.  It is highly informative and chock full of stuff, but it is also very fun to read.  Too bad I finised it.  <br />  Great book, hopefully more of these teach in tomes coming.  <br />  Wonderful and searing.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I have to say that P!INK is one of my fave singers out there.The first time she appeared on TV with  There You Go , i fell in love with her.And now she is coming back with a brand new stuff and a total change.Personally i adore her first album CAN'T GET ME HOME because of it's r'n'b sound.But this new album has nothing to do with r'n'b.It's pure rock with r'n'b and pop mixture.Missundazstood starts with 7 amazing tracks that you can not seperate one from another.Missundazstood is a great opening track with an amazingly follow up new single ''Don't Let Me Get Me''.''Just Like A Pill'' rocks the house with its irresistable melody and chorus that you can easily find yourself singing it after two or three listening.First single ''Get The Party Started'' comes to calm the atmosphere with its dance feeling.''Respect'' is a typical girl power song and sure will get a place in any Girl Power complication.''18 Wheeler'' takes the atmosphere to a more girl power situation with its amazing chorus and lyrics.''Family Affair'' is an r'n'b track about family problems and still makes a sense of diary.Then the album just slow it down.Misery is a cool song featuring Steven Tyler but still has something missing.Dear Diary and Eventually are OK but not that good.Lonely Girl is a cool song featuring Linda Perry the co-writer on Pink's album.Numb is a good track with an OK but not something speacial follow up Gone To California.My Vietnam is a good end for the album.I'm givin 5 stars to this album because of the great 7 songs in the begining and for the courage of Pink's that changing her music syle taking it one step further.Can't Get P!NK dow (watch out the lyrics of 18 Wheeler)
0375703764|4.0|Just a quick word to those considering buying a copy of House Of Leaves.  I'm only a third of the way through it, so this isn't really a review, just a comment about my experience with it so far.<br />There's something seriously spooky about this book.  Several times, as I've been lost in it's pages, I've had the distinct feeling that someone was sneaking up on me.  Scary.
B00005QZWI|3.0|Excellent music, superb score. Enya does this soundtrack proud.... Just don't plan to play it on your computer.<br />Having ordered this CD, I recieved the 'enhanced' version, which is basically the soundtrack with the ISO filesystem hiding the music. A web page and shockwave file were all that could be found when I attempted to listen to this CD on my computer, and despite my best efforts, I could not appreciate this soundtrack on the far superior sound system attached to my computer.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I'm sure everyone knows &quot;Last Nite&quot;. The video to that song was great, and was what got me interested in The Strokes to begin with. But having purchased their album, I was disappointed to find that what I thought would be a simple yet refreshing style is nothing more than simple. Lead singer Julian Casablancas uses the same radio effect on his vocals on practically every track, which becomes very irritating to listen to. I want to hear some variation from someone who is obviously a very good singer. It's the same deal throughout the entire album, with all the band members showing flashes of talent every once in a while, but not often enough for this album to be anything other than 11 tracks of exactly the same sound. They've taken their simple, energetic style and stretched it over an entire CD. Yawn. These guys should take some time with their next album, try and explore different themes and styles on the same CD, and above all else, ignore the hype. Guys, you're not that good yet.

For a while (particularly in the first vol), you don't know if you are in this world or a different one - which is exactly what the author intends.  This fantasy - weird and wonderful though it is - is the real thing.  Anyone could get caught up in it - or perhaps we are already in it? Gets you thinking.  It's everything a timeless book should be.
6303407188|5.0|First of all, why is this movie only 10.00? This is one of the funniest well acted movie I've ever seen, much better than some movies that are out now. Ed wood is so bad he's good! With an all-star cast why isn't it out on DVD? I recommand Ed for anyone thats strange and unusal!
B00005OAIE|1.0|John Mayer's major label debut, Room for Squares, has occasioned more than one comparison to Dave Matthews.  One spin and it's easy to hear why.  His vocal ID is two-thirds Matthews, one-third Peter Gabriel, with his musical bearing Dave Matthews Band-lite.  Beyond the comparisons, Room for Squares is a breezy listen, no more or less.  Each mild pleasure, like the slinky \\"City Love\\", is negated by a bland arrangement; the acoustic skiffle of \\"83\\" is belabored by its rose-colored nostalgia for when he was all of five.  This is a major case of arrested development - what more can you expect from someone who insists that \\"the real world is just a lie you rise above\\"?  Most real:  \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\", wherein Mayer discovers sex, and it means more to him (and us) than that Superman lunch box he pines for from 1983.
0684857219|1.0|This book is about 25 years out of date with both scientific results and empirical observations on what works for the average, non-steroid popping individual.<br />This was my bible for the first 5 years of my weight-lifting life, and it was the worst possible thing I could read. I trained as prescribed by Arnie and ate like a pig. I made only nominal strength and weight gains because like 95% of the population, I'm a 'hard-gainer', which means that unless I take steroids, lifting more than 3x a week is overtraining. Recovery time is at least one week per muscle group for the average person. According to Arnold's schedule, it's more like 24-48 hours.<br />A year ago I switched to a much less physically and mentally taxing 2-3x a week plan typical of HIT (high-intensity training), and have seen gains of 2.5lbs/week on bench and 5 lbs/week on squat.<br />Arnold's book is average for tips on form. Its training regimen is only for Mr. Steroids.
B00005NWLO|5.0|By far one of the greatest live albums around, has all the classics and a few non-studio gems. Thier version of T for Texas is amazing, Steve Gaines played like his fingers were on fire. Ronnie Van Zant sang every song with heart felt emotion, Simple Man was just one sample of his vocal power. The 3 guitars of Steve Gaines, Allen Collins, and Gary Rossington sounds like they were feeding of each other. There was no video released of the Fox theatre show where this was recorded, but if you want to see the power of a live show pick up a copy of Free Bird the movie, it also contains a version of T for Texas. If you are a Skynyrd fan you know what you are getting, if you are not a fan you need to add this cd to your colection. I promise you won't be dissapointed.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|If you love music--and if you expect to be humming a new tune or two after seeing a musical--save yourself two hours and skip this film.  I was so repulsed by the haphazard collage of contemporary music.  If you closed your eyes, you'd swear you were listening to a B-grade (and very smarmy) lounge act.  There is NOTHING original about the music, and aside from some extravagant visuals, NOTHING special about this movie.  For a truly Oscar-worthy movie, try seeing 'Amelie'.  And if you're looking for a ground-breaking, contemporary musical, check out 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch'.
B000002C4J|5.0|It's hard to find the right words to describe Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love. If you like Celine and haven't gotten this album you should get it. Its content resembles, in musical style, those from FALLING INTO YOU. Although sometimes it may be hard to get into some of the content, this occurs only rarely at the expense of the tremendous range it has on offer. And while the album doesn't quite have the sweet setting that categorized some of her earlier releases, nobody should dismiss it. Celine mixes symphonic rock with R&B with even funky reggae arrangements! (Treat Her Like a Lady is worth dancing to on Friday nights.) But don't let this versatile range make you think there are more like ten women on this CD. Yes, I love My Heart Will Go On. The combination of Celine's powerful voice, Irish tin whistles, and a symphonic rock orchestra in a heartfelt arrangement is amazing. No wonder the song (and the TITANIC movie) became so popular. To Love You More is another noteworthy gem...for this release, that is. Although it did appear on Japan's import of FIY back in '96, its REAL origin can be traced to the Japanese 16-track reissue of THE COLOUR OF MY LOVE. So it's really more TCOML property than FIY but to be a big hit in Japan and in the US Celine is honored to have that song for this pressing. In other matters, pretty much the whole CD is notable and interesting enough to add to anyone's Celine collection. After all, 70 million Celine lovers can't be wrong.
6305648522|5.0|..this is not a blockbuster film, not an action film, not really quite a coming of age film. What this IS, is a labor of love, a true work of art, and proof that the film genre can be poignant, entertaining AND thought provoking. It's success stems from the characters...real people in real life situations, with no heroics and no eye-popping cutting edge special effects.<br />It touches us because it has no happy ending, no ending at all actually, the lead character Toto, although very successful in life remains unfulfilled. He has guilt over unfilled family relationships, a father who died in the war, a teenage love that was lost, and doubts over his own accomplishments. <br />The only thing that does give him satisfaction (which he only realizes at the end of the film) is the friendship and love he had for the old man who befriended and mentored him as a child. The old man is the projectionist at the Cinema Paradiso, Alfredo, wonderfully portrayed by the great Philippe Noiret.<br />This will surely be one of the most beloved films of all time whether foreign or domestic due to the beautiful cinematography, the beautiful score, the wonderful acting, and the great care and love given by the director.
1577311523|5.0|I am thirty rears old and have been searching for answers to questions for most of this time. I was raised in a strict religious envirement, and like Tolle says, the highest good was always projected into a future time, which only exists in the mind and never in actuality. After reading The power of now, I came to realise that the search in itself was hampering my attempt at finding any real peace. It seems clear to me now that any search (for real truth) which involves the egoic mind, only leads to further suffering.<br />I have come to appreciate (with help from Tolles book)that real truth can not be realised in the conventional scientific method of subject and object. This is mind stuff. Only when the mind is still can we enter into peace. <br />The whole world is dominated by movement away from the present moment. Nothing is ever good enough. Tolle's book \\"The power of now\\", has helped me to understand that all our problems are created by a mind which refuses to acknowledge the present moment. Indeed, the very nature of the mind (as Tolle says) is in itself the problem.<br />I have been sunk in a depresion for years, nothing could get me out of it.  I have also suffered from obbsesive compulsive disorder, which is an anxiety problem charicterised by continual checking rituals and the need to control every moment.  We have to surrender to the moment and allow it to be, unfortunatly the ego like Tolle says does not like this and want to control every moment.<br />By simply looking at the trees and realising that they do not worry about time, has helped me to become more present as a person.    <br />\\"Loss of now is loss of being\\", so says Tolle, and I can apreciate his words.              <br />This book is wonderful, and I will read it many times. It offers a truth which transcends the mind, and in a practical way helps us to find the narrow road between past and future. This narrow road is the NOW, so simple, and yet so hard.
B00005JL9B|5.0|To say that the Japanese cinematic tradition is different from<BR>its Western counterpart would be the understatement of the year.<BR>Japanese cinema has never succumbed to the moralistic approach to<BR>moviemaking that permeates Hollywood. To further prove this<BR>point, enter \\"Battle Royale\\", surely the most controversial film<BR>in years. The story is as follows:<br />At the dawn of a new millennium, Japanese society is out of hand.<BR>Unemployment rates are at an all-time high; kids are skipping<BR>school and physically assaulting their teachers. This has led to<BR>the government introducing a new measure to keep kids in line -<BR>the Battle Royale Act. Every year, a ninth-grade class is chosen<BR>at random and transported to a deserted island, where they are<BR>equipped with \\"Wedlock\\"-style necklaces that can be made to<BR>explode, a map, a compass, food and water and a weapon. Their<BR>goal is to survive for three days on the island - while killing<BR>off all of their classmates. If, at the end of day three, more<BR>than one person is alive, they are all killed.<br />The hero of this movie is ninth-grader Shuya Nanahara, who swears<BR>that he will protect the girl he loves, Noriko, and somehow make<BR>sure they both survive. He is unwilling to kill but desperate not<BR>to die, an attitude not shared by all, as we are about to<BR>witness.<br />As they are equipped with various weapons, ranging from pot lids<BR>to machine guns, we observe how different their attitudes turn<BR>out to be, from Nanahara who is devastated when he thinks he<BR>accidentally killed another boy, to the machine-gun wielding kid<BR>who kills everyone in his path without remorse.<br />\\"Battle Royale\\" has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's \\"A<BR>Clockwork Orange\\". I would hesitate making that comparison,<BR>mostly because I'm not a huge fan of Kubrick's. While \\"A<BR>Clockwork Orange\\" is almost as disturbing in its violence as<BR>\\"Battle Royale\\", the latter is in my opinion the superior film.<BR>The sight of 15-year old kids dressed in school uniforms killing<BR>each other with crossbows, sickles, axes and machine-guns is much<BR>more disturbing than watching a bunch of freaks wearing false<BR>noses assaulting a helpless man. It is hard to put yourself in<BR>the position of Alex and his cronies in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\",<BR>simply because they are so strange. This is not the case with the<BR>kids in \\"Battle Royale\\".<br />The absence of flashy camerawork, slow motion and other cinematic<BR>tricks transforms the camera from a machine to a nihilistic<BR>outside observer. This is a trademark in Japanese cinema, and has<BR>been used in films as varied in style and context as Takeshi<BR>Kitano's \\"Violent Cop\\" and Norifumi Suzuki's \\"Star of David:<BR>Beautiful Girl Hunter\\". Not to mention that making a movie like<BR>this in the days of Columbine requires something that virtually<BR>all American film-makers lack: guts. That no American distributor<BR>dared import \\"Battle Royale\\" just goes to show how conformist the<BR>once individualistic American society really has become.<br />So is there nothing about this film that could be better? Well,<BR>yes. There are two things I feel should have been different.<BR>First of all the length of the film. At a mere 109 minutes, it is<BR>too short. I would have wanted another thirty minutes or so<BR>explaining the background, to get to know the kids better. We do<BR>get to know them through a few flashbacks, but I would have<BR>wanted more. Had this film started out as a typical American high-<BR>school film like \\"The Breakfast Club\\" or \\"American Pie\\" the<BR>violence would have been even more disturbing. Second of all,<BR>it's the violence itself. While I do not feel that violence is in<BR>itself important to a film, it does serve a purpose. My objection<BR>is not that there is too much violence, but that it is not<BR>graphic enough. When I see a kid getting shot I don't just want a<BR>squib going off (a squib is a small plastic bag or rubber balloon<BR>filled with fake blood, which is made to explode to give the<BR>impression of a gunshot wound), I want Dario Argento-style<BR>effects where you follow the bullet through the body, showing the<BR>effects of the gunshot in all their gory details. If that would<BR>be too flashy for this film, why not at least use the great<BR>Japanese tradition of special effects and make a film that makes<BR>your stomach turn?<br />Nevertheless, \\"Battle Royale\\" is an experience unlike any other,<BR>and if there was any kind of justice in the world this is the<BR>film that would win the Academy Award for best foreign film. We<BR>all know that it won't. This is a movie that dares question<BR>modern society and what it is doing to people, and that is the<BR>reason why it will never win an Oscar. It is not conformist<BR>enough. That is why I love it.<br />All I can say is: \\"Arigato, Kinji-san.\\"
1567184855|5.0|Whether you believe in &quot;reincarnation&quot; and &quot;life between life&quot; or not, this book is a treasure in understanding &amp; accepting your own personal spirituality and connection with the universe.  <br />Mostly written in a &quot;dialogue&quot; format (between Dr Newton and his clients) - but still containing some thoughtful analysis by Dr Newton, I found the book easy and entertaining to read.  No one can, or probably ever will, be able to &quot;absolutely&quot; prove or disprove the notion of life between life (i.e., in between our reincarnations, where are we?) - but this book certainly presents the information in a thoughtful, intelligent manner. <br />Through deep-trance hypnosis, Dr Newton claims to have tapped into the crucial state of being our souls experience in-between our incarnations on earth - i.e., the &quot;life between life&quot;.  Many of his clients had very similar things to say about this state, and I found it utterly fascinating to picture this place, this existence, in my own mind.<br />Honestly, I regard this book as spiritual food for thought.  While reading, and after, I found myself genuinely looking at myself, how I got here and what reasons might be behind my life.  Definitely a book to be read with an open mind, and whether in the end you believe the premise or not, it will still provoke a more rounded and expansive view of your own spirituality.  (Please note - the key words are &quot;open mind&quot;!)
B00005JKYS|2.0|I read the book by Hal Moore prior to seeing the movie.  In fact I read the book several times as I found it one of the best non-fiction accounts of war I have ever encountered.   This was an important work for the battles in the Ia Drang played a pivotal role in the formation of American military strategy through the '60s (not that anybody in upper command appeared to either understand or heed these lessons).<br />So how did the movie compare to the book, i.e. the truth?  Not terribly well in my opinion particularly in regards the battle.  There was no 'charge' led by Hal Moore routing the NVA on the last day of the battle.  Pure 'John Wayne' style fantasy that simply did not play very well.  In truth this Hollywood 'addition' was completely unnecessary as there were plenty of 'real' heroes without any vainglorious nonsense.  Every man who served during in that battle was in truth a 'hero'.<br />The strong part of the movie?  The depiction of the families who lost husbands, brothers and sons.  The emotional carnage was a true reflection on the cost of empire that all of us need to understand, particularly in these grim times.  The 'view' from the NVA side was interesting and added a dimension to the film that usually isn't present.<br />I'm glad that a motion picture was made from Hal Moore's book.  General Moore was by all accounts a tremendous soldier and a man of true character.  I encourage people who enjoyed the movie to take the time to read the book by General Moore, \\"We were soldiers once, and young\\".   A moving work written by a talented man that goes a long way towards dispelling some of the many myths surrounding the Vietnam War.
B000007UFO|5.0|This is the one MUST OWN simple minds CD. The music is dreamy and lush... containing many more layers than most of the other synth bands of the era. King is White is simply a masterpiece! Big Sleep, Someone Somewhere and New Gold Dream are all tops.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Yes, Tomb Raider has a bad plot, terrible dialogue and a lack of consistency. Given the major actors it makes it all the worse  given their acting ability.<BR>Two things make it watchable:<BR>1)Mr Brittas/Rimmer (for those of you in the UK) turns in a marvellous performance as a younger butler. That sequence when he fastidiously dons his dressing gown and slippers with a shotgun is marvellous<BR>2)The action. Let's face it, knocking out a bad guy with a front wheelie on a powerful motorbike whilst wearing silk pyjamas is what Lara Croft is all about.<BR>It is patently obvious that the film makers have crammed as much of the games into the film as possible. There's the Ankor Wat, the Antartic, the Egyptian setting, mystery, time and space and plenty of Lara. To be honest the only thing that didn't amuse was the token 'father' sections with Ms Jolie's real counterpart and the 'hmm, how do we end this - let's have a silly ending' bit.<BR>OK, forget the plot, play the games, see the film and watch it for what it really is. Lara Croft in all her action-toting glory providing an enjoyable two hours of nonsense.
B00005YT8U|4.0|The miracle of the Chieftains is not just that they have collaborated with so many popular musicians to bring Irish music where it might not otherwise have gone, but that they have been doing it for forty years -- a feat seldom equalled in any music genre.  _The Wide World Over_ is a wonderful retrospective of this work, featuring collaborations with artists ranging from Joni Mitchell to the Chinese National Ensemble, as well as several new recordings.  The album is also a fine tribute to Paddy Maloney's skill as a composer and arranger.  In recent years a great many Celtic groups have explored the fusion of traditional music and tunes with &quot;popular&quot; genres, but Paddy Maloney was one of the first to do so, and remains one of the best and most effective arrangers in this area.<br />_The Wide World Over_ draws heavily from the Chieftains' work of the past ten years, and features more collaborations than it does traditional and traditionally arranged tunes and songs.  As such, it may not appeal to Celtic music purists.  This is not a CD that is going to stun the listener with the virtuosity of the players, an element that has come more and more to the forefront of the genre in recent years.  In fact, in many of the tracks the band takes a back seat to the guest artist.  What is conveyed, though, is a real joy in the music and an understanding that Celtic music is a living and changing tradition with relevance and parallels in many different global cultures.  Good music is good music, no matter where it comes from or who plays it.<br />You may not want to purchase this CD if you already own the entire Chieftains catalogue.  However, if you don't and you want to add just one of their CDs to your collection, _The Wide World Over_ would be a good choice.
B00003CXXP|1.0|After reading many positive reviews of AI from presumably legitimate sources including The Washington Post and Entertainment Weekly...I will say that the special effects and acting in this movie are excellent, but they are woefully unable to save the movie from its horrifically arrogant and boring plotline, and Spielberg's blatant attempt at emotional manipulation. Spielberg continually underestimates his audience's ability to understand the plot and to experience emotion based on a suggestion. For example, William Hurt's character is given exceptional lengthy, monotonous speeches in a demeaning attempt to \\"explain\\" to the audience what is happening. As for the movie's arrogance, it ends with the sentiment that humans are this wonderful, admirable, perfect species, even though most of the humans portrayed in the film are selfish, unforgiving creatures incapable of love or understanding...
B000000OQ5|5.0|I was about 17 when this first came out and I can still remember how dynamic I thought it sounded at the time. The thing is, it still sounds that way to me. The worst thing to do would be to mistake this album with other superficial hair bands that were churning out hackneyed material in the late 80's and early 90's (i.e. Warrant, Winger, Skid Row, Poison, Cinderella, etc).  Having said that, overly deep, thoughtful lyrics are not in abundance here (\\"Modern Day Cowboy\\" is an exception). By the same token, stupid lyrics are absent as well.  What we're left with is good rock and roll and a great album to crank at parties (I know I did).<br />\\"EZ Come EZ Go\\" is a terrific song to begin the album and is followed by the smokin' \\"Cumin Atcha Live\\". Overall, it's one great tune after another including \\"Gettin' Better\\", \\"2 Late 4 Love\\" and \\"Rock Me to the Top\\". Side two (imagine for a moment that it's an old cassette) has three of the strongest tracks on the album in \\"Modern Day Cowboy\\", \\"Changes\\" and \\"Little Suzi\\". CRANK IT!  \\"We're No Good Together\\" and \\"Before My Eyes\\" may be two of the weaker songs here, but even they aren't bad.<br />Nothing that Tesla ever did after this one really did anything for me with the exception of a handful of songs on their second album, The Great Radio Controversy. Other than that it was all down hill as far as I'm concerned. I mean, do we really need a song attacking Thomas Edison? By the time \\"Edison's Medicine\\" was hitting the airwaves they were a mere shadow of their former selves. This is their first and best album. Ignore the others and turn this one up until the knob breaks off.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|For starters, Phil Colins is for people growing up in the 1980's and as 'RICK' has demonstrated that he was not the intended listener. I had never owned a Phil Collins music title (that's including tape &amp; LP), nor have I after. But the collection is excellent, as for someone that only listen to his songs on the radio. I for almost a year and a half since 1999 I palyed it countlessly and after I got sick of the sequence, I started using the 'random' track play on the CD player to compromise myself, mind you, I also have a huge collection of CD like, Sting, The Corrs, Mariah Carey, etc. But this seems to be the best collection I have owned, the next best is Bon Jovi - Crossroads, the worst is Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This movie has many themes; a child's love, the future of mankind, and the power of dreams. What really bothers me is the number of bad reviews here...either we have become totally dumbed down as a society or we are so used to seeing bad films that we can't even recognize when a good one comes out. Also, the fact that many want a more 'satisfactory' ending is ridiculous! It was the journey, not the ending, that made this a great film. The combination of Kubrick's darkness and Spielberg's fantasies is also unique and intriguing.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I first saw this movie in the theatre I was blown away.  Watching it is like going on a fantastic ride at Disneyland.  The look and feel of the picture is like nothing you have ever seen.  It's so ahead of its time.  I don't know if it can even be truly appreciated for the masterpiece it is right now.  I promise, in half a century it will be comparable to The Wizard of Oz.

0446608955|5.0|I read this book with no expectations--I had seen the previews for the movie, and I always have to read the book before seeing the movie, so I bought the book. Once I got into it though, I couldn't put it down. The writing is simple, but the messages it conveys stay with you long after you put the book down. Landon, the narrator, has a character that i would hope every guy has a little bit of inside. We can admire him, but we can also relate to him. And everyone has seen a Jamie, the innocent, supereligious girl who must have a really personality hidden deep inside. I would recommend A Walk to Remember to anyone looking for a book to help them appreciate the real value of life.
0783221487|4.0|David Lynch's &quot;Dune&quot; has held up extremely well over the years, far better than I ever would have expected.<br />Part of the reason, I think, is the choice of directors.  Frank Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; is one of those unfilmable novels (in fact, it makes &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; look like child's play), and David Lynch manages to capture at least the bare essentials of the novel -- the sense of pessimism, dark urgency, and atmospherics.  The latter is a sorely-missed quality, and &quot;Dune the Movie&quot; holds up very well compared to the post-movie theatrical wasteland of the early 21st century, and such films as &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Star Wars Episode 1&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine.&quot;<br />Viewers would be well-advised to try and read the book first -- again, like &quot;LOTR,&quot; some background is almost a necessity before attempting the film.  The story is just too complex to translate well to the big screen, so if you haven't read the book then you might find yourself simply relaxing and soaking up the (very well done) atmosphere and the visuals.<br />I'm very thankful that this film wasn't made sometime in the past five years.  It would be painful to see Frank Herbert's genius placed on the chopping block of some money-grubbing producer and made into (yet another) CGI-based carnival freakshow.  Enjoy this film for what it is, a &quot;true&quot; re-imagining of the novel &quot;Dune&quot; as seen by David Lynch's somewhat twisted imagination.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of my two all-time favorite films.  It is truely a masterpiece and deserves every award it recieved.  It is about suburbia and peoples lives, one imperticular (Kevin Spacey) who is unhappy with his life all together and is looking for something more.  First time director Sam Mendes shows sheer genuis with his fantastic direction, Kevin Spacey gives the preformance of a lifetime, and Annette Bening, who completely deserved the Best Actress Oscar of 1999 but did not get it, is spectacular.  She is my favorite Actress of all time and Spacey is my favorite actor.  This is a must see film.  It touched me in a way that is very hard to describe and I hope it will do the same to you.
0385501560|2.0|like many people i was drawn to choke by the entertaining movie fight club; also the ... blurb on the back cover comparing palahniuk to don delillo caught my eye....  anyhow, i'm not going rant and detail ...; i just want to  provide an antidote to all those incredibly glowing but naive reviews (\\"Palahniuk is an AMAZING writer\\"; \\"Choke is worth the time and trouble\\") above and below this negative one, to tell you that Palahniuk is a pretty terrible writer by almost any measure and this slim novel is about as hollow as the Strokes' Is This It CD (and about as fashionable too). <br />i suppose that reading choke can make you think the book is dark, fresh and modern; you wouldn't be wrong if you're not conversant with much contemporary fiction. however, what feels fresh is actually careless, especially in its barely-fleshed characters and really really bad dialogue. i snickered many times.<br />what seems to matter to Palahniuk are scenarios (sex in airplanes! fight clubs!), not ideas (...Delillo's White Noise) or vision (... William Vollmann's The Atlas) or even straight ahead narrative (Kavalier & Clay??). After awhile his scenarios stop being funny because you realize that you aren't being taken anywhere but just looping endlessly from the stupid to the pointless. bottom line is that this is a very amateur-ish novel that actually feels like it was hastily written over a weekend because the manuscript was due on monday. consider your self warned.
B00004RJ74|4.0|...Other than that, \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" is a very enjoyable movie. I really could not care less about all the vampire stuff; the Gecko Brothers on the run was a very cool concept in itself. For all Salma Hayek fans, this movie is a must-see since it features this lovely lady dancing around in bikinis with a huge python around her neck. Regarding DVD's extras, this collector's series will surely not let you down. Apart from the usual theatrical trailers, TV spots, music videos, and outtakes; Disc 1 also features a 90 mins. full length feature about the movie called \\"Full Tilt Boogie\\".<br />In a few words; if you love action or outlaws or vampires or hot chicks or blood and gore or a mixture of all these factors; you jus can't go wrong with this movie!
0140288503|5.0|I read a fair amount of historical non-fiction and was taught throughout high school to think critically when reading.  Check sources, check author's tone, point of the writing, points of view being used, context, and so forth.  Apparently Mark Bowden, the author, comes from the same school of thought.  He writes a  thorough and genuine account of a sadly-ignored incident in US history.<br />I can recall the newspaper accounts of the time, wondering what we were doing there and why, after taking such incredible beatings, we were leaving.  Rather than do the research to find out why, Mr. Bowden has compiled this book, which rightfully deserves its place on any historian's bookshelf.<br />Bowden's accounting of the events and context are flawless.  His research is uncommonly thorough, and given the opportunity to write the first really comprehensive accounting of the events, he makes the most of it.  His attention to detail, his recreation of the timeline, and his notes are worthy of emulation by future students of history.<br />All that is nothing without good writing, and Bowden keeps a reader locked into the story.  As hard as some of it is to read because of the imagery and concomitant emotional responses, Bowden leads you through the battles at ground level, at eye level from helicopter platforms, at screen level from command centers.  At the end of the book one wonders how you survive the reading; how much worse to have been there in it?  I was exhausted mentally, and therein lies the demanding aspect of the book.<br />So much goes on, so many players become involved, that a cheet sheet and glossary of some terms would've helped immensely.  Even a cast of characters would've been of some utility, but eventually, I just bore down and focused.  Some questions were answered in the notes, others reveal their answers upon later reflection.<br />In all, I daresay adding my review to the nearly 400 others won't make someone any more inclined to buy a 5-star book if they've ignored the other 399 reviewers, but this is my review and I'm sticking to it.y've ignored the other 399 reviewers, but this is my review and I'm sticking to it.
0792839218|3.0|Okay, that was a joke,  'Hot, hot...&quot; is a line from the movie...But he was quite dashing.  C'mon! That's why I bought it!  Otherwise,  this super-creepy film doesn't really merit a second glance.  Once is enough.  Marsha Mason plays frazzled again- and she is good at it.  Tony Hopkins makes a nice father figure.  (But then you see glimpses of Hannibal coming through). This is a film best given to the local psychic  for seance material, or as a Halloween Party Door Prize.  Or just watch it for fun.  I did say it was Creepy...
B00005B36H|5.0|I couldn't possibly add meaningful new information about this release to anyone perusing it casually for some indication over its worth.  Tool is a cerebral, immensely talented group of musicians who seem equally capable of producing fresh, incisive commentary on society as they are impenetrable meanderings of lyrical morass and musical indulgence.<br />I happen to like the new album, and found it was a hard disc to appreciate on one listen; perhaps that signals growth on my parts and the band.  This isn't Opiate, but Opiate was raw and obvious in comparison to Sober, which in comparison to Ænima... you get the idea?  No?<br />Pretend Tool is a light.  Opiate is the first filter.  Sober is the second.  Ænima is the third.  Lateralus is the fourth.  Can you still see the light?  Is it even light that you see, or sense another way?<br />If this makes sense to you now, you're one up on me.
0375413405|5.0|I am so glad I went ahead and purchased this commerative edition of a classic I've neglected to add to my growing collection.<br />What I gained from the beginning was the story of Julia's start in French cuisine while in Paris with her diplomatic husband.  Her blossoming association with this classic cuisine and her eventual copatriots of bringing this cuisine to the world (Bertholee and Beck and Chef Bugnard) was a treat to read.  Growing admiration for Julia, where she's been and what she is all about.  A true blessing to the field!  The break into the publishing world of Knopf is delightful!<br />Masterful intro to the techniques and puchase and prep of ingredients and their adaptation to modern kitchens is well done.  Even supermarket shopping is included.  Secrets and options and illustrative helps permeate its pages as does sumptuous recipe collection.<br />I am into such as\\" Escalopes de Veau a' l'Estragon (sauteed veal scallops with brown tarragon sauce) and those heavenly Cassoulets! Who does them better than the French?  Another rich, easy to do dish that will knock out guests is \\"Poulet au Porto (Roast Chicken Steeped with Port Wine, Cream and Mushrooms).  For cleanup, tarts are so French, and the collection here is tempting.<br />This will prove to be a turn-to resource for continual guidance and inspiration.
6305558167|5.0|This movie has always fascinated me. It deals with wizards, magic, betrayal, loyalty, deceit, incest, love &amp; lostsa deaths.<BR>The scenery and costumes and the knights of the round table and their quest for the holy grail takes you into the middle ages like no other movie, that I have seen, takes you.<BR>It is truly a wonderfully made movie and the story is so intriguing.

B000001F9E|5.0|1976 was a hot summer in England, and I was only 12 years old, this Thin Lizzy vintage would'nt  reach my ears for another five years. <BR>And then WOW<BR>I won't bore you with a tedious track by track breakdown, every one is a classic, the band at its peak on tour, on fire, the duelling lead guitars of messrs Robertson and Gorham are really so exciting, laid on the intricate (and much underrated bass playing of Mr Lynott). <BR>So I guess I should buy this on CD, I still have the magnificent Gatefold LP, up in my parents attic, it would be worth something but its worn out, really.<br />&quot;ah nostalgia's not what it used to be.....................&quot;
B00005LC1H|5.0|No matter how many times I watch Fawlty Towers I can't help but laugh out loud. There is nothing funnier to me than good sarcastic, physical humor. There aren't many people that do it better than John Cleese. It's not only great having these episodes on DVD now, but this collection includes interviews and other info that makes it even more fun to watch. Finding out that Basil Fawlty is based on a real person just blew me away. What can be funnier than a hotel owner that doesn't like dealing with people. I've shown Fawlty Towers to various people, and so far, every one of them has become a fan. It's a shame they didn't make more episodes. If you don't find Fawlty Towers funny, you need to see your doctor about having your funny bone replaced.
B000001E18|3.0|This is U2's biggest disappointment for me. I was so hyped about getting Zooropa. Which is basically U2 trying to cling onto Achtung's success with all it's might. Somehow though it just couldn't do it. <br />Zooropa isn't a bad album, but it's not great. It's good though. And it has some great ideas on it. But among U2 albums it stands as one of their worst. I haven't heard October so I may have been spared their actual worst. The title cut from this album is much like &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; in its intro. And the song gets really cool with some great guitar work by the Edge. &quot;Lemon&quot; is the best song on the album that starts very well and has some great bass playing by Adam. Listen to it, this has got to be some of the best bass playing I have heard by Mr. Clayton. &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car&quot; is a good song that has some great elements in it. &quot;The First Time&quot; is a ballad much like &quot;One&quot; in some sense. But it's not quite as powerful. &quot;The Wanderer&quot; is a nice addition to this and has Johnny Cash along to sing. He's got a great voice. The rest of the songs on this album are fair if not downright just plain bad. Among the fair are &quot;Babyface&quot;, &quot;Stay(Faraway, So Close)&quot;, and &quot;Dirty Day&quot;. The bad are &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Some Days are Better than Others&quot; these songs just are plain annoying and worth skipping. <br />If you like U2 this album you will like. Otherwise don't expect much from this album. Still a solid product, but nowhere near this band's potenial.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Another one of the countless adaptations of Bram Stokers Book. However, one of the older ones and one of the best ones. Filmed in eerie and stylish pictures, you will find great Bela Lugosi portraying one of the smoothest counts in vampire-film history. Even as his greatest menace seems to be coming from his eyes staring sinister and shining like beacons out of his slightly dimmed face...
B000001FS3|5.0|U2's first and best known opus is grand and wonderful, but I still cling to the band's Achtung Baby more. That doesn't take anything away from this album. This is still one of the best albums and the best of the 80's by far. <br />Joshua Tree starts off with &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; which is the start of the opus. A grand song, and a beautiful beginning. Then comes my favorite song from this album &quot;I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For&quot; which is a wonderful song that starts off with some great percussion elements. &quot;With or Without You&quot; is a great song as well. And it stands the test of time. &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; is a great political song for the era and stands alongside &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; as one of U2's biggest political statements. &quot;In God's Country&quot; is a wonderful song that expands the opus that was left off at Bullet. Then comes &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; two great songs that continue the opus. Before coming to a very satisfying closing &quot;Mothers of the Disappeared&quot; The only problem and reason why I name this No. 2 of U2's albums is the lackluster songs: &quot;Running to Stand Still&quot;, &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;, and &quot;Trip Through Your Wires&quot;. All three of these don't stand a candle to all of the Achtung songs. But the other songs do make this album worthwile and a worthy addition to any album collection.<br />Buy your copy today!
B000003TB6|5.0|This group has always kept hip-hop lovers happy when they come out. I just bought this album because I strongly believe in paying respect and acknowledgement to hard working hip-hop acts... Go buy it....
B000001EAQ|4.0|This album is great, and is almost the epic it tries so hard to be. It's a colossal album that U2 tries. It's missing some passion I think. And that's where this album fails. It's a treat still.<br />\\"Discotheque\\" isn't the grand start you would hope for, but's it a good song. \\"Mofo\\" is a very good rocking song. They started off the their show in Dallas with this number. And it probably should have started the album off. At least I think it should have. \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" was my favorite song off this album, and it's still a great song. A little depressing, but's it's a nice song. \\"Staring at the Sun\\" is the hit from this album and is a lot like Achtung's style. It's got a nice feel to it. \\"Last Night on Earth\\" is another rocking song that just gets your blood flowing. \\"Gone\\" is another good song. \\"Please\\" is my favorite song on this album and one of the most intricate songs the band has ever written. Some great bass guitar parts here as well and a killer guitar part by the Edge. What a song. \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" is a good song, though I'm not much on the lyrics. Jesus is not dead, he's alive. Bono is a Christian and should know that. But let's not go into that to much. I can't stand the song \\"Miami\\" and despise \\"The Playboy Mansion\\" almost as much. The rest of the songs are great filler songs. But they are just filler songs. This is a great U2 album nonetheless.<br />If you don't own a copy of the most underated U2 album get it today.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I'm not sure just how long this movie was even though I looked at my watch about 40 times during the film.  The story didn't seem to go anywhere or interest me at all.  It seems as though there are large sections of the move where the characters forget about the plot (you have to kind of come up with one for them) and just wander around aimlessly.  You could have told the same story in a 21 minute tv show, but instead you end up with loooong drawn out scenes that go nowhere and do not contribute to the story whatsoever.  In short:<br />Harry is an abused little boy that gets trust into the magical drivers seat.  He goes to magician's school.  He is the chosen one (who cares?) but doesn't seem to do anything that proves this.  There is a stone that they need to save from some evil guy, but they stray down long boring sequences that only seem to prove that the famed Harry can't do magic after all and always relys on his friends that do to bail him out.  They drive the chosen one thing into your head a few more times, then Harry saves the day without realy doing anything....
0897500482|5.0|I had the opportunity to see Bruce Lee in action at an East Coast karate tournament in 1969. He wasn't competing but was there as a celebrity guest.<br /><br />I stood with others at the back of the tournament hall and listened in awe as he talked about having just finished filming Marlow and his plans to leave soon for Hong Kong to begin filming a movie.<br /><br />Later, I watched him warm-up a great tournament fighter named Luis Delgado. Lee's speed was absolutely incredible. His backfist was nearly imperceptible and his footwork for closing the gap was a blur.<br /><br />What a loss to the martial arts world that he left us so soon. But we still have this book of his notes. It a wonderful bible, if you will, that will make any martial artist look at his own training to see how some of Lee's ideas can fit.<br /><br />There will always be the Jackie Chans and Jet Lis who will come along and dazzle us with their screen antics. But Bruce Lee was a seeker of knowledge, a true master of the fighting arts and philosophy. Some of it is in this wonderful book.<br /><br />As an author of 19 books on the martial arts, I highly recommend this book for every MA library.
0395071224|5.0|It is well documented that J.R.R. Tolkien despised allegory. Yet \\"The Hobbit\\" contains one of the greatest allegorical phrases ever: \\"the unexpected party.\\" Yes, life is a journey, a quest if you will--but it is also (when lived to the full) an unexpected party. And so it is that Bilbo Baggins is spurred on to leave his warm Hobbit hole to go on one of the most exciting and entertaining journeys in all of literature. <br />Tolkien never thought this book would even be successful, much less attain its almost mythic status. In part, he was trying to write a story for children (and it is problematic even in this respect). No one however, can deny what a strange, original creation it is.<br />The story takes place in a fully formed world (Middle Earth) of Tolkien's own imagining. It rings with the sound of ancient music and poetry. The elves, the dwarves, and men have all kinds of history behind them to give them depth. Only after finishing the Hobbit did Tolkien envision the importance of the Ring. <br />What \\"The Hobbit\\" is--more than just being a prelude to the tale of the One Ring--is a great adventure story. An ancient people goes seeking to reclaim its home, a Hobbit discovers that he has more in him than even he ever expected, a people are freed from darkness at great cost, and something is found that was lost...all under the supervision of a mysterious wizard.<br />This is a tale of good's triumph over many evils. A story about a seemingly forgettable little creature and his impact upon great events--a realization that: \\"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\\"<br />I give \\"The Hobbit\\" my highest recommendation.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I'd only heard a few songs from Pj Harvey before but I bought this one and I totally was beyond impressed. This is a great cd that hasn't left my cd player. It's definately an album that you can listen to the whole way through. <br />\\"One Line\\" and \\"This Mess We're in\\", with Thom Yorke, are lovely, almost haunting. \\"You Said Something\\" is a great song as well. Then with \\"The Whores Hustle and The Hustlers Whore\\" and \\"This is Love\\" added in for good measure with the electrifying guitars and great lyrics.<br />This album is a must-have and Pj Harvey is hugely talented.
6305508550|4.0|This is a pretty funny film. There are some really good scenes.<br />The story is about a high tech company that has become top heavy with employees over the years. The head of the company hires a consulting firm to come in and review/fire the dead wood.<br />Our hero become accidentally hypnotized into thinking that he needs to start doing things that are important to him, not the company.<br />Anyway, he starts going (or not going) to work when ever he feels like it. He dresses anyway he likes. He does whatever he wants. The rest of the employees think he is crazy. The consultants think he is under motivated. They reccommend that he be promated.<br />The things he and his friends get into are hilarious. The office is non stop cubicles....<br />Jennifer is an added bonus to this film. Not a big part, but she in it often enough to be considered on of the four main characters.<br />Good flick.
B00005A46T|5.0|One of the only complaints that I had with Slipknot's first release was the poor mixing.  It had a fresh take on some old metal routines...However, I was always wishing that it had a stronger punch, technical wise, which could have only been done with a bit more money and experience behind the board.<br />Well, I got my wish with this disc.  Jesus, man...EVERY song is really well written, but the sound on this disc is what really stands out.  I thought that the chaotic feel that Slipknot has was a \\"good thing\\", but they've really mastered it this time.  I really love how the whole project sounds like its just about to go spinning out of control, yet it never does.  The guitars are heavy, but not blah.  The drums (all three percussionists) are right on with each other without sounding like a bunch of samples, which really makes for a good full sound.<br />If you like the first release you will WORSHIP this one.  I didn't think they'd return with anything harder, but they have.
B0000508U6|5.0|This CD is great!  I can't play it enough.  There is a great deal of influence from The Beetles in many of their songs.  I have not found one song on here that I want to skip past, and that is saying a lot considering the way I listen to music.  Their music has a very distinct modern edge that I have not found in any other bands.  My hats of to Coldplay.  I can't wait for them to come out with more.
B00005QIPH|2.0|The Strokes are all hype and style with no substance.  It certainly helps when each of the members of the group have the advantage of an instant cash machine to feed the public relations machine thereby building the hype.  The critical acclaim heaped on the this group is not warranted. The songs are weak and limp.  None of the songs exude any passion, emotion or feeling. Don't buy into the hype.  Do not buy this disc until you have heard it in its entirety first.  Do not buy it based on its critical reviews.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn has quite simply made one of the greatest cd's that I have ever heard in my life. Every song that is on this album is amazing. As far as all the stuff about Lauryn being a racist I guess some people will believe anything that they hear. Think of the Cd though she poured her heart and soul into this album and for people to say that she wasted time is horrible. All the artists in the genre that people put Lauryn in are so similar and Lauryn came out and made a cd that people can listen to and it might even bring out some emotions in them&gt; She tells of how she was told that she should have an abortion on the song &quot;To Zion&quot; yet she made the decision to have her child. How many other artist would say this on their records.
B00004RD54|5.0|If you haven't heard Lou Reed before then make haste and buy this CD!!! This is the best live album and one of Reed's best albums ever. <br />'Intro/Sweet Jane' is truly a classic.

B00005JL9B|5.0|This film is wonderfully dark, yet faithfully portrays the various characters (all with unique motivations) as scared and desperate youths fighting for their very lives.  The premise is unique and it is well executed. The film isn't a \\"gore-fest\\". but rather could be seen as the loss of innocence in the most extreme circumstance. <BR>If you have the opportunity to see this film, either by VCD, bootleg DVD or on screen at a Horror Festival, go!  You will not be disappointed.  You will find yourself frustrated that it is not available on DVD for Region 1.  It is one of those underground classics that every good movie collection should have.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|i didn't really expect much from this one to begin with but it was worse than i expected.the whole plot was stupid(an incompatant model brainwashed to kill a world leader)i expected it to be a little weird but they to the whole model thing to far.i guess that was there idea from the begining,but it didnt work it was just to over the top.<br />  however their were some funny parts in the movie they were to few and far between.if you seen mystery men and kinda liked it you make find this a little entertaining,but if you didn't like mystery men then you will probbaly hate this one.<br /> I really like Ben Stiller and i think he's got alot of talent but he needs to slowdown with the weird themes for his movies.he movies.rent it (maybe)
B00005YW4H|5.0|Discovering that Norah Jones is in fact the real-life daughter of Indian classical maestro Ravi Shankar was what initially got me interested in her music. As an active Anoushka Shankar fan (for those of you who don't know yet, shes Norah Jones' sister, and is an Indian classical recording artist) I expected something similar from Norah. I must say though, that despite her heavily Indian classical background, Norah has chosen to take on tracks steeped in Western Jazz influences, and pulls it off with remarkable ease.<br />It pays to know a little about Norah Jones before listening to her music. I hear the term 'Billy Holiday' being loosely thrown around when people review her music, but Norah Jones has, with great subtlety, used her classical background to create a record that betrays any trace of Eastern influences. Being as she is the offspring of an Indian father and a Southern mother, Norah's Texan upbringing is evident throughout the record. However, even though this is her debut album, she has been making music for a while (if you can find her rare 'First Sessions' EP from 2000, you should get it) and it shows. This is no wary first album, nor is it a pretentious and I'm-a-star-because-my-dad-is-one type recording. In fact, Norah's press releases strain to avoid mentioning her father's name and to promote her as an artist all her own.<br />I first heard Norah over the Internet, purely by chance, and I was instantly reminded of Carole King, and particularly of two seemingly different albums - Sinead O'Connor's 'Am I Not your Girl?', and Gloria Estefan's 'Mi Tierra'. The comparison may not be evident immediately, but if you've listened to these two albums you may know exactly what to expect. I do agree with reviewers who say that her voice is 'smokey' but its also 'rustic' and 'full-bodied'.<br />The album itself is a revelation in terms. For one, it is being released at discount price to begin with (even though it is a full length 14 track LP), a strategy that could or could not pay off, especially considering what little promotion Norah has been given thus far. Secondly, its been a long while since we've had true talent cover the great blues classics and add their own original material and input. While there are occassional instances when an artist treats a cover with respect (such as Fiona Apple's version of The Beatles' 'Across the Universe'), its not every artist that has the raw talent and energy to grasp the attention of an audience that has grown weary of the vapid material world in general. In Norah Jones, we find that promise.<br />Critics may argue that the two best songs here themselves are the covers that Norah has chosen. One is Hank William's torch song 'Cold Cold Heart'. The other, which has on numerous occassions been called the album's finest track, is her cover of John D. Loudermilk's \\"Turn Me On\\". Granted that these lyrics aren't exactly poetic or steeped in the mythical streams of conciousness that emanate from both her father and sister's body of work, but in a woodsy, plain way, Norah scores with simplicity with her voice, much the same way that her sibling scores with the simplicity of her instrumentation.<br />What I like about Norah Jones is her reserve and the ability to refrain from milking a tear-jerker ballad for all its' worth. This is not a diva in training, and we should all be so lucky. Perhaps its Miss Shankar's Eastern heritage that lends her that special mystique, but whatever it is, shes got a great first album out, and its one that we should all be listening to.<br />I wanted to jot down the names of a few specific albums that I felt 'Come away with me' had much in common with, in terms of spirit and ambience. In addition to the two albums I had mentioned before, it also carries the essence sported by Susheela Raman's stunning album 'Salt Rain', and by Vanessa Paradis' 2000 album 'Bliss'. Norah Jones' debut is one that fits in more with the Real World catalog - I'd be excited if she could do some collaborative work with Afro Celt Sound System or Sam Mills.<br />All in all, a splendid effort. If you're a fan of New Age and world music, and even if you haven't been a fan of bluegrass or Jazz, this is one album that could possibly open up new areas of musical interests for you. If only for just that reason, you should definitely get this. Highly recommended.could do some collaborative work with Afro Celt Sound System or Sam Mills.<br />All in all, a splendid effort.

6304712936|5.0|Indeed Wing J. Flanagan, reviewer from Orlando, Florida is right on.  My 5 stars are for the film [a new DVD is yet to come!] Amadeus is, in my view, the perfect motion picture.  It has never been surpassed.  Once one considers all aspects of filmmaking, Amadeus is clearly one of the finest films ever produced, perhaps THE finest.  It's hard to believe a crew similar to the one that created Amadeus also created the horrible English Patient.  Go figure...I can't.  Nonetheless, Mix Magazine just did an article on the sound mix of the NEW release of this film, which was supposedly coming out in February, with 22 new scenes and a total digital remix and remastering on DVD.  Where are you Amazon?  I can't find it anywhere, so I'm waiting.  It's also due a theatrical re-release.  Perhaps we'll see some trailers in a day or so.
B000003TAW|5.0|Even though I'm not a die hard Weezer fan, this album is just too good to deny. Weezer is truly original and their ability for such melodic and catchy songs is what makes them so great. And its hard to believe how clever the lyrics are. (Come on- \\"If you want to destroy my sweater/hold this thread as I walk away\\"!? So great...) <br />'Say it ain't So', 'Buddy Holly, and 'Only in Dreams' really stand out for me. I remember hearing these songs way back in '94/'95 and they've really stayed with me because when I picked it back up I found I remembered every word and every chord of the guitars. I love it when albums are like that. I think its a true sign of greatness.

B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is best represented on this DVD.  With superb sound and picture not to mention the awesome comedic talents Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, and Eric Idle.
B00000K3G8|5.0|This 1984 concert journal by the Talking Heads--in my opinion the most unique and inventive new wave band of all time--has long been hailed for its originality and poignancy, but has never quite received the appreciation it deserves. But perhaps this very worthwhile re-issue of &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; will persuade critics to give it another look.<br />But as for the classic original in 1984, if the Talking Heads' critics didn't fully know what they were about before, they sure knew it when they were graced with &quot;Stop Making Sense.&quot; The glorious result of the band's tour for their previous studio set &quot;Speaking in Tongues,&quot; &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; was the soundtrack to the Talking Heads' concert film/documentary, directed by Jonathan Demme.<br />This will sound cliched and naive, but I think that &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;--aside from being a marvelous concert film--boasts some of the purest live recordings ever. Instead of gritty and inaudible music, barely noticable compared to the hooping and hollering of the audience, the Talking Heads and their guest musicians execute a power and a graceful and delicate force. The performances of their studio gems hold completely different and interesting arrangements, both vocally and musically, giving each song a new dimension and flexibility (as if they did not have them before). But overall, the product is listenable, with no drawn out improvisations to make up for a lack of material--each note is worked to perfection. &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; proves to anyone the unique and brilliant world of the Talking Heads, and is a perfect accompanyment to an equally striking film.<br />This re-issue is worth the wait. The extra tracks are well chosen and well balanced, while still appreciating the original product. In fact, I recommend the &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; re-issue as opposed to the original. Not to sound like a greedy salesman, but you'll definitely get the best for your buck.

B00000ING2|5.0|Very enjoyable, fun movie to watch. Once again Tim Robbins is<br />brillant and adorable as he is in all his films. Paul Newman and<br />Jennifer Jason Leigh are not too shabby either. Overall just a<br />nice clean film with a catchy soundtrack and a classic movie charm which is becoming increasing harder to fine:)<br />P.S. Check out Tim doing the Muncie fight song from college--it is so cute:)
B000063TNH|1.0|One of the few movies I ever walked out on (I eventually sat through it on the insistence of trusted friends), this film is somewhat polarizing.  I found it to be trite, vapid, predictable, and nausiating with its jerky let's-cash-in-on-the-indy-craze handheld camerawork.<br />If you loved this movie, I am happy for you that the greatest people producing DVDs is making it for you.  But PLEASE rent it first or you may be one of the 10-20% of viewers who felt like they had just seen the wrong movie.<br />(If it helps, my judgement is that THE LIMEY is the only good film Soderberg has made, and I would give it about 3-1/2 stars).
0066620996|5.0|In his richly illustrated Good To Great, the prequel of infamous Built To Last, Jim Collins debunks several myths about how to turn a good (publicly traded) company into a great one. Leaders of great companies are rather humble than flamboyant. Furthermore, these leaders are persistent, disciplined, results-oriented, and entrepreneurial, debunking the myth that they and their companies usually achieve success through luck or sudden breakthroughs. In addition, leaders of great companies first hire and promote disciplined people in thought and action to focus on what be done to succeed. At the same time, they get rid of those who do not fit the bill. Leaders of great companies and their team also pursue their target market with passion, keeping a constant eye on the relevant drivers of their business. They are deeply convinced that they will ultimately prevail. Leaders of great companies and their team indeed act on the brutal facts they are facing with realism and steely determination. They see technology as an accelerator to reach their BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) and not as their creator. Finally, leaders of great companies and their team know how to manage the short-term expectations of Wall Street without losing sight of their long-term goals. Unfortunately, unlike Gerard J. Tellis and Peter N. Golder in Will and Vision, Collins does not emphasize enough the importance of financial commitment and asset leverage for a good company to become and remain a great company. Hopefully, Collins will explore those topics in greater detail in the second edition of Good To Great.
6305622930|5.0|Fans of this film will love the DVD.  It has an extra DVD with a behind the scenes documentary, timelines, music score, etc.  The quality of the film is top-notch.  This movie remains the greatest military bio-pic of all time, and a must for WWII fans.
B00003CXXR|1.0|I'm sorry, but I cannot believe that the average rating for this film is so high. It is a completely awful film. Firstly, it's very very predictable which is enough reason to avoid it anyway. Secondly, what the XXXX is a Spinosaurus? It's a dreadful film, I can't stress it enough. The only fun I had during this thankfully short piece is watching Tea Leoni's (sp?) facial expressions. Surely the worst actress I have ever seen in any film in history. She's appauling, so is the film. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Don't waste your time or money.
0793563836|4.0|I recently signed up for weekly bass lessons at my local music store, and they sold me this 1st book out of this composite.  I was about 1/2 way through book one when I saw this composite version with Accompanying CDs, and I decided to buy it here on Amazon.<br />The lessons can't be extremely exciting when you're just learning an instrument, but they have done a good job of choosing lessons that actually have some pretty interesting tunes from various genres of music.  They have also interspersed shorter 8 measure excercises with occasional longer numbers of 25 or so measures.  This helps the lessons seem less like \\"drills\\" and more like you're actually making progress.<br />When I received this version with the CDs, it made everything even better.  To be able to play along with the full instrumentation to the songs in the book really helps, especially in forcing you to keep regular time, since you can't d r a a a a a g out a measure when the fingering gets tough.<br />I'm a drummer, but one who can read music (yes, there are a few of us), so I can't vouch for whether there is enough material to teach the uninitiated how to read music notation for time value, but I have picked up a reasonable amount of knowledge of reading music for pitch.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I am a veteran of &quot;little theatre&quot; and see a movie or play at least once a week --- I have watched some movies several times merely to concentrate on the acting.  This movie is a particular favorite of mine, as it is total quality in every aspect --- and, sadly, underrated at the time of release.  I will watch it any time someone I know hasn't seen it (have hosted a gathering of three or more to share in those movies that I consider very worthy to be shared --- this definitely being on my &quot;loved that movie&quot; list.)
0684833395|2.0|I found Hellers work abysmal.  I read it (and bought it) because I'd never read it, and heard from others that it's worth it.  They lied.  Heller tries to write in much the same manner as Jim Carrey or his progener Jerry Lewis try to act.  No thought is given to the conclusion; all that matters to any of them is the method of destruction to the next punch-line.  Bah, never have I wasted more time trying to be \\"educated\\"...
6304712936|3.0|I love this movie!  It is a great portrait of Mozart, and has incredible performances by Abraham and Hulce.  The DVD has a few extras, mostly on-screen reading about the film and the characters.  There is not an additional footage or documentary.  It is a two-sided DVD, and for some reason the movie is split between both sides!  It is so annoying to have to flip the DVD in the middle of the film.  If you like this movie, it is worth owning.  If you are looking for a feature-packed DVD, keep looking.
B000002U82|5.0|I first got into Pink Floyd about 14 yrs ago while I was in the Navy. I was pretty impressed with Momentary Lapse Of Reason, given that the album is post-Waters. The classic rock station I was listening to at home was playing, &quot;Money&quot;. I thought that this song was a new P.F. release and I was shocked to find out this song was released in 1973. The sound of the cash registers in rhythmic fashion is a clear as a bell, a testament to the engineering and recording brilliance of an album that is well ahead of its time. The radio station also played other cuts from DSOTM and, in listening to them, decided to buy the album. There is lot going on with this album. From the blues-drenched stylings of &quot;Time&quot;, through the Beatles-sounding, &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, to the jazz-influenced tunes of, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us And Them&quot;; and one must not forget the awesome soulful vocals in this album. I do understand that there is an underlying objective or story to this album, but I, as a musician, can only bring myself to appreciate the sonic and musical qualities. This album is a must-have for new PF fans and classic rockers alike.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Worst movie Spielberg ever made, I should be reimburse for what I paid.
B00005T30L|5.0|I went to see this movie with my girlfriend, and I thought it was really good, so I had to go to the video store and see it again.  Plus, with the DVD, you get all the extra stuff.  I go to the store, and they have a mere two copies of this movie, and yet &quot;Zoolander&quot; takes up half the wall.  What's wrong with this picture?<br />This is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while.  It's about this girl (Thora Birch) who has just gotten out of high school, and she's basically trying to figure out what to do with her life.  She befriends this reclusive weird guy (Steve Buschemi, great actor), and tries to help him improve his social life.  But, through doing this, she realizes that she has no life of her own, and must come to terms with how lonely she really is.  Her parents don't understand her, her friends no longer have time for her, and plus she has to take this weird art class, where the teacher just makes fun of everything she does.  <br />The movie gets a little dreary toward the end, but it never loses your attention.  You really care about the characters, and you never really know what'll happen next.  My only complaint is that Scarlet Johansen wasn't in it more.  She and Thora are really funny together (&quot;Let's follow that guy, and see where he goes&quot;), and plus she's a babe.  She kind of disappears after the first 20 minutes or so.  Oh, well.<br />This movie probably isn't for everybody, but if you feel like you're going to jump out a window the next time another &quot;American Pie&quot; movie comes out, this is definitely for you.
6305907145|1.0|As a lover of Jane Austen novels I saw this movie when it was first released in the theatre.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!  I wanted my time and my money back.  The only thing this movie had in common with the actual story were the names of the characters.  I don't think Jane Austen herself would have recognized her story.  I guess that's what &quot;based on the novel by Jane Austen&quot; means.  Very loosely based.  This rendition had no soul and the only clever thing about this movie was the end.
B000002U82|5.0|I first got into Pink Floyd about 15 years ago while I was still in the Navy. I really enjoyed &quot;Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;, hence post-Waters.

I do understand that there is an underlying dark theme or objective to DSOTM, but I, as a musician, have come to really appreciate the solid musicianship in this album; definitely a must-have for any new or old PF fans.

B000001Y42|1.0|Oh my god! This is the most amazing heavy metal album ever!  So brutal, and yet so technical!  Wes Borland is the most amazing guitarist I've ever heard.  His solos are so fast and complex, he makes Yngwie and Eddie Van Halen look bad.  Sam River's bass playing puts Les Claypool to shame, and John Otto?  Oh man.  Move over Neil Peart, there's a new drum king in town!  Fred Durst is a god!  His lyrics and vocals are just so powerful.  Geoff Tate only wishes he could sing and write like this guy.  Forget Iron Maiden.  Limp Bizkit ruuuules!<br />Okay, here's a real review.  Limp Bizkit is the worst band of any type of music, period.  Wes Borland is not a very good guitarist at all.  Granted, his work here is better than his later stuff, but still, it's nothing I, a guitarist of average skill, couldn't play.  John Otto is a horrible drummer, who can't keep a rhythm going for anything.  My drummer in my band could make him look bad without even trying.  The bass player is okay, but trust me, my bass player is way better.  Oh, and Fred Durst can't sing, scream, or rap.<br />I listened through this whole thing, and tried to see what was good about it, but I couldn't.  I'm an open-minded person who listens to a lot of different kinds of music, but this I just don't get.  If you want a metal album that'll really impress you, get some Iron Maiden, but not this.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Some may not agree with me on this but this movie was fantastic! I know a few people who swore it was the worst movie made ever but I think if you were interested in the game you should give the movie a chance. Normally movies made from video games are horrible but for some reason this movie worked for me. Angelina Jolie MADE the movie. The stunts were great, her outfits were great, the scenery was great and well...she rocked. :) *The soundtrack is out of this world too.*

B000060OWV|5.0|Guitarist Robben Ford has been one of the best-kept secrets in the world of music for many years. He is one of a handful of truly great living guitarists, and \\"Blue Moon\\" is his best offering to date. The guitar work is, of course, amazing, and the vocals and songwriting are also top-notch. The style is a little hard to put your finger on. You've got blues, blues-rock, R&B, jazz, and rock influences, and sometimes all in the same song (\\"Don't Deny Your Love\\"). \\"Indianola\\" is a rip-roaring celebration of the guitar that sounds great cranked up while you're rolling down the highway. \\"Something For The Pain\\" may just be the perfect rock-steady blues anthem. Can you tell I'm a huge fan? You owe it to yourself to get this CD.
1558216847|5.0|There may be people who find the narrative unbelievable. Regarding such people, one is minded of the definition of a cynic as one who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.<BR> The book is an inherently believable narrative of one who was willing, with his companions, to risk all for freedom. So was the girl they met. That part of the tale will make you weep, as when the men gave her a flower for her hair. It should not surprise anyone that the girl was not raped, since, by way of background, she was one with the men. <BR> It becomes a tragedy beyond words when the girl, and one of the men, die in the Gobi Desert, but the party perseveres, just as when people died on the Oregon Trail, and in first crossing Death Valley. These two episodes also seem unbelievable, but they occurred, thus refuting the mean-spirited.<BR> Two more of the men die while crossing Central Asia and the Himalayas. But four of the original seven make it to India. <BR> Far from being a contrived fiction, the book appears to this writer to reflect a triumph of the human spirit. It is also offers keen insight into the difference between \\"civilization\\" and the inherent decency of man to his fellows. The book will make you swell with pride, bring tears to your eyes , and cause you reflect deeply and repeatedly, but you will never forget it.
6305558167|5.0|I like everything about Excalibur...the sound track, the story, the battles. Everything seems just as it should be, plus a little bit better. It's a must see for anyone interested in sword and sorcery type movies. It is one of the best ever made. Even the armor is very cool. I have yet to see a movie that used as much chrome plated plate mail!<br />There are tons of good books that would interrest a person who likes Excalibur. Lord of the rings, Abacar the Wizard, and The Mists of Avalon to name a few.
B000063UR2|4.0|Legend has always been a favorite classic of mine. I recently purchased this DVD in region 2 (Europe) format. Now, if the region 1 (USA, Canada) DVD includes the same revamped movie on it as the region 2 DVD, then fans of this movie should be prepared for some major changes. In my opinion the most dissapointing of the changes was the soundtrack. It has been totally changed. A music group called Tangerine Dream created the original scores, which played a signifigant part in giving the movie it's uniqueness and fantasy-like out-of-body feel. Well, it's been totally edited out, with some more modern movie music thrown in it's place, paling in comparison to the original. I actually felt cheapened as I fist listened to it. It just sounds, for lack of a better word, silly. Other changes include scene changes. For example - when the princess first walks into the hut in the woods, she looks around and examines a clock. In the original movie, she has a strange vision of the future. In this new version, that doesn't happen. Keep in mind that is just a SMALL example of a change. <br />     The only good changes I noticed about this revamped version of Legend was the visual qualities and special effects. All nicely done and edited. If you ask me, visual qualities and special effect enhancements was all this movie needed to be released on DVD.<br />So, did all this editing ruin the whole Legend experience? To some people, perhaps. Is it better? Not a chance. Is it worse? Well, thats for you to decide. <br />     Bottom line - I think I'll just record my VHS version onto a DVD/R and label it \\"Do Not Edit\\"
B00003CXXP|1.0|Perhaps, perhaps the DVD version might save this movie!! Please don't waste your time buying it. My advice is to rent it first. You may only be able to get through it once.  I am a HUGE Sci-fi fan and was excited to see this movie.  I was soooooo disappointed in it.  Some parts of did not make sence whatsoever... Sorry....
B000053VAF|4.0|Actually, I thought this movie was very interesting.  It touches on things that one would not normally consider (the other \\"what if...?\\").  Mind you, you have to be very open minded when watching this movie and understand this is a person's FICTICIOUS vision and not to be taken TOO seriously (read the commentary before the movie).  Any one who takes this movie too much to heart might do well as to consider this movie very blasphemous and obscene, if that is the case than I would say, \\"if you can't laugh at yourself or have no sense of humor than don't even consider seeing this movie!\\"  <br />As a strong Christian myself I saw the humor as well as some seriousness in it. It goes beyond the surface and can be scathingly funny!<br />I definitely recommend this movie to people who have an open mind and know how to laugh at themselves and not take everything too critically (the non a _ _ l retentive)!  This is a movie for the unbiased intellectual who knows how to loosen up and have a good time.
0380977281|5.0|Don't miss this one. Gaiman's writing effectively captures the style of the time covered, with great wordplay, humor and heart. It's a short, decidedly adult fairy tale, with rich, earthy characters and a plot that splits and turns and only gets better as it rolls along. The myriad ends are tied into a nice, tight bow by the final pages. Great stuff.
0140177396|2.0|I had really expected more from this book, it was highly recommended by many people whom i talked to, and it is still a mystery to me as to why. I was first a bit shocked at how short the book was, but i have read short books before that were written beatifully and definetley worth reading. This was not one of them. While i could appreciate the irony of the main characters, them attracting my attention more than their situtation. A big, strong man, but dum as a box of rocks, and the keen small man, being the one to over throw the bigger man. This book seemed to be the starting point of so many modern stereotyes, it's unbelievable. Though i must say i had some time adjusting to their slang, and while the book was descriptive to a point, i never really fell in love with the story line. It was not as complex as some people would have it to be, and it seemed as if their situaion could have been more deeply shown, or there could have been other opsticals explained. Maybe it is just me, but i would not spend my money to buy my own copy of this book...
B00005QIPH|4.0|After reading several negative reviews of the album, I felt compelled to write a review myself.<br />Most of you who criticize the album do so because it is not the best rock record you have ever heard.  The hype suggests that the record is among the best ever made, and it wasn't.  Therefore, you dislike it.<br />Let me say this: the album is great.  It is!  It's really good.  But that's not what is extraordinary about the album.  What IS extraordinary about it, and why it is getting the press it is, is because the album is the first sight on the horizon of the coming in a new era in rock.  Following the grunge scene, pop has been immersed in either this bubble-gum stuff or this hip-hop/soul stuff or this rap/rock stuff.  Its been about a decade since solid rock has been seen in the mainstream.  And you guys who are Velvet Underground, Television, Ramones, Clash, or Stooges fans, and do not get why The Strokes are getting the press they are, it's because you've heard this all before!  You know where these guys are getting their sound, and it's repetitive to you!  Instead of complaining about the hype, praise the hype!  Finally, the mainstream just might be getting a clue about what good music is.<br />So I say, praise the album!  It might not be the be all and end all of rock, but it's a sign that you might be able to start listening to the radio again.<br />For those of you that have never heard a song by Television or the White Light/White Heat record, BUY THIS ALBUM, and then move on to where these guys are coming from.  This is THE introductory course to classic rock, and may finally show you why people complain that pop is dead.<br />P.S. The bass line to the title track is FANTASTIC
B00005QK3W|4.0|The first time I heard it, I was disappointed. But after the 2nd time, I quickly realized how great these songs are. This is the kind of album that has to be heard over and over. And believe me, you'll want to do just that. As usual, Paul shows us his unique talent for creating pop melodies, as well as rocking tunes.  For those who dislike the corny lyrics (\\"Yappa, yap, yap, 12345\\"), remember the lyrics that made the Beatles famous. This is what McCartney does best. Those corny words stick in your head (even my 2 year old daughter has it stuck in her little head!) and those great melodies are just unforgettable. My only beef : it's a bit too long and some songs could be shorter. Other than that, it's classic Paul. He only gets better with age!
B00005QDW1|5.0|I totally rescind my previous rating. Though very different from their previous CDs, I think this signifies the end of \\"album puberty\\" and the beginning of something wonderful. <br />The music is richer and the sound is a combination of LA meets Jamaica meets London. It is Ska, but moreso. I am a huge No Doubt fan and try to listen to everything they have, read all the articles, and watch all the TV appearances. It just seems as if it gets better and better with each listen. <br />For those of you (like I once was) who expected the usual \\"alternative\\" sound, this is definitely a more streamlined and ALTERNATIVE sound. Who would've thought they'd hear the soulful beats of reggae blended with an edgy club sound? I think this is the next level for No Doubt.
078401213X|4.0|A great example of intelligent filmmaking on a tight budget. Whilst some of the scenes are a little hard to watch, this remains a very thought-provoking film. The director, Daniel Aranofsky, makes great use of the light and dark shades that black-and-white-filmmaking produces so effortlessly.  This is used to suggest, very effectively, feelings of agoraphobia and paranoia as experienced by the lead character Max (Sean Gullette), in his search for mathematical truth. The DVD carries separate Actor and Director commentaries that are genuinely insightful and revealing. Whilst this film is undoubtedly a little rough around the edges in parts (and indeed what would you expect from a budget of around $80,000?), it is certainly a powerful and interesting piece and I would recommend it to those with imagination and an open mind.
1587990717|5.0|The past decade has witnessed the release of many books about risk management and assessment, but none have managed to illustrate the role that random events play in life and markets as well as Nissim Nicholas Taleb's latest work. Writing in a leisurely and personal style that makes his complex subject utterly accessible, Taleb instructs us on how to account for randomness in our decision making, and illustrates the many ways in which we confuse luck with skill. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book, which many investors will wish they had read in, say, 1994.
B000003TA4|5.0|oh my gosh-this is such a great cd. i absolutely love every single song. they all have a special something that makes it stand out. kurt kobain may not have been a stand up guitar player-but he is an excellent songwriter. this cd is like 10 years old and it still sounds like it came out yesterday. most cd's get old after about a month-but this one has never gotten old for me. i love it. my favorite cd i own. go buy it because you will not be displeased.
B000001EKX|4.0|When KISS released their debut album on February 24, 1974 they went on their first tour as an opening band and were kicked off because of course they were better than the headlining band. So they couldn't get a tour so they went back to the studio to do another record in late 74. Hotter Than Hell has pretty good tunes written by Ace Frehely and a good guitar solo by him on Strange Ways. Peter Criss's &quot;Mainline&quot; is my favorite song on the album. Other good hits like &quot;Watchin' You&quot;, &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot;, &quot;Parasite&quot; are good examples of KISS's appetite for world wide domination.

Gimme the old MTV with the VJs any day.This CD brings back fond memories of that time when MTV actually cared about music,unlike today.I wont even waste 30 seconds of my time watching todays MTV,Id rather watch mold grow on a slice of bread.There are some good cuts on this CD besides &quot;radio star&quot;,like &quot;johnny on a monorail&quot; and &quot;living in the plastic age&quot;.This is a must have CD for fans of 80s technopop.recommended.

But, after being bombarded through the media about how original and clever \\"Scream\\" is, the curiosity got the better of me and I watched it. What I found was exactly what I expected--self-satisfied, star-driven teen slasher fair with occasional (and I do stress, occasional) wit and nary a thrill.<br />\\"Scream\\" starts out with a boring, suspense poor scene that must last fifteen to twenty minutes. In this scene, we find an overly \\"endowed\\", stereotypical teen (Drew Barrymore) harassed by threatening and relentless phone calls from someone with a sinister voice. After director Craven feels he has generated enough \\"suspense\\", the film finally cuts to the chase to reveal Barrymore's boyfriend, his entrails sitting in his lap. A few \\"terrifying\\" moments later, Barrymore meets a similar fate.<br />The rest of the film is pretty much just a slasher/whodunit with the film's hip, baby-faced cast (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, etc) struggling to catch the serial killer before they become the next victim. Along the way, Wes Craven sprinkles little nods and references to other directors and films of the horror genre.<br />Ironically, the film is a victim of the same cliches it so vehemently reviles. I found it to be painfully predictable, and knew who the killer was the first moment I saw him.<br />As a slasher film, \\"Scream\\" is decent. There is some humor which fans of the genre will find amusing, and even though it did not induce so much as a muscle twitch in me (scary films just do not scare me), others will probably find it thrilling. Nevetheless, the film was much over-hyped and not nearly as smart as advertised.

B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie is okay, but it could have been much better. I enjoyed the original trilogy and had expected far more than this. The first disappointing thing that comes to mind is the acting. Most of it was very good, but every time I think of the movie, the first thing that comes is, \\"He did it. The little guy did it.\\" (And those of you who seen the movie know what I am talking about.) There was hardly any emotion.  You might have thought a dog jumped through a firey hoop at the circus.  By the way the pilot was reacting as their ship was going down, the viewer hardly seemed to care if R2-D2 was able to fix the stupid thing. As a matter of fact, I almost did not want him to. That would be one less terrible actor in the movie. The second thing that comes to mind is the two-headed pod-racing commentator that looked like two different races of creatures stuck together. That was extremely annoying. But if you like special effects, this movie has awesome special effects and a very good ending.<br />One thing that made Star Wars very popular was Darth Vader...
B000002JSP|4.0|When I think of Zeppelin's career, I think of it as a ladder going up to a slide.  When the band first met together, that was the first step up the ladder.  About half-way up was Led Zeppelin I.  As the albums came out, the climber continuously accended up the ladder at an nice pace.  When Led Zeppelin IV came out, he jumped a few steps and kept going through Houses of the Holy.  Then Physical Graffiti came out and the climber finally reached the top.  Now the only place to go was down~ and that's excactly what happened when Presence came out.  Finally, In Through the out Door is the little bit of air that you catch at the end of the slide.  This is a very good album that helps finish Led Zeppelin's career on a possitive note.<br />1.In the Evening:  One of my favorite songs.  This song provides great instrumental parts and catchy vocals, although you can't understand a thing Plant says.<br />2.South Bound Saurez:  It'll grow on you~ give it some time.<br />3.Fool In the Rain:  Good but it could be a little shorter for what's there<br />4.Hot Dog:  Good song~ not much more you could say about this one.<br />5.Carouselamba:  Awsome song!  Taking it past 10 minutes, this song should have made the Latter Days album.<br />6.All my Love:  This one's right up there with Stairway to Heaven and The Song Remains the Same.  Worth buying the cd just for this song.<br />7.I'm Gonna Crawl:  With a very different sound, you may forget that it's a Zeppelin tune.
0748662529|5.0|Rare among works of detective fiction are stories suffused with joy rather than fear and suspense, but Alexander McCall Smith's _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_ celebrates the role of detective rather than elaborating on its dangers.  This is not to say that the novel does not deal with serious matters: Precious Ramotswe, the No. 1 Lady Detective of Botswana, faces insurance fraud, medical malpractice, abduction, and even the potential killing of children for magical potions, but she performs her feats of detection primarily out of love for the people of Botswana.  She is a \\"fixer of lives,\\" an exceptional figure in a genre of characters concerned with bringing criminals to justice out of a desire for vengeance.  Precious Ramotswe's position as a pioneering female detective contributes to the novel's unique tone.  Many of her cases revolve around the domestic - missing husbands, impersonators of family members, lost children - but Precious Ramotswe works within the traditionally female realm to subvert and surpass it.  She beats the often pompous and self-satisfied men in the novel at their own game, accomplishing her goals with wit and sensitivity and emerging from early life struggles with good-natured wisdom.  This touch of the personal infuses Smith's novel with a uniquely human sympathy, appropriate for the story of Precious Ramotswe's maturation, and for Botswana, historically exempted from the severest political turmoil of its fellow African nations.<br />Smith's light, spare style adds to the charm of _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_; the narration glides from anecdote to anecdote with the grace of beads sliding down a string.  If the novel suffers from anything, it would be that the individual detection stories seem too loosely strung together and that the secondary characters sometimes lack development.  But Smith is less concerned with the process of uncovering a single mystery than with the growth of the central detective: each story uncovers another of Precious Ramotswe's talents.  A novel of hope and healing, _The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_ reinvents detective fiction for a distinctively African, distinctively female world, weaving a tale of cleverness and warmth as it rejoices in the vibrancy of African life.
B00005R2M3|2.0|Comparing this album to, say, Shakira's MTV Unplugged is like comparing The Beatles to the The Monkees. Laundry Sevice is a pitiful excuse of music from someone who was showing such huge potential and promise of a real singer/songwriter. I would never have believed that we would witness Shakira  marketed on her blond hair and belly button rather than her talent. Oh well, my kids will sing her songs with the likes of the boy bands and the countless other talentless pop stars of commercialmania now. Too bad really. Her other CD's were great. Thanks Gloria &amp; Emilio for nothing.
B00005Q45W|5.0|This is one of the best albums of the last ten years. Beautiful, brilliant, and bittersweet; intelligent and enjoyable. Cohen finally has a hit song in his old age. I first heard &quot;In My Secret Life&quot; in a small Polish inn on the Polish-Ukrainian border. I didn't recognize Cohen as the singer; but I knew I had to find the singer and the hauntingly beautiful and bittersweet song. I heard the song, the next day, riding through Wroclaw on a 24 hours bus ride through Poland. As another reviewer stated, the songs do take you to other places and times. The rest of the songs are also quite good - &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; also lingers in your mind.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie was horrible. I have never written a review before and probably never will again but, this movie was so bad i thought it was only fair that i warn any potential viewers.<br />The first half hour of the movie gets you interested but its all down hill from there.  They ask all kinds of questions about the killer but don't answer any of them. The whole point of the movie seemed to be lets sell as many tickets as we can for this movie and hope they come back for the sequel.
1573222038|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down!  After having read Tipping the Velvet, and Affinity, I waited (somewhat impatiently) for the publication of Fingersmith.... it was worth the wait.<br />The characters are well developed, well written, and with the plot twists and turns, it was just a terrific read.<br />I highly recommend this book!
0780619951|5.0|This is by far my favorite film ever. Brando is entertaining and Kilmer is handsome, but it is the startling work of David Thewlis that stands out in this exciting and wonderful picture. His sensual scenes with the dancing Fairuza Balk are fascinating. I am still hoping for a sequal.
0593044703|5.0|Have only just started (on P155) this magnificient work, and am already hooked.<br />After reading the Prologue and Chapter 1 I was thoroughly hooked on this amazing book. The best part is there are another 2 books in the series :) <br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed. And if you are disappointed, take it down a charity shop and make someone elses day...
0141301155|4.0|The book was a bit boaring at the bergining but when people started geting the tickits I was getting excited.<BR>I did not understand some things but the the book excellent.
B00005JKYS|5.0|We Were Soldiers is the story of a 3 day battle in the Ia Drang Valley of Vietnam in November 1965.  It is based on the book We Were Soldiers Once, and Young, cowritten by Hal Moore and Bob Galloway.<br />Mel Gibson plays Hal Moore, who was at that time a Lt. Col and Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry which is the unit involved in the battle.<br />The battle scenes are the most realistic I have ever seen.  The violence and gore is neither amplified for effect nor toned down to avoid shocking or offending.  The North Vietnamese are presented as competent hard-fighting advesaries which adds to the realism and the sense of \\"being there\\".<br />The effect of the loss of life in the battle to the families is brought home with great power by scenes back at Fort Benning, the battalion's home garrison, involving the wives, particularly Col Moore's wife.  During one scene, I could hear crying throughout the theater.<br />The movie does not attempt to rehash the tired political arguments about whether we should have fought in Vietnam.  Instead it portrays the effect that decision, once made, had on real people in the military and their loved ones.  I have seen nothing that does that better.<br />I most strongly recommend this movie to anyone.  It is a great war movie for those who like that genre and it is a great \\"people movie\\" for those who generally don't see war movies.  I believe anyone who sees it will not quickly forget it.
0880389052|5.0|..it came to me when i was soo bored of this kind of books.. i just read a few pages and...whoop!...6 books of Drizzt's tale (saga, if you like) finished in blink of an eye...i am still reading his life..<BR> i haven't heard people talking in a negative way about this book. even the ones who didn't like fantasy..<BR>...Salvatore is a &quot;real&quot; writer..<br />and Homeland is a &quot;must&quot; for all readers..
B00003CXXP|2.0|A.I. starts out slow and never picks up speed. This would be ok if there was actually a good story to follow. We get to watch a robot boy get rejected and then wonder from place to place trying to find a way to be a real boy. I found there was only one thing I actually liked in this movie and that was the boy's companion &quot;Super Toy&quot; teddy bear. The &quot;Super Toy&quot; actually did a better job of &quot;acting&quot; and showing emotion than the star of the film. I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone.
0385503954|2.0|I was so excited by the prospects for this novel, I ordered it from Amazon.UK. What a disappointment.The McEwan prose style is in full flower but the composition of the novel left me underwhelmed.  The three principal aspects of the story are interesting in themselves but the novel felt like three novellas put together to form not a coherent story but something like a pastiche.  The ending (I won't commnet!) has a bit of a contrived POMO feel to it...
0679720200|5.0|What is nothing?  Where is it?  How does it affect us?  I don't know, and I don't care.  I've heard people say that indifference is a bad thing, but what's wrong with blah?  Blah is good.  Well...maybe not good, but it's not bad either.  If you're searching for the meaning of existence, or if you want to read THE existentialist masterpiece, or if you're bored with this review (like I am), go buy this book.
B00005JKES|5.0|No other T.V. show (or movie for that matter) has left such an impression on me.  It has superb acting, more twists-and-turns you can shake a stick at, and a mysterious story line that will forever run deep.  You have got to experience the wonder by picking this up.  If not, season 2 will never come around as Artisan is watching sales to see if they should release it.  What a horrible shame that such a great piece of work has a chance of never being finished up in DVD.  Trust me, if you like mystery, great acting, with a touch of quirkiness--Twin Peaks will be your all-time favorite as well.
0451191153|5.0|My main problem with this book is that it's &quot;for adults.&quot;  Apparently, we &quot;kids&quot; won't understand what the meaning is, or maybe we're too young and don't know enough about life to know what Ayn Rand is talking about.  Either way, that is soooooooooo much BS.  I'm fourteen, and I loved this book.  It's one of my all-time favorites, right up there with The Stranger and Lord of the Flies.  The struggle for the preservation of integrity and self is very interesting.  Everyone who read this book with me commented how &quot;Roarkian&quot; I am.  Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.  But I can say that there should be more Roarks in the world.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, go buy this book and read it.
0060282983|5.0|My third grade teacher read this to our class some 20 years ago.  I guess I wasn't really paying attention.  I've spent the last three weeks reading this to my 3 year old son and we really enjoyed the story and all of the lively characters.  After finishing the book, he gave my wife, his younger brother and sister all character names.  There's nothing better than reading with your children and this classic is a true winner!
0345451325|4.0|Eric Nylund has written an excellent sci-fi story that stands on it's own without Halo (the first person shooter for Microsoft's Xbox game system.) That said, if you are playing Halo (as I am, over 70% finished...keep gaming!) or if you have finished Halo, then the book is beyond expectations.<br />The Fall Of Reach tells the story of Spartans: a warrior class groomed and made from the bodies of six year old children. Once grown they are tasked to save the human race and way of life from an invading horde called The Covenant. <br />The Fall of Reach begins with how the Spartans are \\"recruited\\", trained, and deployed. Spartans are the equivalent of the 21st centuries Delta Force: operators who's lives are about mission success. Almost 200 pages of the book deal just with the Spartan background (I read this portion in one sitting,) and let me mention, after just finishing Black Hawk Down, this book was a neat follow-up providing a sci-fi equivalent. It is very interesting, very well paced, and keeps the readers coming back for more. <br />For Halo players if you are looking for background information and insight into Master Chief and his creation, life, etc. prior to the game play - look no further. I would suggest players read this as they play; it doesn't destroy any of the gaming secrets and really makes the game seem more interesting (which is hard to do b/c the game is already superb.) I would almost say shame on Microsoft and Bungie for not bundling this book with the game: it's that good. I would call it a must read.<br />So whether you are playing the game or looking for an excellent sci-fi story, this book will live up to your desires. I highly recommend it!<br />Now lets hope the movie rumors are true!
0783222955|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best films made. It seemed to be untouched by the Hollywood treatment and stayed true to the book. A great film without doubt
6305508550|2.0|Bah! 2 scenes do not a movie make.  Mike Judge can't decide whether he wants to be Franz Kafka or in the Hallmark Hall of Fame, so he settles for something that would make Joan Lunden titter with suppressed amusement.<br />Bravely lambasting office politics in a manner that only someone who has never worked in an office could enjoy, Judge then moves on to tougher fare.  Waitressing in a restaraunt not the most pleasant experience?  I mean, Oh my gosh, I was stunned by his searing portrayal of the disenfranchisment of Coporate America and it's inevitable Ennui-inducing Weltanschauung.  Verfremdungseffekte like White men rapping and Jennifer Anniston being \\"Homey and down to earth\\" only further emphasized the moral of this story (In true Brecht fashion) - when the Proletariat fulfilled its Hegelian destiny and been run beneath the wheels of enterprise, only the Uebermensch-next-door will be able to \\"Take up arms\\" and stem the tide.  If you thought what I just said was right on, go finish that poem you've been working on.<br />A cinematic masterpiece for anyone who likes to snicker at the misfortunes of others and fancies themselves luckily outside the world of grunts and laborers.  Buy it for your Philosophy Grad-Student get togethers.  Goes well with Rolling Rock.
B0000508U6|5.0|One of the greatest debut albums ever. Shades of Cure, Blue Aeroplanes, and perhaps Morrissey, but saying this fails to do it justice. Deserving of record of the year along with Dylan's Love and Theft.
0736041850|5.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the customer reviews I read, but I still didn't expect such an extremely high level of detail and quality! It turned out to be everything I was looking for and more. It is very well laid out - a section is devoted to each bodypart (i.e. arms, chest, shoulders), and on the first page of each section is a rundown of all of the exercizes that are profiled. What follows is a beautifully drawn depiction of someone performing the given movement with the targeted muscles highlighted. It also offers tips on proper form and possible variations. I can honestly say I have never been more satisfied with ANY book I have purchased. I HIGHLY recommend this book for anyone with even the slightest in the way the human body works and it is an absolute MUST HAVE for anyone who is at all involved in weightlifting at any level. It will help make your workouts more effective because you will know exactly which muscles you have been targeting in your workouts and those you may have been neglecting. Please do yourself a favor and buy this book!!!
B00003OSTN|5.0|HOW long has it been?  50 years?  THIS one still stands proudly and that's really thanks to Miss Crawford's unforgettable Oscar-winning  performance as the much-maligned mama [with a bow in Ann Blyth's direction - equally stellar as the daughter from hell!]<br />Paintakingly photogrpahed, set, orchestrated, whatever, the images are forever brilliant!  [Where on earth do see this today in our era of CGI and all of that lovely technical stuff?].<br />THIS is what movies are/will and should be like - 'escape and entertainment' folks  - a Hollywood product at its finest!<br />Companion?  &quot;Now Voyager&quot; with Davis of course!
B00005JKYS|5.0|Of all the war movies I have seen this has got to be the BEST!!! It is absolutly the most realistic and amazingly made movie I have ever seen. The cast is outstanding,everyone of them. Mel Gibson did an excellent job in his roll as did all the rest of the cast members. I am looking forward to seeing this movie over & over again. You laugh & cry with the carectors & feel like you are actually going through the lives with the people in the movie. I now have a MUCH greater appreciation for what our brave soldiers did in Vietnam, this movie really puts everything into perspective for those of us who never had to face the tragedy that occured during that time in history. My hats off to the writers, directors and actors & to all the men who fought & died in this horrific war. God bless all of them & thanks to the people who put so much into this movie to make it the extreme hit I know it will be.<BR>Thank you,<BR>Donna Johnson<BR>Crossett, AR
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Unconventional, Campy, Cool really says it all.<br />A must-see for all lovers of dance/choreography/theatre/film-making, and for those following a different drummer. &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; excites the senses, awakens forgotten passions. The viewer is pulled in quickly, driven to watch every moment, caring what will happen to the characters. <br />&quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; will find its place in your top ten favorite films, without a doubt. <br />FYI, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; shares the same director/producers as &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot;, although as the title might suggest, there is no vocalization in the latter.
B000001BZT|3.0|When presented with this eclectic \\"bluegrass/heavy metal\\" project, MCA transferred Earle's account to their rock division, Uni International, and Earle's road band had already undergone a dramatic country-to-rock change of personnel. Newly recruited guitarist Donnie Roberts is a rough-edged hard rocker, not as proficient on his instrument as former studio whiz/producer Richard Bennett.  Roberts' guitar sound changes the ambience of this album, and with Earle producing, the result is an eclectic rock record. Earle's writing saves the day. Released as a single, \\"Copperhead Road\\" achieved enormous crossover success onto the rock charts and VH1, and it remains one of Earle's best-known songs. The oft-recorded \\"Devil's Right Hand\\" is here, as is \\"Snake-Oil,\\" and the touching \\"Only A Child,\\" perhaps a nod to Earle's own children. At any rate, this effort established Earle as a definitive rock crossover artist, capable of surviving on both sides (or the middle) of the country/rock fence.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Wow.  I had been sold that the best &quot;modern&quot; recordings of Brahms were either Abbado's digit-itis ridden version or the smaller chamber orchestras.  What a pleasant surprise to hear the symphonies given the royal treatment by Solti, who acquits himself marvelously here.  We have the beefiness of a huge orchestra combined with precision and openness of texture.  None of Von Karajan's mud!<br />Being a huge fan of the 4th, I was really impressed with that performance.  The tempos were just about perfect, though the fourth movement could have been a shade faster.  Regardless, it was a hair-raising listening experience that left me a little breathless.  My new favorite Brahms 4th!
B00003CXTG|4.0|The main problem with this movie, as I see it, is that it drags on and on---especially the &quot;love story&quot; at the beginning of the movie.  I think the writers could have shortened it and get the point across at the same time.<br />When the attack occurs----well, that is a true masterpiece.  Not only did the director manage to capture the total destruction at Pearl Harbor, but the human loss was made quite clear.  One scene in particular has stuck with me--after the attack was over, people began to try and rescue some of those trapped--some soldiers are trying to free their fellow soldiers from being drowned and all they could do was hold their hands as they died.  That scene alone, for me, conveyed the devestation of human loss at Pearl Harbor.<br />I also liked Cuba Gooding Jr. in this movie...Mister &quot;Show me the money&quot; proves he can go way beyond a comedy and into some serious drama.  Hopefully, he will get more roles like this one.<br />The only character that got on my nerves a bit was Alec Baldwin's.  We get the message, Mr. Baldwin, you're supposed to be a tough guy!  Sheesh...talk about over acting.<br />Aside from Mr. Baldwin's performance, and the length of the movie, I would recommend that you purchase this film.
B00003CXDD|3.0|Willow is a pretty standard fantasy film, where the child/item/weapon of prophesy is threatened by the wicked queen, and must be protected by roguish or physically challenged heroes.  If that sounds familiar, than you already know what Willow is about.  If you've seen other George Lucas films (i.e. Star Wars and the Indiana Jones movies), then you've already seen this film in a different guise.  That it's still fun and enjoyable to watch is a credit to the cinematography, the guys and gals at ILM, and the undeniable warmth and sincerity of Warrick Davis in the lead role.<br />There are a number of Lucasfilm hallmarks in Willow.  First is the immersion into the fantasy world where everything makes perfect sense to the inhabitants of that world.  Because the immersion is complete, we accept it without question.  Second is the virtually non-stop action that is so entertaining.  Finally, there's the music.  While not scored by Lucas's normal collaborator, John Williams, he instead employs another veteran orchestral composer, James Horner.  The music is a perfect compliment to the images, and you find yourself humming the themes after the film without having consciously noticed them while watching.<br />Unfortunately, there are a number of things that are disappointing about the film.  Foremost is the story - it is too recycled from the SW and Indy movies, and is completely linear and repetative (baddies find heroes, they fight, heroes escape, repeat).  The character Willow is in almost every scene, and nothing is developed outside that character (for instance, we never find out why Madmartigan is hanging in that prison cage).  Also of concern is the performances - Ron Howard usually gets the best out of his actors, but other than Davis, the performances seem forced.  This is especially the case in the contrived and sterile-feeling love story between Madmartigan and Sorsha, which is especially perplexing because the actors fell in love with each other on the set.<br />The DVD edition is quite good, although not up to the standard of SW I: The Phantom Menace.  The commentary by Davis is very imformative.  He gives insight into the actors playing various parts (including pointing out extras in his village played by his wife, father-in-law, and Kenny Baker), the locations, the effects, etc.  There are 2 making-of features, the newer of which is fascinating.  This was the first film to include the technique \\"morphing\\" (not the Abyss as many believe), and the feature producer includes interviews with the ILM people that came up with it and the filmakers who have used the technique (including Abyss and Terminator 2 director James Cameron).<br />Therefore, this is a good DVD for the cost.  While I was disappointed in the film, it is a rousing adventure story that is enjoyable on that level.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Finally, a wonderful, thoughtful, simply brilliant science-fiction movie.  I think of this movie as a future fairy-tale (in fact, that is one of the themes of this movie---the robot wants to be a real boy...sound familiar?).  Steven Spielberg did an excellent job of directing, Haley Joel Osment pulled off his character well and Jude Law, once again, shows that good looks and talent CAN go hand-in-hand.<br />To be truthful, I had avoided watching this movie because of the hype over the special effects.  Usually when this type of hype happens, that means the movie is just a showcase of the special effects crew--not the case in this movie.  Yes, the effects are beyond what I could have imagined, but they work hand-in-hand with the movie.<br />The second disc is chocked full of special features---I enjoyed watching the interviews with Steven Spieldberg and the two main actors.  Also, I truly enjoyed watching how they did all of those special effects, the second disc itself stands alone.  <br />Bottom line: the movie is excellent, beyond what I could have imagined.  Money well spent!
0887306713|5.0|Built To Last was an extremely thought provoking and eye opening read. Built To Last studies some of the most successful (called the leading companies) and the following companies (non-leaders in an industry). The research for this book produced surprising results for the authors (and the reader). The authors found the there were at least twelve commonly held businesses beliefs that their research refuted. In essence these dearly held business beliefs were myths.<br />Here is a look at each of the twelve myths and a sound byte describing each:<br />1. It takes a great idea to start a company Few visionary companies started with a great idea. Many companies started without any specific ideas (HP and Sony) and others were outright failures (3M). In fact a great idea may lead to road of not being able to adapt.<br />2. Visionary companies require great and charismatic visionary leaders A charismatic leader in not required and, in fact, can be detrimental to a company's long-term prospects.<br />3. The most successful companies exist first and foremost to maximize profits Not true. Profit counts, but is usually not at the top of the list.<br />4. Visionary companies share a common subset of &quot;correct&quot; core values They all have core values, but each is unique to a company and it's culture.<br />5.

0345350499|5.0|First and foremost, read the book and if you are interested in how TNT &quot;redid&quot; it for a movie, then watch it.<br />Now, I know that some Christians have a problem with this book--it doesn't portray Christianity in a &quot;nice&quot; sort of way, but this book hit home for a lot of non-Christians (Pagan or not) because it showed some of the nastiness of that relgion's followers.  I don't mean to offend anyone with this review, but Bradley hit it on the head with this one--at least from my standpoint (and a lot of others).<br />I enjoyed how Bradley retold this story---it does put some of the women in a better light in the story, but not at the expense of the men in the story--in fact, she humainized everyone in the story, and did it in a wonderful way.
B000003EUL|2.0|In Chopin's Polonaise Fantasy the Richter Formula works a dream. What it consists of is starting very slow, getting very fast in the middle and ending slow. In the first movement of the Appassionata or the Brahms Bflat it is simply detestable. I say this as a great and sincere admirer of Richter. He was a very human and engaging genius and his style or styles varied a lot, but there was something in the way he caught the public imagination (mine very much included) that seems to get people closing down their discriminatory faculties and going for the reach-me-down superlatives. For me his Appassionata is about as wrong as can be. In the first movement we have the Formula, in the slow movement the last variation is busy in that dreadful and all-too-familiar way, and in the last movement he probably holds the speed record, which might be ok except that Beethoven specifically tells us not to rush this movement. Oh what an awesome thing this movement is from Serkin - the main theme sinister and pianissimo, the one and only glint of major harmony<br />shining pathetically like struggling sunlight in Turner and the end of the world in the last bars. Sorry but it's hard to put up with the thing treated as an Olympic 400 metres, and even harder when the perpetrator is my own adored Richter. The first movement of the Brahms is pretty awful too, not just because of the messing around with the tempo but because right near the beginning he plays the wonderful power-up that leads in the full orchestra - one of the most terrific sequences ever conceived for the instrument - in a choppy staccato. Are the composer's slur-marks not clear? Who else ever got this wrong? Just listen to Watts to hear how it can and should be. Things improve a bit thereafter, but considering the competition this is neither a runner in the stakes for this particular masterpiece nor something I want to remember the great Richter by. In this piece Watts is definitely one to consider. Gilels is particularly interesting - his earlier performance from 1960 or so has a fast and incandescent first movement, in his later performance he goes slow for reasons presumably known to himself. Backhaus is specially interesting, particularly in the odd slow and precious way he took in the finale after the war, having got that particularly<br />sensitive tempo dead right in earlier years. Horowitz and Toscanini is unique, full of diablerie even if not maybe getting too deep. Pollini is agreeable but lightweight. Serkin's various versions need discernment -- the best by far is the one he did with Ormandy round about 1959 and maybe the best I know. For the Appassionata go for Serkin without any perhaps, either his studio recording or better still his recently reissued 1957 recital.<br />To this  'No, no, no' (to quote Mrs Thatcher.)teresting - his earlier performance from 1960 or so has a fast and incandescent first movement, in his later performance he goes slow for reasons presumably known to himself.

B00005QZ7U|3.0|I did enjoy watching this movie, but it isn't one that I would recommend buying.  If you've seen it once, you don't need to see it again.<br />Nicole Kidman does a good job---I'm going to go out on a limb here, but I don't think she will win the Oscar over this one.  Her singing voice is pleasant as is Ewan McGregor's (but I wouldn't recommend that they switch careers).  <br />About the direction: quite frankly, some of it made me a bit dizzy.  I understand that the director wanted to make the scene seem more &quot;fast-paced,&quot; etc., but when the audience feels a bit queezy, that is not such a good thing.<br />Bottom line: rent it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.
B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection delivers all the main hits by Madonna from the early 80's to aroung 1990. Although there are still a few hits missing (\\"Dress You Up,\\" \\"Who's That Girl,\\"etc...), the Immaculate Collection delivers the goods. The cd starts out with the early 80's hit \\"Holiday\\" a nice, fun song, with a very happy beat. There is also the sorta bubble gum poppish sounding song- \\"Lucky Star\\" on the album. Madonna's hit \\"Borderline\\" which is also featured on first self-titled album, is a song about love. \\"Live a Virgin\\" the controversial song with a very controversial performance at the 1984 Video Music Awards is sure to get you into a good mood. \\"Into the Groove\\" which appeared on Madonna's movie, Desperately Seeking Susan, is sure to make you get into the groove for dancing. The slow, but powerful songs inlude \\"Live to Tell\\" and \\"Crazy For You\\". As the cd continues Madonna's voice sounds more mature and her songs start focusing more on sex. The hip song \\"Express Yourself\\" which has a steamy music video (not included on the Immaculate Collection, unfortunately:( ) has a good dance beat. There is the very elegant lady-like song \\"Vogue\\" the 1990 hit is featured on the Collection. There are two extra, experimental songs featured on the album- \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\". \\"Justify My Love\\" well...what can I say about it? Madonna'a sexy whispering voice creates the perfect sound and pulls off this song. The music video for \\"Justify My Love\\" was banned from MTV and VH1 for so much sexual and homosexual content. \\"Rescue Me\\" has a very disco, 70's ish feel to it.<br />Madonna was still hot in the 90's, but I personally like her beginning sounds much better. I liked how she constantly changed her image all the time, never knowing what she would do next to create controversiary.<br />The Immaculate Collection is by one of Madonna'a greatest albums out there. It is filled with the 80's hits by Madonna which will please everyone. I highly recommend this cd! Buy it! You won't be disappointed!
B00000I3JO|5.0|Every album by The Blue Nile should be in your collection if you are a lover of what music is really about... creating a soundscape... drawing out emotion.  This album makes you want to fall in love.  Full of melancholy and sincerity and truth about love and emotion.  As another reviewer has written, this album is not at all dated... it's just as beautiful now as it was when it was released.  If you are looking to get away from the emotionless tripe being slung at us on the radio today and really fall in love with music again... buy this CD... or any other from The Blue Nile.  You will not be disappointed.  Just close your eyes... listen... and fall in love.
B00005RYLE|4.0|That's what a previous reviewer called this film. I strongly disagree. It seems to me that he failed to realise that this film wasn't intented to be a dark comedy. It's a horror movie. And the purpose of a horror move is to scare and shock us (which this flick does quite well). Not to make us laugh. He went on to compare this film to porn. How can you compare the two??? Unlike porn in which the sex is pretty much real, the violence and gore in this film is SIMULATED. I've seen this movie a few times and of course the first time it scared the hell out of me! But during repeated viewings one cannot help but laugh at the bad acting and the cheesy (though gruesome) effects. It's not seeing a person getting mutilated that gets a chuckle out of me, it's the hokeyness of it! Anyways, I'm through venting. <BR>      This is probably my least favorite of the ED trilogy but when I saw a picture of this collectible edition I had to get it! The same illustrated pages within the Necronomicon in the film can be found in the cover! (I'm still having a hard time deciphering the text) There's also a nifty little booklet included. Of course there are alot of extra goodies within the DVD itself with a couple of hidden surprises! My favorite was the 'Fanalysis' feature with Bruce Campbell himself. There's only 2 small problems however. On the inside back cover of the book the DVD is enclosed in a tight plastic sleeve. It's a struggle to get the disc out without scratching it up. Unlike the actual Necronomicon in the movie this edition isn't made of human flesh but judging from the way it smells you'd think it was. It stank up my whole room the evening I brought it home! But other than that I'm pretty damn satisfied. If only more movies had specials editions as cool as this!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's CD is definitely a rare find in music today.  Think about it... in describing most &quot;alternative&quot; albums these days you can easily begin the discussion with &quot;they sound like a mix between so-and-so and so-and-so&quot;.  John Mayer's album is to contemporary music as the screenplay for &quot;Memento&quot; is to contemporary film... a unique voice in an overprocessed, super-homogenized world.
B00005TT77|4.0|After seeing the film I rushed out to find the soundtrack. I think this is a refreshing way to listen to the songs we all know and love from the Beatles. This soundtrack reminds me of the way the group &quot;Me first and the Gimme Gimmes&quot; remakes old songs. Entertaining! I especially love Sarah McLachlin's version of &quot;Blackbird&quot;. I'm also a new fan of Rufus Wainright and was happy to hear him. This is a fun album!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Traditionally, I listen to rhythm and blues and rap music.  But I have been known to go outside that genre and listen to other forms of music.  I bought this CD because listening to some of the songs they play on the radio isn't so bad.  So I told myself to invest in this CD and I find that it is a worthy investment.  I would get criticized for listening to classic rock.  However, I could care less what others think and what sounds good to my ears.  This CD I am giving five points because I liked listening to it over and again; even when I am exercising.
0671004107|5.0|Let me first say I'm not a &quot;reader&quot; by nature, so it's rare for me to say that I &quot;love&quot; a book.  This book is deserving of the &quot;love&quot; label, because once it grabs your attention, it doesn't let go.  I seem to have a short attention span usually, but Carl Sagan wrote a great novel that doesn't overtake the reader with too much scientific mumbo-jumbo.  There is science stuff every once in awhile, but nothing that overpowers the reader -- it's VERY easy to understand.<br />The story goes very in-depth with each character, but leaves just enough questions in the readers mind to keep up suspense.  If you liked the movie, you'll like the book.  If you hated the movie, you should read the book -- it explains SO much (they are very similar, excluding a couple things).  Great book overall.
B000059XUY|3.0|Disney's retelling of _Oliver Twist_ contains equal parts street smarts and kiddie schmaltz.  Although the film starts out with energy and attitude to spare, it slowly runs out of steam.<br />The film is worth a rental for the terrific voice talent: Billy Joel as a scruffy \\"Artful Dodger,\\" Bette Midler as a diva doggie, and Cheech Marin as a bug-eyed chihuahua.  Too bad the film's other characters -- including, sadly, the nominal protagonist -- are so bland and colorless in comparison.<br />_Oliver & Company_ marks several \\"firsts\\" for the Disney studio.  It was the first cartoon feature to make extensive use of computer animation.  It was also the first Disney film to feature a song with lyrics by Howard Ashman (and for all you trivia buffs, that song is the unmemorable \\"Once Upon a Time in New York City,\\" sung by Huey Lewis).<br />I'll end this review with a warning: Cheech Marin's performance takes every negative Hispanoamerican stereotype known to humankind and works it to the wall.  Most of the shtick is clearly improvised, a lone-gun variation on Cheech and Chong's infamous \\"stoner\\" comedy of the '70s and early '80s.  Is it funny?  Yes, but it's still deeply offensive.  Buyer beware.
0812550706|3.0|Ender is an extremely mature child in my opinion compared to the childlike figures that are typically seen in books. I was blown away with the language he used when speaking to his siblings and other characters. I was surprised by Ender's high sense of guilt and wrong. Throughout the book he has an inner struggle about what he deems to be right and wrong. To be so young, he has a strong sense of responsibility of his actions. He also has a strong sense of integrity that I would not have expected to see in someone his age. Ender is presented in my opinion as a boy trying to find himself in a world where how he feels and what he thinks is unimportant. It is mind blowing to read the level of knowledge Ender has at such a young age and how he reacts to being a Third. I found it equally interesting to understand the notion of there being a Third, the idea of it reminded me of Gattica, where people in the society had to have permission to have children and the goal of having children was to create perfect beings. The course of the story takes you on a series of adventures that seem like a life like game of the future. If you like science fiction or books with a space age feel, you'll love Ender's Game. I personally do not like this genre, but found Ender's Game to be worth the time it took for me to read it.
6304383827|5.0|I am an 18 year old male, who writes reviews on scientific books, likes sports, and cares nothing about novels. But this movie, and the book, are absolutely great. The way Austen, and the movie, capture a timeless struggle in society is compelling. This is my favorite romantic-comedy-in-victorian-times movie (actually, regency era, not victorian), without a doubt.It actually makes you change mood as the characters do. The cast is simply magnificent, and Paltrow is absolutely brilliant as Emma...I should mention too that the movie is a pretty good adaptation of the novel, with the usual limitations of course.<BR>It is quite distressing to read other reviewers suggesting the storiline was [taken] from clueless....Jane Austen wrote Emma in the 1800's.
B00005JKYS|4.0|As much of the Vietnam War becomes forgotten except as it is experienced through the movies about it, this movie is an important addition to the genre.<br />... The story told here is an honest one about brothers in arms who went where their country sent them and did what they were asked to do. The message is not dissimilar to that seen in many WWII movies but severely lacking in movies about this conflict which seem to find more \\"truth\\" in such movies as \\"Platoon\\".  While that, too, is a great film, it must be remembered that the acts portrayed in it were the exception, rather than the rule.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" examines the first battles of the Ia Drang Valley in 1965. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) and a force of some 400 men defend a vulnerable position from attack by as many as 4,000 North Vietnamese entrenched in the surrounding mountains. The tactics, the motivations, the emotions and, ultimately, the terrible cost are examined through the eyes of Moore, his top Sergeant (played flawlessly by Sam Elliot), Moore's wife (Madeleine Stowe), an intrepid chopper pilot (Greg Kinnear) and a photojournalist (Barry Pepper).<br />The battle scenes are realistic - though not quite as harrowing as \\"Black Hawk Down\\" - and the characters are more clearly drawn than in that film.<br />Overall, this is an excellent look at true heroism and moral conviction in the face of adversity and almost overwhelming odds.
0195073401|2.0|I personally consider this book inaccessible to those who do not equip with sufficient knowledge in mathematics.  You can easily find that this book covers no further insight at all than Intermediate Microeconomics by Varain, but transforms intuitive concepts into incomprehensible mathematical equations.  If you're not interested in becoming a PhD in Economics, simply forget this book.
0804106304|5.0|In some ways it seems redundant to add to the other reviews of this book-- but I recently revisited it, having read it over ten years ago, and was reminded of why I loved it the first time.  The structure of Tan's narrative-- going back &amp; forth between time lines and mother/daughter stories-- made it more interesting.  The way women repeat the mistakes of our mothers if we do not know them, the way women are taught (not just in Chinese American but all American) to keep disappointment to yourself-- all of these themes rang true for me, too.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is so complex that while I was watching it and my husband asked me a question, it was like I was waking from a deep sleep-- I was so engrossed in what was happening that I was completely unaware of my surroundings.  The effect of the narration jumping back &amp; forth in time is that you feel as confused as the protagonist-- you think &quot;what the heck?&quot;  as you go along, only to figure it out as you go.  In the end, you feel saddened by the way the people who the protagonist comes to rely upon use him for their own reasons.  What a fascinating concept-- no short term memory!
0790733226|2.0|Read The Book.<br />A brilliantly written saga dedicated to furthering mankind's intellect, outlook, and inner peace.  <br />The movie didn't understand that.  It is dedicated to furthering the career of Jodi Foster.  Little beyond that.<br />Even if I am wrong (which happens), please read the book before embarking on the magical, mystical voyage of cliches that you will presented with here.  You will be a better person for it.
B00005K3OT|4.0|The majority of reviewers liked Chocolat. Those who didn't generally felt it was too sentimental and improbable. It isn't cutting edge and isn't designed to appeal to people craving action and adventure, but it is to me a delightful fable, a kind of fairy tale for adults. I think it works on its intended level, which is that of a sweet, delicious confection. And it's cast includes Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin and Judy Dench, four actors who can do no wrong in my book. <br />The time appears to be the 1950s, and the place is one of those quaint French villages you see on postcards and in posters. The town's mayor, Comte de Reynard [Alfred Molina], is from a family of pious and benevolent aristocrats who have ruled over the town for centuries. Life is quiet and orderly, and the center of activity and social life is the local Catholic church, where the young priest allows the mayor to edit his sermons for him. Everyone seems to believe that contentment equals happiness, but the truth is that the utter predictability of life there has led to utter dullness. One day a fierce north wind begins to blow and almost literally brings to the town Vianne [Binoche] and her young daughter. Vianne rents a dingy old shop from a bitter old woman called Armande [Dench]. She transforms it into an enchanted place full of the fabulous chocolates she makes. She doesn't attend church and has the nerve to open her shop in the midst of Lent, a time when all good Catholics deny themselves pleasure. The mayor is incensed and does all he can to close the place down, but, one by one, the residents discover that the chocolates are more than just delicious. They have magic powers to change lives for the better. This, of course, makes the mayor even angrier. Things get even worse [or better, depending on your point of view] when a group of river gypsies, led by Roux [Depp], land in town. <br />The beautiful Binoche, who is French, is the perfect choice for Vianne. The worldly Dench andOlin fit right in. And what about Depp, who has done rather well for a high school dropout from Paducah, Kentucky? It may surprise you to know that he has lived in France for several years, and, so, if he seems right at home, it's because he is. Oddly, though, he uses an Irish accent here. <br />The photography is excellent and uses deep, rich colors that are most appropriate for the story and the setting. Director Lasse Hallstrom's other recent films, The Cider House Rules and My Dog Skip, are among my favorites. His forte is movies in which characters and their stories are the dominant features. <br />I say this is a movie for adults because the subtleties of its story will be lost on most children. As good as it is, it is not my favorite film about the magical powers of food and cooking. That honor belongs to a superb Mexican movie, 1992's Like Water for Chocolate.
B00004TH83|4.0|Lara Fabian reminds me of Celine Dion. On LARA FABIAN she kind-of sounds like her too. The first song I heard by Lara was \\"I will love again.\\" What a great song that is. So, I bought the CD and now I'm a fan. The CD is filled with some great adult contemporary/top 40 material. Lara's voice is amazing. She's got a rich, full-bodied voice. I don't know how else to describe it. It's well rounded lets say. <br />Lara Fabian begins each song with gentle, smooth singing and then it builds and builds. Then she gets dramatic. She sings with passion from beginning to end. Highlights include \\"part of me\\", \\"giving up on you\\" \\"I am who I am\\", and I especially like \\"love by grace.\\" Of course \\"I will love again\\" is included too. The Italian version of \\"Adagio\\" is also a nice touch.<br />Lara did a lot of writing on the album. I think she wrote almost every song on here. If you're a fan of pop vocal get this CD. You'll enjoy it.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|\\"Zoolander\\", an affable satirical comedy about male models in the New York high fashion scene, is marred by some unfortunate script choices and a tendency to fixate on its own cleverness. Still, it is one of the funnier movies from 2001, a year that showed a further deterioration in the art of making screen comedies. We can only hope that this decline will be reversed one day. <br />Derek Zoolander [Ben Stiller], the hottest model around, is trying to win top honors in VH-1's Fashion Awards for the fourth year in a row. It's a good thing for him that he's really, really, really good-looking because he is also really, really, really dumb. When he loses to arch rival Hansel [Owen Wilson], he goes into a tail spin. He announces to his manager, Maury [Jerry Stiller], that he's quitting. Modeling is so shallow, he says, and he'd rather do something meaningful, such as founding The Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Don't Read Good and Want to Do Other Stiff Good Also. Maury must find a way to make him change his mind, because the kingpins of fashion plan to brainwash Derek and force him to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, who has vowed to end child labor in his country. This idea, they reason, will be the beginning of the end of cheap labor and will ruin the industry.<br />Stiller, who also directed, makes Zoolander one of the funniest characters in ages. The wispy, Marilyn Monroe-like voice, the exaggerated facial expressions, the body language, and the fractured syntax of every phrase he utters made me laugh out loud. Also hysterical are Wilson and Ben's real dad, Jerry. <br />In expanding \\"Zoolander\\" from what was originally a brief mock documentary made in 1996, the writers made a decision so bad that it seems like something Derek himself would have thought of. What possessed them to make the victim the leader of a real country? It's not as though the movie has any political statements to make. The assassination attempt is merely a plot device. It doesn'twork at all and changing it and one other element might have made \\"Zoolander\\" a real comic gem, rather than a movie that works just part of the time. That other element is something several recent comedies have been guilty of. Whenever the characters get serious or `genuinely' emotional with each other, dreadful, faux film score music (always piano and violins!) starts playing quietly in the background. In the `dumbing down' theory of film making, this is the signal to viewers that they are now to change their mood. I would suggest that such a musical cue in a comedy works only if it leads to a punch line. In \\"Zoolander\\" all it leads to is the next scene. It's extraneous and annoying.
B000002G30|3.0|...POWERTRIP and SPINE OF GOD, Monster Magnet delivered with DOPES TO INFINITY. Starting off with weird noises and stomping, sabbathtesque riffing, the title track welcomes you once again to the weird world of Dave Wyndorf. The magnet changed with every album but DOPES is, as another reviewer already pointed out their first steps in the later mass-appeal direction. The songs themselves are still spaced enough to satisfy fans of SPINE OF GOD and SUPERJUDGE but there is less disortion and the songwriting seems more focused. Is that a good thing? Less and no.<br />On one hand, DOPES is a great spaced-out listening experiences. Songs like &quot;All friends and Kingdom come&quot;, &quot;Third Alternative&quot; or the mind-boggeling Doors tribute &quot;Dead Christmas&quot; are among the best Magnet songs ever written. Wyndorf is at his lyrical over-the-toppiest, telling us how he found &quot;the heart of forever&quot; but he's &quot;never gonna tell you why!&quot;. The instrumentals &quot;Ego, the living Planet&quot; &amp; &quot;Theme from Masterburner&quot; completely deliver, the first mentioned interrupted by Dave screaming &quot;I talk to planets baby&quot;. The whole album is unique and beautiful crafted, every riff here just plain rocks. <br />On the other hand, this album sounds way too clear and produced to really get going ( like SPINE did ). Overproduction is the word, you'll be fighting against thinking how this may have sounded if they kept things a bit more, you know, basic. In short, DOPES is a polished Magnet, not yet as polished as POWERTRIP but still polished. Even though all the songs are 100% Wyndorf, there is actually very little to discover when compared to SPINE. I know I sound like a purist but hell, if a Band made a milestone like SOG, it's hard not to compare their other efforts to the one that is a pure classic. And from this POV, DOPES sounds like Disney stuff.<br />On it's own, the album rocks. But they could have done better. Dopes is still agreat listen, in fact, if you're new to Monster Magnet, you should start with this album. It contains everything that makes Monster Magnet a great rockin' band. But SPINE was way more than just a brilliant album from a great rockin' band...
B00003CXSP|4.0|Novelist Thomas Harris has written three books about Hannibal Lecter - The Silence of the Lambs, its prequel, Red Dragon, and the sequel, Hannibal. The books, with their scenes of graphic and horrific violence, are more readable than they are filmable. This has not stopped Hollywood, of course, which has even filmed Red Dragon twice - once in 1986 as Manhunter and now under the original title in a version due to be released in 2002. <br />Hannibal nearly didn't become a movie. In his books, Harris created two famous characters, Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling, whom Jodie Foster recreated for the movie of Silence of the Lambs. Ms. Foster won the Oscar for best actress, and the role became the one for which she is most famous. Hannibal's problems arose after Foster declined to play Starling again. The book's ending showed the character doing things Foster felt her Clarice would never do. This is a classic case of artistic differences. Harris had created his version of Starling, and Foster had created another one. Eventually it was agreed that the ending would be changed, but, by then, Foster was no longer available. Getting Hopkins to agree to do Lecter again had never been a problem. Luckily, the producers discovered that another enormously talented actress, Julianne Moore, was available, and project was saved. <br />This movie takes place several years after Dr. Lecter's escape from a mental institution, and he's still on the loose. Clarice remains with the FBI. She isn't the naive young woman she was when she first did battle with the demented doctor. She's a seasoned veteran and has a hard edge to her. Just as she begins to suspect that Lecter has resurfaced in Florence, Italy, she gets involved in a botched FBI operation and is suspended from the bureau. This slows her down but hardly stops her pursuit of him, as she and Lecter are inevitably drawn together through the strange and twisted bond they established long ago. Meanwhile, in Italy, local police inspector Rinaldo Palli [Giancarlo Gianinni], who is more interested in the huge reward posted by one of Lecter's victims than in justice, is about to learn that the doctor is not someone you play dangerous games with. <br />Once more Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Lecter. He's such a great actor that he could probably entertain us just by reading from a telephone directory. It's not his fault that the character is not quite as interesting this time. One of the most fascinating things about him in Silence of the Lambs was the fact that he was confined to a cell and had to use his mind to envision what Clarice was telling him. Since he is free in Hannibal, the role doesn't require Hopkins to use quite so many acting skills. Moore does well in the rather thankless job of replacing Foster. She wisely doesn't attempt to duplicate any mannerisms her predecessor used. She playa Starling as she might have been when she was older. Ray Liotta is sufficiently sleazy as a government official who is Starling's arch nemesis. Gary Oldham has a major role, but he isn't listed in the opening credits and is impossible to recognize except in one short flashback. <br />I have some fairly major complaints about the movie. The script isn't as strong as Lambs' was because it veers away from the psychological aspects. This makes it far less chilling on an intellectual level. Much of its violence is gratuitous and seemingly meant to gross the viewer out. I know you can do all sorts of tricks with computer generated graphics, but does that mean you should use them just because you can? If, for example, you graphically show someone's being eaten alive by pigs, as Hannibal does, it produces an instintive fear in most people, but, ultimately, too much of this stuff results in mere cheap thrills and brings down the level of the movie's quality.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I didn't stop laughing this entire movie. It was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, and very clever! Reese Witherspoon gives an incredible comedic performance, and Selma Blair shines as the bitchy law student who &quot;steals&quot; Reese's character's boyfriend. All in all, an excellent movie with a superb cast!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|NOTE: Written August 2001<br />Though 2001 is far from over, it's not to early to say that Memento is one of the Top Ten movies of the year. This outstanding suspense thriller gets just about everything right. It's stylish, tricky, clever and intriguing. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, leaves you guessing and causes you to debate it with the people you watched it with. If it has a fault, it's that it pays no mind to the modern phenomenon of limited attention spans. Pay attention or be lost.<br />The movie opens with a shot of a hand waving a Polaroid snapshot. But, wait a minute! This photo isn't coming into focus, it's fading away. We are going backwards. Each scene shows what happened before the preceding scene. Because of the marvelous way it is edited, it isn't that hard to follow. The result is not so much one of confusion as it is one that demonstrates how tricky memory can be. <br />The protagonist, Leonard [Guy Pearce], has anterograde memory loss, which is a condition that makes it impossible to make new memories. This condition is the result an injury he received on the night his wife was brutally murdered. He attempted to save her, or that's the way he remembers it. Now he is on a quest to find her killer. This is an almost impossible task for him. If he meets someone, he won't remember doing so ten minutes later. If someone talks to him too long, he won't remember the first of the conversation. It makes him easy to victimize, and, along the way, he meets several characters who do just that. At the same time, we slowly begin to wonder if Leonard is, in fact, a victim. There is something not quite right with his story. <br />Leonard's long term memory is perfectly intact. He remember everything from before the injury. He has a methodical personality and uses all sorts of tricks to help him remember things now. He constantly writes notes. He uses Polaroids to remind him of who he has met and where he has been. He even goes so far as to have pertinent facts tattooed on this body, so that when he wakes up every morning, he will remember his mission. It is important to note that Leonard isn't looking for justice. He's seeking revenge. <br />Guy Pearce is stunning as Leonard. His role is much more difficult than he makes it appear to be because he must create in us empathy and understanding for a character who, because of his condition, basically has no personality we can relate to. How do you relate to someone who never remembers he's ever met you? A bond could never exist. Yet Pearce does make us care about Leonard.<br />This is director Christopher Nolan's second film. His first, which was shot on video and is in black and white, is so obscure you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who's seen it. After Memento, be promises to be a very recognizable creative talent. <br />There is something reassuring to me about this movie's success. [People] have voted Memento number eleven on [a] site's list of best movies ever made. While I might not rank it that high on my own list, the important point is that, of the 12,000 plus votes cast, about half came from people under twenty-five years old. This group rated it even higher than older voters. The fact that all those kids can be so impressed by a literate, intelligent movie that has no special effects and no pop music soundtrack is something that others in Hollywood should pay attention to. Perhaps the business would be well served by more movies that challenge their audiences.
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot is the heart and soul of hard rock.  There is no other that can compare to the power and emotion of Corey, the lead singer.  This CD, as well as Slipknot's previous album, helps me relax after a hard day.  The only downside is that the CD starts out strong with the first few tracks, but starts to lose some of it's hardcore edge as the final tracks begin to play.  But that's just my opinion.  I say, buy this CD, you won't be sorry.
0385503954|5.0|...and that's saying a lot, because this author has produced some of the most well-constructed, intelligent and -- my opinion -- lasting works of our time.  I knew after reading his last novel, AMSTERDAM (winner of the 1998 Booker Prize), that the follow-up would have to be something special -- and this incredible novel is definitely that.  I've read that this novel just missed winning the Booker Prize for 2001.<br />McEwan's characters are, as his readers have come to expect, expertly and completely developed here -- even without one of them acting as the narrator (until the last short section of this novel), it is as if we are INSIDE them, experiencing everything that they experience.  Placing these characters within as story that spans more than 60 years of the 20th century, a story that is simultaneously timeless and excruciatingly evocative of its setting in place and time, he has delivered a work that is both immediately entertaining and filled with insight into the human character and struggle.<br />The author's research into the times covered by the book -- especially of the British experience of World War II, both at home and in the European theatre -- adds immense vitality and meat to his story.  The horrors and emotions, the physical and mental suffering, and the pain and death of WWII are brought to life in such a way as to break your heart.  The characters' actions -- and their consequences -- played out in these surroundings bring out facets of their humanity that have many revelations and lessons for us.<br />The young girl who sets things in motion -- thirteen years old at the outset of the book -- is Briony Tallis.  Her family is well-off enough for them to live comfortably in a large house in the Surrey countryside.  The youngest of three children, she is adored by her siblings and parents (although her father is a rather distant, frequently absent figure).  She is intelligent and precocious, writing stories as a form of personal expression, which are well-received with kudos from her family.  One day in the summer of 1935, she witnesses events she does not understand -- she is a child, after all, and lacks the emotional tools with which to deal with adult situations.  Her reaction to the event is understandably skewed -- but it is her subsequent lie that sets the story rolling.  The consequences of her actions change the lives of all those around her -- and her own as well -- forever.  McEwan skillfully employs Briony's writing efforts to show us -- and Briony -- the power and responsibility that it embodies.  By the story's end -- and I'll give away no more about the plot, you should savor it for yourself -- I was incresingly unsure what was real and what was a product of her fantasies and imagination.<br />The book is of moderate length -- at 300 pages -- but a quick, stimulating read.  While it is very revelatory about human nature and the struggle -- internal and external -- of good and evil, it is extremely entertaining and compelling, another lasting literary contribution from this talented writer.  Some of his other novels -- all of which I highly recommend -- include THE CEMENT GARDEN, THE COMFORT OF STRANGERS, THE INNOCENT, and THE CHILD IN TIME (winner of the Whitbread Prize in 1987).  His writing is filled with darkness as well as light, always intelligent -- one of my favorite writers.are well-received with kudos from her family.

B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie suffers from mixed reviews.  People Love it or Hate it (on the net, anyways.  Most folks I know in the real world think it's a fine addition to the Star Wars universe).  No denying that or the fact that one side probably will never change how the other side feels about it.  I myself, I love it. It's not as good as the original Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back, but it's on par with Return of the Jedi, which still puts it in my top 4 all time favorite flicks :) <br />The biggest problem I have with it is the Gungan/Battle Droid battle.  It's just a little too video game looking there.  Other than that, the FX were amazing.  Liam Neeson totally embodies the status of Jedi Master.  Jar Jar may be annoying, but his presense is not ruinous to the movie.  I could go on and on, but there's no need.  Everyone has an opinion on the movie, and now you know mine.  Let's talk DVD.<br />Everyone raves about \\"The Beginning\\" documentary, and it deserves it.  But I couldn't help but think I could easily watch another hour or two of it.  As imformative as it is, it still seems only the tip of the iceberg for the making of the movie. The web docos were all nice, I enjoyed each and every one.  Lot of info in those few minutes.  I liked the deleted scenes, but I know there are more out there, so come on George, cough 'em up!  It was also nice to see the previews and trailers again.  They are well put together and still get the anticipation pumping to see the movie even after watching it numerous times.  Also a very imformative commentary from George and the Team at the Ranch.<br />This is a well stocked DVD and worth the wait.  It's saying something when the movie's detractors are raving over the DVD, but as a big fan of the flick, it's simply over the top.  Well done, George, my man, and bring on the Clones!
B00003CXXO|2.0|Let me start with the ending first.  This part was a total unnecessarily drawn out, and over emotional part of the film.  I agree with another reviewer, stop the film when the boy finally finds the blue fairy.  That was his goal throughout the movie.  There were few moments of joy in this robot's immortal life, all the pain the we are forced to witness just makes you emotionally numb at the end and checking your watch waiting for the ending (if you haven't turned the movie off already).  It started promising enough, with a good concept, but Spielberg made it too hard to bond with the little creature that was nothing but an embodiment of pain and loneliness.  The film is visually beautiful, but without a strong story, it is an overall disappointment.
1884737994|5.0|My husband got this book.  He is totally into Mt. Biking and of course, with serious Mt. Biking comes the maintenance that goes along with it.  This book is like a tool to keep your Bike running at its best.  You or the person you buy this for won't be disappointed with the information it provides.
B00004XPPK|5.0|This film is rightly celebrated as Rita Hayworth's greatest film.  Certainly, it contains her most famous visual moment, and what is probably one of the most famous images in the history of film.  People recognize this shot, even if they have never seen GILDA.  George Maccready is escorting his right hand man Glenn Ford up the staircase of his mansion, telling him about his new bride.  As they reach the top of the stairs, he calls out to his wife, \\"Gilda, are you decent?\\"  The camera jumps into the dressing room, to a tight close up of a woman with her hair thrown forward so she can brush it out.  Gilda dips her head, throws back her hair, reveals her beautiful face, and almost mockingly replies, \\"Who, me?\\"  The way she responds, we instantly know that we are dealing with a thoroughly bad woman.<br />Make no mistake about it:  this film is about people doing inconceivably nasty things to one another.  Gilda isn't so much a loose woman as she is a woman intent on revenge.  She has married Maccready because she learned that his right hand man was in fact her former lover.  In fact, the man she still loved, but who had treated her badly.  So, she marries him to enact her revenge on her ex.  And that is just the beginning of the nastiness that people inflict on one another in this film.<br />There are so many stunning moments in the film.  There is, of course, her rendition of \\"Put the Blame on Mame.\\"  There is an unbelievable strip scene which is not merely one of the sexiest scenes in the history of film but one of the least revealing, for, in the end, her \\"strip\\" consists of removing a single glove.<br />The narrative of the film breaks down a bit near the end of the film, keeping the movie just short of complete perfection.  But that really isn't all that bad, since this film is mainly a study in the dynamics between three people.  And thanks to Hayworth, Ford, and Maccready, that love triangle is, at every point, a thing of extreme fascination.  Special mention should also be made of the excellent supporting role played by the Joseph Calleia, as the police detective.<br />The great irony of the film is that while it was Hayworth's greatest triumph, it was also the last truly great film in her career.  Although she was excellent in A LADY FROM SHANGHAI just a couple of years after this one, virtually all her best roles came before GILDA.  But even if she made no other films than this one, GILDA alone was enough to guarantee that she would always be remembered as one of the most beautiful and sensual actresses in the movies.hould also be made of the excellent supporting role played by the Joseph Calleia, as the police detective.  <br />The great irony of the film is that while it was Hayworth's greatest triumph, it was also the last truly great film in her career.

B00005NNMK|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Final Countdown\\" (the song) the first time I heard it back in the '80s. But I didn't fully appreciate its well-crafted, smooth sound until I started listening to most of today's one-dimensional metal bands.<br />I decided to buy Europe's Final Countdown remastered CD after hearing the band Stratovarious, a group whose sound reminds me of Europe (see me review of Stratovarius' Infinite CD as to why). <br />What a cool CD! \\"The Final Countdown\\" is a lot of fun to hear again. So is \\"Rock the Night\\" (track two). John Norum's guitar style reminds me of Dokken's George Lynch. The layered, clean vocals (provided in large part by Joey Tempest) are so refreshing after listening to late '90s through 2002 rock vocalists (like the absymal Matthew Barlow of Iced Earth)! These songs are catchy, upbeat and produced with pristine precision.<br />I know John Norum is now with Dokken, but what happened to the rest of these guys?<br />Europe was rock when guitarists were shredders, vocalists were soaring and crystal clear (in other words, they could actually sing) and keyboardists added a lot of atmosphere and finesse.<br />If you like Dokken and other '80s hard rock/metal bands, you'll like Europe's Final Countdown CD.
B000006045|4.0|Many artists who classify themselves as trip-hop or downbeat don't hold a candle to this album. Deep, transendental, dark, laid-back, and ultimately satisfying, Massive Attack's third LP is their greatest. I liked &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Risingson&quot; was good, but I thought having two abstract vocalists on one song was kind of silly. &quot;Teardrops,&quot; now being featured on almost every &quot;chillout&quot; compilation, is very nice and soothing, featuring Portishead. The rest of the album is nice and deep, with those trademark sinister-but-harmless vocals that made Massive Attack famous. A nice album.
B000050XEI|5.0|I love this album.  It's calm and soothing.  It's a gem to listen to when you just feel like relaxing.  This album is nearly perfect, except that it IS short.  Oh well, but the music produced by Enya is of superb quality and she meets up to her standards very well.  Enya has now become one of my favorite music artists, because she is truly one.  This album's a keeper.

B00005BJ2O|4.0|Unfortunately, I haven't seen this movie YET... but I'm sure I would probably love it more if I had seen this movie.  <br />I love this soundtrack, it's really lively and a pleasure to listen to.  I'm glad I decided to buy it.
0385335482|4.0|If you are into fashion and shopping, you will love this book. The main character sometimes reminded me of myself - juggling the payments just to have that new fashion item!  A nice, light-hearted read.
B00005JKNF|1.0|What could these first-rate British actors have been thinking of when they agreed to play meager parts in this second-rate Altman film! ... And American audiences and movie critics who fell all over themselves to extol this film! PLEASE! What was it, the accents?...Maggie Smith's character was bitchy and mean-spirited - a part she can play in her sleep.  And to what purpose - to make fun of Ivor Novello (wonderfully played by Jeremy Northam), one of the few interesting characters in the film. Her part made no sense at all.  When this film is reviewed again - say ten years from now - it will be seen as a shabby, hackneyed film.
B000002KHF|5.0|This is a wonderful recording by Van Morrison.It is one of his earliest recordings as a solo performer. The CD contains the familiar Moondance, but the highlight for me is the first track: the beautiful And It Stoned Me. Van's words paint a glorious picture. The music on this album makes its way straight to the heart and touches the soul. If you are a longtime fan of Van Morrison this is a must have CD for your collection. If you are curious about Van's music this is an excellent introduction. There is no performer like Van Morrison. He is an amazing musician and Moondance is an amazing album.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a very exciting book. The fact that Ender is six years old when he is called for duty leaves the reader wanting to learn more. It is not an everyday thing that a young child is called off for duty in battle school. Ender also has has a monitor in the back of his neck since he was born. This may seem like a simple device, but the monitor kept track of everything Ender did. Then Ender lost his monitor, which completely changed his life. Later on the same day he lost his monitor, Ender got in a fight with some boys at school. There were many boys against him and they were much larger than him. In the end, Ender used his wit and not his muscles to defeat the boys. Since Ender could take on the boys, Col. Graff visited him that day. The colonel asked Ender to go with him. This spot in the novel is one of the most important parts in the novel because Ender has a very tough choice to make. He can either go with Graff to train to save the world, or he can stay at home with his brother, Peter, and sister, Valentine and live a normal life. In the end, he chooses to go with Graff. These scenes are what make the novel very interesting and compelling. There are other instances of this in the novel. For example, when Ender had just boarded the space shuttle, he was confronted by a group of kids, much like his previous fight at school. Once again, Ender uses his thinking skills and gets himself out of trouble. Even though he uses his mind at first rather than his fists, Ender does not completely hide from trouble. The fact that Ender uses his mind to hit people makes the story even better. Because Ender had kicked the kids, he now has a sense of guilt that hangs over him through out the entire novel. The guilt that he has makes the novel even more interesting. When Ender finally has to defeat the buggers, he over comes this guilt for a brief moment and destroys the entire fleet of ships, thus saving Earth. Ender's Game is a very interesting and easy to read to book.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie came as a huge surprise on me in a very positive way. Once in a while there are screenwriters and/or directors who really want to do something extraordinary to impress the viewers of their production. As an example, Groundhog Day had the main character relive the same day over and over again for ages until he finally got the girl of his dreams in the end, and it worked. Fight Club also gave you an intense story where two very different characters slowly evolved to a movie climax rarely seen, because to most people the answer to all the story's conflicts is to unimaginable. A closer example to \\"Memento\\" is \\"The Usual Suspects\\" from 1994, which gave you a very exciting story set in the criminal underworld run by Kayzer Zose, a man everybody fears but no one knows who he is...a lot like the main character in \\"Memento.\\"<br />The story is about insurance investigator Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. Leonard got injured after intervening on his wife's murder. The murderer was still there when Leonard walked in on them, thus the main character ended up with a cracked skull (figuratively speaking).<br />The movie's opening scene is where most crime stories would end; the main character gets his wife's murderer. The rest of the movie is built upon the fragments of memories that led Leonard getting his guy, in other words this movie is kind of told backwards, starting from the mentioned opening scene and ending where the whole situation actually begun... sound confusing? Well, I was confused for about fifteen minutes but once I understood what was going on the rest was just pure genius. At one point I asked myself: \\"How can a story told backwards actually get more exciting by the minute?\\" As much as I would give you some information about this, you really have to see the movie for yourself to actually understand what a gem this really is. The tension curve is always rising, with an ending so surprisingly good that this movie is up there with stunners like aforementioned \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and \\"Fight Club.\\"<br />This is a totally unmissable movie for lovers of the crime/mystery genre.
B000002U82|5.0|What can I tell you about this CD that you haven't already heard? Besides the fact that this is Pink Floyd's masterpiece. Like Sgt Pepper is to the Beatles, Physical Graffiti and ZOSO to Led Zeppelin and Exile on Main Street to the Rolling Stones. Every song on this CD goes beyond mind blowing, and a clear fact that they don't make music like this these days. Now everything is electronic and voice computer-generated by know-it-all young brainless producers who have no idea that they wouldn't be here if it wasn't for giants like Pink Floyd. You can listen to DSOTM straight through without leaving the comfort of being disturbed....well I can. I can't deal with pop music today even though I grew up between the 70s and 80s. This is the CD to have in every household no matter what type of music you're into.
B00005QW5X|4.0|Maybe this movie is not for every one, yet maybe it is. On the surface it may seem to have a gay theme but really could apply to any one. In essence it's about finding true love. The music is the real star of this movie. Some of the best music and art direction to be filmed in years. I saw this movie after reading about it here on Amazon, and was glad I gave it a chance.<br />An East German transvestite that comes to America by way of batched sex change and false married to America GI. Then starts a Rock-N-Roll band. Along the way he/she has her songs stolen by a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and by strange luck she gets them back.<br />Once again, the music is the driving force. A Rock opera for the 21-century. Like Spinal tap, and Tommy taken to the next level. Out standing job by first time director Cameron Mitchell. Give this movie a look-see. I think you'll be very surprised.
B000002B30|5.0|All of Springsteen's classics are here on one disk, and this disk is great, from beginning to the end. Really there should have been two disks, some good songs are left off, but maybe that is for anither day.  Born to Run, Born in the USA, My Hometown, Glory Days, THe River, Thunder Road, and many more of his hits, plus three new songs are included. Really can't go wrong with this one, Springsteen fan or not.  ROCK ON.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Well,to begin this review I have to say that I expected this to be the real musical highlight of the year 2001 - who could be a better composer for the world`s most popular children`s book film adaption than John Williams. <BR>In fact,no one could be more suitable for the job. As I love the book I was rather excited to see the movie,and Williams did his work quite well. <BR>The score fits very well into the film,and it is a wonderfull experience to hear it when watching the movie.<BR>There are a few main themes which should might be noted. <BR>I should take those here,instead of going through the CD track by track (i`ll take it theme by theme)<BR>For the first,it is the main theme,known as Hedwig`s theme first heard in \\"Prologue\\",which is a rather mysterious opening track,with some christmas bells that makes it sound rather sweet. But he uses it to represent much more than just Harry`s owl - it is simply this theme that is the one you remember and the best really new theme on this album. Then we have the \\"Quidditch theme\\",which is given a magnificent representation<BR>in track 11,which is the best action cue on the disc,and may be the best in the entire film - it could best be described as a combination of the action music from \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\". Then we have the second main theme,first heard in \\"Harry`s Wondrous World\\" and then heard in some cues. It is a theme rather similar to Hook`s main theme,and to hear it in full presentation,I`d recommend you listening to track 18. <BR>Then,we have the menacing theme for the evil You-Know-Who (Voldemort!)which could almost be described as a companion to Imperial March,but a little simpler and more frightening. A pity it does only make one appearance on the disc,as that was a theme I really liked. He has,indeed,created a rather good score for this film. Well,do I have any negative comments about this music?Indeed I have. Unfortunatley,it did not fully lived up to my expectations. The film is,as you know,about \\"Magic\\",but unfortunatley,that`s pretty much what this score fails to deliver. The themes,with the exception of \\"Hedwig`s Theme\\"can almost be described as simple variants of the ones heard in Star Wars,Hook and Indiana Jones. <BR>So they are a bit too similar to William`s other scores to deliver the true magic which Williams would be able to deliver.<BR>The over all rating on this score is difficult to set,but here is my personal rating track-by track. <br />Prologue ***<BR>Harry`s Wondrous World *****<BR>The Arrival of Baby Harry ****<BR>A Visit to the Zoo/Letters from Hogwarts ***<BR>Diagon Alley & The Gringotts Vault****<BR>Platform Nine & Three Quarters/Journey to Hogwarts**<BR>The Great Hall/The Banquet**<BR>Mr Longbottom Flies***<BR>Hogwarts Forever & The Moving Stairs**<BR>Norbert,The Norwegian Ridgeback/A Change of Season****<BR>The Quidditch Match*****<BR>Christmas at Hogwarts***<BR>The Invisible Cloak/The Library Scene***<BR>Fluffy`s Harp****<BR>The Devil`s Snair***<BR>The Chess Game****<BR>The Face of Voldemort*****<BR>Leaving Hogwarts****<BR>Hedwig`s Theme**** <br />Anyhow,I can forgive him. He`s been very busy at this time,working with a lot of projects. <BR>Also,I think that the music works a little better in the film than it does on the album. There were several great cues and developed themes that did not appear on the album (especially Voldemort`s march). A pity!<BR>So it`s not the score itself that is bad & unoriginal,I think it`s just a bad music selection for the album. So my rating is 3.5 out of 5 or 7 out of 10. <BR>Though HP did not won the Academy Award it was at least nominated and therefore deserves some attention.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I love this CD. Although it isn't their best, its really close. Ixnay on the Hombre is my favorite, followed by Americana, then Smash and Conspiracy of one. All these are good. The older ones are more punk-ish though.
B000002J03|5.0|yes i am young, no i haven't got every led zeppelin album, but i still can tell you what i think of the album.  the 1st led zeppelin album i obviously bought with me not being around when it all happened was 'iv'.  well you know it had 'stairway to heaven' and 'misty mountain hop'.  i always thought that would be  my fave. led zeppelin album, but i was wrong!  this album is totally great!  i obviously already knew 'whole lotta love' and also 'what is and what should never be' and 'lemon song' from jimmy page and the black crowes 'live at the greek' (also a top quality album!)  my fave tracks on this album are 'ramble on' and 'living loving maid' (its sooo funky!)  but yeah i love to smoke the sacred herb and there aren't many better albums to smoke to than this!  sorry my review doesn't tell you much, but everyone frigging knows who and what led zeppelin did anyway, i just thought that it was an album that i deserved to have done a review too!  jimmy page ofcourse was a great guitar player and still is, although the stuff he played with the yardbirds kinda [stinks] (check out jeff beck era!) and there has only been a few great vocalists (jimi, steven tyler, axl rose, kurt cobain, warren haynes) and robert plant is definetley pretty close to the top of that list if not the top!  so there you go!  just get it if you dont own it!  you really are missing out!
0689815816|5.0|This book was first introduced to me as a preschool teacher at a private preschool in Maryland.  It was highly successful with ages 2-4, teaching the early principles of memorization!  What is always successful in an early educational book is keeping the fun in fundamentals!  If you can hold a two-year old's attention you know you have a winner!  This held the attention of 12 two year old children!  Terrific!

B0000508U6|3.0|I kinda like this CD, and I know that I'm not supposed to listen to the lyrics of pop, but I think these guys had some kind of psychic trauma involving spiders.  Or maybe the spiders are just a metaphor for how many times the singer messes up and has to apologize through the medium of song.  (I guess it works since his audience keeps letting him mess up again and again.)<br />Maybe I'm missing the irony, but it seems to me that if more than 50% of the album is devoted to apologizing... well, people who just apologize all the time aren't very sincere.  <br />Other than that, the sound is pretty generic by the third track.  The songs are pretty, but there's not a whole lot of breadth here.... but for pop music, it's not too terrible.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Love the song How You Remind Me. At least it has some melodic content with good drive. Chad Kroeger's vocal talents shine on this song. The rest of the CD was a incredible example of \\"What is this mess\\" A depressing succession of Wannabe Creed but have no REAL music/lyric writing talent. My prediction, one hit wonder with a small following. Buy the single.

B00005UW7V|5.0|The movie was incredible from start to finish, although I have seen reviews about how the ending was no good.  You just have to think about it, depending on the person you may feel differently about it.  But personally I enjoyed it and the idea of it all astounded me.
B00005UW7V|5.0|I cannot believe how many people degraded this movie.  I thought it was wonderful! I even cried towards the end.  Haley Joel Osmont is a great actor and plays a strong character in this film.  Yes, I admit that the film cuts off in the middle and you wonder, &quot;What does this have to do with the movie?&quot;  But it all ties in together.  It's all about the journey.  Searching for the &quot;one&quot; thing that David wants-to be a real boy.  And the special effects are great.  I have always been a fan of Modern and Future technology.  The future cars were really cool.  So I give this movie 5 stars.  Way to go Spielberg!!
B00005JKZQ|3.0|Showtime tells the tale of a relentless TV producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) in search for higher ratings, lands on the idea of a live reality show about cops.  She pairs up two completely different personalities as partners for the program, a no-nonsense LAPD detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) and an actor wanna-be patrol officer Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy.)  Now, with a camera tailing his every move and disrupting his life, Preston have to find a way to continue with an investigation that was botched up by Sellars.<br />Robert De Niro is a great actor, but when it comes to being a comedian he really isn't very good at it.  Take Analyze This for example, the movie was absolutely dull and was only saved from being an utter disaster by Billy Crystal.  He was a little better in Meet The Parents, but without Ben Stiller it probably wouldn't be as big of a hit.  With Showtime, De Niro gets the job done as the serious and the reluctant type, his acting is impeccable, but only a handful of his lines are actually funny.  Eddie Murphy on the hand is the same as in all his other movies, loud, obnoxious and able to squeeze out a laugh here and there.  So if you like his past works, you'll probably enjoy this film, otherwise don't expect anything different from him.  Rene Russo does a decent job in her supporting role, but she wasn't on screen long enough to make any difference or impact.<br />Let's face it, this is no Rush Hour (which was a lot more fun than Showtime,) the chemistry between the leads was alright, but good jokes were few and far between, even the attempts at a gag reel in the end was somewhat pathetic.  Overall a fairly mediocre movie, but ultimately a forgetful one.
B000007NWG|5.0|If more musicians/lyricists would add Syd Barrett to their dietery list, the quality of thier music &amp; lyrics would soar dramatically.  Robyn Hitchcock is a good example of this. <br />A long time ago in my life, I identified with Barrett's angst and his crazy joy. I put together a personal collection of lyrics, drawings and photographs based on recollections of Barret lyrics, mostly from Madcap and Opel. Barrett was best at &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; rantings, floundering around in the cellars of his mind until something really ripe, really sweet, or really darkly true would pop up. When this occurred, then it would leave you stunned or heartbroken because you knew exactly where it was coming from. This was the power of Syd Barrett, and he played exactly like he wrote. Literalist minds stayed away. <br />The other members of Floyd, especially Waters, really missed him. They lost their spiritual leader and they knew it. They could not woo him out of his new life to get him back and continued to mourn his loss right through &quot;Shine On.&quot; They knew what had passed. I give them credit for going on without him. A tough job.<br />There was no pretense about Barrett. He was not trying to be phychedelia...he WAS phychedelia...sort of reminds me of Artaud who WAS absurdist theatre.  These guys open up creative centers in you...just remember to have a door so you don't get trapped in the self-destructive element..that is the key. <br />Good luck whereever you are Syd, and thanks.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Only thing i have to say is MUST HAVE, MUST SEE, LOTS OF ACTION!!! I saw previouse of this movie and to tell you the truth it didn't really interest me, until i heard other people talking about it... so I decided to buy it and i was glad i did! The story is great and different than other films are that have to do with high jacking and etc. A great movie with an outstanding cast including john Travolta, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and more. Swordfish starts out good and keeps you all the way until the end glued to your seat. Don't rent- buy it... because this movie is worth every penny!!!
B00005QFHG|3.0|CHOCOLAT lacks action and heavy drama. Also, outside of Judi Densch's best-supporting nominated performance, the acting isn't all that great. Johnny Depp shows up at the end of the film, but his appearance is more of a cameo than a performance.<br /><br />The movie itself isn't bad. The story has a good moral (tolerance) and the setting of a small 1950s French village is beautiful. However, the film isn't all that great; it's just average. The film's story is just another rehashed version of a water-downed Hollywood favorite: an outsider with liberal values moves to a small secluded place, the outsider is threatened, but in the end the outsider &#34;enlightens&#34; the people about their backward ways.<br /><br />Tolerance and forgiveness are essential in life. Jesus was all about forgiveness and Christians should be the most forgiving people. There are some Christians who aren't very tolerant or forgiving, but many are. Therefore, why are Christians almost always the bad guys in modern movies? Overall, CHOCOLAT looks tasty, but doesn't have much filling.
B00005R87Q|4.0|F and F was a good movie and had a good plot but left you hanging in the end that made you wonder \\"What the [heck]??\\" The movie was fast paced and entertaining. I still thing that Gone in 60 Seconds was better only because the story plot was solid and didn't leave you hanging in the end. So the only thing i have to say is watch the movie but don#t get mad when it comes to the end since it leaves so many answers open, Other than that it was a great movie!!! If you liked Gone in 60 seconds i think you will also like this one, especially since it has good special effects that leaves you in your seat saying \\"wow that was cool\\" F and F is an enjoyable movie and as i said did not lack in story but mostly the ending!
B00005PJ8I|5.0|While watching CAST AWAY, a quote from another movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, kept coming to mind; \\"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.\\" That quote sums up CAST AWAY. It is a movie about surviving and making choices.<br />Tom Hanks plays Chuck, a Fed-Ex trouble-shooter who is so constrained by time that he plans dates with his girlfriend months in advance. Chuck get called on an emergency assignment and his plane ends up crashing into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, but is abandoned on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re-education in living.<br />This is a Tom Hanks movie, make no doubt about it. He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it. However, if CAST AWAY was simply a Tom Hanks film and nothing more, it would have sunk faster than the drowning plane in the movie.<br />CAST AWAY is unlike any other film I have ever seen. Most people are sick of their existance in life and go to movies to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film. This is a film that was made to make people think. The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life? What do you most revere? What makes a friend? How strong is love? These are all questions that CAST AWAY forces one to examine. But the most important question of all is whether to get busy living or get busy dying.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Wall Street is truly a great film that accurately portrays attitudes of the 80's and unfortunately the 90's as well. The acting, directing, storyline, camera-work, is all superb. The film shows the attitudes concerning money and how important money was and is. More important than friends, more important than people, more important than life itself. One thing that suprised me was one reviewer's comment that they know many people that don't think Gekko,the greedy villian in the film, did anything wrong. That guy who wrote that really needs to get out of the Pat Buchanan Dinner Parties and start waking up to the real world! Not that using people to get money, breaking the law to get more money, have relationships with people that like you only for your money, greed is right philosophy is bad or anything, but the guy stated that \\"(making a great profit on a real estate investment) felt better than sex!\\" That alone should make the man worthy of ridicule!<br />Another comment I had issue with was that you had to be a \\"bleeding heart\\" to believe that capitalism is unfair and promotes greed. I mean, even honest people that are pro-capitalist will concede that capitalism is unfair and that it does tend to restrict wealth to narrow sectors of the population. I don't know you're definition of unfair is, but it sure seems like its unfair to me. Honest capitalists will only argue that \\" by gosh, its the best system we've got, Look at whats it did in Latin America for crying out loud, Socialism is a failure, look at Sweden for example!\\"(Recently voted by the UN as the best place to live in the world, US didn't make the top 5) etc.
B00003CXN3|5.0|Drugs in America are a huge problem. Through various ministries I have worked with over the years I have learned that approximately 80% of homelessness and 75% of crime is a result in some way because of drugs. In the 1980s the U.S. federal government began a war on drugs. Yet, twenty years and billions of dollars later the problem has increased. It's a part of the universal battle of good versus evil and the battle can be wearisome and frustrates even the best.<br />It is this wearisome frustration that Steven Soderbergh brilliantly portrays in the movie TRAFFIC. Simply stated, TRAFFIC is about the war on drugs in America. The story the movie tells is related through three separate yet intricately intertwined tales. The film jumps from one scene to the next, back and forth, but without loosing one's attention.<br />The first storyline deals with a Mexican cop, Javier Rodriquez (Benicio Del Toro). Rodriquez is a good cop working amidst the sleeze and corruption of good people gone bad. Rodriquez fights against the powerful bureaucraticized drug cartels because he dreams of when children can play baseball safely again.<br />The second storyline revolves around Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), the newly appointed U.S. drug czar and his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen). Unbeknownst to Wakefield, Caroline has become a hard addict, so much so that she eventually prostitutes herself for drugs. His daughters tribulation changes Wakefield's perception about abuses.<br />The final tale is a narration between a jailed drug lord (Steven Bauer), the takeover of the \\"family\\" business by his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and the two DEA Agents (Luis Guzman & Don Cheadle) working to convict the dealer and protect the key witness against him. It's a frightening look at ruthless famial loyalty and the anguish of our country's law enforcement.<br />The acting in TRAFFIC is superb, the directing prime, and the cinematography brilliant. Much has been made oer the movie's bleak tone. Nevertheless, though the film is dark it ends in light. The movie leaves one feeling frustrated, but hopeful. As long as the fight goes on, there is always hope.one. Nevertheless, though the film is dark it ends in light. The movie leaves one feeling frustrated, but hopeful. As long as the fight goes on, there is always hope.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|Ah, fresh air.  This disturbing little gem kept my wife up all night with the lights on and in the morning she pleaded with me not to go to work until the sun rose.  It's always nice to see originality at work, even when it scares the bjesus out of you.  This film is not for those who thought that \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" was scary when the baddie, a winged doofus, was whistling \\"Jeepers Creepers.\\"  This is a movie for those who saw the true cleverness of \\"The blair witch project.\\"  Although distinctly different than Blair Witch, Session 9 gives you the same feeling of an eerie dread that sticks with you days after first viewing.  The DVD makes a welcome addition to a serious film fan's collection with some cool extras.  The deleted scenes offer an interesting and creepy sub-plot not explored in the final cut.  The alternate ending is not as bone-chilling as the one left in the movie but if you like extras this disk provides an interesting perspective.  Great plot, methodical pacing, and plenty of chills(gore hounds beware, this is a psycological horror movie-splatter lacking), make this movie one great view, just be sure to watch it late at night.
B00005T343|2.0|Sometimes art gives us a villian that is more memorable and interesting than the hero. Witness for example the villians of STAR WARS: Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and Darth Maul; or the man-eating shark in JAWS; or Shakespeare's MacBeth or Iago. In 1991 another villian entered the collective group conscience and grew into a larger figure in the fabric of American pop culture. That villian's name is Hannibal Lecter and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS marked the beginning of his dynasty. Now he's back in a sequel that bears his name, HANNIBAL.<br />In the film it has been ten years since Lecter escaped from prison. He is now living in Italy as a Renaissance scholar named Dr. Fell. However, he is eager to come out of \\"retirement\\". The heroine of LAMBS, Clarice Starling, has been publicly humiliated by a botched drug raid and is put back on the Lecter case after the Justice Department gains new information concerning the cannibal's whereabouts. Starling chases the lead and the game begins anew.<br />Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Lecter and Julianne Moore fills Jodie Foster's shoes well as Starling. Ridley Scott's direction is once again masterful and the other performances and crafts of the rest of the cast and crew are just as excellent.<br />With that said, HANNIBAL is a major disappointment. The movie starts off suspenseful, but soon falls into predictability. Sure there are a few gory twists and turns, but you know Lecter is going to escape and that he won't harm Clarice.<br />The movie started a controversy because of the violent, campy, gore. Certain individuals will want to see it just for those \\"cool\\" scenes. However, as much as I like Anthony Hopkins and as intriguing a character Hannibal Lecter is, the movie was a big let down. Just not enough substance.
B00005Y228|5.0|I've been waiting for Kylie to release something here in the US for sometime. This more then makes up for the wait! I already love Can't Get You Out of My Head and In Your Eyes.

6305313687|5.0|I rented \\"American History X\\" because it had Edward Norton in it and I had just seen him in \\"Keeping the Faith\\" and loved it. I couldn't have picked a movie more different than \\"Keeping...\\" if I tried.<BR>Edward Norton's performance was mesmerizing and totally believable. He plays a racist skinhead and/or Neo-Nazi and his character is smart and eloquent enough to make you almost understand why he thinks the way he does. That's the really scary part.<BR>I recommend this movie to anyone who can bear the intensity of the emotions it evokes.
B000000W6F|5.0|Thought it seems that most people do not enjoy the company of the Smashing Pumpkins first CD, I'd have to say that it is one of the best, and I place it in the top three of the best of their CD's. I do enjoy GISH very much, and never find myself reaching over to hit the \\"next track\\" button. All songs are very catchy, and the lyrics are profound! In one song, \\"SIVA\\", which I am sure you all know, Billy Corgan sings \\"Gather strength down in my heel/ and dig it in the world I peel\\". Now, THATS a message that surely speaks how he couldn't care less about himself, the world, or probably even his fans! GISH is bursting with indie hits, and I have never regretted purchasing this CD. If anything, I would have regretted NOT purchasing this CD. But then again, maybe it's just me, a crazy Pumpkins fan who is so completley obsessed that she has ALL of their albums, and enjoys them all to every last song, and plays their songs on the guitar. Yes, it seems that have no life, but to just simply worship the Smashing Pumpkins. Alright, back to my review, GISH is a GREAT CD! BUY IT!!!!!
B00000ILBK|4.0|I don't watch such movies looking for holes in the plot - and they do exist. As an admitted Star Trek fan, I was very happy with this installment.
014028009X|3.0|After hearing many people rant and rave about how funny the book was or how hilarious or dramatic or how easy it was to relate to etc. I was very disappointed when I read it. I expected a fantastically brilliant piece of work but it seemed to be like every other book out there written in diary form. It was very average and the characters seemed a bit too unrealistic. There are much more funnier etc. &quot;diaries&quot; than this one. Even though those characters are also unrealistic, they still provided more entertainment.
6305910103|4.0|True Star Trek fans find all the elements they want here. The plot moves nicely, the characters are rich, and the action is great. And this is before the cast started looking really old like they do in the later movies!
B00005JKYS|1.0|The movie did not develop any characters beyond the normal sappy sterotypes of soldiers.  The first half is a romanticized view of soldiers (and their families) lives.  Once they go to war, the second half, the movie picks up steam.  However, the war scenes were without a clear purpose and not really part of the story. Bottom line, it could have been shorter and much better if the characters had been developed before the war.
6300274195|3.0|I understand there are many sentimental parents and grandparents who treasure this movie. Well a 3 year old doesn't care about that; they just want to be entertained. With that as my only criteria, I have to give this 3 stars. The movie is rather slow paced compared to what kids are used to. And there are those now politically incorrect moments, too (specifically racial overtones). They don't bother me, but they could bother some people. We all agree it's a classic, but I doubt all of our kids would.
B00005U18E|4.0|,,,I read the book when it came out, and have been looking forward to see the film ever since. I love the book, and don't think the film fully got the atmosphere of it, though the film stands perfectly alone. Renèe Zellweger is Bridget taken perfectly out of the book. A single woman in her thirties with people all around her expecting her to be a spinster all her life, while she is desperately hunting for the right man. She knows she eats too much, drinks too much, lives too unhealthy, and decides to start a diary to get hold of her life. The wonderful, funny part of it all is her self humour, and Zellweger plays this role to perfection.<br />All predictabilities are there, a boss to fall in love with and having an affair with, a mother who is trying to \\"live her own life\\" running away from her father with a man she meets while she is never satisfied with the life Bridget lives, friends, among them a gay man, who tries to advise her about her life, and the respectable, though terrible boring Marc Darcy. Zellweger plays her role so filled with charm and is the one who does the whole film. Huge Grant, as the boss, and Colin Firth as Marc Darcy do quite good acting, but without Renée Zellweger to glue it all together the film would have lost it's magnificiance.<br />Bridget Jones is British, and the story is British. Only one scene in the film was truly dissapointing - the fighting between Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) The scene were too violent and unreal, the story would have been much, much better if the fight could have been a fight to believe in. I think the fighting scene would do okay in an American movie, but not this 100 percent British story.<br />All in all a great film. Not to match the book, but then very few films do...
6304233639|2.0|I remember when the previews came out, it looked like an amazing movie. When I went to see it in the theater, what started out mediocre went straight to ridiculous. I don't mind the occasional holes in a plot, but these are craters! Like when they give the aliens' computer a virus? Imagine the aliens running the same operating system as us! Or after they shoot the first ship down, wouldn't the aliens figure it out and prevent it? The list goes on and on. The plot becomes terribly cartoonish and juvenile to the point I was actually embarassed being in the theater watching it. I give it 2 stars for some of the special effects.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Alright, folks... here's your riddle of the day:  Whaddaya get if you cross the Three Stooges with the Greek poet Homer?<br /><br />\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" that's what!<br /><br />Here is another superb comedy finely crafted by screenwriters /producers/ directors Joel and Ethan Coen.  Starring George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Turturro,  it features a brilliantly written script, superb acting by a wonderful ensemble cast, and a musical score that's simply second to none.<br /><br />\\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" is a simple story really... set in the Mississippi delta region during the Great Depression, it's the tale of three petty criminals who escape from the chain gang in quest of buried treasure and experience a series of misadventures along the way.  Ulysses Everett McGill (Clooney) is the silver-tongued, self-appointed leader of this odd trio, a man who claims to have stolen and buried over a million dollars in cash.  Delmar O'Donnell is the docile, sweet-tempered dimwit (played to perfection by Tim Blake Nelson).  The third member of our little gang is an irritable, acerbic fella named  Pete.  Together they set off, chained to each other, in search of McGill's treasure, which is buried somewhere about to become a man-made lake.  Our heroes have only four days to find the loot before it's lost forever at the bottom of the newly created reservoir.<br /><br />As they begin their journey, the run across an old blind seer who prophesies that they  will find a fortune, but not the one they seek. with a posse of law enforcement officers and vigilantes hot on their heels, Everett, Pete and Delmar ditch their chains and prison garb and continue on their quest.<br /><br />Our trio's journey is anything but quiet and uneventful.  They continually run into strange people and situations...  a Baptist congregation at river's edge, singing a beautiful song, lulling our heroes into sweet forgetfulness for a few brief moments... three washer-women, also at river's edge, whose siren-like song ensnares our three miscreants... a bank robber on the run, who nearly co-opts our heroes into a REAL life of crime...  the one-eyed, fast-talking Bible salesman who offers our heroes a hard lesson on economics and life in general in the Depression-ravaged Deep South...  and other characters as well including a whole gang of fellas dressed in white sheets and hoods who take exception to our heroes' intrusion into their ceremonies.<br /><br />One of \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou's?\\" greatest strengths is its musical score.  As the Coen brothers point out, nary a scene goes by without some kind of music in the background.  The songs - 19 of them by my count - are  all wonderful.  It's a sublime mixture of old-time gospel and country music and African-American spirituals.  From James Carter and the Prisoners' \\"Po' Lazarus,\\" through Alison Krause's sweetly  simple and reverent \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" (with brilliant harmonies added by the First Baptist Choir of White House, Tennessee);  the old-time country classics \\"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\\" and \\"Hard Rock Candy Mountain,\\" and \\"You Are My Sunshine;\\" to the old-time Gospel classics \\"Keep On the Sunny Side;\\" \\"I'll Fly Away\\" and \\"I Am Weary (Let Me Rest),\\" (and many other songs as well), the music adds an extra dimension to this already multi-faceted film.  (By the way, all these songs can be found on the \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" soundtrack compact disc... but that's another review!)<br /><br />I've now watched \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" about  a dozen times.  Each viewing has been a genuine pleasure for me. This film is clever in its conception, extraordinary in its execution, sublime in its storytelling, and masterful in its music.

6305609721|4.0|This one and Star Trek II are the best, but this one is by far the funniest. Even most non-Star Trek fans should enjoy this one.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Outstanding work from such a young artist. His ear for harmony and his variety of style is stunning. This is one of the albums that I have ended up playing non-stop because each song is unique and interesting. Rufus' ability to play with wording as well as music composition and mood makes this cd a tremendous value. This young man will be huge someday. Be able to say you were listening to him even before everyone else caught on.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm not going to go into the intricacies of this album (plenty of others have done this already)...It's an excellent work that will make you yearn for summer nights in the Southeast listening to your favorite new unknown. Along with Ryan Adams, Mayer is one of the few new artists who's album I will actually by after downloading off the net.<br />I give it ****1/2
B00005A1PR|5.0|Few artist become &quot;popular&quot; by sticking to solid songwriting and looking to musical heroes like Stevie Wonder anymore. In a world of plastic 12 year old musicians with their voices pitch-shifted in a computer to make them look like they can sing India.Arie is a ray of hope. There are a few songs on the album that I could personally do without but all in all this is a great effort and an album any true music lover must own. The song &quot;Beautiful&quot; is one of the most stirring ones I have heard in years. The tribute to Stevie Wonder at the end of the album is perfect!
6303234844|3.0|Three stars even though I know that this would be a great video from listening to the CD.  My problem is that I will not buy a VHS any more.  I want to buy this video.  I want to buy it on DVD format.  Royalties, liabilities, contracts, etc all likely conspire to prevent release on DVD.  I find it hard to imagine that Peter Gabriel (or David Gilmore of Pink Floyd's Pulse and DST) really would want to handicap their income by not releasing their work in a modern format.  Peter? David? Is there anybody out there? Release your work on DVD and have more income.
0743216458|5.0|Made into an excellent miniseries on HBO, Band of Brothers is an account of one of the greatest combat companies in the European Theater of Operations.<br />The book focuses on the entire history of Easy Company, from their basic training beginnings under a sadistic CO to their combat jumps in Normandy and Holland and finally to their victorious celebration at Eagle's Nest while drinking Hitler's finest Champagne.<br />The central character of the book is that of Major Dick Winters, a \\"Citizen Soldier\\" who all military officers should look to for inspiration.  After reading this book you feel compelled to write Mr. Winters and thank him for his courage and his determination.<br />This book does give more in-depth accounts than what was offered in \\"Citizen Soldiers\\" and \\"D-Day\\".<br />I reccommend this work to anyone who wants a detailed account of a combat company at work in fighting the Nazis.  Like other books by Ambrose, this is not one to skip.
B00003W8NM|5.0|With a name like Fight Club, one would expect this movie to be laced with violent, testosterone-driven men beating the everliving hell out of one another.  To that end, this movie does not disappoint.  On every other level, though, this movie shocks and surprises the viewer, and it is one of the few films in recent years that makes you think, rather than treat the viewer like a mindless zombie.  All the praise and every in-depth review of the movie that I can offer has been already sang by the masses.  This is merely a confirmation of their reviews, a way to barely raise the meager(in my opinion) 4.5 star rating, and, if you didn't need anyone else telling you, more incentive to make this movie the next purchase on your list.
0060278234|5.0|'Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr' is one of the best sequals I have ever read.  Instead of making up an entirely new plot and conflict, Lirael takes from the first in the series 'Sabriel' very well.  I would definitely read this book after reading Sabriel.  It has some adult content (suicide, sex), so I wouldn't reccoment it to people younger than ten. Look out though, because the ending leaves you hanging for the next in the Series 'Abhorsen'.
0800141326|1.0|From Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, the duo that brought you \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Stargate\\", comes the ultimate movie for people who hate Godzilla movies!<br />Being that I am a person who happens to love all of the Japanese Godzilla films with an undying passion, I found this American imposter to be nothing more than an insult to the good King's name and all the talented masterminds that have helped to make him the legend he has become over the years, namely Eiji Tsuburaya, Ishiro Honda, Tomoyuki Tanaka, Akira Ifukube and, yes, Jun Fukuda.<br />If you're reading this review and don't recognize the five names I've just mentioned, do yourself a favor, stop right now, drive down to your local video retailer and pick up a copy of this Americanized piece-of-[junk]-of-a-movie falsely titled \\"Godzilla\\", I know you'll just love it!  After all, it's the superficial, imaginationless, CGI-crazed people like you that have turned the name Godzilla into such a joke in this country!  You know what, you can just keep your \\"Shreks\\" and your \\"Matrixes\\", because my fellow TRUE G fans and I know what real movie-making is all about, and we know that it takes more than just big budget effects to make a film a MASTERPIECE!  It takes IMAGINATION, TALENT and HEART, which have sadly all but died out in the American motion picture industry of today!<br />There is enough room in the world for one, and only one, King of the Monsters, and he is not some giant computer-generated iguana!  His name...is GODZILLA!!
B00005JKQX|5.0|I was totally and utterly moved by this film! The performances were great, and the direction was perfect! Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly deserve the Oscars that they were nominated for. Great movie about a man's struggle with schizophrenia, and how he dealt with it. It's hard to believe that this actually happened. I was shocked. Twists and turns galore! <br />You'll love this film! Ron Howard also deserves an Oscar!
0385503954|5.0|Though this book is only of average length, it has the feel of a big family saga, so completely does McEwan delve into the consciousness of his main characters as they attempt to cope with the long-term repercussions of a \\"crime\\" committed by a Briony Tallis, a naïve 13-year-old with a \\"controlling demon.\\" Briony's \\"wish for a harmonious, organised world denie[s] her the reckless possibilities of wrongdoing,\\" so it is doubly ironic that her attempt to \\"fix\\" what she sees as wrongdoing involving her sister and Robbie Turner, a childhood friend, becomes, in itself, a wrongdoing, one she feels compelled to deny and for which she will eventually attempt to atone.<br /><br />Opening the novel in 1935, McEwan creates an intense, edgy, and almost claustrophobic mood. England is on the brink of war; Briony, a budding writer, is on the edge of adolescence; her newly graduated sister Cecilia is thinking of her future life; and Robbie is about to start medical school.  The summer is unusually hot.  Troubled young cousins have arrived because their parents are on the verge of divorce; Briony's mother is suffering from migraines; her father is \\"away,\\" working for the government; her adored brother Leon and a friend have arrived from Cambridge; and Briony, an \\"almost only child,\\" with a hypersensitive imagination, finds her world threatened.<br /><br />Step by step, McEwan leads his characters to disaster, each individual action and misstep simple, explainable, and logical.  The engaged reader sees numerous dramatic ironies and waits for everything to snap. When Briony finally commits her long-foreshadowed \\"crime,\\" the results are cataclysmic, and the world, as they know it, ends for several characters.<br /><br />Giving depth to his themes of truth, justice, honesty, guilt and innocence, and punishment and atonement, McEwan uses shifting points of view and an extended time frame.  Part I is Briony's.  In Part II, five years after the crime, Robbie, now a footsoldier retreating from the French countryside to Dunkirk, continues the same themes, seeing the crimes of war, not only between the combatants but against civilians and, at Dunkirk, by the Brits against each other.  In Part III, Briony, atoning for her earlier crime by working as a student nurse, rather than studying to be a writer, brings the past and present together, tending the casualties of war.  The ending takes place in 1999, at her 77th birthday party.<br /><br />This is a totally absorbing, fully developed novel, the kind one always yearns for and so rarely finds! The characters, the atmosphere, the lush descriptions, the sensitively treated themes, the intriguing and unusual plot, and the rare entr&eacute;e into the mind of a writer, both Briony and McEwan, give this novel a fascination few others achieve.  It's hard to put this one down!

0385503954|5.0|While Ian McEwan's novel seemingly centers around one day and evening when a series of unfortunate events cascades into tragedy for one family, this is only one layer in this mesmerizing book. Below the surface are questions about sin, human fraility, love and, finally, atonement. At the heart of the book is a young girl names Briony and her unformed views of the world which lead her to unfortunate conclusions. As McEwan describes her perspective: ..\\"her life now beginning had sent her a villain in the form of an old family friend...that seemed about right- truth was  strange and deceptive, it had to be struggled for, against the flow of the everyday...\\"<br /> Until I encountered this book, I had begun to wonder if there was truly anything new and original to be read in literature - or only a rehash of themes that had already been worked to death. But McEwan's book not only kept me glued to my seat until I'd finished every last page and read every single word (but slowly, so I could savor the best lines), but made me rethink my beliefs. It made me think about not only love, family ties and betrayals and truth versus fiction but left a reverberation that continues to echo through my days. If this sounds overblown and sentimental, I urge you to read this book yourself before coming to any judgments.
0743216458|3.0|Ambrose has done another marvelous job of oral history. He does a masterful account of Easy company, but he obviously is a Cold warrior of the Cold war as not only in this book but also in 'Citizen Soldiers', he villified the Soviets (Russians) as plundering, raping, and burning in Germany-Austria. He does not at all talk about Nazi atrocities that were a hundred times greater (more like a thousand) and it is because mainly of Soviet Union that Europe does not speak German and still has (well a few) Jews left. He also obviously has German sympathies. While he is not by any account a Nazi, his books trouble and offend me as a Ukrainian whose grandfather lost his mother and two siblings to the Germans and fought in the Red Army.
B000002UAI|5.0|I hesitated to give 5 stars, then thought: if this was any other band, of course it would get 5 stars. But we expect a lot from the Beatles.<br />\\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" is a beautiful, lyrically simple song-- my second favorite Beatles recording after \\"In My Life.\\" \\"What You're Doing\\" is another great song sung (and presumably wrote) by Paul-- it sounds a lot like what the Byrds were doing at the same time. \\"Words of Love\\" is perhaps the best cover the Beatles put on an album (the other covers are not as good, though the Perkins tune at the end and the Berry one earlier are both enjoyable). \\"Eight Days a Week\\" is also a great song.<br />In general, I enjoy everything the Beatles did up to and including Rubber Soul (my favorite album), more than most of what they did after that album. Most people seem to feel the inverse. But much of what they did afterward was experiment for experiment's sake. This was noble, in the formerly (and often still) restricted world of pop music, but as songwriters the Beatles, I think, reached their creative peak with Rubber Soul.<br />For those who care, Steve Earle once said his ultimate desert island disc was Beatles for Sale.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have been listening to the same few samples of the songs on her site every day for a whole week before finally got the CDs in the mail today. This is before hearing about all the hype. I think I'm addicted to her voice. I bought both of her CDs (First Session & Come Away...). Most of the songs on First Session (her demo CD) are the same as on Come Away. But I like the ones on First Session better. Go out and get a CD for yourself NOW!
B000001EHS|5.0|I love this band.  I have been a fan since 1983.  This cd is good for playing in my car as I run errands or in my house as I clean because it is full of hits.  Some people may not like the ballads, and would rather have their harder rocking songs.  I can appreciate that.  For me, I like both.  I LOVE \\"When Love And Hate Collide\\".  These are the songs that made me like them (\\"Bringin...) and kept me liking them.  They are the songs that made me go and buy their cd's and DVD's.  This is the cd that I used to introduce my kids to the Leps.  Now, they are fans.  It is not fair to lump them with the \\"hair bands\\".  Their newer songs should have done better commercially (especially if Bon Jovi can do it).  If you only know one or two of their songs, you should definitely buy this cd and listen.  I am sure you will not be disappointed.  Then, maybe you will want to hear more (like Pyromania, Hysteria, Slang or Euphoria?).  Just try it...YOU WILL LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!  <BR>P.S. A new cd should be out this year...LOOK FOR IT!!!!!!!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|THIS CD IS THE BEST CD IN THE WHOLE WORLD!! IF ANYONE DISAGREES THEN THEY ARE CRAZY BECAUSE THIS CD IS SO GOOD!!!IT WAS WRITTEN ALL BY SHAKIRA AND IT SHOWS HER GREAT TALENT. THE MUSIC VIDEO SHOWS HER BELLY DANCING TALENT TOO. SHAKIRA IS THE BEST AND SHE IS GOING TO ROCK THE WORLD WITH HER GREAT LATIN MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|To be quite frank, Batte of Los Angeles is a modern classic. The things Tom Morello can do with a guitar frighten and excite. Zack de la Rocha has a glib tounge and a gift for writing lyrics. From the hard, loud, and fast songs like Guerilla Radio and War Within a Breath to the slower songs like Ashes in the Fall or Born of a Broken Man, this album is amazing. Unlike the mindless rock out there (can anyone say Limp Bizkit or Mudvayne?), Rage actually makes music and that music has a message in it.<br />While I do not agree with all the political statements made by Rage (e.g. Communisim for one. I do think egalitarianism is a laudable stance to support.), they are some of the most talented artists out there. It is a shame that they have broken up. I am looking forward to what Zack releases solo and what the rest of the band does with Chris Cornell from Soundgarden.
0385495323|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It is informative and entertaining, and made difficult concepts easy to understand. For the first time I could know what is behind the public key, private key encription. The historical anecdotes are also delightful.
B000002UA0|4.0|It seems everbody has to have a strong opinion about The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Some people hate it violently, some people love it religiously, and almost all of the rest are left in a state of profound confusion.  You almost never hear anyone say \\"Well, it was ...alright\\" or \\"it was fair to midland.\\"  There are those that see Syd Barrett's work as pure genius, and there are those that see it as the incoherent drug-induced ravings of a madman.<br />At any rate, TPatGoD is not very easy describe but I'm going to try anyway.  Imagine if you can a combination of psychedelia, fairy tales, 60s English rock, folk, a little jazz, a little touch of classical, and a few other things that are best described as ...indescribable.  There are no classic rock radio station friendly songs like \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Money\\", or \\"Run Like Hell.\\"  Heck, there's so much strangness it may even have a Mr. Bungle fan weirded out.  Believe me, I know.<br />Then you add Barrett into the equation.  His singing style is just ordinary.  His guitar playing consisted of ominous twangy riffs and chaotic leads that were unlike the beautiful bluesy solos of future player (and Floyd savior/destroyer - depending on how you look at it) David Gilmour.  Finally, there's his lyrics.  I feel no shame in saying that I don't have the foggiest idea what any of them are about.  Barrett may not have known either despite what these Floyd fanatics like to believe.<br />In conclusion, I feel uncomfortable giving this album a starred rating.  It is so bizarre that I have difficulty rating it in terms of quality.<br />Overall rating: 3.75 stars.  Your rating may be a lot different.
0316776963|1.0|I guess I missed something when I read this book.  I didn't find it funny at all.... in fact... I never laughed to myself let alone out loud.  I was highly disappointed in this book. Having never read any other of his works so I have nothing to compare this to, I would not buy any other of his works.
B000060OWV|5.0|This is a very good Robben Ford album!!!!   For some reason, I am liking his covers most of all, which are delivered with style, feeling and authority.  The production is first rate also.  And it is wonderful to hear again the seamless ensemble playing between Tom Brechtlien, Roscoe Beck and Robben.  <br />Worth the wait!
B00003CXXP|3.0|Kubric had this thing for movies that move at a glacial pace. Speilberg obviously followed suit.  I found myself using the FF button more and more.  The really cool effects (sunken city, future race) didn't show up until the last 20 minutes.  The plot is unoriginal, the acting uninspired, the action uneventful, and overall it's a bore.  It's eye-candy with SOME interesting points.  The only part I thought was worth it was the evolution of the Mecha.  Even that got stolen from Asimov and Anime''.
6304143184|5.0|i myself am rushing to find a version of this movie before the revised version is the only thing available. unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a letterboxed version of the original in either VHS or DVD. this video seems to be the best alternative.<BR>i have to concur with the customer from seattle. spielberg's movie will suffer, and suffer bigtime, from his intended changes. it's not the digital technology i'm worried about, but the thematic problems: to replace the rifles with walkie-talkies is a grave mistake, that will likely ruin one of the greatest scenes in movie history.  the guns, the closeup of e.t. & elliot's eyes, and john williams' score as they take off all combine to send chills down every viewers spine (even, admittedly, after 20 viewings.) the children have been chased for 10 minutes at that point, and the only way to preserve the incredible climax of that take-off is to escalate the threat aimed at them. walkie-talkies? ooh, i'm shaking in my boots...
B00005JKDR|5.0|Like their previous release, this is a good moive for all ages. There is so much improvement over the computer animation. The facial expression and all the tiny little fur on Scully can be see so clearly. They just flow with the air so naturally. The color is so rich. It is very pleasant to the eye. And of course... the lovely and adorable 'Boo'. At the age of 40, I never knew dat I will like any other doll until 'Boo' came along. What a laugh! Can't wait to get the Dvd of this wonderful moivie. Looking forward to all Pixar animated moives. No doubt about...
B00001U03Q|4.0|This is a good disc to listen to even if you never bought a Eric Clapton tape or c.d.I throughly enjoyed it and played several times.
B000002UB3|5.0|Ok, so I was drunk, and I made the black cab stop as me and my drunken colleagues jumped out and weaved across the north London Rd.it was the cab drivers fault , he announced this landmark to us,and it was there!!     I have read the many excellent reviews, and have little to add, except that if you buy one beatles album, this is as good a place to start as any.    'Something' stands out as one of my favourite Tracks, George's playing (if it could) just got better and better. lyrically this album is insightful and beautiful, silly, and sad.  It stands the test of time as a classic, and is essential I think in the history of 20th century  music.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|jimi was in the upper stratosphere and higher in his approach to blues/rock and music in general.<br />no matter the genre (if he touched it) it soared as if by magic.his guitar prowess bordered on the ethereal.he coaxed notes from his instrument as the master of his craft.his range and understanding of his instrument brought forth a setting of wonder between this genius and his guitar.<br />his life was like a comet soaring in the heavens with brilliance and wonderment,then crashing down through the atmosphere toward a much too rapid end like comets do.long may you reign oh! provider of splendor,dreams and magnificence for us all Sweet Jimi!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|first of all, take into consideration that i am 16. second i'm lookin on the reviews and one question comes to my mind, what's up your butts? (in reference to those complianing bunch that said this movie was a waste of money)<BR>I found this movie INCREDIBLY funny and am planning to buy the DVD soon. granted, the movie had no depth and no purpose but does there have to be? if you're looking for some insight into the meaning of life in a movie there's nothing wrong with the movie, there's just something wrong with YOU. and as for one-liners more than i can think of! the comedy is witty and the delivery is flawless. the great part about the comedy here is that you dont have to have gotten a 1600 on the SAT to understand it. not a waste of money and certainly a great movie to get you laughing. <BR>i see some of these people giving it 1 star, and analyzing the hell outta it. maybe that is what ruins the fun? like i said NO DEPTH. im a huge fan of SNL skits, Jay and Silent Bob movies and Ben Stiller. my advice to any viewer of this movie is to NOT OVER THINK IT! dont come in with any expectations and dont try to search for any profound message, just sit back and relax.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I simply cannot understand what the fuss about this film was after everyone was dissapointed. This is actually quite a good movie, maybe not as good as the originals but it had everything that makes a good Star Wars movie, the villain, the good-guys, the comic relief[okay maybe Jar Jar let this one down]. Also some great visuals and some super cool battles. The podrace is a real blood fueler i might add.
B000002BE9|5.0|fiona apple went through a lot in her life for such a young person, and you can hear it in her music & lyrics, which is nothing but depressing.  her piano skills are AMAZING, to say the least and her voice is deep a soulful as well as high and poigent. she is one of the best female artists out there, & very under appreciated.
B000002JS6|5.0|I threw this cd into the player after not having heard it for many years and I was blown away,this sounds like a greatest hit record. Not a dog on this one. AC/DC may not be high art but they sure know how to ROCK
0767802659|4.0|It amazes me that this film is not more highly-acclaimed for its special effects, especially the cgi &quot;bug&quot; aliens.  The cgi elements are seemlessly blended into the film and flawless in appearance and affect.  The story is great-Heinlein classic!  (Want to know more?!)  The situations are often strangely comical.  I never tire of watching this movie.  Highly recommended.
B00005PJ8I|2.0|Tom Hanks is a great actor, but watching him talk to himself for all that time almost made me wish he had hung himself in the movie, which should have saved me at least a good 35 minutes of my life wasted watching this movie.  It was a good concept, but the final execution of watching Hanks and Wilson the Volleyball survive all those years on the island to have the moral of the story be that time marches on whether your around or not...let's just say it was a letdown.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The story idea is very interesting, but it could have been done a lot better.  It gets a little too sentimental and strange at the end.  The acting performances given by Jude Law and Haley Joel Osmet are outstanding.  The film is well worth watching for their performances alone.  The visual and special effects are stunning.  The dvd contains some interesting documentaries.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Although this album is pretty bad, it's a good effort for Britney. We were promised before the album came out that it'd be totally different, which (with the exception of 2 songs \\"Boys\\" and \\"Slave 4 U\\") is a big joke. It's solid pop, which isn't dreadful but neither is it great. If you're into pop music, you'll adore it, but I can only find 5 songs which are any where near a high standard.
B00004THAY|1.0|I bought this CD without hearing anything about it on the day it was released.  I asked myself &quot;How great will it be to hear Eric and B.B. working together?&quot;  With the typical expectation of fantastic chops(and being a guitarist myself, they were not unexpected), I put the CD in my car player leaving the store.  I was horrified to learn that these two greats could fall so short in putting together a decent album.<br />I felt like I was listening to a mutual admiration society recording, without the typical substance to the music, or the musicianship that I expected.  I would definitely not recommend this recording to anyone who enjoys real blues, or is serious about ANY type of music.  BB and Eric should stay away from each other and concentrate on what really is important...music rather than condescending playing.
B000001FS3|5.0|For all the years that I've had this CD, this is still the best popular music I own.  I love it and never get tired of it.  One of my favorite things about U2 is that their music has a message to it whether its about apartheid or about US abuse of military power and might in 3rd world countries, it makes one stop and think.
0767819594|5.0|This movie is riveting! One of my favourite movies of all time. You coul watch it again and again
6304342586|5.0|What can I say?  It was a great movie with good actors
B00000DGUG|1.0|Forget Alanis,she tries to be too intellectual for her young,inexperienced years.She`s a tiring artist to listen to.
B00003CX9S|5.0|There is so much that can be said about this film for a number of reasons. Much of it would spoil the film for those who have yet to view it. Let's begin with the basics:<BR>This film covers the time in John Merick's (the Elephant Man)life where he is rescued from a life of freakshow gawk and abusive captivity and follows him to his death. I don't know whether or not to recommend studying the history of this man before viewing the film or not. Be assured, however, that this film will leave an indellible and Deep mark in your soul regardless of how much (or little) you know historically. <BR>John Merick was born with a disease (if it can be called such) that left him almost inhumanly disfigured and with skin that hung coarse, tumor filled, and loose {hence the name 'Elephant Man'}. He was hurried into a horrific existence of tormenting sneers and gasps from \\"audience\\" members at the freakshow he was the main attraction of. Early in the film a doctor (played spectacularly by Anthony Hopkins)'rescues' him and takes him into the eventual permanent care of the London Hospital. Slowly, Merick captivates and enlightens his caregivers to the (nothing short of) brilliant soul inhabiting his mangled shell. <BR>What follows is easily considered on of THE BEST FILM PERFORMANCES in existence - namely by John Hurt as John Merick. Though all that is visible behind a stunning feat of prosthesis-makeup are Hurt's eyes and voice, he carries the essence of such a trampled being to levels rarely acheivable by mankind. The fact that he did not receive an Academy Award is beyond Blasphemy! Between the director's(David Lynch!) innovative and artistic beauty, and Hurt's soul wrenching performance, the film can almost be unbearable to watch at times. Anyone who has ever tasted the slightest cruelty of another's taunting will surely buckle under the weight of this film. The importance of this film is inexpressable. Historically, and socially, it shoves to the forefront all of our damnable crimes against eachother through our own sense of vanity and conformity. <BR>This film ought to be required for all highschool and college students - if but for their own sake. It truly captures the wickedness we are all capable of and also (even moreso) the beauty we all hold within - even in the face of total obstacle. <BR>Simply a MUST SEE for EVERYONE!
B000059MEK|4.0|This cd is really good.  I listen to a lot of electronic music(Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin etc.) but I tend to stay away from dance music. This cd however is the exception.  Yes it is very poppy but it is very catchy and even makes someone like me want to dance.  It is danceable yet the production is creative which makes it good for just listening too.  The only reasons I took away 1 star was becaue Too Long is just not my kind of music.  It would be fine i it was 5 minutes but 10 minutes is too long for this kind of track.  This album is really good, its just a shame a few of the songs have been used in commercials.  But dont let that deter you from buying this album.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter was a wonderful book and the movie really does it justice! When I read a book, I have a mental image of what all the characters and places look like. This movie actually seemed to pull them all from my imagination! Phenomenal! Well acted and visually stimulating! I felt like I was 10 also, sitting beside my 10 year old in the theatre.
0783225970|5.0|This movie is by far the most detailed for it's time. The scenes are so real! The cast did a fantastic job Reinacting the Cuban Refugee War. And what can I say about Al Pacino,,,,,HE'S NOT EVEN CUBAN! The guy is Amazing. I think after evry person sees this movie they will try to immitate the accent Al pacino portrays.
B000003TAW|5.0|this is by far one of the best cds that I own, has been awesome, still is awesome! its one of those cds where u dont ever, EVER press the skip button, alllll the songs are awesome... the lyrics, the beats, the melodies, the whole frickin thing! has been my all time favorite cd and always will be... look out for their 4th album... maladroit
B00005JKZQ|4.0|Ebert said that Showtime is pretty much a rehashing of buddy-cop movies. I wouldn't know because I don't usually watch those movies...but who cares?<br />This movie was just hilarious. DeNiro and Murphy were delightful on the screen together. The contrast of their characters and the eventual evolution of their relationship was pretty interesting. If you're thirteen or older, and you like comedy, then go see it. However, even though it was kept under wraps pretty well, there is quite a bit of violence in this movie that may frighten small children. Besides that, enjoy. =)
B000021YQV|4.0|From the album's ferocious opening backslap to the sludgy riffing of &quot;Aerials&quot;, Toxicity is the definition of aural beatdown.  At first listen, the drums and guitar seem to share the simple goal of liquifying your brain, and the vocals grate against that wall of sound to horrid effect.  The music and lyrics rush quickly by, and the many interesting facets of the songs' construction and execution are gone before you can figure them out.  Repeated listens further illuminate the musical ornaments and twists on the album (at least, they did so for me), but nothing ever detracts from the full-force attack incited by every single song.<br />An open mind is essential for a full understanding of Toxicity.  Some listeners will revel in its heaviness without ever locking on to the more subtle elements, and some will distance themselves from this music because its violence is too much for them.  I pity both groups.  Toxicity has something to say about music and about the modern world, and while the two messages cannot be fully absorbed as a pair, neither should be overlooked.
B000021YQV|5.0|I'm no industry analyst, and I'm certainly not one to fall in love with just any mainstream metal that I hear on the airwaves. However, the first time I heard \\"Chop Suey!\\" on Chicago's Q101, I got curious, thinking, \\"Wait a minute here... this isn't 'Sugar,' nor is it 'Spiders' (FYI: both singles from SOAD's first release).. it's better!\\" This album is a far more matured and refined effort, and it's apparent to anyone that heard the first album that SOAD definately had not run out of creative energy, and even more apparent that they avoided the dreaded \\"sophomore jinx\\" by a longshot! Serj's vocals are once again the most uncanny you've ever heard, as he hits every type of mood in the Rock/Metal spectrum, sometimes all in one song! (See \\"Toxicity\\", \\"ATWA\\", and yes, if you really listen, \\"Chop Suey!\\") SOAD hits on the ever so popular and controversial topic of cocaine-addict groupie hoes in \\"Psycho,\\" and the government drug conspiracies in \\"Prison Song.\\" \\"Shimmy\\" strikes as a kooky, not-so-well mannered imitation of 1/2 of System's first release. All things considered, this album is definately the same System that caught our attention in 1998. The only difference from this release and their self-titled release can only be summed up like this: they're worlds apart, yet 100% System.

B00003CXTG|1.0|As Bruckheimer and Bay count the ticket receipts and collect their big cheque from Disney, we the audience are left in a haze of sheer disappointment; and to an extent, exploitation. Bruckheimer has the ability to take away the art of filmmaking. It is all about product placement, merchandising and sequels. We can witness the bomb's point of view shot in its full 2.35:1 cinematic quality (which is the only good four seconds in the entire movie).This film was terrible. Apart from being funny many times (intentionally and unintentionally) the emotional impact of the hundreds of people dying was almost non-existent. Bay, so concerned about cutting every 5 seconds and showing large American and Japanese flags (just in case we forget who is who), has little idea about exactly what he is trying to do. Bay, who wouldn't know how to register a heartbeat in his unbelievable stereotypes, had no emotion to attach to each bomb dropped and bullet shot. What the attack amounted to was all style and no substance. It was like a video game. Some of the plane battles were so cartoon-like it was as if you were watching 'Pearl Harbour: The New Playstation 2 game\\". Granted that these effects are remarkable but we are barely given the chance to appreciate them as we cut to another shot every few seconds.<br />And the love story, so contrived, so inexplicably trite, is arguably the most sickening thing about this film. Affleck and Hartnett are best friends. Aflleck meets and falls in love with Beckinsale but he has to go to England and show the English how to fight a war (the cheek of that!). That leaves Beckinsale alone with only Hartnett to look after her. I leave the rest up to you to figure out.<br />Bruckheimer sure knows how to get good actors to deliver the clunky dialogue. You have Sizemore, Baldwin, Voight and a surprising Hollywood turn from Ewen Bremner. They perform well, and so too do the three leads. Affleck is brash and cocky. Hartnett is shy and charming. Beckinsale is sexy and, well, cries a lot. The three are gorgeous to look at and hold the screen strongly. Considering the quality of the dialogue a lot of credit has to be given to these young stars, whose onscreen charisma should never be taken for granted.It's all been done before though. The love story is there for the teenage girls. The action is there for, you guessed it, the men, and the \\"credibility\\" factor (Jon Voight) is there for the old people (simply put). Elder Americans are renowned for their patriotism so this film will attract the grey market, which summer movies rarely do.<br />You can talk about the historical inaccuracies but I have come to accept that Hollywood is more concerned with changing history to fit their story as opposed to the other way round...Their answer to every incorrect detail is \\"it's a movie.\\" If they are so unimportant why not film Pearl Harbour in present day in the Sahara desert?<br />Great DVD...
6305252521|2.0|The movie is well done and also well acted. The story is fairly original, and, at first, it could pass as an epopee of freedom. All in all, it is not surprising that it has been well received by movie critics and moviegoers worldwide. So, why did I give it only two stars? Because its message disturbed me. I know, you might ask, \\"How can a movie about freedom possibly disturb you?\\" Well, the oppressor's name is Christof (note the similarity to Christ), who forces poor Truman (true man = Adam) to live in this horrible (ironic) perfect town, where everything is just \\"plain perfect.\\" Everything is cool, even though the whole world (think Christof-God and the world-Universe here) knows what Adam... pardon, Truman is doing all the time. Then, Sylvia (read Serpent here) comes along and says, \\"Adam, wake up, eat this fruit and you shall become....\\" Sorry again, she says, \\"Truman, this Garden of Eden is not real, grow up and get outta here.\\" Truman then sails towards freedom and the cruel Christ(of) tries to stop him by saying. \\"Truman, out there you'll find pain and suffering. Stay here in the garden with me.\\" But since it's cruel to force Truman to remain in such a perfect place, Christof is destined to lose, and Truman finds freedom and Sylvia waiting for him. In the movie, everything is cool at the end, but in the real world things are different. The real thing [stinks] and Truman's grandkids (that's us) complain a lot and say: \\"You know what... Christ(of) doesn't exist, because, if He did, He wouldn't allow all this pain and suffering instead of letting us live in the perfect garden of Eden.\\" In conclusion, I obviously like freedom - I loved the movie \\"Watership Down\\" - but the idea of freedom presented in this flick looks dangerously like a twisted version of Genesis chapter three. Well, these were my five cents...
B00000099Y|5.0|Beware!  Do not press the play button until you are sure you're ready.  There's no introduction on this album, no hand-holding, no gradual incline from earth to heaven.  Aenima crushes the two planes together into an intimate and long overdue embrace, and it all begins in the very first percussive pangs of &quot;Stinkfist&quot;.  The album's message becomes clearer as the music and lyrics run a vast thematic gauntlet: a desensitized and numb society, the alternately dark and uplifting consequences of our own free will, the fallibility of human relationships, and a divinity that reaches out to us from beyond the immediate world.  The lyrics provide a platform to elucidate the songs' meaning, but the songwriting and instrumentation carry the true life force of the album.  As the disc progresses, several un-songs knit together the various pieces of the album into a formidable whole.<br />Keenan sums this music up in one line: &quot;Stepping through my shadow, coming out the other side.&quot;  The album is dark, oppressive, challenging.  Accept the challenge, though, and you will find your perception of the world changed in ways that cannot be undone.
B000002GK1|4.0|I defintely recommend this album! This was Soundgardens' breakthrough album in many cases throughout the world, and was the follow-up to the brilliant if quite unfocused riffage of Louder Than Love. Badmotorfinger is far more focused in its songwriting and has a sharp, crisp production which allows the drums to snap, the bass to thud, the guitars to crunch and of course, to allow Chris Cornells powerful roaring vocals to cut through the lot like a hot knife through butter.<br />The album starts off with the tight, stinging intro riff to 'Rusty Cage', a thoroughly excellent and anthemic rock song with a chorus that's irrisitable not to shout along to (\\"I'm going to break my rusty cage and run\\", indeed). When the song gives way near the end to a jagged and angular outro section, you begin to realise you're witnessing creativity of the highest order, especially from a so-called 'grunge' act!<br />This is followed up by the excellent single \\"Outshined\\" featuring a Led Zeppelin-esque riff in 7/4 time and another anthemic chorus. \\"Outshined\\" is packed full of interesting melodic hooklines and hard rock attitude, you simply can't help but bang your head along.<br />Tempos are slowed down for the next song, the brooding \\"Slaves And Bulldozers\\" in which Chris Cornell does his best Robert Plant impressions during the chorus. Opening up with Ben Shepherds slow-burning bassline, it's packed with jagged, angular guitars and it's nowhere near as anthemic as the previous two songs, although it has moments of insane creativity (such as Kim Thayils vastly atonal guitar solo). Clocking in at 6+ minutes, Soundgarden played this in their sets well up until their demise.<br />This was also the case with the next track, an all-time classic of the bands' called \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\". A song written by all members of the band, it features some sterling drum work from Matt Cameron which never wavers from its pounding beat throughout while Kim Thayil and Ben Shepherd thrash out the songs blinding grunge riff. This is the band on excellent form, and a song which even the biggest Soundgarden fanatic would find difficult to get bored of.<br />The short, but extremely complex \\"Face Pollution\\" is up next, and while the lyrics leave a lot to be desired the music contains so many twists and turns that by the end of its two and half minutes you feel a bit dizzy. That doesn't mean that it's not suited for banging your head to, in fact it's completely ideal! But closer inspection to this song explains that Soundgarden were more creative than most of their peers, especially the pounding middle section before Cornell screams the title over and over again through a pounding 5/4 riff.<br />Ben Shepherds songwriting gets a showcase on the fine rock song \\"Somewhere\\", which doesn't feature the greatest lyrics in the world (screamed over the top of the intro amusingly by Cornell) but musically it's hardly simplistic despite the fact that it sounds simple without closer observation. Catchy and melodic, with some rather deft and quick time signature changes and a bizarre ending which seems to have no relation to the rest of the song whatsoever, this is a great song which shouldn't be overlooked.<br />\\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" brings the band back to more traditional laid-back grunge rock in the main body of the song, after a totally weird introduction with wailing guitars and a voice which sounds like it comes from a childs toy, a fine song if not the highlight of the album. More traditional grunge rock is followed up in the form of \\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\", one of the few songs to feature lyrics not written by Cornell, with music written by Matt Cameron. \\"Mind Riot\\" deviates from the rest of the albums distorted riffage to give the listener a break with its chiming, Indian-sounding guitars and anthemic chorus, definitely a highlight of the album and shows a more psychedelic direction that the band would bring to fruition on its next album Superunknown. \\"Drawing Flies\\" is another fairly short track with disjointed sections that seem like they never work but actually do, and features more music composition from Matt Cameron. The last two tracks are absolutely amazing, the rifftastic \\"Holy Water\\" with its excellent lyrics and anthemic chorus sounding like it was the inspiration for Silverchairs song \\"Slave\\" from their Freak Show album. The album closes with \\"New Damage\\" which features more creative riffery, alongside such lyrics as \\"the wreck is going down/get out before you drown\\". Well, I can safely say this album is far from a wreck and everyone should drown in the sonic textures of this album. Admittedly, it may not be everyones cup of tea but if you like heavy guitars shot through with a sense of melody and a dash of prog riffery, you'll love this album. It's let down by one or two dull moments, such as \\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\", but features so much creativity it makes this album essential! Buy it immediately!
B00005QIPH|5.0|for Rock and this may be it. As a first effort I'm giving this cd a five. This is a refreshing sound on the airwaves. If you are familiar with 60's garage rock, this is similar. Good basic Rock with good hooks. It will be very interesting to follow this young groups growth and I for one am anxious for their next cd.
B000002C1V|5.0|Even though &quot;the Final Cut&quot; is obviously pretty much a Roger Waters solo outing (with the other members of the band not really having to much contribution) it also stands as the most stunning antiwar album ever conceived.  All of the tracks are well done to say the least.  The album is about the effects of the war, and is meant as a tribute to Water's father who was killed in the battle of the Anzio bridgehead (which was also a significant factor in both the album and movie &quot;The Wall&quot;).  The symphonic arrangements of this album are both amazing and darkly beautiful in their meaning and composition.  And Water's lyrics (occasionally sung like a sort of deranged narrative) are well placed within the music.  This is an incredible album, and I will recommend it to anyone.
067158037X|3.0|When I first started listening to \\"Angela's Ashes\\" I was hoping for a glimpse into the life of the common Irish.  Much of the book was an absolute delight, whole other parts were very distasteful.<br />\\"Angela's Ashes\\" is Frank McCourt's story of his life from his first memories in New York, through his childhood and teen years in Limerick until he is able to save enough to return to America on his own.<br />At the start of the book, McCourt says: \\"My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born...Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"  He then writes a first person stream of consciousness narrative to prove his premise.<br />The parts of the book which were absolute delights were the parts in which one is treated to the language of the Irish with all of their peculiar phrases, expectations and beliefs.  While listening to these selections, I was reminded of some of the phases which I have heard from my Irish born relatives.  Some of the beliefs and world views illustrated did not seem so different from some of which I have heard or even held.  There is just enough truth to make the quotations humorous.<br />I am glad that I listened to the audio version which was read by the author.  His Irish accent made the book more entertaining than the written word would have been.  I noticed that the pronunciation was not always the way the book was writen.<br />The oppressive and endless poverty and burden of alcoholism are depressing but, in his as in too many families, real tragedies.<br />The characters are, perhaps, realistic dichotomies.  Malachy, seems to be a good man when sober, but his weakness for the drink renders him an irresponsible father.  Angela, the mother, seems to be a an incompetent personality who, somehow, manages to hold her family together when with little and, eventually, no help from Malachy.  The initial, cold receptions of the McCourts by their families in Ireland ultimately give way to  grudging acceptance and assistance. Frankie, the author and narrator, begins as a naive child who, forced by circumstances, becomes a self sufficient adult.  Perhaps the tragedy of Frankie is that, immersed in a world of hardship and formal religion he learns much about self-sufficiency but little about morality.<br />The parts of the book which I found to be most distasteful were the later sections which degenerated into what would have to qualify the work for an \\"X\\" rating.  Perhaps this is McCourt's ultimate way of proving his premise that the worst childhood is an Irish Catholic childhood.  I suspect that this would have been a better book had the immorality been eliminated from the later sections, but, perhaps, it would not then have conveyed the intended message.<br />This book is enjoyable to read in parts and I am glad to know what it is about, but any endorsement would have to be lukewarm.al, cold receptions of the McCourts by their families in Ireland ultimately give way to  grudging acceptance and assistance.

B000002LRX|5.0|Nothing can better represent the dark humor of this album than the cover art: on the front, the pure white majesty of the bird under the delicate script of the album title; on the back, the meat rack brimming with skinned fowl and severed beef heads.  The music found within is pummeling and otherworldly, never settling for a surface glance at an ugly life but determined to plunge through the skin and probe the slimy gore underneath.  The song writing here is twisted and interesting, but always extremely tight.  Seldom does a group of musicians gel this well for the full hour that this disc runs; rock beats rise above the blase norm, bass lines provide a thoughtful groove, guitar riffs rip through earth and sky alike, keyboards wrap the violence in an eerie half-light, and Patton's vocals cavort through the storm with expert intensity.<br />This album is not for the faint of heart, but if &quot;emotional music has quite an effect on you&quot;, then you should take this soul-drenching journey over and over and over again.
B000002L9Y|5.0|I first heard this album in my Dad's car when I was eight years old going on vacations in B.C. Now, everytime I listen to each song I am taken back to the mountains, the lakes, and the endless forests of the most beautiful place in Canada. British Colombia is definitely the perfect backdrop for Stevie Nick's enchanted wonderland that she effortlessly creates with her sexy, soulful, beautiful voice. Her songs \\"Seven Wonders\\" and \\"Welcome to the room Sarah\\" are simply stunning! I have read reviews that say her \\"When I see you again\\" [is bad], but in my opinion it is the best song she has ever sung. Given that she was suffering from severe depression and abusing drugs at the time, you have to give her credit for singing such a desperate, mournful song with such dignity. It is as though the rhiannon in her was crying for help. It was her cry to us all, her fans, to save her from her illness. And that is why the song makes me cry everytime I hear it. The emotion straining through her wavering, fragile voice is mystical and enchanting, and makes my heart go out to her. Finally, when the sun goes down, and midnight comes along, Lindsay Buckingham takes the reigns with the sexiest song ever produced \\"Tango in the Night.\\" That, and \\"Big Love\\" is the perfect song to make love to. The umphs and aahs of Stevie and Lindsey combined with awesome guitar turn that song into the most dazzling orgasmic song ever!!!! And, much kudos to Christie McVie for her beautiful and delightful \\"Everywhere\\" and her strangely delightful \\"Family Man\\"<br />To anyone who needs an album to turn to to sort out any emotional feeling, pick this album up!!! It is always in my discman. I am addicted. Yes! Yes! Yes! ... Buy this album today and check out Trouble in Shangri-la!!!
B00005N5S5|5.0|All I can say about Terminator is that it has class!  I've yet to see another movie in the same league.  I'm not really a Science Fiction movie fan, but this movie was amazing!  The first in this two-series movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a Terminator from the future which has come to terminate Sarah Connor, because she later gives birth to John Connor who would lead a mission against evil machines like terminators.  Sarah knows nothing about it until she sees a news flash which informs her of the murders of three people with similiar names: Sarah Connor.  Sarah at once knows that she is the fourth target and tries to hide from Schwarzenegger.  Micheal Biehn comes in here.  He is the 'good guy' of the movie (not to mention cute!).  He is a person from the future and has come to help Sarah.  His name is Kyle Breece.  After helping her for a few days, they fall in love.  They go to a hotel and, just before they're leaving from there, Schwarzenegger comes.  They fight him to the his and Kyle's deaths.  Sarah is very sad and heart-broken.  Later, she becomes pregnant with Kyle's baby.  She makes tapes describing Kyle and the chemistry between them.  A very thrilling, yet touching movie.  A must-watch for all ages!
B00005RYLE|1.0|After the largest mislabeling scandal in video history this movie remains the worst thing to hit Hollywood since the plot for Halloween 3.  I deeply feel sorry for the people thinking they were buying Ben Hur (an actually good movie) and due to the scandal ended up with this [junk].  Is it any wonder Bruce Campbell's career has hit virtual rock bottom.  Just watch this low budget [stink]fest.  A bunch of poorly animated monsters attack some people in a cabin.  At first the gore and killing of the monsters is pretty crazy and entertaining but it soons becomes stale and repetitive after 82 minutes of the same wackiness. Calling this a \\"cult classic\\" is unbelievable since there really is nothing classic about it.

B00005B74V|5.0|I purchased both the &quot;remastered&quot; import versions of Surrealistic Pillow and Crown of Creation. Both CDs have bonus tracks and it has been claimed that each has been digitally remastered. However, if you study both the CD and the accompanying insert, there is no statement whatever to suggest that these CDs are remastered. Though listening tests are subjective, neither of these CDs sounded superior in audio quality. The widely available recent U.S. reissue of Surrealistic Pillow--including stereo and mono versions of both songs but no bonus tracks--actually claims to be remastered (e.g.,  note info on audio restoration &amp; digital transfers) and sounds superior to the European import w/ bonus tracks.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Well, I think this movie wasted 3 valuable hours of my precious life, and now I can't get them back! Arg! I was utterly  bored throughout the entirety of this movie. That actor, Haley or whatever looks really funny, and annoys the hell out of me. If the robot kid was portrayed by some other child actor, I would maybe have not hated this movie so much. The movie drags on for way too long, and I found myself watching the seconds slowy tick by on my watch more entertaining than this movie. The acting didn't come off as very good either. Overall I would say the only thing worth seeing in this movie is Teddy, the talking robot /toy teddy bear. ROCK ON TEDDY!!<br />Meh don't buy this, in fact don't even rent it unless the video store is so desperate they give it to you for free, and even then I would advise not taking it.
6305265666|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Drew Barrymore acts like she was born for this role and she's just so good! Its about a girl named Danielle and when her father dies she becomes a servant for her stepmother. Yup a cinderella story but instead of a fairy godmother, she gets a famous painter to help her!<br />Clearly showing that girls and women can be strong without needing magic and by being themselves. Appropriate for the whole family, and most girls and women will enjoy this sweet Cinderella Story. Its a spectacular movie, wonderful scenery, wonderfully made. Drew Barrymore shows the world what she's capable as an actress.<br />However the DVD's only special feature is the trailer. That's so disappointing! Clearly because I remember that this movie was promoted heavily and they had many interviews, etc., so they should have had more special effects rather than the trailer.
B000001ABD|4.0|If you are a avid Stevie Wonder fan like myself you would consider yourself disappointed by the way Song Review is put together. My biggest problem is the songs are randonmly put together. This being said its hard for fans to see his musical progression from the 60's, 70's and 80's. Also with any Greatest Hits collection some of his most groundbreaking work is missing such &quot;As&quot;, &quot;Isn't she Lovely&quot; among my personal favorites. Yet the cd isn't all bad as you can hear the beautiful ballads and roaring funk that Stevie Wonder has protrayed all through his incredible career.
B000003TAB|5.0|Its a B-sides collection, yet its better then the entire cataloge of posers like Bush, Nickleback, Staind, ect.  And its a lot more coherent than most B-sides compilations, something that really surprised me.  You could play it for someone who's never heard it before, telling them its &quot;the lost Nirvana album&quot; between Bleach and Nevermind, and they'd believe you in a second.  Because it feels like a whole album, not just a collection of songs.<br />Aneuyrsym, or however you spell it, is my favorite song on here.  I think its funny.  It starts out all hard and wicked, with a guitar spiraling upward, and then suddenly the guitar drops out and it totally changes, like you've skipped into another song by accident.  I always laugh at that part.  And there's something just hilarious about how Cobain sings &quot;come on over and do the twist&quot;.<br />One of my friends who never knew anything about music once told me &quot;Every song Kurt Cobain wrote was depressing.&quot;  Well, maybe that's true, but he was funny a lot of the time too.  Like Sliver, who would have thought someone could make an awesome song out of the lyric &quot;Grandma take me home&quot;?  Or Been a Son, a song about how Kurt's dad always said his sister should have been a boy.<br />Dive is a great opening song too, very dark and reminiscent of Blew.  New Wave Polly rocks, Stain has some great guitar parts.  Molly's Lips is probably my least favorite song, a cover that's a little too poppy for me, but most people like it and its still pretty great.  Definately check this album out and don't be scared just because it a B-sides comp.
B000002UW1|5.0|This is a fine little album - it got me through high school and college okay and the disc is now a bit worn out. It's not on the same plane as Life's Rich Pageant (REM's best) but Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe did certainly create a gem of an album in Document. All the conventional wisdom applies: The first tracks are great tunes but have not worn especially well due to their anti-Reagan, down with the right-wing-contras political overtones. Stipes lyrics are clearer than ever before, and somebody lit a fire under Buck's guitar. Berry's drumming is as great as ever. Several tracks are excellent including &quot;Disturbance at the Heron House&quot;, &quot;Oddfellows Local 151&quot;, and heck, I even like &quot;The One I Love&quot;.  A couple of songs really miss like &quot;Lightnin' Hopkins&quot; and &quot;Fireplace&quot; but, hey, that's the price for being innovative.<BR>REM is the smartest and most original band to come out of the 1980's and this is one of the essential pillars of the REM catalog. Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce &amp; Lester Banks, birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom!
B000056BSA|1.0|I feel sorry for Penelope Cruz for making this silly movie. Its about a woman that finds her husband with someone else, so she heads to the U.S. She lands a gig as a cook on a cooking show, everyone loves her. She finds a new guy that digs her. The desperate husband tries to get her back and after persuing her, he does! <br />Too many inappropriate things for me to like here. Let's see she has a guy that dresses as a woman, and the fact that Penelope's character goes out to the ocean and offers offerings to some goddess. Too pagan for my Bible believing ways. <br />Penelope is a sweet actress. She's believable, however this movie is all too wrong for her to show her talents. Actually it was well done for a film with a small budget, but unfortunately not good enough to keep.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Well now everyone who has read the book will have loved it(including myself) but i thought this film would have been way better.<BR>   I thought the special effects were very good fuffy the three-headed dog especially and it was very well acted.<BR>   However i thought that the different scenes just didn't string together, which in my opinion made the film all too rushed and another thing that was disapointing is that not all the facts are as they are in the book.<BR>   It's a film worth watching but after all the praise and fuss about it i was expecting better.
B00001SIES|4.0|I really don't know what made me buy this album, maybe it was the video for Muscle Museum which kind of reminded me of Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun.  Anyhow, these guys sound like Radiohead, there's no denying it, Muse even states in interviews that their two biggest influences were the Bends and Nevermind.  And to be perfectly honest, I've had just about enough of Radiohead and its imitators, it seems like the high pitched Thom Yorke vocal style is all over the place now.<br />Regardless, Showbiz is still a good album, and its just different enough from Radiohead for Muse to be considered a unique artist and not just a rip-off.  The guitar noises are often somewhat frantic, the songs are all well-produced, and the album is very coherent.  Some of the songs take a bit of getting used to, especially the third track, but they'll grow on you.  Matthew Bellamy obviously has a real flair for writing big, epic songs, so I can only imagine what Muse is going to be like in the future.  So Radiohead similarities aside (its really just mostly the vocal that does it), Showbiz is a good album.  And even if Muse has yet to make its own OK Computer, their debut Showbiz is still 10x better than Amnesiac.
B000006OS2|2.0|I own the VHS version of this movie, and enjoy the film itself immensely.  Unfortunately, the Goodtimes company has produced a very poor quality copy of the film.  There are many places that have been very obviously manipulated in a modern edit bay with unrealistic zooms and grainy textures.  I would buy the DVD version of this movie in a second, if I knew the quality were more akin to the original release of the film.
B00005HYH5|5.0|There is little doubt that 1969's \\"Ummagumma\\" substantiated Pink Floyd's psychedelic cult band status further than they had before, whether intentionally or not. To say the least, it is different from the Floyd's later, more successful, works; there is no central concept or theme. There are no moody outbursts against a rigid educational system or campaigners for censorship. There is no united co-musicianship (though this time it is not the result of bitter feelings among the members). But there is one essential element that paints this album with an intriguing color; ruthless freedom of experimentation.<br />According to the band, one purpose of \\"Ummagumma\\" (the title is enough to suggest its strange yet inventive manner) was to allow each individual member his chance to experiment half a side of vinyl, doing whatever he wanted with it. The result may seem self-indulgent and needless to say, weird, by our naive standards, but it was undoubtedly innovative and natural.<br />Through the live disc, we are introduced to the atmosphere of \\"Ummagumma\\" until we can clearly see into the world that lies ahead; the spacey psychedelic sounds form an imagery that is complex beyond measure. I remember playing the extraordinary live version of \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun\\" for a friend, who remarked, \\"If I walked into someone's basement and they were playing this music, I'd get out of there as fast as I could.\\" This reaction is not unexpected upon the first listen to the disc. But once one realizes that Pink Floyd's intention was not to scare--and that none of the memebers were on drugs at this time--they will be able to appreciate the world they've created here.<br />Then comes the unappreciated but undeniably inventive experimental concoction that is the studio album. We are greeted with keyboardist Rick Wright's four-part opus, \\"Sysyphus.\\" Named after a character of Greek mythology, the instrumental comprised of heavy organ and piano movement, seems to tell its own story of the mythological character without intending to. An example of Wright's talent as a musician. From here we are cradled by bassist Roger Waters' acoustic peaceful melody, \\"Grandchester Meadows,\\" complete with early foreshadowings of his moody yet assuring brilliant lyrics. But after the final acoustic notes, we hear the unexpected sounds of a man swatting at a fly, and are thrown into, perhaps Pink Floyd's most unusual song to date, \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict.\\" The \\"instruments\\" Waters used were his own belly and coffee tables as drums, with several sound effects. The raving spoken word lyrics go (officially) undeciphered to this day. From here, guitarist David Gilmour provides a reasonable aftershock with the three-part \\"The Narrow Way.\\" With this song, Gilmour blossomed, in an early stage in Pink Floyd's history. And then we are flung from heavy guitars to the flute intro of drummer Nick Mason's opus \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party.\\" The entire second part is one long percussion solo, besides some sound effects sprinkled throughout the track's surprisingly pleasant effect. Another pair of flutes punctuate the album's exit.<br />I strongly recommend \\"Ummagumma\\" to those dabbling in the psychedelic space-rock arts; this is the unsung vanguard of its genre, a feat Pink Floyd has accomplished more than once. Presented here in limited edition deluxe packaging and pure remastering, \\"Ummagumma\\" can be fully appreciated for what it is; a world of its own, ready to be discovered again and again.ry of the mythological character without intending to.

0887307396|5.0|In their richly illustrated Built To Last, the sequel of infamous Good To Great, Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras systematically explore what makes up a great company compared to a good company. A great company has a strong vision that encompasses both an immutable core ideology and envisioned future. That vision transcends the current leader of a great company because it has been institutionalized over time. Contrary to common wisdom, charismatic leadership can be very detrimental to even a great company. Furthermore, a great company nurtures its future leaders by promoting from within to preserve its essence over time. Collins and Porras demonstrate that bringing external \\"blood\\" to lead a (great) company in decline is often not very productive to turn around such a troubled company. In addition, a great company often commands a cult-like devotion from its staff. Disciplined people in thought and action are indeed self-motivated to help their company stay great. A great company also prospers by sticking to an evolutionary process that rigorously keeps the strongest ideas and lets the weakest ones die reflecting some BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) set previously. Although status quo is never perceived as satisfactory, vision is not lost out of sight. Collins and Porras show that both stimulation of change and preservation of the core are pursued at the same time vigorously. In Good To Great, Collins explains to his audience how to relate the above-mentioned concepts to the mutation of a good company into a great one.
B000001OAA|5.0|Every song here could have been a hit single, no exceptions.  Shirley Manson's voice is better here than on other Garbage CDs, very deep and gothic.  This album is easily Garbage's darkest CD, and the most guitar heavy.  Grungy guitars drive almost half the songs here, but there's plenty of FX and synth stuff present all over the album too.  The best part about this band is how they cram every song so full of different sounds so every time you play it you'll be hearing a new melody or guitar fill that you never noticed before.  As such, the songs have a lot of replay value and make for great headphone listening.  In fact, put this one on headphones and you'll notice just how complex this music is, how there are tons of cool sounds to hear that would probably elude you otherwise.<br />Supervixen:  Stop/start CD noises, as if your CD player is skipping, make it probably the most unique track on the album.<br />Queer:  Spooky, seductive, one of the strongest tracks, a hit single despite the fact that nothing on the radio sounds anything like this.<br />Only Happy When It Rains:  A tounge-in-cheek song about how dark this album is, its actually one of the happiest songs on here.  Featuring cool backwards-tracked hard slamming guitars.<br />As Heaven Is Wide:  Bitter, very synth-driven, very dark<br />Not My Idea:  Only Manson can make a nonsense line like \\"Dip-dip-da-dip-da-dip-du\\" sound like something you'll want to sing along with.<br />A Stroke of Luck:  Slow, dark, and cold, a song to listen to when walking around on a cold winter night.  This is where the album goes from really good to amazingly good.  Along with the next two songs, Stroke of Luck is the best on the album and my personal favorite.<br />Vow:  Amazing agressive song.  \\"I can't use what I can't abuse...and I can't stop when it comes to you.\\"  The perfect bitter revenge song.<br />Stupid Girl:  Probably the catchiest Garbage single, and one of the best too.<br />Dog New Tricks:  Very catchy, heavy guitars, a fairly straightforward grunge/rock song while still sounding like nothing else out there.<br />My Lover's Box:  Probably the worst song here, but far from bad.  The lyrics in the chorus annoy me: \\"send me an angel to love, I need to feel a little piece of heaven\\".<br />Fix Me Now:  A blast with its poppy chorus, with almost a bit of a retro feel or something<br />Milk:  A slow haunting ballad, with an amazing soft synth-type noise throughout that'll just have you wondering how they came up with it.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I was concerned that this cd would be based toward the younger kids, and would leave my 40+ self un-impressed.  Some of the songs were alittle rough, but the musical ability of Pink and her band comes thru.  There's some good blues music, acouple party songs, and some cryin' music.  All in all, a great cd.
B000002UA2|5.0|Crammed between their 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot; and their 1973 break-out phenom &quot;Dark Side of the Moon,&quot; it is no surprise that Pink Floyd's unappreciated &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; is an obscure item itself. The stirring soundtrack to Barbet Schroeder's film &quot;La Vallee&quot; (or, &quot;The Valley,&quot; about an expedition to a mysterious uncharted land), it was Pink Floyd's second soundtrack album (unless you count the collaborative &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; and other rare items). The band had previously worked for Schroeder when they composed the score to his 1969 film &quot;More.&quot;<br />Although I have never seen &quot;La Vallee,&quot; Pink Floyd's seemingly visual sounds have given me a great view into the film's mood; mysterious, adventurous. The two opening instrumentals provide a first glimpse into the mystic theme. From there, we are given a set of great tunes that establish the adventure of the story (&quot;The Gold, it's in the...&quot;, &quot;Wot's...Uh the Deal?&quot;, and the pleasant instrumental &quot;Mudmen&quot;). We also see little hints of romance in &quot;Stay,&quot; a rare subject matter of Pink Floyd, and some early cynisism of bassist Roger Waters in &quot;Free Four.&quot;<br />This soundtrack is an essential piece in Pink Floyd's lexicon, as it closed their days of being a cult band only popular in the UK and throughout Europe. A great way to end an era.

She ask was it was rated and I acted like I didn't know but the truth was I knew it was rated R but I just dying to see what Sarah was up to in the lastest movie of her's. When the movie got done I was very happy I got my money worth. Ever since I seen that movie it's my favorite movie out of the 90's I'm glad I went to see that movie maybe that is why Sarah is my favorite actress. ...
B000002HRE|2.0|Load part II.  With just as much filler.  Goes on equally as long (as in &quot;please won't this album be over with, I can't take it anymore&quot;).  Although I would have to rank it higher than the Black album and Load, something I'm sure most people would disagree with but I don't care.  Because even though its a bunch of torpid, overly heavy noise just like the preceding two albums, at least this one has more semi-decent songs.  Marianne Faithful's vocal is awesome on the Memory Remains, and I don't care if &quot;the original was better&quot; but I like the Unforgiven 2 more anyhow.  And Fuel is the perfect song to get into a car accident with, its happened to me so I can tell you from personal experience.<br />Anyway, I still hate the Metallica of the nineties.  The few semi-tolerable tracks on this album are not enough to change my mind.  The recently unbearable MI2 soundtrack song has lowered their credibility even further.  And Lars really, really, really needs to turn down his drums a little bit.  I mean I know he thinks he owns the band or whatever, but the man's got his bass kick set so heavy that he's just ruined everything this band has done in the last dozen years.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Given the title, I would guess that Kubrick's intention in starting this project was to introduce the film world to the metaphysical and ethical questions that life-appoximating machines would raise.  The only philosophical question raised by Spielberg's product, however, is whether artificial intelligence might one day correct real stupidity.  While I'm sure Teddy, the talking teddy-bear, was Kubrick's idea, (yeah right), I doubt Kubrick would have approved of the Chris Rock and Robin Williams cameos (which say it all).  In my view this film is a cynical insult to movie fans.  But as would be Ricky Martin finishing a Beethoven score, it's a triumph for false consciousness everywhere.
0736041850|5.0|Weight training isn't easy, and not just because of hard work, sweaty shirts and stinky gym shoes.  It's hard to know what excercises work which muscle groups, and this wonderfully illustrated book lays it all out.  Divided into sections for each major muscle group, its easy to pick and choose new excercises to work your shoulders, back, buns, whatever.  The diagrams also include pointers on good form, as well as modifications for each move (like, standing or sitting).  For every excercise, the illustration includes &quot;colored&quot; muscles so you really know what is being worked.  This book is great for beginners and even the advanced trainers.
6301963717|1.0|Guys, what do you like about this movie? I've seen <BR>Gabriel Byrne's incredible perfomance in &quot;The usual <BR>suspects&quot; and immediatly bought &quot;M.C.&quot;<BR>What can I say? Gabriel Byrne is great, but the movie is <BR>so boring... Nothing to compare with, for example, <BR>&quot;Once upon time in America&quot; (that's masterpiece!). <BR>BTW, it's the first time when I put a grade less than 4 stars.
B000002HMH|1.0|This album is almost completely filler.  The only songs I can stand to listen to are the first track, and Until it Sleeps, which is an amazing song even if the drums are too metal for my taste.  Hero of the Day is really bad, a sellout song if I ever heard one.  And the rest...this album just goes on forever, it seems like it'll never end, there must be almost 70 minutes of filler on here.<br />The thing is, Metallica are amazing musicians, the singer has a great voice, ect.  But still, I judge a CD on one thing only, and that's how fun it is to listen to.  That's why this one gets a one, its simply not a good album.  Cut back on the heaviness a little, especially on the drums, and focus more on making things melodic.  Or instead maybe bring back the old, complex Metallica who spent lots of time on songwriting and constructing epics like Sanitarium and One.  Also, I don't know if Metallica realize it, but they can make heavy music without cranking up the volume and prescence of all the instruments so much that it starts to hurt the songs.  That's probably one of the reasons so many people like old Metallica better; the production was a lot more reined-in and let their heaviness come from their instruments, not from a bunch of studio trickery.
B00005RFAI|3.0|I give her 3 stars for her songwriting ability, but as far as the melodies and the performances it's much left to be desired.<br />Some of  the songs on  the album are just as weird and obnoxious as the trouble making artist.
0345440900|4.0|This book had some very good ideas, some you realize once you read them are common sence yet you may not have thought of it yourself otherwise.  Like most books, it is best to pick and choose what you find helpful...don't take everything to heart because although she refers to various babies...they may not suite your situation.  <BR>NOW THE IMPORTANT THING...I have a 6 month old and just bought the book recently...at this stage it didn't really offer anything that helpful. But if you are pregnant or just home from the hospital, it may have some helpful tips for you. I am looking forward to Volume 2 - hopefully it will help me out more with the 6+ month stage.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Just as good as the Downward Spiral.  Its not an epic concept album, but it makes up for it with pure agression and accessibility.  If you're new to NIN then this is the album to buy.  There's simply no denying the power of songs like Wish.  I have no idea why that song never hit it big as a single, it should have been huge.<br />Pinion and Help Me I'm in Hell are great intro/intermission instrumentals, excellent proof that Reznor can produce work of genius even without using tons of layers of sound.  Wish is probably that catchiest, most straighforward agressive NIN song ever.  Last is great, with a very powerful sound, and Gave Up is like a sped up Wish that just careens out of control at the end.  Happiness in Slavery is my favorite song here.  Its the least accessible, but gets better with every listen.<br />As for the two bonus tracks, Physical seems to be a rare example of Trent Reznor demonstrating humor in his music by covering an Adam Ant song.  Suck, the other bonus track, also appears as a collaboration on Pigface's first album and is a pretty great track.  Reznor was wise to put these last two tracks as bonuses, because even though they're great they lack the power and production of the earlier portion of the album.<br />All in all, an album totally different from Pretty Hate Machine and the Downward Spiral, representative of when the raw power of NIN was at its peak.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|First time I heard ATDI I didn't know what the fuss was about. Finally I asked my friend to let me listen to Relationship, the first full cd of theirs I ever heard. I listened to it, and listened to it and so on. Heck I still listen to it and sing their songs all day. Awesome cd but I don't think its their best. To bad they are now split up into Sparta and The Mars Volta hopefully something good will come out of it. Buy it.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nickelback completely ignore the ideals behind the grunge revolution but no qualms about utilizing the now familar, marketable sound of grunge in their music.  Basically, this band is what Matchbox 20 would sound like if they suddenly decided that sounding like Kurt Cobain would help them sell more records.<br />How You Remind Me would be an annoying song even if it wasn't played at least once every hour on corporate radio stations.  Too Bad is the only slightly-less annoying followup single.  The lyrics are what truly make them horrible, just standard top-40 mildly whining stuff that's been rehashed a million times by now.  These aren't great songs, people, these are generic relationship songs sung in the grunge style.  Grunge had lyrics that were miles ahead of Nickelback, it had punk idealism, it had artistic aspirations.  Nickelback has nothing other than commercial aspirations.  As for the other 8 tracks here, they easily fall into the category of filler material and made so little impression on me that I can barely remember what they sound like.  In fact, I heard this entire album before there were any hits off it, and when I finally did hear the hits on the radio I didn't even remember hearing them the first time.  That's how unremarkable these songs are.<br />Perhaps the thing that annoys me most about this band is how this is their second album, and ironically it sounds even more like Nirvana than their first album.  They're supposed to have their own sound by now, but now I'm fearful album number three is going to be even more derivative still.  Nickelback are about as generic as rock gets, and have the integrity level of Bon Jovi.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I wouldn't ever compare a new artist to older more established ones except that I'm afraid that folks mignt miss out on an opportunity to experience the incredible india.arie. I had never heard of her until I watched the Grammy show and I must say that she should have won several awards. <br />I bought this CD based on her performance at the Grammy's and It is wonderful.

B00005O3VD|5.0|William Wyler was a perfectionist.  Barbra Streisand is a perfectionist.  Hence, the perfect DVD: &quot;Funny Girl.&quot;  Never have I seen a restoration as fine as this.  The picture and sound are perfect.  Now all you Streisand fans should no better in complaining about the lack of extras.  Knowing Barbra, she will have another version released in a couple years called the Collectors Edition with loads of stuff.  In the meantime, what a treat this glorious DVD is!  We have one of the greatest motion picture debuts of all time preserved forever.
B00003CY5J|4.0|In all honesty, I originally rented \\"The Score\\" just to see the location footage of Montr&eacute;al. I hadn't read any reviews because I wanted the film to surprise me, and boy, it did! I was completely impressed with the rapport between De Niro, Norton and Brando as well as the appearance by Gary Farmer. As many have said before me, Angela Basset's screen time was limited to something like 10 minutes more or less, but she did a fantastic job as Nick's girlfriend--saucy, yet devoted, someone Nick can trust in and rely on, a rarity in his *other* field of work besides owning a jazz club.<br />The cinematography was superb, from creative Steadicam shots (walking through the narrow, narrow door to Nick's tool room in the intro, panning around cars) to fantastic reflection shots (the Customs House). Much emphasis is placed on smoky, atmospheric lighting, with shadows playing a crucial role in charater development (as Jack, Nick and Max talk, all three are equally cast in shadow so as not to single any one of them out as the potential \\"winner takes all\\").<br />The music is equally impressive, including solid, sultry jazz performances by Diana Krall, G Club, Cannonball Adderly, Cassandra Wilson, Thelonious Monk, Mose Allison, and others. Unfortunately, none of these songs are included on the \\"The Score\\" soundtrack. But they make the atmosphere of Nick's NYC Montr&eacute;al Jazz Club spring to life--smoky lights and cool blue jazz as a contrast to the tense heist scenes.<br />All of the actors do incredible work with their roles, especially De Niro and Norton. Norton's double character of Brian/Jack was certainly a surprise. I did not think that he was being overly disrespectful to the mentally retarded--I have read reviews that stated it as such, but Jack was merely playing a role.<br />De Niro certainly appeared to be the tortured thief, torn between his wanting to settle down with Diane and run his jazz club and that one last shot at glory that he goes for time and time again. \\"How many times have you said that in 25 years?\\" asks Max (Brando) when Nick says he's quitting for the umpteenth time. But Frank Oz's masterpiece shows us his dilemna in the silences and the shadows that surround Nick.<br />The DVD interactive menus were user friendly and graphically impressive at the same time, starting off with an explosion of sparks accompanied by the sound of a watch ticking and counting down. I was a little disappointed with the \\"extra\\" features: a theatrical trailer, a director's commentary with Frank Oz and Rob Hahn (which did have its interesting moments, but like so many commentaries there are long stretches of silence and totally irrelevant information), the \\"making of\\" (which was more a recap of movie footage than actual \\"making of\\", and additional scenes (one improv with Brando and De Niro at the bar, an alternate coffee shop scene with Norton and De Niro and a longer scene with Mose Allison singing \\"City Home.\\"<br />Minor gripes: De Niro and Brando's French---aaaarrgh. That's all I can say. I cringed, I covered my ears...I actually switched the audio to French and listened to most of the film that way. That is a neat feature seeing as the film *is* in Montr&eacute;al, and some of the actors are francophone to begin with. The French dubbing was excellently done and followed very closely to the original script.<br />Lots of swearing, no nudity and no sex, some tense moments. The hacker character strongly reminded me of Burns Flipper from the PC game \\"The Longest Journey\\"--totally stressed out, mentally unstable, obsessed with technology and both were compulsive swearaholics.<br />\\"The Score\\" is a wonderful character/heist movie with a great setting (Montr&eacute;al), a killer jazz soundtrack, and three generations of stellar acting talent (Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Edward Norton). If you're looking for something new, something with a smoky,mysterious atmosphere and genuine white-knuckle-remote-clenching tension, pick up \\"The Score\\"! (And then go visit Montr&eacute;al to see the beauty of Vieux Montr&eacute;al for yourself).go visit Montréal to see the beauty of Vieux Montréal for yourself).
B00005MNP7|5.0|Eat To The Beat was a wonderful followup to Parallel Lines, but is one of the band's least-liked albums.  I don't know why perhaps it's because the record doesn't contain any top 10 singles like the inferior Autoamerican did.  In my humble opinion though, the songs on this album rival Parellel Lines for beauty and complexity.  Songs that make you go \\"WOW!\\" are:<BR>01.  Dreaming<BR>     Debbie really lets the Shangri-La in her emerge here (\\"beep! beep!\\"); this song is simply heaven, the cryptic lyrics are wonderful.  The quality of this song is so strong, one must wonder why it isn't more acclaimed, perhaps their best record.<BR>02.  The Hardest Part<BR>     A song about a bank robbery/love story;  great song, fun lyrics, throbbing beat.<BR>03.  Union City Blue<BR>     Another contender for The Best Of Blondie (I don't know why it wasn't included on that album).  This is one of the greatest lost album tracks EVER;  it's production is rich and layered (almost seems like a Phil-Spector engineered track);  Debbie's vocals are simply amazing, and the overall effect is sublime and dreamy.  <BR>04.  Shayla<BR>     This track really shows off Debbie Harry's vocal abilities, and the lyrics and production are surreal; great tune.<BR>07.  Die Young Stay Pretty<BR>     Not many people like this track, but I find it to be a tongue-in-cheek gem (Harry was 35 when this record was released).  This was Blondie's first foray into reggae (think The Tide Is High: the prequel)<BR>08.  Slow Motion<BR>     This is a percolating pop song with ice cream Debbie vocals and an experimental, varying beat.  I love it.<BR>    Note:  These are only the classics on the album;  the rest of the tracks are wonderful as well.  The only dud on the album is \\"Sound-A-Sleep\\" (10.)  I always skip over that one, most fans do.<BR>    The 24-Bit remaster is absolutely fantastic;  this album sounds like it was released yesterday.<BR>Even casual fans will need this record if only for \\"Union City Blue\\" (which isnot on The Best Of Blondie).  Believe me, that song makes it all worthwhile.<BR>My verdict:  Buy Parallel Lines first, then Eat To The Beat (then Autoamerican if you care to keep going).
B000002H6C|5.0|Masterpiece: that's the first thing that comes to mind.  About the shoddy production (especially to new listeners): i have to assume that the reviewer is referring to the bass sound -on that account, i will have to agree with them.  But the rest of the album's sound was a main factor as to what entranced me for all of these years.  It's tight, dry and totally unlike previous Metallica.  The compostitions are complex and well thought out.  Absolutely beautiful, I must say; ethereal.  &quot;One&quot; is not the feature song on this album in my opinion; &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot; displays the indicative transformation from wet and '80's to dry and '90's -perhaps even further into the future.  The album is enormous with respect to time, but keeps your eyes peeled and your mind active throughout the whole adventure.  Five and a half stars actually.
B000002JPA|5.0|Where to start?  SIMPLY THE BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD.  My review-actually no one person's review--will do justice to I&W, so don't wait for some ultimately persuasive words to click on the \\"Buy\\" button--just do it, IMMEDIATELY.  You'll thank me later.    I hate reviews that are put in general terms, so here are a ton of specifics:    For those who appreciate variant musical styles, this CD should be a no-brainer for your collection.  The more complex charts will probably not appeal to a mainstream demographic, although some tracks (Pull Me Under, Another Day, Wait for Sleep) will catch the average listener's attention with their riveting melodies.  But no CD in the last decade--or perhaps ever--can touch Images & Words for its complete musicianship and epic-style storytelling.  Dream Theater manages to fuse balladic lyrics and melodies with searing riffs and unusual technical complexity.  Rare is the band that pulls off such a cacophony of stylistic nonconformity and makes it work.  In Images & Words, DT not only makes it work, but makes it enjoyable to listen to.    Each song is a bit different than the other, and they run the gamut of categories from a short vocal soliloquy accompanied by only a piano background (Wait for Sleep) to an 11 1/2 minute documentary (Learning to Live) tackling the topic of being infected with AIDS (released in 1992 when AIDS still scared the hell out of people).  Most of the songs contain at least some passages in which the band is showing off its chops, but again DT showcases its talent without reducing the songs' artistic value.  For example, \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" is an in-your-face technical machismo-fest that retains logical musical progressions.   \\"Surrounded\\" teases the listener with multiple time changes, but the seamless beauty of the music is uncompromised (not to mention intellectually stimulating religious undertones in its fantasy-world lyrics).  And \\"Metropolis Part I\\" challenges both the musical and cerebral faculties of theaudience by previewing a story about one man's discovery of a past life through hypnotic regression.  Think of it as a \\"Prologue\\" to \\"Act I\\" of an intellectual rock musical.  What makes \\"Metropolis\\" even more impressive is how the tone of the music adjusts to match the widely changing 1st-person moods and 3rd-person perceptions of the story's characters.  It is brilliant work, continued in my 2nd-favorite of DT's studio releases (behind only Images & Words), titled \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory.\\"  In this album, the entire CD comprises 9 scenes from Acts I and II of the Metropolis \\"musical.\\"  Stunning and definitely worth buying, but I digress.    Why do I specifically enjoy this music so much?  As the son of two music teachers who had classically refined musical tastes, I was exposed to a lot of opera and symphonic music while growing up.  Oversaturation of the classics set in at an early age, yet through so much exposure I developed a mature appreciation for the fundamentals of musical technique.  After experimenting with the Styx-Chicago-Journey-Supertramp-Kansas-Triumph genre and some hair metal in high school, my favorite bands emerged as Rush and Queensryche.  These bands of course balance melodic hooks and technically difficult accompaniment very well, and bring meaningful lyrics into the mix.  I enjoyed some harder rock in brief moments, but the likes of Pantera and pre-\\"Sandman\\" Metallica were a little too heavy for me at the time.    When I was first introduced to Dream Theater through my college roommate's Images & Words CD, I instantly knew it was the perfect unique mix of my life's worth of musical tastes.  I must have spun this CD literally thousands of times over the last 10 years--for the first year I played it 3 to 5 times a day, back to back, sometimes skipping class to master the lyrics or reverse engineer the time changes and syncopation.  Impossible!  Hypnotic!  ADDICTIVE.    If this were almost any other band, I would say that the almost-too-self-indulgent vocals of James LaBrie are supported by some of the world's best chops on instruments.  But Mike Portnoy on drums, John Petrucci on guitar, and Kevin Moore on keyboards all have lead roles in the musicality of the CD.  While individualistic, these parts combine with a tour-de-force of power that somehow works extremely well together.  John Myung's bass part usually lends a supportive role rather than a leading presence, but his musicianship and technical mastery of the instrument are phenomenal as well.    LaBrie is an exceptionally strong vocalist, and his part-time bravado / part-time pussycat approach probably would not have matched as well with the style of any other band I can think of.  Each band member deserves a significant bio, but rather than having me take apart each of his tendencies in this meaningless text, one truly must experience the blend of talent in person to understand.  SO BUY THE CD!  After you've become hooked, check out some of DT's other work.  They are a band who have achieved a significant hard-core international fan base by doing things THEIR way, maintaining their dignity by avoiding the common and sticking to what makes them unique.  No sellouts in this group!    The bottom line?  After spinning the CD a few times to get through the technical facade, the listener finds himself interactively engaged with the music, craving a deeper understanding of the lyrics, wanting to decipher the difficult musical passages, and trying to imagine himself as a character in the dramatic scenes that are playing out.  Yes, the \\"images and words\\" brought forth by this music transports the imaginative listener to a \\"dream theater.\\"  Like the near-perfect details in these songs, the names of the CD and the band were not chosen by accident.    ENJOY!
B00005R87Q|4.0|I love this movie!!! I don't watch movies for the reality, if you want that then WATCH THE NEWS!<br />The movie revolves around the tried and true plot of a hot young cop, Brian (Paul Walker) befriending Dom (Vin Diesel) the charismatic hero in the underworld of illegal street racers. Throw in customised imports with enough neon accents to light up a football field, hot women who keep up with the guys, a suspect asian gang, the inevitable love affair between Brian and Dom's sister Mia and the desicion for Brian to make about where his loyalties lie  - and you got yourself one slick looking movie!<br />If you love car flicks (did you watch Knight Rider in the 80's?)  this is one Dvd that should be in your collection.
B000002JKA|4.0|Above average CD in progressive rock!  But as a fairly serious DT fan, even I must admit that their second studio effort with James Labrie at vocals left a little to be desired.  I had come to appreciate &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot;'s unique blend of melodic vocal strains and complex, riveting (but not bonecrunching) instrumentalism.  I was a little disappointed that they put so much emphasis on the hard edges of their music in this release, with very few complex instrumental interjections by comparison.<br />The lyrics were a bit more shallow for the thinking man than in I&amp;W as well.  Still some unique concepts but not quite as creative in my book.  I did think it was interesting that DT continued writing lyrics that arguably have some consistent religious overtones.  Throughout this CD the lyrics can be interpreted as the thoughts of someone who is experiencing a loss of faith, a search for faith, and/or a discovery of faith, depending on the song.  This would not be the first time for such a story line, in my opinion.  Going back to the &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; CD, for example, I interpret the song &quot;Surrounded&quot; to clearly reflect the process of being led through religious conviction toward salvation by an angel.<br />Anyway, LaBrie must have had some gravel rattling around in his voicebox for the majority of the &quot;Awake&quot; recording sessions.  His efforts to be an angry vocalist just didn't sound natural.  In fact, one of the best things about the &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; CD was how LaBrie's assertive yet elegant vocals kind of offset most of the &quot;hard edge&quot; suggested by the technical complexity of the instruments.  It also allowed the instruments to contribute their own emotional tone to the lyrics.  That sort of common emotional message among the parts just doesn't come across as well in &quot;Awake,&quot; because LaBrie is challenging himself to reflect the emotion all on his own.  This forces the instruments into more of a backup role--which is decidedly NOT Dream Theater-like.<br />This CD may have been appreciated by more mainstream rockers than I&amp;W was, but that is exactly what's wrong with &quot;Awake&quot;--the Theater almost got &quot;sold out&quot; while they recorded this CD.<br />That said, it does have some great moments.  And it has some great hooks.  In fact, I'm sure if I had discovered &quot;Awake&quot; as my first DT album, I might have listened to &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; and thought &quot;Where's the dark edgy feel I know &amp; love?&quot;  But that's not how it happened, and somehow the band didn't come together quite as convincingly in this release.  I'm glad they've gradually gone back toward their early-90's style.<br />If you've never tasted Dream Theater before, definitely buy &quot;Awake&quot; and take it in, but don't buy it first.  Buy &quot;Images &amp; Words&quot; along with &quot;Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory.&quot;  Then buy &quot;Awake&quot; and a couple of their other CD's from the middle years to get a grasp on their evolution as a band.  Buy their most recent release, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence,&quot; last to see how they put it all together.  All are great CDs for any rock fan who appreciates technical complexity in music.  I just wouldn't start with this one.
B00005JKZQ|4.0|This movie was lots of laughs from beginning to end.  It was a proof that a movie can be full of laughs without the use of four letter words in every other sentence.  Murphy is wonderful in his role as Trey Sellars patrolman and would be actor whose dream is about to come true.  Robert DeNiro is the detective he accidentally busts in a sting operation that is about to go down.  From there the action and the laughs begin.  I don't want to spoil your fun.  Go and see the movie.  I don't think you'll be sorry you did.
6304233639|5.0|This may not be the most profound movie about aliens and prospective human enslavement/extermination, but it's sure the most fun!  The computer generated special effects, like those of Jurassic Park, were examples of the most impressive technological developments in cinematography in years.  With the exception of a few Matrix-like camera tricks (and Sky Captain-like 100%-animation schemes), little technology has visibly improved to the average moviegoer since the days of ID4.  Audio is breathtaking.  Characters are fairly well-developed and likeable for a testosterone-based shoot-em-up.  It has enough love story elements to keep the soft-core audeience intrigued.  Intellectually stimulating enough not to be ludicrous.  What is there to complain about?  The most impressive part of the flick is that the whole thing could really happen...if you believe in that sort of thing....  Kind of makes you think about your place in the universe, but not so hard that you can't sleep at night.  Great movie!
630336568X|5.0|Sylvester Stallone plays an ex-Green Beret in this typical Action film.  I would rank this up there with Rocky 2 and 3.  Stallone's performance is amazing.  The cops mess with him and he shows them who's boss by retaliating using his recently learned Vietnam war tactics.  It's a police vs. Rambo fight in which they are on Rambo's territory.  This is a classic edge-of-your-seat thriller.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I loved Morning View. It is one of the best CD's I have ever owned! I would recommend this CD to anyone.<br />1. Nice to Know You- Great opening track. Lyrics and slow introduction really make the song great. 8/10<BR>2. Circles- Lyrics are some of the best on the CD. 9/10<BR>3. Wish You Were Here- I liked this song because of the mellow feeling. 10/10<BR>4. Just a Phase- Good song but the intro is around two and a half minutes. Once you start to hear Brandon singing the song gets better. 8/10<BR>5. 11 am- I love this song. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. 10/10<BR>6. Blood on the Ground- In my opinion this is the only \\"hard rock\\" sounding song on the CD. It is really great and the type of song where you cant get the tune and the lyrics out of your head! 10/10<BR>7. Mexico- Nice slow song. Props to Mike on this one. 8/10<BR>8. Warning- From the very first word to the last it makes you think about what kind of person you are. This song has had a very strong influence on how I look at life. 10/10<BR>9. Echo- I am in absolute awe of this song. It is so good! 10/10<BR>10. Have You Ever- Cool song. 9/10<BR>11. Are You In- You know they dont have the lyrics to the song in the CD cover so I assumed that there were no words. But I listened to it and it does. Thanks for throwing us off guys! 8.5/10<BR>12. Under My Umbrella- Another great song. 8/10<BR>13. Aqueous Transmission- Words can not express how much I love this song. If I had to pick one song to listen to for the rest of my life I would choose this one. 12/10<br />Go out and buy Morning View!
B000002AS1|5.0|I love the film \\"Forrest Gump,\\" and the music within.  Lucky for us fans, there are several soundtrack CDs available.  The instrumental one is awesome.  I have always been a fan of Alan Silvestri's music (\\"Back to the Future,\\" \\"Father of the Bride,\\" \\"Fools Rush In,\\" etc.). Included on that CD are all the instrumental pieces heard in the movie.  If you've seen the movie often enough, you'll be able to recreate the scenes in your head while listening to the music -- Forrest running, the feather floating, Forrest talking to Jenny, Forrest in Vietnam. A lot of very powerful songs can be found on that CD.  The other CDs (actually a 2-disk set) are a compilation of oldies used in the movies.  Relive the eras of the 50s, 60s, and 70s with all these great songs.  There are a few songs from the movie that are not on the soundtrack but it's still a good CD anyway.  Both CD/sets are great for any fans of \\"Forrest\\" and I would highly recommend them (especially the intrumental soundtrack).
B00004Z459|3.0|The CD is ok but not one of the best. The only songs that really grabbed my attention were Papercut, Runaway, and A Place for My Head. The rest of the songs were okay but not 4 or 5 star qualtiy. I guess if you liked Crawling and In the End you would enjoy SOME of the songs. I was very disappointed by this CD. To me it was a waste of my 15 bucks.
B00005Q66T|4.0|This is a great CD, no two ways about it. The main disappointment is that there is no new material on the CD (also, what happened to 'Nothing Really Matters'?) I can live without her cover of 'American Pie', because i thought it was a bit awful, really (although the single of it had a great dance remix on CD1. Humpty mix, i think it was called.) I'm glad of the inclusion of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina', because they're great pop songs. Other than that, it is a collection of hits from the albums 'Erotica', 'Bedtime Stories', 'Ray of Light' and 'Music', so for any real fan of hers this CD is surplus to requirements. But if you don't own those albums, then this is a must-have, along with her other hits collection, of course, the 'immaculate collection'.

B00005QGAZ|4.0|I bought this CD today, but to my surprise tracks 5 &amp; 6 wouldn't even play! But I called the 800 number in the insert and they're gonna send me a new copy which is good, didn't have to argue w/them or anything. Otherwise the CDs great and I LOVE someone in the dark!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|...the Beast is mean to Belle in the beginning, but Belle doesn't tolerate it. If she did, she would have went down to dinner when the Beast ordered her to. Belle has to be the most courageous Disney heroine out there. It's not until the Beast saves her from the wolves does Belle begin to start a friendship with him. And, she doesn't realize her love for the Beast until the end of the film. So, how could she possibly love the Beast to change him? The Beast changing himself in order for Belle to love him is more accurate. If I had a daughter, I would be proud if she patterened her life after Belle. She's a devoted and loving daughter to her father, she loves to read, she is independant, strong, brave and intelligent. What more could we want from our daughters?...
006441034X|5.0|Hands down this is one of my favourite books.  The first time I read it was two years ago, most of it while sitting in my high-school library laughing out loud and disturbing the peace.  It's just so hilarious and completely absorbing.  I fell in love with Howl.  I re-read it just now, and I've decided Howl is the epitomy of what I want a guy to be like.  I'm quite enthralled with his and Sophie's relationship.  There are so many precious moments in the novel, namely the green slime, Howl cathing a  cold, and the scarecrow.  It's so imaginative and original, yet familiar.  You can picture everything, and yet it's not at all over-descriptive.  It even has a clever little allusion to a Hamlet.  I rarely re-read books unless they're very special to me, as is this one.  And I discovered a lot of little things I missed the first time around.  In fact, you don't even need to like fantasy to like this book.  I think it has a little something for everyone in it.  And it has one of the most beautiful, non-cheesy, non-cliched romances I've ever read.
0375703861|3.0|Ever kissed someone with bad teeth? It's like liking a dirty stone (too much history, I think). Anyway, I wanted to stop reading this book until &quot;The Miseducation of Irie Jones.&quot; Before this chapter, the characters are bitter, resentful people who don't deserve to be played out in a book. Their story is archaic, one-dimentional and boring. From other reviews I've read the older people think exactly the opposite. <br />However, the book does change when you look into the life of Irie Jones, her school and her friends. I admit she's no angel and she's a little obnoxious but she is more sympathetic to the world around her. Who could criticize her when she struggles so much with beauty, racism and her hair? This is where history has led us to. <br />My reasons for the three stars is because about half-way through the book Smith breaks a major fiction rule by interrupting the story with a sentence of her own thoughts. With so many characters as narrator, Smith does not need to jump in but she does. Maybe it was something the editor missed or didn't think it was important. When I read it though it really jarred me.<br />White Teeth does have its moments. It's time to stop dreaming about the old days and looking into the new with understanding and patience. It's time to start taking care of those precious teeth.
0553284347|1.0|This must be one of the saddest books I have ever read. Not simply because of the gut-wrenching stories of abuse, but more importantly because of the totally negative \\"solutions\\" it offers.<br />All the way through the book I was aware of a feeling of pure rage and hatred emanating from the text. Just my imagination? I don't think so. Check this giveaway passage (from a \\"fairy tale\\" created by one of the author's patients) on page 287:<br />'Ivy [for Incest Victim] panicked. \\"But there's no way over the river,'\\" she cried. \\"Yes there is,\\" cooed Susan victoriously. \\"You may *ride on my outrage*. It has carried me far, and it will carry you too.\\" '<br />(emphasis added)<br />What a powerful, and revealing, description that is!<br />This constant harping on anger and rage is not simply aesthetically unappealing - it is bad psychology. In Chapter 9 - \\"You Don't Have to Forgive\\" - the author tells us quite categorically (page 187) that:<br />'One of the most dangerous things about forgiveness is that it undercuts your ability to let go of your pent-up emotions.'<br />Firstly, forget the \\"most cherished religious, spiritual, philosophical, and psychological principles\\" that the author rejects. The fact is that we have plenty of hard scientific evidence that holding a grudge will upset your body's chemistry resulting in significant physiological damage such as ulcers, heart problems and/or other stress-related illnesses.<br />Indeed, the whole claim (page 185) that:<br />'... it is not necessary to forgive your parents in order to feel better about yourself and to change your life!'<br />rings pretty hollow as far as I can hear.<br />Secondly, if the author thinks it so important that victims hang on to this raw edge in order to be able to let go of pent-up emotions, what sense can we make of the following description of a therapy group for incest victims (page 277):<br />'Every time a new member is initiated, group members must repeat what has long been unspoken. The more often this happens, the more everyone in the group is desensitized to the shame and guilt.'<br />If simple repetition is really so successful in dealing with shame and guilt - which are presumably amongst those \\"pent-up emotions\\" - why is it necessary for victims to refuse to forgive? Do different emotions have to be dealt with in different ways? Will the anger and rage still persist after the shame and guilt have (allegedly) gone?<br />Indeed, can we even take seriously this idea that repetition provides an effective way of clearing negative emotions? Again, the practical evidence is that repetition does not *clear* bad memories. Rather it literally *fixes* them more firmly in your brain. We may be \\"desensitized\\" on the surface, even as all hell breaks loose at the subconscious level.<br />This is, in fact, a good example of how being a victim or a \\"survivor\\" becomes an essential element of someone's core identity.<br />(\\"Victim\\" and \\"survivor\\" are actually very similar roles in that they both keep us looking backwards, chained to the past, instead of allowing us to let go of the past and move on.)<br />Nor was I reassured by this passage on 'confronting your aggressor' (page 294):<br />'1. ... If the aggressor claims not to remember, ask him to acknowledge that even though *he* doesn't remember, it must be true because *you* remember.'<br />Has the author never heard of false memory syndrome?<br />Both America and Britain have seen major child abuse witch hunts take place based on nothing more than this simple assumption - that everything a child says it remembers is bound to be a TRUE memory.  (Not forgetting the overenthusiastic care workers who \\"help\\" the children to \\"remember\\" non-existent events.)<br />The fact is that many children can VERY easily be talked into remembering things that never happened at all. Getting a child to mis-interpret an essentially innocent event - to favour one side or the other in a custody battle, for example - is just as easy, ifnot easier.<br />Despite the claim that this is the route to \\"reclaiming your life\\" I strongly suspect that whilst, superficially, it may *appear* to bring benefits, it is *actually* more likely (at a deeper level) to perpetuate the destructive effects of the initial abuse.easier.<br />Despite the claim that this is the route to \\"reclaiming your life\\" I strongly suspect that whilst, superficially, it may *appear* to bring benefits, it is *actually* more likely (at a deeper level) to perpetuate the destructive effects of the initial abuse.
B000003S0P|4.0|Red, the final record by the 70's lineup, at that time reduced to a trio of just Fripp, Wetton and Brufford.  Crimson knew they were going to split up after this one so they compiled some stuf together and the very uneven Red was born.  There are people who prefer this over the lineup's other two records, but I find it too bleak in some areas.  <br />The title track is great.  This is no warm song, it is straight forward and loud.  This one of the great instrumentals Crimson have ever done, the Fripp riffs are more technical here than on previous albums.  From the album opener you sort of know this is one is very metallic.<br />Fallen Angel contains more weird lyrics from Palmer James, about the death of a brother in the cold streets of NY.  This song is pretty good actually.  The chorus: \\"West side skyline crying, fallen angek dying, risk a life to make a dime\\" are some of Palmer's best lyrics.  <br />One more red nightmare is a song you either love or hate.  I think the saxophone parts are great.  The lyrics stink though.<br />Porvidence was an improv the band actually did live in Providence.  Without hesitating this is the worst Crimson instrumental.  Little squeals and sounds, a little drumming here and there.  Very forgettable.  <br />Starless, the album closer is sort of sad to listen to.  This ws the last song the lineup would ever record together.  It is my personal favorite off Red.  <br />Make this your last record by the 70's lineup.  Red is sitll pretty good, but King Crimson is like a dimamond.  You have to explore the different facets of this band.  It's important to sort of grow with the lineup and work your way up.
6304078102|2.0|Whoever wrote this script must surely have been trying to create an up-to-date, americanised version of the great British weepy \\"Goodbye Mr Chips\\".  Unfortunately the script and the score total undermine this excellent plan.<br />Richard Dreyfuss does his best to make Glenn Holland, the initially reluctant but eventually dedicated teacher - and a very good best it is.  But in the end there are too many clichés and not enough that is true-to-life.<br />Above all else there is Mr Holland's \\"Great American Symphony\\".  This is a key element of the plot because:<br />- His need to make money whilst he composes his masterpiece is the only reason he becomes a teacher.<BR> - His dream that the finished symphony will enable him to become a full-time composer is what keeps him going whenever things go wrong.<BR> - The final climax of the film centres around Mr Holland's pupils, past and present, getting together one last time to play this masterpiece on the day that Mr Holland is fired from his post.<br />Yet the symphony itself, when we finally get to hear it, is actually brief, vacuous, laughable, and totally unmemorable.  If you've been paying attention to the plot you have to wonder how come Mr Holland himself is so unaware of his obvious lack of talent as a composer.<br />The second major fault in the film also appears in the final scenes.<BR>Throughout the film Dreyfuss/Holland has regularly clashed with Vice Principal Wolters (more brilliant character acting, this time by William H. Macy), who regards the music department as a waste of time, space and money.<BR>In the end it is Wolters who informs Holland that, due to budget cuts, the music department is to be closed and that Holland's services are no longer required.  When Holland comments on how happy Wolters must be to see him go, Wolters replies:<br />\\"I care about these kids just as much as you do.  And if I'm forced to choose between Mozart and reading and writing and long division, I choose long division.\\"<br />Sounds level headed, huh?  But it ain't.  If the script writer had actually known anything about modern teaching then he would have known that there were already a number of reputable studies in existence which show that a regular helping of classical-type music (at least once a week) will actually RAISE all-round academic performance - including in reading, writing and long division.<br />So what do we get?  An overly long film (just under 2.5 hours) with a fairly banal plot and an ending which features the triumph of mediocrity - both in teaching methods and in the symphony.<br />I cannot help but imagine what it would have been like with a tighter script, a shorter running time, and an ending where the dawn of a new era of enlightened teaching was welcomed in by a genuinely creative piece of orchestral music.<br />Bottom line:  this film is like a damp rocket, all fizz and no fire.  So sorry Mr Holland, if I want to watch a positive film about education I think I'll stick with Edward James Olmos in \\"Stand and Deliver\\".  Apart from anything else it is based on true events - not just a giant helping of schmaltzy fiction.
B000003S0I|5.0|My favorite album of the 70's lineup of King Crimson which featured Wetton on bass, Cross on keyboards and violin, Bruffored on drums and of course guitar extrodinaire Fripp.  I picked this up after hearing the disappointing In the court...which never really struck a chord with me.  I own all three records by the 70's lineup and Larks is still my favorite album by them.<br />The two instrumentals, Larks' tongues in apsic pt1 and pt2 are both different from one another.  Part one starts out with what sounds like Tibetan bells followed by a quiet little riff before exploding into an explosive metal guitar by Fripp.  The second part in my opinion is not as good as the first but still ahs its moments, it erupts right after the crazy drumming of Brufford and dang, I forget the other guy's name on The talking drum.  <br />The other three tracks, Book of saturday, Exiles and Easy Money show the diversity of the band. The band can change styles and still sound coherent which is great.  Book of saturday and exiles are two soft guitar songs with strange lyrics courtesy of Palmer James. Then without warning Easy Money starts grooving along &quot;...got no truck full of ladida, keep my bread in an old fruit jar&quot; sings Wetton.   This track is filled with all sorts of strange sounds, the drumming is exceptional here.  <br />Not anything by the 80's lineup which included Adrian Belew, the former guitar player for Zappa, I would say this is the ultimate King Crimson album.  Starless has its moments, but the instrumentals and improvs on Starless sound loose and unfocused and Red simply is not up to par with this one.

Its about a band of rabbits trying to find a safe home. They go through all sorts of problems as small as crossing a rode to as big as escaping an army of angry rabbits. This is a geat book in witch you can see the world through a bunnys eyes.  Do not turn this book down because there are talking animals.  after a wile you wont even know they're rabbits!
B00000ICD9|5.0|I read the Book What Dreams May Come By Richard Matheson first, long before I saw the movie. The Book was very very good-I really liked it. But The reincarnation I had a hard time understanding-in the book, that is.The movie made it amazingly clear. <BR>Then I saw the movie. It started out quite different from the book-Showing Chris and Annie's first meeting. I really liked this new beginning-it gave them a closer kind of feel. <BR>When their two children died, I felt kind of like I wasn't sitting in my living room anymore-but like my mind was somwhere else-wondering where they had gone-what heaven is like.<BR>When Chris gets to his own personal 'heaven' after his death, I found myself imagining my own personal paradise, one perfectly for me. I loved that feeling that you got throughout this whole movie-like as if you were saying \\"What if that were me?\\" <BR>Hell was much liked it had been in the book-utterly terrifying but amazing in its way. <BR>But Annie's personal prison was far worse than any physical Hell-it was the mental hell, the one that we all know we have buried deep deep inside, and if we lived in it, like she would have had to, most of us would go completely and utterly insane-I know I would. <BR>Robin Williams-he's just-he's just. You know. Just...Lets just put it this way-if I could act like that, I'd get a billion requests for movie scripts a year. There could never be another Chris-Robin IS Chris. <BR>Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as well. His role as Albert could not have been a better pick.<BR>So when all is said and done, and the movie is over and you're sitting in the darkness, pondering what it was all trying to say, you wonder...wonder if maybe that beloved cat or dog you had as a child will come running and will knock you over and cover you with licks when you're dead and up in your heaven amoung the sky-maybe, just like Katie.And maybe, we'll keep our own heaven inside, just like our hell.
6303393977|5.0|This film truly deserves the description of being a \\"Classic.\\" Paul Newman and Robert Redford (in the company of Director George Roy Hill and a particularly appealing Katharine Ross), take the history of the bloodthirsty \\"Hole-in-the-Wall Gang,\\" and turn it into an affectionate cinematic portrayal of male bonding and cultural change.<br />Taking place at the end of the 19th century, Butch and Sundance are, as veteran actor Jeff Corey, playing a sympathetic sheriff and accidental existentialist, snarls, \\"two-bit outlaws on the dodge!\\" They spend much of the movie dodging a posse hired to hunt them down and kill them in the wake of a series of amusing train robberies. The location shooting of their escape is breathtakingly beautiful.<br />Ultimately, they have to flee the closing frontier, and end up in Bolivia, which is portrayed as a kind of low-rent version of the Old West. Their trip to South America is an intermezzo, done in sepia tint, focusing on their stay in New York, which, with its (relatively) modern conveniences, underscores how anachronistic their lifestyle has become.<br />Their inability to rob banks in Bolivia without using Spanish-language crib sheets is both hilarious and touching, a kind of paradigm of cultural and technological dislocation.<br />In keeping with its 1969 release date, the film has a strong antiestablishment cant to it: Authority is faceless, unyielding, and, mostly, inept. It is telling that Butch and Sundance kill no one until they \\"go straight\\" as payroll guards. Their criminal lifestyle is romanticized as a kind of \\"On The Road\\" on horseback. That this doesn't offend the audience is a measure of how fine this movie is. The warmth and humor overcome both the moral relativity of the characters and their sad ending.<br />Newman and Redford are wonderful together as the affable outlaws. Newman's Butch is a charming, flaky visionary who is trying desperately to cling to the past. When confronted with the new alarms and teller's cages at a favorite bank, he dismisses the guard's explanation of, \\"People kept robbing us\\" with a wistful, \\"It's a small price to pay for beauty.\\"<br />As Butch says: \\"The future's all yours, you lousy bicycles!\\" In a sense: the Western Outlaw was succeeded by \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" when cars succeeded horses, and train and bank robberies became Federal crimes. \\"Your times is over!,\\" Jeff Corey insists, and he's right.<br />Redford plays Sundance as the stylish straight man, never quite falling prey to Butch's dreams, but never able to dismiss them utterly: \\"You just keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're best at!\\" The onscreen chemistry between Newman and Redford is so palpable that although they only made two films together (\\"The Sting\\" in 1973 is a modernized version of \\"Butch & Sundance\\"), they can easily be considered one of the finest comedy duos ever, anywhere. The dialogue between them is banter between two very good, very old, very comfortable, friends. Maybe there was a script involved, too.<br />\\"Butch and Sundance\\" may be short on facts, but it speaks a kind of truth for which facts are not needed.ages at a favorite bank, he dismisses the guard's explanation of, \\"People kept robbing us\\" with a wistful, \\"It's a small price to pay for beauty.\\" <br />As Butch says: \\"The future's all yours, you lousy bicycles!\\" In a sense: the Western Outlaw was succeeded by \\"Public Enemy Number One\\" when cars succeeded horses, and train and bank robberies became Federal crimes. \\"Your times is over!,\\" Jeff Corey insists, and he's right.<br />Redford plays Sundance as the stylish straight man, never quite falling prey to Butch's dreams, but never able to dismiss them utterly: \\"You just keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're best at!\\" The onscreen chemistry between Newman and Redford is so palpable that although they only made two films together (\\"The Sting\\" in 1973 is a modernized version of \\"Butch & Sundance\\"), they can easily be considered one of the finest comedy duos ever, anywhere.

B00005U11Z|4.0|Ok let me say the basic stuff...Good picture,good sound,venue is alright,but not a great audience.Stage is not deep enough.The drummer is always too close to steve on the TV picture,because they are positioned too close on stage due to the stage size.That's not good production.To compare watch Styx 'Return to Paradise'DVD.<BR>Song selection is good,could have added some more songs.Steve augeri sounds as everyone says 'like 'Perry.Thats about it.the very fact that he sounds like Perry makes you want to compare and he doesn't stand a chance.If you are not familiar with the Journey ex-vocalist Steve Perry then You'll love Augeri.He deserves that much credit.<BR>It's a great concert and a must buy for all JOURNEY fans and even the others would like this concert which has some great tunes.<BR>Go ahead and enjoy.I loved it...But I wish another DVD with Perry also comes out.
B000000HZZ|5.0|Whenever I think about my favorite albums of all time, Gentlemen Take Polaroids is always among them. It was way too cool for it's time and to this day still holds up as a wonderful recording. The music is mesmerising  coupled with David Sylvian's vocals creating beautiful sonic landscapes. A real treasure.
0812550706|4.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is a futuristic book that looks at how the world would handle being attacked by an alien species. Some say that art is an imitation of life, in many cases this seems to be true with this book. The world does not take being attacked and almost destroyed by the \\"buggers\\" and has taken on the attitude that we, the inhabitants of the Earth, must win at any cost. All the nations of the world have come together for this one purpose-to be prepared for the buggers if and when they attack next. More importantly, we want to get them before they get us.<BR>  When the buggers attacked Earth, it took the entire world by surprise. No one was adequately prepared. In the mist of all that confusion, one man, Mazer Rackham, made a lasting impression and the military wants to \\"recreate\\" his genius and bring it into this new generation. Driven by this purpose the military adopts what I believe to be an unusual tactic-they literally groom children from the womb for war. Mere children as young as three years of age are fitted with a \\"monitor\\" in the back on their neck that connects into their spinal cord. These \\"monitors\\" allow the controller to experience everything that the child hears, sees, feels, and does. Only by knowing the child's every movement, every thought, and every motive can the military forces weed out the best prospects for the war on the buggers. The children that are deemed worthy are then sent to Battle School to learn the tactics of war.<BR>  One child in particular, Ender Wiggins, shows extraordinary potential. It is he that is used as a pawn in the earth's war on the buggers. Although only six years old, Ender is highly intelligent and is driven by what he perceives to be a just cause. He is young enough to be easily controlled. His entire life has been orchestrated in such a way to leave him isolated and unloved. These two elements combined mark him as the perfect weapon. Ender craves acceptance-he will only gain that through excelling at Battle School. Ender wants to be loved-the only person who ever loved him, his sister Valentine, has been taken away from him. To further control him, his superiors give Ender just enough information to make him believe in their war, fearing that he would not fight if he was ever allowed to see the whole picture. In the end, Ender is a mere toy designed for a specific purpose-to kill-and once that purpose is accomplished, he is a dangerous weapon they want to dispose of.<BR>  If it is true that art is an imitation of life, I pray that we never encounter another species. This book depicts how little respect we have for each other and possibly for another life form. The drive was so strong to be conquerors that they were willing to sacrifice their own children. In today's society we send grown men off to war and they come back, if they come back, scarred and damaged. We send young men, barely able to carry the title of \\"man\\" on their slender shoulders into the territory of certain death. But we do not send six-year-old children. We do not disguise the horrors of war as \\"games\\" to entice the young mind and we do not use trickery and manipulation to strip children of their innocence in order to turn them into \\"universal soldiers.\\"<BR>  Ender's Game is an interesting novel full of wonders and intrigue. It also makes one think about our humanity and our moral system. Just how far are we truly willing to go to be rulers?
B000002JNJ|4.0|Pantera's 'Cowboys From Hell' released in the mist of Florida's Deathmetal onslaught of 1990.. Did many things for metal [It influenced many] Dimebag Darell &amp; co was all over the TV [Not bad for a band that was once Glam] but 'Cowboys' rocks from start to finish, it's obvious that Pantera &amp; Singer Anselmo [1990] love Metallica, but as a Non American, i can't beleive the passing similarities to 'Exhorder' Their 1990 LP slaughter Of The Vatican' went unnoticed by the masses, though this much more raw sounding release, it tears stripes out of Terry Dates' production of Cowboy's [Low Budget S Burns] as usual.<br />Cowboys is a great album and ready available , Exhorder 'Slaughter' is a better album and totally unavailable,<BR>Don't make sense?
B0000024VP|5.0|While I agree that Dylan's genius made it hard for Donovan, the &quot;classic&quot; scene in &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; didn't quite play out that way. If you listen carefully, when Donovan finishes his song and hands the guitar to Dylan, he asks him to play &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue,&quot; and Dylan responds, &quot;You want to hear that song?&quot; He did not &quot;lay it on him,&quot; but simply honored his request.

B000000YG5|5.0|Sonny Rollins was at the time of this recording one of the greatest and most innovative tenorists. Today his stature is possibly somewhat overshadowed by that of John Coltrane, as Coltrane's individualism and innovative powers are very obvious. In his own way, though, Rollins also made a very important contribution as an innovator - perhaps especially in his handling of rhythm. In any case, he was certainly one of the most satisfying tenor players of his time, with a hard drive on up-tempo tracks, and melodious (never sentimental) lyricism on slower numbers. His phrasing was always interesting, articulate, and musical. This is an excellent record which shows him to great advantage, e.g. in \\"St Thomas\\" and \\"Moritat\\", though I personally think he is even more exciting when heading the trio on \\" A Night at the Village Vanguard\\", as, in truth, no pianist could really match him satisfactorily as a soloist, and he does not need a piano as an accompaniment. - Joost Daalder

B00005QDW1|3.0|this is no doubts worst album ever.. true no doubt fans would only say this. im not saying its totally horrible, but its just so not like them.. im a little disappointed in this one.
B00000JJHZ|5.0|Love it!  Have had the CD for many years and decided to buy it again on DVD-A format.  It is almost like hearing it for the first time again.  Unfortunately, it is only mixed for 2 channels. Now if the would remix it for 6 channels, that would be something.<br />Would love to see Giant Steps or some Thelonious Monk on DVD-A.
B00005NC66|2.0|What is french for dribble???<br />The editing of this film must have been done by either a blind man or a chimpanzee suffering from attention deficite disorder. The difference between &quot;art&quot; and a movie, art is for the critics to give arwards to and movies are for &quot;common people&quot; like me to enjoy.....
B00004SCX6|5.0|I LOVE EVERY INDIVIDUAL SONG ON THIS ENTIRE CD, but my all-time favorite tune on this CD was written by Britney herself. No other song on this CD (despite every song's brilliance) can compare to \\"Dear Diary.\\" Written by Britney Spears, Jason Blume, and Eugene Wilde, \\"Diary\\" wasn't Britney's only stab at songwriting; she wrote five songs on her latest CD, \\"Britney.\\" This is like when you listen to Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\" album, EVERY song is brilliant but can't compare to the last song on the album. \\"Oops!\\" is the same way. IF IT'S THE LAST THING YOU DO, BUY THIS CD!!!
0345350499|4.0|Once I figured out the language of this book, it became alot more enjoyable to read. At first it was like trying to understand a foreign language. But once I got the hang of it, I couldn't put it down! When I finished the book, I was sad because it was over and I craved more. I can't wait to read the rest of the stories that go with this one.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears' self-titled album is the BEST Britney album so far (but just wait till she puts out album 4). Britney is the BEST singer AND songwriter of ALL TIME, beating out the members of Pink Floyd, Tommy Shaw, Dennis DeYoung, AND Doug Ingle (although I LOVE that \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\"). The best songs she wrote for this album are \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"That's Where You Take Me,\\" \\"Lonely\\" (which has an \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\"-esque metal sound to it), \\"Let Me Be,\\" and \\"Anticipating.\\" The best songs she DIDN'T write for this album are \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" (I agree, it's not too melodic; it's SUPPOSED to not be!), \\"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"Boys,\\" \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll,\\" \\"Bombastic Love,\\" and \\"What It's Like to Be Me.\\" Spend EVERY PENNY on this CD.
B0000035E7|4.0|Okay, I had a really good time reading the customer reviews for this. Especially the negative ones. I like the one where this guy complains about *JOHNNY'S* little girl, hee. Was Kurt really THAT hard to understand?? Also, when did anyone say Kurt was a guitar virtuoso? Don't put words in Nirvana-fans' mouth. And there's more to songs and music in general than 10-minute long solos. There's room for every type of music and for every taste.<br />Anyway, I would agree with those who said that for Nirvana beginners, Nevermind, Unplugged and In Utero should be bought first and foremost (the first reason why I'm giving Bleach only 4 stars). But somehow, I can't help strongly recommending this one too. CDs like Incesticide are cool for the versatility of the songs, but I somehow like it better when songs create a certain mood and have a similar feel to them. Bleach is an album full of those kinds of songs. Also, I like Kurt's vocals better on this CD than on In Utero. There's just more rage and power in them. Sorry.<br />Blew- I love this one. It's got a great melody and great vocals.<BR>Floyd the Barber- Okay, I don't like this song. This is the 2nd reason why I am giving Bleach 4 stars. No further comment. <BR>About a Girl- Let me get this off my chest: this is my favorite Nirvana song *ever*. Sure, it's not as *significant* as Teen Spirit (which I do love), not as energetic or loud, but to me AAG is just incredible. It's so melodious and flowing and reminds me of the Beatles, with a slightly heavier sound. It's got great lyrics too, somewhat like hearing only one side of a phone fight. This song is the main reason why I can't help wishing that someone would release a cleaned-up enhanced version of this CD with a better sound. Yes, it's on the Unplugged too, but this version has more energy to it. <BR>School- my second favorite. I'd pick this riff over Negative Creep's riff, for better or worse, and the 3 simple lines complaining about how grown up life is no different from school are endearing.<BR>Love Buzz- I haven't heard the original of this. I wish I could, but can't find it. When I do hear it, perhaps my opinion of Nirvana's version would change, but as it is, I love it, especially the guitar parts.<BR>Paper Cuts- this song is depressing. From the vocals to the dark melody, it's sort of shiver-inducing. In a good way.<BR>Negative Creep- Heh, *Johnny's* little girl... Sorry, it's just funny. And the song itself is funny too. In a good, obnoxious  way. <BR>Scoff- I found a lot of people complaining about the repetitiveness ofthis song. Perhaps the last (3rd) time they repeated the verse was too much, but this is still my 3rd favorite song on the album. I just love that irritated roar at the end.<BR>Swap Meet- This is one of the songs that I found most accessible on first listen (besides AAG).<BR>Mr.Moustache- this song depends on my mood. It's pretty good but not one of my favorites.<BR>Sifting- again, I heard complaints about repetitiveness, and maybe so, but the lyrics are so strange and the tune is wonderful, making it my 4th favorite on the album.<BR>Big Cheese- see Swap Meet.<BR>Downer- *ahem*, the 3rd reason why I give this only 4 stars. Wasn't the Incesticide version enough? Needless to say, this song was a &quot;bonus track&quot; on the copies printed sometime after 1992, and in my humble opinion, there was a reason it was left out the first time.
B000002V0Q|2.0|After having grown up listening to the cream of the crop as far as early metal is concerned - Metallica (nothing after \\"Justice\\" though), Maiden, Slayer, Anthrax, etc. - I decided to check out your Essentials list to see where this musical genre stood among today's Amazon pundits and patrons. Most of your selections are solid - can't argue with Puppets, Reign in Blood or Back in Black. But this one has to be a joke. First off, Countdown is maybe Megadeth's fourth or fifth best album, if that, with silly, trite, uninspired vocals and lame, pop, bubble-gum rhythms. In fact, this disc, along with Metallica's \\"black album,\\" were the catalysts behind my decision to stop listening to metal around the early 90s. Where was the clever incisiveness of Peace Sells... or the driving power of Rust in Peace? All this album proves is that sooner or later everyone sells out in an effort to make their tunes more palatable to the masses. If this is what passes for \\"essential listening,\\" then I must say that the music industry is in worse shape than I had originally feared. If you're looking for some direction in what to buy, stick with the early stuff, and leave this garbage on the shelf- or in the can where it belongs.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|To critics of the Rainbow Children: forget Britney or whatever you're listening to and listen to this album with an open mind.  Like anything Prince has done, the groove on this album is tighter than tight.  John Blackwell holds down the groove so well it's scary.  Too bad he couldn't open up more on the album, but I can't wait to see the tour!  The music probably a little more harmonically sophisticated than your average teen-pop fan can comprehend, but it's not dense or overdone in anyway.  It seems the common complaint about the album is the \\"low voice.\\"  Yeah, it freaked me out the first time I heard it, but whaddya want, it's a concept album.  And as a concept album, it gets its point across.  The playing and singing on the album are fantastic, as is the writing.  At any given point of the album, the groove feels great.  Some have branded this \\"Prince's jazz album.\\"  The album is too produced to be considered jazz, and there is not enough improv for that classification to hold up.  However, when the horn lines and sax and flute licks scattered throughout the album add a flavor to the album that is pretty unique, as it is not a strictly jazz or funk album.  It's cool how neatly it pulls off being jazzy, funky, groovin and rockin all at the same time.  I don't find the album to be incoherent, as some have alluded to.  I think the diversity of the music on the album adds to its appeal: from blues influenced rock with some proggressive-ish moments, to a funky R&B feel, to a gospel feel, to a jazzy feel, even a disco beat, all with an overlying sense of a solid, and I mean SOLID, groove.  This album may very well be my favorite of the year, I doubt anything better will be coming out in this vain this year, or next, for that matter.
B000002J1I|2.0|Not much to recommend here beyond Squire's charged intro in &quot;On the Silent Wings of Freedom&quot; &amp; the nice harmonies of &quot;Onward.&quot; The next Yes album, &quot;Drama,&quot; is much more listenable &amp; inspired.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is one of their only fine moments.I had heard Let It Go, and I thought that had some cool riffs, but I heard this song WASTED on the radio and knew I had to buy it.What a great purchase!!I went on to buy High N Dry,etc. Those albums are OK,but On Through The Night, the 1978 45/EP and the bootleg First Strike are the only things you need by this group. They rock with fine musicianship and great lyrics.Any kids starting out as musicians should start playing this kind of stuff, and eventually be able to play a complicated song like Overture, which is the pinnacle of their career.If you have the original LP on Mercury with the skyscraper label-it comes with lyrics.Read along with Overture,and you will be amazed.The band never again came close to writing absolutely brilliant lines like \\"Time is the essence the priests do say, restore your faith in man, for the job you do and the role you play will help rebuild this land.Through empty streets and dusty fields we'll fight for what we need, protected by our swords and shields we can replant the seed\\" The song idea was subconciously based on Bohemian Rhapsody, but is very original in it's own right.Sorrow Is A Woman is another very powerful track, switching moods quicker than a kid faking a sickness.I would go as far as to say that Def Leppard was a true metal band for this album, everything after pales in comparison.High n Dry is a good album, but some of the songs are sickeningly similar, the only outstanding track is the instrumental Switch 625.I cant talk about anything after 81, as I dont like hair metal.I saw them live in 87 on the Hysteria tour, and I thought they were awful-they didnt play anything even remotely good except for Let It Go.83-87 were huge years for the group,so most people would not agree with me at all.I applaud the band for changing styles, a band has to try new things, I just didnt care for the new things they were trying.I can't believe On Through The Night is so overlooked by fans and by theband themselves.They should be playing 3 to 4 songs a night from these days.If you can find it, there is a bootleg called First Strike-it has a couple previously unreleased songs from 79 that are exceptional-See The Lights, Glad Im Alive,Heat Street. I think its out on CD as Warchild or something, not as good as On THrough, but close indeed!!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|...The hype...intrigued me enough to purchase the CD, with some trepedation. I was not disappointed. \\"Come Away With Me\\" is a leisurely paced after-hours collection that should lay the foundation for an illustrious career. The most refreshing quality of Norah Jones' silk and smoke tenor, is her appreciation of the value of understatement. She definitely not of the historonic, \\"look at my 5 octave voice\\", diva school. Like Billie Holliday or Eva Cassidy, Ms. Jones focuses on the intrinsic beauty of the song, itself, without the bombastic vocal flourishes. The legendary Arif Martins' trademark lean and clean production is the appropriate setting for Norah Jones' alluring voice and excellent piano work. The downtempo arrangement of Hank Williams' \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" is a seductive rethinking of the original. The songs where Ms. Jones really shines, however, are the songs of her guitarist Jesse Harris. The four Harris songs \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Shoot the Moon\\", \\"One Flight Down\\" and \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" fit her voice like a glove. Blue Note has plowed a lot of resources behind launching Norah Jones and \\"Come Away With Me\\" delivers the goods.
B000055WIQ|5.0|I must admit, I never have enough courage to watch this movie frequently, but when I do I see a movie that is a masterpiece even by today's standards. The new scenes the film company added on to here are amazing, such as the one where Reagan descends the stairs like a spider with blood dripping out her mouth, simply horrifying I'm telling you. This film, unlike some horror films, actually follows a very good story line, even if the prologue in Iraq is a bit tedious and long. But the reason for this, is that you will understand the film a little better. If your the type of person that enjoys getting spooked by movies such as these, I personally recommend you take the chance by picking up this movie.
0316921173|1.0|I tried, I really did!  I am your average 30 year old who likes to think that they enjoy a range of novels from Harry Potter to Oprah's club to Bridget Jones type tales to David Sedaris...my favorite book (I Know this Much is True by Wally Lamb) was even this long!  I barely made it through 150 pages of Infinite Jest...there is just too much to figure out!  I didn't like so many characters (I would have just liked to hear about the one family), and I think that you need to be doctoral student in literature to unravel all of the language. I am not one to give up on books (I read The Corrections!) but I was starting to dread my nightly reading times thinking about returning to this maze of a book!  No offense to the author's triumph...I guess I am not that smart!
B00000F1D3|5.0|This album still remains one of my favorites in my collection, whoever thought Cher would become this century's leading dance diva? Look to this album as proof, and you will not deny this statement. Sure the leading single &quot;Believe,&quot; was probably the most catchiest, but there is also &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;All Or Nothing&quot; which is just reeking of club flavor. In my personal opinion, I think this album is better than Kylie Minogue's new dance album. 'Believe' in me, and pick up a copy of this today!
0380804557|4.0|Stardust is a very different kind of fairy tale.  It can be light and happy at times, but it really is a surprisingly dark and adult tale.<br />This book should be looked over before giving it or reading it to your children.<br />That said, this book is very original.  It is well crafted and flows nicely.  There are many unexpected surprises, and nothing seems familiar or remotely jaded.  The story is about a young man whose life seems a bit dull.  The only thing that happens that is remotely exciting in his town of Wall is a fair.  The townspeople aren't even allowed to go out of the wall by their town (this is their town's namesake) ever except to see the fair, which is like a giant bazaar.  Sound dull?<br />Well, it's not.  The main character's life is soon turned upside down by his deciding to make a journey--a decision prompted by a strange twist of events in another world-- to outside the wall.  Let the adventure begin!  He journeys into a wonderful world where the rules are quite different from the life he previously knew.  He meets all sorts of creatures whose significance is clear later, adding to the twisted, but not too complicated, plot.  The characters he meets are oddball and colorful.  The plot is intriguing.  There is even romance which is real, believable, and endearing.  It is a delightful read, though it can be a bit depressing at times.<br />This colorful book is certainly fascinating and satisfying, with a storyline that seems to ramble but all comes very neatly into place in its own time.  I highly recommend it.

0880389052|5.0|I got this book near Christmas along with the other two books in the Dark Elf Trilogy. Some of my friends had a lot of R.A. Salvatore books and I recognised the author, but I didn't have any idea what it was about. The risk of buying it payed off, because it turned out to be a very good. BUY IT!!!
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is the best film yet about the Vietnam war. The film sets the stage well while the unit is stateside. The training and prep to go to war might have been a movie in itself. The use of the helo's in battle was portrayed accurately. The ground tactics were right on! This portrayal of \\"elite\\" troops in battle was superbly done. The film is fairly close to the Moore/Galloway book. This is the first time that I remember an honest portrayal of both sides. The shifts in perspective from the Viet regulars to Moore was skillfully handled. As a film and a bit of history We Were Soldiers is worth your time and money. The film deserves academy award consideration.
B00005Y228|2.0|The last I had heard from Kylie Minogue was her 1988 remake of Little Eva's &quot;The Locomotion.&quot;  Liking that one song, I bought her US debut album &quot;Kylie,&quot; and was disappointed to find that &quot;locomotion&quot; was the only decent song on there.<BR>Now, 13 years later, it seems that Ms. Minogue has done it again.  The song &quot;Can't Get You Out of my Head&quot; is the best one on the album...all of the other tracks are relatively dull, (although, I must admit, they are catchy.)  What bugged me was how all of the songs sound so  much alike that it became difficult to differentiate them from one-another.  <BR>If you like &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head,&quot; then purchase the single; unless you like monotony, don't buy the album.
B0000507UD|5.0|Believe me when I say this.  This CD is great.  I love all the rock songs especially &quot;My Way&quot; and &quot;Rollin (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot;.  WWF Superstar the Undertaker has &quot;Rollin&quot; for his entrance music.  I'll admit this guy is not my favorite wrestler but because he uses this song he has the best entrance.  Anybody who loves Limp bizkit or other rock stars like kid rock or Korn will love this Cd.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I am one of those who have just recently discovered the many faceted splendour of this album. I'm quite discriminating when it comes to rating and this is one of them rare 5 stars and truly it deserve every one of it. <br />What I like most about the album is how Clash manage to achieve a certain amount of cohesiveness in the flow of the album. First of all, there is a certain amount of constraint if one wants to achieve cohesiveness in a punk album. Punk songs are meant to be short, stark and to the point and it would be hard to weave that all in to a smooth flow. This is as opposed to psychedelic bands where there is much more space to play around with. Thats one of the best parts of this album, although it's punk yet they somehow manage to go beyond the whole 'punk-songs-make-good-singles' sort of feel. What's more, London Calling isnt an outright concept album which makes the cohesiveness of the songs all the more amazing. There are only main themes ( revolution, racism, modern day life ) which connects the songs.<br />Another reason why i find this album amazing is the album's, i shall use this word again, 'cohesive' eclecticness. This has been said many a time before but the diversity of this album is quite fantastic but what makes it special is that the band has somehow manage to imbue its signature on every song. When the band forays into a variety of musical styles, i should think there is a need for a benchmark for it not to veer too far away and that benchmark is them themselves. I somehow feel its all Clash-like and won't be too surprised if they come out with a whole album full of Guns Of Brixton sounding like songs. <br />Needless to say, all the songs in this album are great.<br />One of the best albums of all time!
B00005UQ9F|3.0|When the heck was this realeased? Was I sleeping???<BR>Plot starts spooky, sans MTV's &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. Has a ton of potential, bulds well. Far better than most &quot;slashers&quot;-- but disappointing ending.<BR>If you like chillers, rent it.<BR>If you want SCARY??????<BR>&quot;The Changeling&quot; w/ G.C. Scott. Probably the best ghost movie ever made.
B000024D4R|4.0|What i like about this album is its structure. Three meaty songs sandwiched by two thin almost symmetrical slices of a folk like tune. A very good flow from song to song and also within the songs itself. From verse to chorus and chorus to verse and on towards the improvisions, it has a very nice structure. And so too with the lyrics, the simplification of society into three main groups providing the structure for the story. <br />The songs are excellent as well. The extended jams are not overblown and overwrought as i feel some progressive rock groups tend to see it as a must indeed for its albums to be deeemed 'progressive'. <br />Since i cant really mentioned any stand out tracks considering that it is made up of only 5 tracks, i shall have to focused on the music which goes on within this songs. One of my favourite parts are the use of the synths to carry on the note while the vocals fade out (Sheep). I have not heard any artist which uses this technique then. The guitars on this album is good as well. I really like the solo and the rhythm parts to Dogs. The lyrics are stark and strong, which goes well with the concept of this album. <br />This album is definitely in my top 25. The only other Pink Floyd album which tops this one is Dark Side of The Moon. Many have said that Wish You Were Here or Piper at the Gates of Dawn or The Wall is better than Animals. Wish You Were Here never did strike a nerve with me. Its' main failing is the last track of the album, SOYCD Part 6-10. I have yet to hear Piper at the Gates of Dawn in its entirety, so i cant comment on that. And the second disc of the Wall is just too weak for it to be considered a classic.
0471413909|5.0|Before I found this book, I'd heard of the Stone Age diet and wished I could adopt it. The restrictions--no grains, legumes, dairy products, or processed foods--sounded formidable, as did the requirements--fresh meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit, the wilder/more organic the better. But my health problems have recently goaded me into adopting a rough form of this diet, and I've needed a diet manual to focus and refine my new food choices. Voila! I found The Paleo Diet just yesterday and am already convinced it's the right diet book for me. I do feel better since I started eating more animal protein and no starch a few weeks ago, but I've been having trouble with fatty meats, and Loren Cordain's book explains why.<br />The reviewers here who argue that saturated fat has been getting a bum rap, that our Stone Age ancestors undoubtedly ate the whole bird and not just the breast, etc., appear to have read the book cursorily, if at all. Cordain clearly explains that the animal protein prehistoric people thrived on had nowhere near the amount of saturated fat found in today's domestic meats, poultry, and dairy products. Quoting from the book, \\"Paleolithic people couldn't eat fatty meats if they tried--they had nothing like the tubby grain-fed animals that produce our steaks today.\\" Readers who want more science may consult the 20-page bibliography in the back of the book.<br />The Paleo Diet is primarily a diet manual, a nutritional primer, and a cookbook, loaded with practical information (e.g. \\"How to Be a Savvy Shopper for Fish,\\" \\"Dining Out, Travel, and Peer Pressure,\\" etc.) for readers who want to adapt the Stone Age diet to the 21st century. What's more, the book is engagingly written and extremely readable. Above all, Cordain makes the Stone Age diet seem simple. If I could give his book an extra five stars, I would!
0790736918|5.0|If you only see one western in your life this is it !!  A true classic in every form, from the script to the directing.  John Wayne should have received an oscar for his portrayl of Ethan  Edwards.  John Ford's use of lighting and the opening scene blends so well with the closing scene, true art at it's finest. I would love to see this re-released in the theaters, a story that not only is compelling, but one that you become a part of. A film that you can watch with the entire family.

This book will show you how to accumilate wealth and still live comfortably along the way.  Where you end up in life comes from many different choices you make in your life time.  This book is your road map to making the choices that will allow you to retire, really retire, and have the nestegg you will need.  If you don't read this book until you are my age it still could help you,(not nearly as much)  ...It's not over till it's over.
B00005B36H|5.0|What more can be said about such a weighty piece of work?  Tool has always managed to avoid the \\"they're popular, so it's cool to hate them\\" label, and they do a fine job of avoiding the modern rock stereotype.  Tool has always been about the music first and the musicians second.<br />So what about the music here?  As with AEnima, Lateralus is long--very long.  As with AEnima, there are a couple of non-song-y \\"filler\\" tracks (which are good, too).  And, as with AEnima, this is the type of album you listen to, all the way through, because it's an 80-minute journey.  Unlike AEnima, however, the dismal attitude and apocalyptic pining (and accompanying profanity) have been replaced by (gasp!) optimism and a yearning to understand the here and now, and the hereafter.  More than once on this album we hear Maynard's powerful yet beautiful voice singing listfully about \\"this form\\" and how we can \\"swing on the spiral of our divinity, and still be a human\\" and other such weighty matters.  There's still a requisite \\"angry\\" track, \\"Ticks and Leeches,\\" which contains perhaps the most frightening vocal noise I've ever heard from Maynard.  Up next are four tracks which comprise the spine of your listening experience--\\"Lateralis\\" thru \\"Triad\\" seem to define the scope of this album by themselves, even though the lyrics here are very minimal (\\"Triad\\" has none at all).<br />When the sociologists look back on our era, they won't remember the Britneys, the Bizkits, or the Blinks as the artists who mattered in our century--they'll have Tool.
B00000DCHD|4.0|Billy was arguably the first artist I ever was a fan of, listening to this album and memorizing the lyrics at age 4. And 25 years later it still sounds excellent, particularly on CD. I can never skip over the hot-rocking \\"Big Shot\\" with its heavy guitar-drum-piano interplay and its tough-guy lyrics. \\"Honesty\\" is a strong contender for Billy's most beautiful piano ballad(competing with \\"And So It Goes\\" or \\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\"), while \\"My Life\\" is a rhythmic ride that's hard not to sing with. Then Billy gets into his bluesier side for the first serious time, taking us on a trip into this facet of his style with the classic-jazz adventure \\"Zanzibar\\", the sneeringly sax-heavy \\"Stiletto\\", and the entrancing Latin-styled \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\". \\"Half A Mile Away\\" is as catchy a rock tune as his '80s singles(like \\"I Go To Extremes\\" and \\"Tell Her About It\\"). A gem of a BJ love song surfaces with the minor-keyed, slightly orchestral \\"Until The Night\\", and the album closes with the Ray Charles-esque title track, one more of Billy's bluesy jaunts. My only complaint is that this song, like a few others, is a little too short, and we're left wanting more. Me, I just put it on again.<br />Billy's knack for employing a concert's worth of different styles has often been one of his hallmarks, and the little variances on 52nd Street make it an album you can't call your BJ collection complete without. This is another one you won't want to take out of your stereo, so crank it up and enjoy. Once you're on 52nd Street, it's very hard to leave!

B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World , a dark comedy about teen angst, serves as an antidote to all those mindless Hollywood teen comedies and/or dramas that sprout up in multiplexes like summer weeds. Be forewarned that this antidote is far stronger than many viewers can tolerate. Consider the tag line that appeared on its theatrical posters: \\"Accentuate the Negative\\"<br />Movies about the alienation that some teenagers feel can be traced back fifty years to the James Dean classic, Rebel Without a Cause. Prior to this film, pathologically unhappy kids were always depicted as residents of slums and orphanages. Suddenly, here was a movie that showed kids growing up lost and miserable in a middle-class environment. The idea that the American Dream had a dark side was controversial then. It still is. <br />In Ghost World, Enid and Rebecca [brilliantly played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson] are best friends who are just graduating from high school. They're of the super cool, intelligent group that sees beyond the hype and myths of our consumer driven society. As the movie plainly shows, those who see the world too clearly can end up even more clueless than those who see it through a mental fog can. It points out that belief in false values can be more comforting than belief in no values at all. This, of course, presents one of the great conundrums of life in suburbia. <br />Enid and Rebecca's plans for the summer include getting an apartment together. Rebecca is the more realistic of the two. She gets a job and goes about looking for a place for them to live. Enid is paralyzed from seeing little of meaning in her life. Her assessment of the world around her is accurate, but her attitude starts to cause a rift in her relationship with Rebecca. <br />The girls alleviate their boredom by play mind games with people. When they read a pathetic personal ad in the newspaper, they decide to contact the nerdy-sounding guy who placed it. This turns out to be Seymour [Steve Buscemi], who collects old 78 rpm records, hasn't had a date in years, has forgotten how to carry on a normal [meaning banal] conversation, and has made a lifestyle out of alienation. Enid has found her soul mate, but can two such searching souls ever truly bond with another person?<br />Director Zwigoff, who in real life is not unacquainted with alienation, has made an ingeniously original movie. The subject matter may be dark, but it is never brooding. Humor abounds in nearly every scene, although much of it is the kind that some people don't understand or don't appreciate. Too dry, too scathing, etc.<br />Ghost World is based on a famous underground comic book `novel', which may be why the world it shows often seems to be coming from some alternate reality. The place the girls live in exists in its own time and space. Everything's just a little too bright, a little too strange, a little too off center. I liked this odd point of view. It made the black humor more palatable. This city wasn't like the one I live in. Or was it? I couldn't really solve my problems the way Enid did at the end. Or could I? Is her world science fiction, or is the real fiction the world we have created? <br />Some people will always dismiss the problems that cause teenagers who have been given `everything' to see their lives as lacking in meaning. Ghost World  doesn't provide answers or solutions. It does do its quirky best to show us that there are valid reasons why some people see life's illusions too clearly, both in the movie's world and in the real one. It also says that such people are not necessarily as weak as they appear. They can and do go on to lead useful, productive lives. But first they must find their way out of the mess they were born into.
B000003C4K|4.0|yes, this is exodus' first record and it is real good. if you liked old metallica, anthrax, or slayer, and you are looking for something similar this is what you need. be warned though, the lyrics are kind of cheesy. i am also not the biggest fan of paul bailoffs voice but you will get used to it. its too bad exodus never got as much recognition as metallica, megadeth, anthrax or slayer, they sound just as good as any of them. this album will still forever rule, its too bad Paul died recently. R.I.P. Paul Bailoff.
B00003CXV4|2.0|While watching Sweet November it occurred to me that I might be wrong in always blaming Hollywood for its seeming inability to make a decent romantic movie these days. Perhaps, I thought, society has changed so profoundly in the last thirty or forty years that the genre is no longer viable. Some people believe that movies influence society's behavior, but I am inclined to think that they merely reflect our collective points of view at any given time. And, frankly, my dears, I suspect society at large no longer gives a damn about romance. This Sweet November is a remake. The original came out in 1969, back when people still laughed at how material we could be. Now materialism is king. It's the new religious order and demands to be taken with utter seriousness. In such a climate, romance is forced to take a back seat, and I don't mean in a fun way. You'll see what I am talking about as you read on.<br />Nelson is a driven ad agency exec whose current girl friend is about to pack her bags because Nelson is so obsessed with his work that he pays her no attention. He seems to have it all - the lavish loft apartment in a trendy section of San Francisco, a car that costs as much as some people's houses, designer suits, a fat paycheck, and, since he is played by Keanu Reeves, good looks. All of this success has gone to his head, and he's now a spoiled brat on his way to becoming a tyrant. One day he meets the gorgeous Sara [Charlize Theron], a woman with a definitively alternative lifestyle. When she announces that she's chosen him to be her man for the month of November, he blows her off. He rethinks her proposal the day he is deservedly fired. She promises that in the month they are together, she will make a new man of him, one who appreciates the really good aspects of life. When he asks why they'll be together only thirty days, she gives him some silly answer. In truth, Sara has good reason to limit her time in relationships, but she soon finds that Nelson is turning into a man she can't easily let go of, for in him she discovers that most elusive of emotions - love. <br />Reeves and Theron make an attractive couple and exude a good bit of chemistry. Their initial meetings are fairly silly and unconvincing, but once they get serious about each other, they are interesting to watch. I don't normally think of Reeves as a romantic lead, but the casting is appropriate here because Nelson must turn from a jerk into a nice guy. Nice guys are right up Reeve's alley. <br />I suspect the problem with Sweet November is connected to all that materialism we see today. I think it breeds a culture of permanent adolescence. A witty and urbane lead character is rarely seen now. In updating the story, Sweet November's writers created a modern man in Nelson, and that man comes off as childish, petty, vain and egotistical. It's someone we see more and more of in movies. It's hard to root for a someone like that, especially in the first half of the film. It also makes it harder to relate to the woman. You keep wondering why she would fall for a guy like that. If that's all that's available, then romance is truly doomed.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Every era has movies that define it, set it apart and act as a sort of historical notation of the moods and points of view of the people of its time. Traffic, director Steven Soderburg's sprawling and ambitious look at the effects of America's war on drugs, is one of those movies. Years from now, I suspect people will view it and admire its power. They will also ask themselves what we/they were thinking back then. Can the 'war' really be so misguided, so fatally flawed? Does it solve anything, or does it simply escalate the misery and violence? Does it inadvertantly act as a price support system for the drug cartels? The movie almost never preaches. It simply records (in near documentary fashion) three distinct yet somewhat interwoven stories. It doesn't tell you what to think. It merely suggests that you do think about the possibility that a new approach to drug abuse be taken. Those who do not wish to dwell on the subject can take Traffic on its other level, which is that of a first-rate thriller.<br />One story revolves around Javier [Benicio del Toro], a Mexican cop in Tijuana. Javier is by nature an honest man who wants to do good, but he is well aware of the corruption all around him. When he and his partner make a substantial drug bust on their own, their mission is intercepted by a group of soldiers working for the Mexican equivalent of the United States drug czar. From this incident, Javier becomes tangled in a lethal web of lies and corruption. Meanwhile, across the border in San Diego, Helena Ayala [Catherine Zeta-Jones], who is at the top of the local social circle, watches in horror as the DEA busts her husband and charges him with being one of America's biggest drug kingpins. Slowly, Helena realizes that the businessman husband she has loved and trusted all these years really is a master criminal. When a rival gang threatens the life of her young son, Helena decides to take some radical action. In the third story, Robert Wakefield [Michael Douglas], a Federal judge in Ohio, has just been appointed head of a US task force on drugs. He heads to Washington hoping to make a difference. He quickly realizes that the drug war has turned into a political circus. Elected officials no longer believe it can be won but are determined to put on a show for the folks back home. After Robert discovers that his own daughter is an addict, his view of the world is quickly turned upside down.<br />Besides the actors mentioned above, there are many others in the cast. All of them are great. Don Cheadle and Luis Guizman play DEA agents who relish being assigned to the Ayala case, not because they still believe they are making a difference, but because they get to go after a white man for a change. In a star-making performance, Erika Christenson is remarkable as Caroline Wakefield, the addicted daughter. Of all the characters, hers may be the most telling. Drugs pervade every segment of our culture. Caroline and her friends don't fit the user stereotypes. They are smart, educated and privileged. They are the very children of the group probably most in favor of the war on drugs. As Michael Douglas's character says, \\"How can we make war on our own families?\\"<br />Some viewers may be put off by the movie's documentary style, but I liked it. Director Soderburgh was himself the cameraman. This is most unusual in a big budget project, but it is typical of this ever inventive director. In post-production, the film negative was color-washed. The result is that the Mexican scenes have a yellow tone, the Ohio and Washington segments have a bluish hue, and the California parts are in bright or 'normal' colors. Not only did I find this interesting to look at, it made the movie, which jumps around a lot, very easy to follow.<br />Traffic isn't perfect. One scene in particular doesn't make good sense, but I can't tell you which one without spoiling the plot. Any film with a great number of characters is apt to confuse some people. Still, despite a few flaws, it is easily one of the top five American movies of 2000 .few flaws, it is easily one of the top five American movies of 2000 .
B00003CXRP|2.0|Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks. <br />This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning. <br />The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.<br />Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.
B00003CXSM|2.0|The week that The Wedding Planner opened, its star, Jennifer Lopez, set some firsts. The movie came in at number one, and so did her new CD. Rarely before had a popular performer managed such a feat. The album is fairly memorable, but, alas, the movie is not at all. It should soon fade into oblivion. Perhaps the best thing about it is that is offers further proof that Ms. Lopez can act.<br />When it opens, Maria [Lopez], who plans weddings for a living, is orchestrating a lavish one. She pulls the big event off smoothly, and then goes home. Here we see that, outside of her profession, Maria doesn't have much excitment in her life. She lives alone and has nothing better to do with her spare time than to eat some takeout food and watch TV or to join her father and his friends at their Scrabble club. One day she is crossing a street and gets the heel of one of her new Gucci shoes caught in a manhole cover. While she tries to free her shoe, she is nearly run over by a runaway dumpster. She is saved by the handsome Steve [Michael McConaughey], who is a successful pediatrician. That night they have a romantic, but chaste, date in a park. At first it looks as though Maria has found Mr. Right, but the next day she finds out that Steve is the fiance of her newest and richest client. Meanwhile, her father, an Italian immigrant, decides that Massimo [Justin Chambers], a boy she knew as a child in Italy, is perfect for her. This sets up one of the oldest plots in the romantic comedy genre. A girl is in love with a man who isn't available while being pursued by a nice guy she doesn't love. <br />The problem with The Wedding Planner isn't the tried and true story line. There are, after all, only a few acceptable themes in romantic comedy. The problem is with the dialog. The screenplay is not outrageous enough to be a screwball comedy, not racy enough to be an adult comedy and not clever enough to be laugh-out-loud funny. It is simply bland, which is a problem in any kind of movie. <br />I suspect that Ms. Lopez was drawn to the part because her character is a prim, buttoned up type, the opposite of the star's real life image. Playing against type, she does a fine job, but this is not enough to carry such a lightweight story. McConaughey drawls his way through his role, playing Steve so limply that it's hard to see the attraction. Bridgett Wilson-Sampas is good as Steve's intended, Fran, who only thinks she wants him. What few great comic moments there are belong to Joanna Gleason and Charles Kimbrough as Fran's out to lunch parents, and to Justin Chambers as Massimo.<br />You know a movie is in trouble when it constantly reminds you of other, more memorable movies. I kept thinking about Hepburn and Tracy or about Doris Day and Rock Hudson. I remembered how witty and outrageous some of their movies were. I found myself wishing I were watching one of them instead.
B00003CXRM|3.0|Joel and Ethan Cohen, two brothers from the Midwest, have been making quirky, flamboyant movies for two decades. They have created some delightful films, including Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Fargo. O Brother, Where Art Thou? isn't one of their best efforts. It has some great scenes and superb acting, but the whole thing never quite adds up to a satisfactory whole. Still, even a minor Cohen movie ranks above the Hollywood average. <br />The movie is based loosely - very loosely! - on Homer's epic Greek poem, The Odyssey. It takes place in the Mississippi Delta during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When it opens, Ulysses, Pete and Delmar [George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson] are escaping from a chain gang, and they spend most of the rest of the movie running from the law. Ulysses talks the other into escaping by claiming he buried the loot from a big robbery. They have to get to it quickly, he says, because the place where he buried it is about to be flooded for the creation of a lake. Their madcap adventures cause them to meet many strange, eccentric characters. There is the blind man who endlessly rides the rails and foretells the futures of those he meets. They meet the Bible salesman from hell, enthusiastically played by John Goodman, as well as three sirens who set out to seduce and rob them, a black blues musician who has just sold his soul the Devil at the crossroads, and Ulysses' wacky wife and daughters. They find some interesting discoveries, as well as some ugly surprises. <br />As is typical of a Cohen brothers film, this one is fast-paced and rarely gives the audience time to think about what it has just seen. The movie is more a series of vignettes than it is a well structured story. Scenes that work are both hilarious and impressive, but the problem is that others fall flat. Also, the ending is uninspired, as if the team were unable to come up with a suitable punch line to their tale.<br />Most of the actors here have worked with the Cohens before, which allows them to be quite comfortable in their roles. Tim Blake Nelson, as dimwitted Delmar, and Holly Hunter, as Ulysses' wife, are standout. This is George Clooney's first picture with this group, but he has no trouble fitting in. He is very good and very funny. In fact, in the last five years he has become one of my favorite actors.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Snatch is a fast-paced gangster thriller from England. Like many such British films, it is equal parts drama and black comedy. Our friends in the UK may take crime seriously, but they can't bring themselves to do the same with criminals. Perhaps there is a lesson for us there. I thoroughly enjoyed Snatch, but I must warn you that the accents can sometimes be hard to understand. The one used by Brad Pitt is intentionally indecipherable. Fortunately, I watched the DVD version, which has an option that puts subtitles on the screen whenever Mt. Pitt speaks. The video edition does not have this feature, but that doesn't matter too much. His dazzling performance is entirely physical in nature, so what does it matter what he has to say? The other characters don't understand him either. <br />The movie was directed by Michael Ritchie, who is probably better known to Americans as Madonna's husband. His first picture, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, was also about psycho bad guys; in fact, Snatch is so similar to it that it is practically a sequel. The characters are different, but many of the same actors appear in both movies. Both films also share Ritchie's frenetic, stylish editing, as well as his fascination with lowlifes. <br />The plot is so complicated that describing it is difficult. I had little problem following it, but several reviewers admitted to getting completely lost. Basically, the story is about a huge diamond that gets stolen from a jewelry company in Amsterdam. It bounces from one group of criminals to the next, and, of course, everybody wants to get their hands on it at any cost. Meanwhile, a boxing promoter is having a very difficult time with a vile, ruthless gang boss who is demanding that he fix a fight. This is where Brad Pitt's character, One Punch Mickey, comes in. He is part of a band of gypsies [thus, the accent] who are the trickiest double-dealing folks you are every likely to see. Soon, everyone is merrily out to get everyone else.<br />The characters all have names straight out of a Damon Runyon story - Frankie Four Fingers, Bullet Tooth, Boris the Blade, Turkish and Brick Top are some of them. I think the names alone are enough of a clue that the movie is not to be taken seriously. One problem some viewers will have with it is that there are two or three times as many characters than in most movies. Keeping up with them can be a challenge.<br />Snatch should prove to be great fun for those who love for a movie to be fast and innovative. For those who like them to be cool, calm and collected, another choice of movies is recommended.

B00005JKMQ|1.0|This movie was at best a 90 minute flick but with all long drawn out boring \\"Music video\\" type parts, it stretched out to over 2 1/2 hours. Ali, in my opinion, is an interesting character, but the way this [movie] was put together was not worth the ticket price or even a rental price. If you have 2.5 hours to kill, and have seen everything else,get 3 other people to chip in a dollar each and rent it......... just keep the ffwd button close at hand.
0553274503|5.0|I finished this book a few months ago, then gave it to someone else to enjoy. It is written in the most sensitive first person. A series of the narrators progress reports tells the story about what life is like for charlie, being menatlly handicapped, and how life is changing for him when the experiment(he had been waiting for his whole life) makes him smarter. but though it all charlie is realizing what went on before his experiment. This book is the saddest book I have read, and it made me mad at myself for not standing up for those who needed it most in high school.
0783225881|4.0|I loved it.  I don't generally care for Kevin Costner, but he is actually OK in this one.  Like the film.  If you love baseball....you'll love this flick.
B00003CXPD|5.0|To me, there are differences between a 'feel good' movie and one that makes you feel good. The phrase 'feel good' implies something shallow, something that touches your emotions in a superficial and often hollow way. You get a little lump in your throat or a smile on your face, but you don't feel anything particularly powerful. But a movie that has the ability to make you feel good is a rare event, and the best ones can connect you with that elusive thing, the human spirit. Billy Elliot is such a movie. <br />Billy Elliot is a twelve year old kid in northern England in 1984 who seems destined for an ordinary life. His dad and his older brother are coal miners, and in the rather dreary town he lives in, it is quietly assumed that Billy will join them one day. Billy is taking a boxing class. One afternoon his instructor asks him to give some keys to Mrs. Wilkerson [Julie Walters], who teaches a ballet class in the same building. She is in no hurry for the keys, so Billy has time to observe the lesson. Something about dancing intrigues Billy, and soon he is secretly attending the classes. Wilkerson is delighted because Billy is easily the most talented pupil she has ever had. It is only a matter of time before Billy is caught by his father and brother, but he is almost mystically drawn to ballet. When he is finally discovered, there is hell to pay. His family is already suffering from the effects of the worst coal miners' strike in British history, and Billy's participation in what they perceive to be an effeminate pursuit just adds to their woes. Billy must now learn how hard it is to follow your heart when it is pulling in two different directions. <br />Jamie Bell is remarkable as Billy. He is the most talented young actor I have seen in years. His command of the role is the more remarkable because this is his first acting assignment. Like his character, he also is from northern England and took dance classes without his friends knowing. <BR>The always excellent Julie Walters plays Mrs. Wilkerson as a disillusioned but kind woman who chain smokes while she teaches and who sees in Billy the talent she never had. She also acts as a mother figure to the boy, who recently lost his own Mom. As Billy's dad, Gary Lewis gives us a man who is hard as nails on the outside but thoughtful on the inside. Beyond his blustering, he sees in Billy's dancing an opportunity he never had, but he resists because ballet is so alien to his world. <br />Billy Elliot is one of the most positive, thoughtful and finely crafted movies I have seen recently. It should prove endearing to all the countless people who have found that they are different from the people around them and who have struggled between trying to fit in and following their true destiny. <br />NOTE: The characters in this movie speak in a British dialect which may be unfamiliar to many viewers. It will be well worth the effort of backing up the DVD a bit in order to catch words and phrases you might have trouble understanding. <br />Rated R for language. The MPAA is going to have to conclude that a certain word beginning with 'f' has been heard a thousand times already by teenagers or else movie makers are going to have to sacrifice that word. I mention this because said word is the one and only reason this film was rated R. It is a perfect film for many teens in my opinion.
B00002E233|2.0|Each year Hollywood offers us a handful of intended blockbuster flicks to attract the masses. In 2000 we had The Mummy, The Haunting, Deep Blue Sea (to name a few) and this year we have Windtalkers, Men In Black 2 and of course, Austin Powers 3.<br />All these films have two dimensional characters, big stars and big effects. They don't want to intrigue us and we don't ask them to. So it comes as no surprise that Deep Blue Sea is another STUPID, big effects, big explosions, big death count film. But it isn't that bad. We get the contrived laughs from the token African American, we have the beautiful lady who verges on titillation and of course have the enemy, who this time is a bunch of [angry]sharks whose brains have been tampered with too many times.<br />Renny Harlin masterly handles his action sequences but at times it becomes so ridiculous you can't help but ask `What next?'. The script is bad, the acting holds on and the explosions are big. It's just a shame that the ending was so anti-climatic. Which is the major flaw. You don't want to spend ninety minutes watching something this stupid and not be rewarded. Jurassic Park overwhelmed us, Speed left us on a high (no pun intended) but Deep Blue Sea simply left us.<br />People who called this rubbish missed the point and people who called it a masterpiece, well, I feel sorry for you.<br />So watch it if you really want to, and I ensure some unpredictable moments, but as usual another effects laden film will leave you deflated.<br />A good DVD nonetheless, but is it really worth owning?
B00005ASOC|4.0|It must be hard to do a successful movie about the literary world. For one thing, it's often such a cerebral subject, and movies demand action. Another problem is that a literate script is a prerequisite. Most movies today don't require this, which results in a lot of screen writers who are long on concept and short on verbal skills. Mike Rich, the man who wrote Finding Forrester, does have writing skills and manages to give us a story that is reasonably compelling. The movie falls short of greatness because it is too long and because the ending is a formula one. but it still manages to be touching and full of hope. It also has a unique view of what it is like to be an intelligent young black man in America that I found to be both interesting and enlightening. <br />To his friends and fellow high school student, Jamal Wallace [Robert Brown] is just nice guy who is very good at basketball. He has secret life that he hides from them. He is an avid reader, and he is constantly writing in his journals. In an old third-story apartment overlooking the public basketball court where Jamal and his buddies play, there lives a recluse. They've never seen him, but they have caught him peering at them from a window. That's why they call him The Window. One day the guys dare Jamal to sneak into the apartment and steal a souvenir. He does this and is caught by The Window, who turns out to be old man. In fleeing, Jamal leaves his backpack behind. The next day he sees it hanging from the man's apartment window. He retrieves the backpack, and when he gets home, he discovers that the journals that were in it have been read. Passages have been marked indicating what the man did and did not like. This begins an extraordinary friendship. Later Jamal will discover that the man is Robert Forrester, a writer who published one novel, gained fame and the Pulitzer prize, and then suddenly vanished. Jamal, Forrester will conclude, has the ability to become a great writer, but will the boy, whois also capable of being a basketball star, have the courage to become one?<br />Sean Connery sparkles as Forrester. He gives us a memorable character who discovers that there is still a spark of hope within his world-weariness. Robert Brown, who has never acted before, is a great find. His Jamal is street-smart, yet obviously worthy of a fuller life. F. Murray Abraham plays an English teacher who is a failed writer and, therefore, thinks Jamal's work is too good for the boy to have done it himself. <br />Some reviewers have stated that Finding Forrester is unrealistic except in the basketball scenes In doing so, they have helped to prove one of the movie's major points. A subtle racial prejudice still exists, even among some of the most urbane and educated people. It implies that a major sports career is perfectly suitable for a bright young black man. Indeed, it is an acceptable and lucrative way to make a living, but that subtle prejudice whispers that that's the summit for a black man or woman, that to aspire for more is to expect too much. I don't believe that's true, and I thought the movie told a story that was entirely possible.
0441003257|5.0|Enormously fun read. The characterization is a bit broad-stroked, but very effective, and the plot very tight. It makes you laugh while biting your nails through Armeggedon, and leaves you feeling good about the world (!). If you like, you can even take away a lesson about the gap between Religion and Faith.<BR>In other words - this is the book of the movie Kevin Smith would sell his soul to be able to make.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Requiem for a Dream was one of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2000 and deservedly so. Naturally, reviewers' favorites and those of audiences are often not the same ones. Many viewers will find this look at the effects of drug abuse on four New Yorkers too strong and horrifying. Not too many people got the chance to see the film in its theatrical run, as it was released without a rating, rather than be tagged with the MPAA's dreaded 'NC-17'. New Line is offering an 'R' rated version on video. You can't fight Blockbuster.<br />Sara Goldfarb [Ellen Burstyn] is a widow living in a low-rent high-rise apartment near Coney Island in New York City. She keeps her beloved television, which is about all the company she has, chained to a radiator. Harry [Jared Leto] is a sweet, rather passive guy who is also a junkie. He steals her TV on a regular basis and hocks it for drug money. It's a pathetic game they play, for he always takes it to the same place and she always goes and gets it. As is sadly typical in most families, they never discuss Harry's drug problem, which he shares with his girlfriend, Marianne [Jennifer Connelly], and his best friend, Tyrone [Marlon Wynans]. Sara has addictions of her own. Chocolate is one. A strange game show is another. One day she gets a phone call. The caller claims she is to be a contestant on the show. She is unable to get into her favorite dress, which she hasn't worn in twenty years. At the suggestion of a friend, she goes to a diet doctor who puts her on pills. Soon she is as addicted as her son. The rest of the movie shows the harrowing decline of the characters. <br />Director Darren Aronofsky jazzes up this all too gritty story with some of the most original visuals you can imagine. This is all done with dazzling camera work and very few special effects. He also enhances the picture with a clever, detailed soundtrack. He wisely observes his characters objectively and never sinks into banal moralizing. He makes few anti-drug statements. His theme is the nature of obsessive-compulsive behavior.<br />The cast is marvelous. Burstyn was nominated for an Oscar, and, if there were justice in Hollywood, she would have won. Leto and Connelly are two of our best character actors, and Requiem for a Dream is another entry in their impressive and ever growing resumes. <br />The story is contemporary but hardly new. It is based on a novel by Hubert Selby, Jr. that was published in 1978, before America's costly and ineffective war on drugs even began.
B00005A46T|1.0|You have to hand it to the record company, they're sure getting their money out of Slipknot. Reaching directly into the overly-spoilt, overly-angst ridden hormonal typhoon of the modern teenager, this album grabs them and makes them feel big and clever. I like the way that bands like this and Marylin Manson and Coal Chamber and the like all pretty much sound exactly the same, sing about the same anti-parent, anti-education, anti-whatever subject matter and bascially prove to the world outside of their insecure, teenage, middle-class followers that it's really easy to tell a kid what to do and how to do it. Go wear that over-sized bootleg hooded top, go wear that belt-chain, and go smoke and pretend you enjoy it.<br />Generalisation? Maybe. But then again, bands like this have been generalising the psychy of the average spoilt teenager for years now. Korn started out doing it with their truly unique style of 'Nu' metal, but too many have followed suit and produced dirge after dirge. True, it's heavier, but it's not the monster of an album you're kids would have you believe, oh no sir. It's tame, it's generic, and it's so contrived that if it was the musical equivolent of a movie, it would probably be James' Cameron's Titanic; the origins are memorable and startling, but by now it's been done so many times you just can't wait for it to sink.<br />Please, for the love of God, do not buy this album if you think it's going to be heavy and cool. Do not buy this album for the subject matter. Do not buy this album because you think it is a good reflection of the highly respectable underground, because it's not. It's a markenting ploy, and the sooner we all come to see this, the sooner the respectable bands will come to light.<br />This isn't metal. This is mediocracty.
B00003CXXP|3.0|This is what Kubrick's final film should have been instead of that atrocity of a mistake Eyes Wide Shut. Osment is a cyborg programmed to actually love and have emotion in this futuristic Pinnochio.The film starts off entertaining even though alot of reviews tend to say it [stank], but those same people are the reason why Harry Potter is such a success. Law plays \\"Gigalo Joe\\" a cyborg that performs just as his name. In my opinion the coolest thing in this movie was the damn robot bear Teddy...I think the bear was more watchable than any character  ...The first half of this movie is great ...but the last 40 minutes in Osments search for the \\"blue fairy\\" is a drag..and I mean DRRRRRAAAAAG..Spielberg also had to rehash his famous Close Encounter aliens in the ending and make it really lame. Good up until the last 40 minutes...then just be warned  that it's pretty lame
B000005HLV|5.0|In the midst of death, this album is a scream for life in death's clothing. Rebelling against the successful but staid and somewhat fearful Norwegian society of their time, Mayhem lashed out with heavy metal embracing the aesthetic of hell. Like a sulfurous treacle riffs are ugly, gnarled and often nearly toneless in an operatic mimesis of the damned. Vocals from Tormentor's Attilla throttle and choke and gurgle in the service of a melody embedded in their distorted roar. The fury of Euronymous as a guitar player was his strumming technique, which here like a humingbird wing streams chords into a continuous sound. If you like metal, or loud music with classical pretentious and roots in the streetfighting mentality of the paranoid, this album is an excellent listen.
0393312836|5.0|My all time favorite book. Burgess's novel beats the movie 100 x's more (and Kubrick's film happens to be my #1 favorite movie as well so that means I really love this book). The book is alot more sickening and explicit than the film , you really get a feeling of nausea while reading it...and that hasn't happened with any other book i've read. While the film loaded it with artsy filmaking and a bizzare musical score. The book is an energetic bleak look into sadism and ultraviolence. Droogs who violently rape and pillage their community without sympathy and care..just for the sick pleasure of it speak in nadstat style of slang that is very difficult to understand while reading , but it contains a handy glossary. Alex leads this group as the humble narrarator is sent to be reformed by the government in which he can no longer choose violence , but his victims can. Burgess ask \\"what cost?\\" and \\"whats the price we pay for conformity\\". However unlike the movie , the film's final and until the reissue was ommitted ending features Alex looking back on his life and wanting a family of his own. Through all his tolchoking and nastyness he is human afterall which was the message all along. Alex was human and if he stayed \\"reformed\\" he would have been nothing more than \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" ripe and healthy on the outside , mechanical and programmed on in the inside..leaving him freedomless and without choice..which the government has no right to do. Very thought provoking work.
B0000584V3|1.0|At least they're acknowledging their power metal roots, but still, who can sit through this? Pretentious without basis, embellished with distraction and built around little concept, these songs are really like daytime TV in prog-neo-underground metal format. With great bands like Gordian Knot or Averse Sefira around, why do you need this?
B00004WKII|5.0|This is simply and justly sums up the career of one of the greatest rock bands of all time. From his alternate takes on Purple Haze to a riveting Johnny B. Goode this is a must for Experience fans.
0517201658|5.0|There really are no words to describe just how good this book is. If you haven't read this book yet, a part of you is missing. If you never have had your heart broken before, the term &quot;heart break&quot; will suddenly become clear. Read this book at home with a box of tissues.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie since its theatrical release in '82. It was powerful movie then. If anything the relevance, power and importance of its message is even greater today. This is a must see! <br />Gandhi still challenges us to live up to our highest ideals.<br />It is a three hour movie with an intermission. I'd recommend watching it in two sittings, first night up to the intermission and then come back the next day for the final powerful conclusion.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love this soundtrack. When I went to see this film, I was skeptical that it would be any good -- Especially after hearing that one of my good friends could not even sit through the first thirty minutes. (There is something seriously wrong with her, though!) I was very surprised with the entire movie. I had no idea that it was going to be full of color, funky costumes, great music, and some crazy camera movements. I had to buy the soundtrack right after. &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; performed by pop stars of today, is so funky and refreshing... I can't get enough of it. I also had no idea what to expect when it came to Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman belting out tunes before seeing the film. McGregor has an extremely strong voice and Kidman is a delight to listen to. They make a perfect pair when they sing together -- yet another reason to buy this soundtrack. If you do buy a soundtrack this year, buy the soundtrack to Moulin Rouge --whether you have seen the movie or not.
B000007MVL|5.0|Like all of her records, this one just doesn't get old even after the 100th time through.  Kate Bush's music never lent itself well to US radio because her music is almost entirely devoid of radio friendly 'hooks.'  Thus, most Americans think of her as some sort of minor player in the music scene.<br />In fact, she has been a major force in the music industry ever since her first record in 1978.  She has commanded the respect of such powerhouses as Prince, Elton John and Peter Gabriel.  She was only recently voted 2nd most influential female musician by Q Magazine in England.<br />Do yourself a favor and buy this record.  Discover Kate Bush today.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is Almost Perfect, because theres nothing perfect in this world, but is very close to be perfect. The story and the characters are well written and Cameron Crowe directing his own writing is always a sign of a good movie. If you like his past movies like \\"Say Anything\\" or \\"Singles\\" you are going to Love this one.
6303160344|3.0|I think that \\"Bleu\\" has failed in what most more or less watchable films made in the 90s have failed. While it is beautifully shot, has a good casting, an appropriate musical score, and a number of highly original (and therefore interesting) scenes (where the use of music, the use of silence is very effective), on the whole it is rather pointless and thus boring. While watching it, I could not understand why it should have been called \\"Bleu\\". This story about a woman who survives a tragedy and has to struggle with her past (and present) is at times very delicate and realistic - and these scenes do come up in my mind from time to time - but it is shown in a way too limited in scope; the film on the whole does not remain in your mind for long, it lacks some strength, some backbone. I tried watching it the second time but it proved to be too boring to bear. I, nevertheless, would recommend everyone to see and think about \\"Bleu\\" by himself.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Maybe this movie is not what people usually watch, but even if you dont watch movies like this you should give this one a chance. Watching this movie is a great experience if you like Cinema, Raimi gave us one of the most experimental camera work ever and it gave the movie its own look, that just Raimi have been able to do in his other movies again.<BR>The Book is great for all fans out there, it has some blank pages so you can get your autographs there. And the Extra stuff is Great, but for a movie like this one no matter what they put in the DVD its never enough, because you will always want more from Ash and the Evil Dead.
B0000214F2|1.0|In PATCH ADAMS, the lead character takes to wearing an enema bulb as a clown nose. After viewing this film, I felt as if that bulb had been used for its intended purpose and quickly called for the usher to bring me a bedpan.<BR>     PATCH ADAMS is a dramedy, where comedic bits are woven into a morality play of good (Patch and his irresponsible zeal to make himself feel good) versus evil (the stodgy medical establishment that doesn't let anybody have fun before they die). You know that this film is going to be a real tearjerker. Unfortunately, writer Steve Oedekerk and director Tom Shadyac decide that they have to rip those tears straight from your tear ducts.<BR>     When we first encounter Hunter Adams (Robin Williams), he has voluntarily committed himself to a psychiatric hospital. Completely despondent and feeling suicidal, Adams begins to climb out of his abyss when he helps a fellow patient overcome his fear of invisible squirrels that block his way to the lavatory. Helping that fellow gives Adams such an ethereal high, he decides to leave the institution, acquires the nickname \\"Patch,\\" and goes off to become a doctor.<BR>     Now at medical school, Patch finds that the business of medicine is somewhat autocratic, impersonal, and lacking a sense of humor. But \\"hey, I'm funny,\\" cries Patch, so off he goes to bombard children with cancer with his own brand of humor---the enema bulb clown nose, tap-dancing with bedpans on his feet, and yukking it up better than the Three Stooges ever did.<BR>     That is essentially the lesson of PATCH ADAMS: laughter is the cure-all for society's ills. True enough, laughter can have beneficial effects on the human body. You laugh, forget the pain for a while, and your body rewards you kindly for not wallowing in misery. But PATCH ADAMS takes this notion to the extreme, completely disparaging the men and women who don the white coats and work hard trying to save human lives. PATCH ADAMS is not about saving anyone's life except Patch's. It is self-redemption, not self-sacrifice. Self-interest is one thing---who is going to begrudge a good physician his money? But Patch is like a parasite, needing to make people laugh in order to feel viable as a human being. This movie does not have as its thesis the need to help the patient. Patients that are helped are residual benefits. This movie is about Patch and only Patch, who uses those patients to inflate his own ego.<BR>     Automatically, we can see where this movie is going. There are no surprises here. We know Patch's irreverent sense of humor is going to clash with the Establishment---a group of doctors who all look the same and whose characterization by Oedekerk is about as deep as a coffee cup. When Patch meets fellow medical student Carin (Monica Potter) late in the game, we know, too, that they will fall in love with each other; but because of her late introduction and the sloppy writing and direction of this picture, we also know that this love story will have no happy ending.<BR>      But PATCH ADAMS is supposed to be a feel-good movie... We still haven't seen Patch go up against the Establishment.<BR>...Back at school, Patch is faced with expulsion for practicing medicine without a license (which, by God, he is). This situation, much to my chagrin, sets up a quasi-courtroom scene in which Patch must defend himself before a board of examiners. Does Oedekerk not have an original thought in his head? PATCH ADAMS isn't a legal thriller, so why subject us to one of the worse movie cliches of all time?<BR>     ...Patch delivers an egotistical rambling about how great he is and about how many people he has helped. As the board decides his fate, in march all those little kids with cancer whose hair has fallen out from chemotherapy and---gasp---they are wearing enema bulbs on their noses. ...<BR>     If Patch was as venerable a physician as he claimed to be ..., he would have sent those kids straight back to their hospital beds. The children havecancer with compromised immune systems. But no, Patch won't mind if one of them falls ill. He will just put on another enema bulb nose and make them laugh till they finally croak from their infection.<BR>     Due to box office popularity, I suspect the success of PATCH ADAMS is because the average moviegoer has no preconceptions about the film he is seeing. He just wants to be entertained. He's not looking for the formulas, the sorry stunts and cliches. He's not expecting dishonest filmmaking. Watch this movie once and you may buy its hullabaloo. Watch it again and you will probably find yourself wretching over the shameless attempt to manipulate the audience.<BR>     Overall, PATCH ADAMS is the perfect example of cinematic excess in both performance and technique. A few cheap laughs, a couple of tricks, and heavy formula make up this ill-brewed show. Supposedly based on a true story, perhaps the real Patch Adams has done some good and helped a number of people. Unfortunately, this movie about him cannot heal itself.
0380973650|4.0|I think all the reviewers have said it all so maybe I won't repeat except to say that I was entirely riveted by this book until the last few chapters, which is why I did not give it 5 stars.  I expected a different ending, maybe because everything led up to Shadow being more of a mythical creature than he actually turned out to be. Most books tend to give you the inside track on the main character's motivations, and when this book didn't do so, even to the point of not giving his &quot;true&quot; name, I felt that it was leading up to something much bigger than what actually transpired. But maybe not, and maybe I am missing some vital explanation that did in fact occur. (While I do not want to spoil this for anyone, which character exactly turned out to be Baldur?!?) However, despite that, I thought that this was a brilliant book and I would recommend it to anyone. I will say that I too read &quot;The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul,&quot; and while I did think of it while reading &quot;American Gods&quot; there is no real similarity at all.
B00005AUBA|4.0|Music that makes you feel good no matter what mood your in, 'you  dont know jesus' and '2 rights make one wrong' for me, are two of the best rock tunes i've heard in recent years. the majority of reviews cant help but mention the fact that the album only lasts 38 minites, but believe me and the 30 second sound clips this has some of the best 38 minites of music your likely to hear all year.
0767819462|4.0|I saw this movie one weekend recently, and at first, I thought it was a bit boring.  Then, I just relaxed and I was amazed by the acting chemistry between all of the characters.  The story was a bit typical for any movie like this.  The kids did a really good job.  They acted as though they've been in the business since before they were born.  Definitely a great movie, but make sure you have plenty of tissues, because you will cry!
0446310786|5.0|Every author dreams of writing a book that will effect the world as positivly as Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The author exposes the uglier side of man in a story that still holds truth for today's reader. Lee's characters draw you into the midst of their lives and keep you reading page after page to the end. I enjoyed this book as much the second time around even more than the first.

B000024KBZ|5.0|This is their best work period. I bought this cd on tape back in 92'. I thought side 1 was the[best]and side 2 [was awful]. But after repeated listening, I discovered that side 2 (Do You Believe In Shame through Lake Shore Driving) grew on me. Side 2 was more moody and side one was poppy. First cut is kind of slow but swanky. I Don't Want Your Love and All She Wants Is are the up tempo cuts you'd expect from DD and they groove. Too Late Marlene should have been released as a single. Best slow song since Saver A Prayer. Drug should be known as their party song. Play this one loud in the car. Do You Believe in shame is dark. Even darker is Palomino. They both work. The rest are slightly above filler in my book. Disturbing though is that on the back of the cd and vinyl copies, the songs aren't displayed. <BR>This is a must have cd for Duran Duran fans. <BR>Enjoy this one. ...

B00003CXPJ|1.0|...<br />This was one of the worst movies pieces of teenage junk I have ever seen.  Even my teenage son thought it was stupid and left.   <br />I think I laughed once through this entire boring escapade - (I laughed at how pitiful the script was, how moronic the acting was, and how stupid I was for actually buying it!   <br />You could tell they were trying to mimic Austin Powers comedy but it couldn't shine Ausin Power's shoes.  <br />...there is less than five minutes of funny content in this whole movie.  The problem is - they stretch it out to almost two hours!   I guess because they kept trying to get you to laugh but continue to fail at it.  <br />Give yourself a break and skip this one.  This one goes on my top ten worst movie list.
1573226521|5.0|I was blown away by Alex Garland's debut novel, \\"The Beach\\". So blown away, that it's now my favorite novel!  \\"The Beach\\" is just such an amazing novel.  On the outside, \\"The Beach\\" appears to be an action adventure kind of book, but really it's much more when you take a closer look.  There's so much symbolism, hidden meanings, and interesting moral questions embedded into the novel, it leaves you breathless.<br />Some people have missed the point of \\"The Beach\\".  Instead of trying to convey the realism of a backpacker, Garland is showing us how ironic the situation is.  For example, the beachers, while on an island paradise, find themselves most concerned over whether they have enough batteries for their Nintendos.  Another complaint that I often hear about \\"The Beach\\" is the lack of character depth.  I believe that Garland didn't give his characters more depth because he wanted to show how depthless and superficial; these people really are.  This was a very effective technique for Garland to use.<br />The main character, Richard, is also quite interesting.  Richard sees himself as if he is in a video game.  Life is a video game to him, therefore he cannot relate to reality or the consequences of his actions. <br />I've heard many people say that \\"The Beach\\" is a post-modern type of book.  They're right.  Much of this novel is showing, well, how messed up many of us from the \\"new generation\\" are turning out in this \\"drug crazy and pop cultured world\\" as one reviewer put it.<br />\\"The Beach\\" is very similar to the film \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and the book that the film was based on, Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\".  Both show the loss of morality when people are separated from society long enough.  It was really fascinating to see a rather moral man like Richard slowly deteriorate on the island.<br />What really impressed me about \\"The Beach\\" is the moral issues that are presented in it.  \\"Just how far would you go to keep a secret?  Can people lose all morality if isolated from society for an extended period of time?  Would you sacrifice your own self worth and morality to save the perfect paradise?  What happens when that paradise becomes not so perfect?  \\"The Beach\\" is also about mind games; the games we play with ourselves, the games we play with those around us, and the games we play with fate.\\"
B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldies\\" should be required viewing in every American history class that addresses the era since WWII and Korea.  High school and college level students must view the film to be exposed to the reality and horror of Viet Nam, and, if nothing else, to view and hear Lt. Col. Moore's (Gibson's) last commentary on why these brave men fought so gallantly.  This is the best movie I have seen about the Viet Nam War.  I fought it from First Presbyterian Church, Killen, TX, adjacent to Fort Hood, TX, where I was Pastor, 1966-1972.  The movie brought back the horror of burying more Nam war dead than I want to remember.  Some of them were 7th Cavalry.  This move superbly depicts the task those of us on the home front had in helping families deal with those damn telegrams and all the arrangments that had to be made, and the pain endured - finally overcome but never forgotten.  Thank you, Mel Gibson, for making this movie!
B000001FSR|4.0|Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan wrote and toured behind the musical play Franks Wild Years in 1986, and this recorded album version is sort of a series of songs from it, but they don't carry the plot. It can be seen as a continuation of his first two Island albums, Swordfishtrombones and Rain Dogs, though it strays rather far from those records at times. Indeed, this record finds Waits stretching himself both musically and vocally. Musically, it retains the odd instrumentation and verbose arrangements of the previous two albums, but takes them even further. Waits seems here to be possessed by a streaky love for carnival music, old German music, and even a bit of Vegas-style, Frank Sinatra-esque showtunes. Some of the songs are in his familar 80's style, and rank among his best work (Hang On St. Christopher, Blow Wind Blow, Yesterday Is Here, Way Down In The Hole, Telephone Call From Istanbul, Cold Cold Ground, Train Song); some are of the wacked-out carnival music variety (Innocent When You Dream, in two radically different arrangements); and some are of the aforementioned Vegas style (the second rendition of Straight To The Top - this is the type of song that everybody always knew Tom was capable of, but never really heard - I'll Take New York.) The result is not his best album, being caught somewhere between the self-conscious ludicrisy of Swordfishtrombones and Rain Dogs, and his dark, brooding masterpiece, Bone Machine. Still, Tom Waits fans will want to grab it up, as it chronicles yet another unique chapter in the career of one of the most idiosyncratic and enjoyable artists of our time.
B00005OWEG|5.0|\\"Apocalypse Now\\" is, put simply, is a masterpiece. It is a big, ungainly mess of a film, but that chaos serves the setting-the Vietnam War-incredibly well. <br />No better film has ever been made about the complexity of the human soul, and many of the moments in \\"Apocalypse Now\\"-the \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" sequence, Colonel Kilgore, and \\"the horror...the horror,\\" have all become touchstone moviegoing and cultural items.<br />One would think a masterpiece like that wouldn't need a touchup, but now comes \\"Apocalpyse Now Redux,\\" with over 45 minutes of new footage, a reworked (and very good) soundtrack, and a gorgeous new image transfer. For those of us who never got the opportunity to see this movie in a theater when it was first released, this new version is as technically good as it gets.<br />However, having viewed \\"Redux\\" a few times, I have to ask a question: what does the new version really add? Does it make the original masterpiece better?<br />Respectively, the answers to those questions are \\"not much,\\" and \\"no.\\" <br />In fact, the extra length and scenes in \\"Redux\\" make the film seem more ponderous and self-indulgent than the original, which wasn't exactly a model of efficient storytelling. <br />The highlight of \\"Redux\\" is the \\"French plantation\\" scene, which has been discussed endlessly by movie buffs, but has never been seen before. The sequence is interesting, and sometimes thought provoking-there is a lengthy discussion of the French Vietnam experience, some references to Willard's dual nature, and some stunning cinematography-but it just doesn't add all that much for to justify its 30-minute length.<br />The other big \\"new\\" sequence involves Willard and his companions finding the Playboy bunnies, whom they first saw at the USO show, stuck in a weird Army camp in the middle of nowhere. Subsequently, Willard arranges a little R&R for the men with the bunnies. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a surreal take on Vietnam, but this sequence is absolutely implausible, it'scompletely out of character for Willard, and it is poorly written to boot.<br />Other \\"new\\" footage involves more detail on Willard's torture at the Kurtz compound, and some scenes use different takes of familiar material. And while this stuff is interesting, \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a masterpiece, and when something's right, you usually don't improve it by fiddling around.<br />\\"Redux\\" brings to mind Paul Thomas Anderson's comments about some of the scenes he deleted from \\"Boogie Nights.\\" He said that while some of these scenes were near and dear to his heart, and some were special in their own way, there was something about each of them that just didn't serve the story well enough to make the final cut. <br />Those thoughts rang so true when I watched the \\"new\\" material in \\"Redux.\\" When a skilled director like Francis Ford Coppola leaves material out of a film, there's a reason. In the case of \\"Redux,\\" the reason is simple: the material left out, while worthwhile and frequently interesting, just doesn't make the movie stronger. <br />This isn't to say that the \\"Redux\\" materials sink the film; when your starting point is as brilliant as \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" a few discordant notes won't ruin anything. And for those of us who treasure this film, the extras are quite interesting. <br />But I find myself scratching my head and wondering if it was money or ego that made Francis Ford Coppola fool around with the original.<br />______________________________________________________________<br />A word about the DVD: it's clear Paramount was in it for the bucks on this one. There are no special features, save the trailer, and the original film is still available on DVD. If you want to compare the two versions, you'll have to buy both.<br />Paramount could have done its customers a huge favor by bringing out an entirely new DVD, with the added \\"Redux\\" sequences as bonus materials and an upgraded sound and color transfer. Or, it could have done what Artisan did with \\"Terminator 2,\\"and include both versions on the DVD, letting the viewer select which version he wanted to see.<br />And if Paramount REALLY wanted to do right by its customers, it could have included \\"Hearts of Darkness,\\" the documentary made by Coppola's wife on the making of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" The documentary is brilliant, and it's a must-see for anyone who loves \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" In particular, the part where Marlon Brando shows up at the newly-constructed \\"Kurtz jungle hell\\" set tipping in at about 300 pounds, bald, and mumbling is just not to be missed.<br />Frankly, what I'd really love to see is the original cut of \\"Apocalpyse Now,\\" with the reworked sound and color transfer of \\"Redux.\\" Anyone listening there at Paramount?
B00005UEAR|5.0|When Dream Theater went into the studio to record this album, they said that they weren't looking to top Scenes From A Memory (surely, as one of the best prog albums of the last 20 years, an artistic peak), and just make another killer album. And that's exactly what they've done. The album is so sprawling and varied that it takes a few listens to get into. It lacks the cinematic scope and cohesiveness of Scenes, and this may seem a bit disconcerting at first; initially, I was somewhat disappointed in the album. However, subsequent listens have revealed its greatness. Once you've put aside all pre-conceptions, you will enjoy this album; looked at individually, it ranks among their best. Mike Portnoy, prior to the album's release said he would loosely describe the album as a cross between Awake and Liquid Tension Experiment. One can see this, as some of the songs (The Glass Prison, The Great Debate, and certain sections of the title suite) are among Dream Theater's heaviest songs ever. However, a deeper delving into the album will reveal that this is Dream Theater's most musically diverse album ever. A range of influences is revealed: Misunderstood starts out with a gentle acoustic introduction reminiscent of Led Zeppelin's The Rain Song, and ends with a guitar noise cachophony straight out of Radiohead's OK Computer (Karma Police, Paranoid Android.) The Great Debate is highly reminiscent of Tool (as are parts of The Glass Prison) with its dub-ins - and even all the way down to the lyrics, vocal melody, and backing riffage (\\"Anarchistic moral vision...\\") Disappear, a ballad that closes the first disc, is another track where you can find touches of Radiohead. The Test That Stumped Them All is very Pantera-esque, and certainly Dream Theater's heaviest recorded moment yet. Although Disappear is not my favorite song in the Dream Theater catalog, every other song on here is absolutely great. The Glass Prison kicks off the album cleverly enough with a fade-in burst of static, thus linking back to Scenes. This is an all-out, balls-to-the-wall rocker in the best tradition of heavy DT. Blind Faith is another great piece with curiously ambivalent lyrics and subtly amazing keyboard playing. Misunderstood contains the musical virtues already noted, and a set of lyrics that are a curious contrast to the preceding song. The Great Debate reeks slightly of cheese (social commentary is not Dream Theater's strong point) with its lyrics focusing on stem cell research, but the music and interesting approach to the arrangement will allow you to forgive it's naivety. However, the undisputed highlight of the record is the 40+ minute title track that is the whole of the second disc. Musically incredible and lyrically interesting, it ranks among Dream Theater's very best tracks ever. The six and a half minute overture is an absolutely amazing piece of work: dominated by Jordan Rudess's incredibly dexterious keyboard work (and later augmented by some heavy killer drumming from Portnoy), it sounds like a masterly symphony orchestra scoring a soundtrack for the latest epic motion picture. After this amazing introduction, we are led into the almost poppish tinkling piano of the second movement. The movements provide an interesting contrast to each other: we have extremely heavy parts (The Test That Stumped Them All), ballads (Goodnight Kiss), and everything in-between. The only bad thing I can possibly say about this absolute magnum opus of a song is that the closing movement (entitled \\"Losing Time/Grand Finale\\") led me to expect a longish concluding musical section - but, alas, this is not to be as the \\"Grand Finale\\" consists of a re-working of the main theme from the overture being played behind the closing lyrics of the album, followed by a minute long fade out. But, hell, even Achilles had his heel. This album is an absolute must for DT fans. The band is spot-on and perfect, as we would expect no less - Portnoy, I think, is better than ever: The Glass Prison and the Overture contain some of his best drumming ever (and he knows it, too: he credits himself with playing \\"lead drums\\" on this album - though who could blame him, eh?) I must say that this album has, belatedly, lived up to my (very) high expectations - I could barely contain my excitement when I saw the announced tracklisting (with running times - who else would dare put out such a disc?) of this album, and it is every bit as good as it sounds. Another magnum opus from the best band on the scene today, period.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Apparently there are lots of quibbles over this film revolving around details of John Nash's personal life.  Certain aspects were not included.  I think these people are missing the point of this film.  What this film does that is startling is that it takes you into the mind of Princeton professor John Nash so that you can experience being there.  You are able to unfold in layers what it is like being a math genius as well as someone being engulfed by schizophrenia.  In fact, you are not suprised that a person with this kind of genius can be engulfed by madness.  The two seem to flow effortlessly together.  Russell Crowe's performance is simply astonishing.  I am not a fan of \\"Gladiator\\" and thought his performance there undeserving of the Best Actor Oscar.  However, both his performance here and in \\"Disclosure\\" are about as deserving of the Oscar as is possible. The relationship I thought was the key one in this film was the one between Nash and his college roommate. That relationship is central to the entire film and ultimately tells you everything you need to know about Nash and his mind.  The marital relationship is fine as depicted. Jennifer Connelly does a good job. But this aspect tells us more about how distressing his problems were for his family, which is not new territory in the movies.  I could have done without that aspect of the story but I assume many people would miss it. I'd compare this film to \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" and, although it is not quite as cinematically adventurous as that film, this one has Crowe's performance, which is saying a lot.
B00005U122|4.0|First of all, let me say that I bought this as a Pink Floyd DVD.  I really like The Wall, DSOTM, WYWH, and Animals.  Fifteen of the 24 songs were from those albums.  The rest were from Ummagumma, The Final Cut, and Roger Waters' solo career.  It was good to see and hear Waters sing my old favorites.<br />Overall I thought this was a pretty good DVD.  The video quality was good, but not great.  The audio quality was superb.  I enjoyed watching it and will watch it again.<br />On the downside, I didn't like some of the renditions.  Welcome to the Machine was particularly jarring.  Sure, Waters was singing it, but the song sounded different.  Maybe it is just the difference between live and studio, but I did not like it.  Your mileage may vary.<br />The visuals were OK, but not stunning.  They mostly consisted of slides playing on a large screen behind the performers.  There was not much of a stage show.<br />Doyle Bramhall II played Gilmour's part.  Although he seemed to be a fine musician and singer, he was no Gilmour.  I think this was one of the hardest things for me to accept.  Comfortably Numb was just not the same.  Snowy White made an appearance during the guitar solo, which saved that track for me.  Norbert Stachel on sax was another noteworthy player.<br />Overall, I did enjoy this DVD and am glad I bought it.  If I had a choice between this or Pulse (on DVD) or this and The Wall, I would choose the others.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Really I am, like the title says, speechless.  Everything in this movie fits.  Just everything.  The music, direction, acting, dialogue, photography,...  <br />Saying something or repeating the story would ruin the experience.  You all should rent it (or better, buy it so that later on, you could watch it again which is recommended) so you can see a real disturbing yet beautifull movie.  From the beginning, you know this movie isn't going to have a happy end.  Which is a good thing, because the movie's purpose is to shock and let you behind with a sense of \\"what the hell have i seen?\\".  Although the rating seems to say this isn't for all ages (there are some scenes which could be rated 16 or older, but only for these scenes in theory contain nudity or foul language or else), i think that it would be a great idea to show this movie in schools where teachers would like to organise an afternoon about \\"being against drugs\\". Because when you have seen this movie, you are definitely going to think twice when someone asks you if you want to have a joint or something else.  The most effective anti-drugs movie for years to come, with enough in it to satisfy the most movielovers.<br />Now, I hope that I have made you curious.  Make sure that you see this one.  It doesn't happen much that I rate a movie 5 stars, but this one deserves it all the way.<br />P.S. : the fact that i don't mention anything about the story itself or other things, i really don't want to spoil anything by saying \\"in this scene this\\" or \\"in that scene that\\", i fully understand this movie but I believe you should watch this unprepared.  My balls on a barbecue if YOU don't like it!!!
B00005UW7V|1.0|Is this Disney, a chickflick or Sci-Fi? The only good parts are the futuristic eye candy which I wanted to relax and enjoy but kept getting annoyed by the obnoxious kid who sees dead people. And I wont even talk about that stomach churning scene where the two brats are shoveling spinach into their mouths and showing their chewed up food. This is the great Spielberg?!! Keep the barf bag handy... In its many components, it tries to have something for everyone and instead has nothing for anyone. Whats with this teddy bear, is it Disney? No cause it has sexual scenes such as the boys in the car being magically touched in the crotch. What is it? [junk].
B0000025DT|5.0|One of the best 3 discs ELO ever released! This is an excellent package with non-stop enjoyable music from begining to end. There are two hit singles here, also. They are &quot;Do Ya&quot; and &quot;Livin' Thing&quot;. The first, a pop rocker and the latter, soft-rock with great string arrangements. Other songs that I particularly liked over the others on the disc were &quot;Tightrope&quot;, &quot;Telephone line&quot;, &quot;So Fine&quot;, and &quot;Rockeria&quot;. This is all ELO, but it features pop, soft rock, and great blends, always. I say buy it; it will be hard to get a better price on such timeless material.
B000056K04|3.0|Though Dave Matthews and his clan of musicians have always been strong critics of Afroman (who happens to be my absolute favorite), I couldn't resist getting &quot;Everyday&quot;, because of the awesome cover in black and white.  But of course, as I expected, this was no &quot;The Good Times&quot; (Afroman), Dave Matthews lyrics and his possee's music come up short, especially on boring tracks like &quot;The Space Between Us&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot; &amp; &quot;I Did it&quot;.   Hmm, not a shameful release, but nothing to hang up on the wall for ol' David.<BR>One love!<BR>-Steve
B0000004V2|5.0|I had a similar experience to a previous reviewer.  I was in England in 1989 and wrote down a list of the songs that I liked that were on the radio at the time.  I went to the store and bought albums by the Lightning Seeds and the Stone Roses.  I listened to both tapes on my walkman and decided that the Stone Roses were too atmospheric.  A year later my roommate said he wanted to buy the Stone Roses album.  I handed him the tape, which I had only listened to once.  From that point on, I heard the brilliance of the album.  It is simply a fantastic record.
1577312082|5.0|I bought this book trying to discover how to become more spiritual, but what I got was the answer to virtually every problem in my life!  The reviews you read here are true.  This is such a great book.  Do you have \\"baggage\\" in your life that's interfering with your relationships?  This book can change that. Are you your own worst enemy?  This book can change that.  Do you have people in your life who constantly drag you down or [drag] you into their problems?  This book can change that?  Do you worry all the time?  This book can change that. Whether you are religious or not, it doesn't matter.  This book speaks to you on a different level than you've ever realized is within you.  I recommend the audio book.  Tolle speaks very slowly, but that's okay, because there is SO much to think about and absorb in what he's saying that slow is good.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Okay, I've argued with people about this movie, and I do see it's faults.  But it is significantly better than any other Sci Fi movies that came out last year (LOTR notwithstanding; that is fantasy).  A very thought provoking, very dark, Kubrick-esque movie, and I commend Spielberg for pulling it off.  It is certainly a far better swan song for Kubrick than the dreadful &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, that can only be enjoyed as a non intentional comedy.  Watch A.I. with an open mind, enjoy how amazingly well it was made, and it's message is not a bad one!
B00005U1YO|3.0|Daft Punk were once described as \\"toeing the line between stupid and<BR>                    clever,\\" and the same thing can very accurately be said about the<BR>                    Chemical Brothers. For example, I can't think of a dorkier way to start a<BR>                    song than by sampling an \\"academic\\" voice intoning the words \\"it began<BR>                    in Africa,\\" and then looping the \\"ca\\" syllable and turning it. But when that<BR>                    track, after about five minutes of rather inane buildup including<BR>                    obligatory talking drums and djembes, suddenly and introduces a<BR>                    syncopated hip-hop breakbeat, I start to think that techno artists should<BR>                    be doing this sort of thing more often. The track I'm describing is \\"It<BR>                    Began in Afrika\\" (note clever/stupid spelling), the second cut on the<BR>                    Brothers' new album, which was probably the most keenly awaited<BR>                    electronica release since Daft Punk's \\"Discovery\\" dropped last year. <br />                    It's more or less universally acknowledged that the Chemical Brothers<BR>                    reached their peak with 1997's bombastic \\"Dig Your Own Hole,\\" which<BR>                    featured not only the inescapable \\"Block Rockin' Beats,\\" and a guest<BR>                    vocal from heavenly-voiced, relatively unknown (and cutie) Beth Orton,<BR>                    but at least half an album's worth of some of the most bizarre and<BR>                    abstract music that could possibly be construed as funk. These<BR>                    successful elements - bombast, rock swagger, guest vocalists and<BR>                    \\"experimentalism\\" (probably more like screwing around) - were<BR>                    harbingered on their debut, \\"Exit Planet Dust,\\" somewhat controversially<BR>                    recombined for the difficult third album \\"Surrender,\\" and unsurprisingly<BR>                    reappear here. This time, they work. Not in the way they used to work.<BR>                    The are no longer groundbreaking, and in its weaker moments this<BR>                    record has an almost nostalgic feel. This time around it's more like<BR>                    I've-heard-this-all-before-and-it-still-sounds-damn-good. <br />                    Of course, they do have a few new tricks to show off. Like Daft Punk,<BR>                    they have taken note of more recent trends in dance music, as is evident<BR>                    in the streamlined, glossy house of \\"Star Guitar\\" (one of the most<BR>                    infectious cuts here, for all its Darude-cribbing). If anything, \\"Come With<BR>                    Us\\" is more varied sonically than any of their previous efforts, from the<BR>                    dark and tumultuous cellos that open the album to the gentle Spanish-y<BR>                    guitar line suddenly morphing into dark electro-funk (on the nifty<BR>                    \\"Hoops\\") to what sounds like a demented music box tinkling away in \\"My<BR>                    Elastic Eye.\\" Even when things start to sound awfully hackneyed, there<BR>                    are enough ideas percolating in the mix to keep them interesting. <br />                    The Brothers made some questionable decisions on this one, like<BR>                    submerging a pretty little Beth Orton melody in swaths of muddy<BR>                    knob-twiddling and burbles and allowing the annoyingly earnest Richard<BR>                    Ashcroft vocal about acid tests to mix with a recycled but workable funk<BR>                    loop, creating the danceable but rather inane closer \\"The Test.\\" And,<BR>                    unavoidably, a handful of cuts in the album's second half don't quite<BR>                    make the mark. But the Chemical Brothers were never perfectionists.<BR>                    Their genius, it seems to me, has always come from goofing around and<BR>                    coming up with entertaining (and occasionally sublime) pieces of music.<BR>                    And, in a way, they've never done that more successfully than here. This<BR>                    album doesn't want for humor, versatility or flavor. All it lacks is a bit of<BR>                    the freshness that made them seem so revolutionary back in 1997.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie seems to be a love it or hate it. I hated it. It was too long and the plot was just unbelievable. I'm not sure who the hero was supposed to be, but I think it was the mentally disturbed child robot. Was this creepy? Yes. Was this an entertaining movie? No. Would I ever watch it again? No way.
B00005JKYS|3.0|World War II has been tagged by some with the rather oxymoronic appellation \\"the last good war.\\"  What this means is that the \\"heroes\\" and \\"villains\\" in this epic conflict were so clear-cut and obvious - and the goals so straightforward and crucial - that filmmakers approaching the subject haven't needed to bother much with exploring the moral complexities that lie at the root of all war, that most inhumane of human endeavors.  Films set in World War II have almost invariably reflected a sense of moral certitude, with the Allied nations seen as the forces of Good locked in a life-and-death struggle with the forces of Evil represented by the Axis powers.<br />This is not, of course, the way Americans came, for the most part, to view the Vietnam War.  Faced with no clearly defined enemy or menace, many Americans came to question their country's involvement in what seemed from a distance to be a civil war between two alien nations and cultures.  Thus, when it finally came time for filmmakers to address this issue, their films naturally reflected much of the moral ambiguity that defined the nation as a whole.  Films like \\"The Deer Hunter,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now\\" etc. not only questioned the moral rightness of our involvement and actions in that conflict, but actually made us question whether heroism - on the scale of the common soldier caught in the conflict - was even a valid possibility.<br />The new film, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" attempts to rectify that skepticism, trying to counterbalance the films like those listed above, while at the same time serving as a long overdue and honorable tribute to the brave young men who fought and died doing their duty on that strange foreign soil.  The film, thereby, endeavors to bring the WWII war film sensibility to one set in Vietnam.  In order to focus our attention on the individual heroism of the men involved, the film first has had to drain the narrative of its entire sociopolitical context.  Since this is the story of the first major battle between the Americans and the Viet Cong - in November 1965 - one would naturally expect to hear quite a bit of discourse - both among the military leaders and the rank-and-file combat soldiers - as to the why and wherefore of both the conflict and the Americans' reason for taking part in it.  Yet, we get none of this.  All the soldiers involved simply do their duty without question, an attitude which becomes, in effect, the film's operative definition of the word \\"heroism.\\"  This is what separates \\"We Were Soldiers\\" from those previous Vietnam War films.  The characters in those other movies were also dying bravely, but they always seemed to be questioning the powers-that-be that got them into the situation in the first place.  In \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" no one ever questions.  The need to follow orders is simply accepted as a given - and thus heroism becomes a matter of doing one's duty and of helping one's comrade regardless of any overarching justification for the slaughter.  Without having to wade through all the moral murkiness of the conflict itself, we are thus freed up to admire the sheer courage and determination of the men.  In fact, the film even makes a few good willed nods in the direction of equanimity by showing that even the Viet Cong fighters, who are attempting to kill all these fine young American men, also have girlfriends and families they love back home.<br />Given this self-imposed myopia, \\"We Were Soldiers,\\" nevertheless, does an admirable job honoring these men.  Like most war movies, so much time is spent on the pyrotechnics of battle that little time is left to engage in any real character development.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" attempts to flesh out its characters in the opening stretch when we see several of the men with their wives and families before embarking on their mission.  But once they hit the ground in Vietnam, all hell breaks loose and most of the men become lost in the chaos of this seemingly interminable battle.  The film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.  The carnage is appropriately gruesome and the filmmakers make sure that we see every last bit of the grotesquerie that the act of unbridled human butchery has to offer.  The special effects team has done an extraordinary job bringing all this to life on the screen.<br />Although a few of the early family scenes seem treacly at best, some of the film's most profoundly moving moments occur back home, when Julia Moore (Madeleine Stowe), the wife of the film's protagonist, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), takes it upon herself to deliver the \\"death telegrams\\" to the other wives on the base.<br />Gibson does an admirable job as the man in charge of the mission, displaying both a rugged strength and a compassionate love for his men that makes him a well-rounded character.  One appreciates the fact that the writers, Joseph L. Galloway and Harold G. Moore himself (upon whose life and book this true story is based) don't require Moore to indulge in the kind of cheap theatrical heroics common to characters of this type.  He is a man whose level-headedness and grace under fire help lead his men on to victory in an almost impossible situation.  This is also a rare instance in which a character is allowed to have a religious dimension without being made into a fool in the process.<br />Randall Wallace, as the film's director, seems equally at home in the battle sequences and in the quieter moments of subtle sadness that permeate the scenes at home.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers,\\" for all its simplicity of theme, manages to be a moving tribute to the young men who found the personal courage to put their lives on the line, with or without a cause that made any sense.film does a terrific job recreating the horror of the fighting, never flinching from the grim reality that is war.

B00003CXTG|1.0|I absolutely hated this movie.  This movie is an absolute disgrace and a disservice to all the people who died on that tragic day.  The biggest complaint I have about this sick mess is that Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay have taken a serious and somber subject like Pearl Harbor and thrown in a silly love triangle involving hearthrobs Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale to appeal to the MTV crowd which of course is a huge market for the movie industry.  That's what I dislike about Bruckheimar and Bay namely how they make big, lavish, loud, dumb-downed movies just so they can appeal to mainstream audiences.  Bruckheimer and Bay are the Britney Spears of filmaking.  Why am not I talking about the movie?  Because there's nothing about the movie that's worth mentioning!!  Don't waste your time.  If you want to see a good chick flick then see A Walk To Remember or if you want a good war movie then watch Tora Tora Tora.
B00005R87Q|2.0|Paul Walker is an undercover cop who gets too involved in the underground world of racing.  Vin Diesel is the criminal he eventually befriends.  Not much plot-wise, and there aren't nearly enough chases or races to make up for the incredibly slacking pace and overdone, headache-inducing visuals.  The truck-siege in the climax is obviously inspired by the similar setpiece in The Road Warrior, but doesn't compare in terms of sheer excitement (or even in size, scope, and length).  Walker took a far more enjoyable trip in Joy Ride.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I have a lot of thoughts about this album that are jumbled so bear with me here.<BR>First I must say I love this artist, because of the simple fact that almost every song on this album and pervious I loved and that is extemely rare even from other people I listen to. I think Alanis is a great singer/songwriter. A lot of her songs you can listen to while feeling different types of emotions and it can lift you up, make you dance or perhaps make you feel relaxed while doing homework like Unsent, I love that song. That's probably why I like this album so much, it's differen't in my opinion. The only songs I didn't like were Your congratulations and The couch now that's 2 songs out of 17. I brought a lot tapes and I never and this is the truth loved all the songs without disliking at least 4 or more of them that's why I stop buying tapes/cds so much. I brought Jagged little pill and this one at the same time because I heard great things from both and I must say I like this one more. I planned to buy Under Rug Swept this week. You won't be wasting your money if you consider buying this album.
0553274503|4.0|I am long since out of Junoir HighSchool at the age of thirty-eight.  I recall this reading nearly in it's entirety.  I feel it ashamed that schools don't seem to be pushing reading as they did when I was a young lad.  Thank goodness I have a daughter who loves to read. She is only twelve and reads anything she can get her hands on. I am Buying this book once again after all these years for her reading pleasure. Yes, this book will bring tears and joy.  I believe this book will inspire any young mind or parent who wants to know what kids miss out on in reading now-a-days!.  Enjoy.

B0000039PW|5.0|This is one of the rawest, greatest rap cd's ever. This is a classic album and no rap fan should be without it. From start to finish it is money well spent.  With songs like \\"One More Chance\\", \\"Juicy\\", \\"Big Poppa\\", and \\"Gimmie The Loot\\" you know Biggie will live on forever. Other great songs are \\"Machine Gun Funk\\", \\"The What\\", \\"Respect\\", and \\"Things Done Changed\\". There is not much to say...just get this album.
B00005Y228|5.0|I have heard a lot of Kylie songs recently by purchasing a few of the lower priced imports (some through Amazon) and must admit that I don't find her to be the godsend that most Europeans believe her to be.  I like her, but not all of her songs are consistently great.  With \\"Fever\\", however, Minogue manages to find a comfortable sound to showcase her cutesy girly lyrics along with her bubbly vocals.  The album is somewhere between funky disco, 80's club music, and trancey techno.  The set includes the hypnotically fun \\"More, More, More\\" and the bouncy smash \\"I Can't Get You Out of My Head\\".  Kylie gets forcefully lusty with disco tracks like \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Dancefloor\\" and \\"Love At First Sight\\", a track that sounds extremely like Daft Punk.  `Fever\\", the song, is a guilty pleasure with giddy writing and an 80s vibe.  \\"Love Affair\\" is a romantically sweet and bouncy dance track.  It has a nice slowed down tempo. The only track that is like a ballad is \\"Fragile\\", which slows down its keyboards and is beautifully honest.  The best of the bonus tracks is \\"Butterfly\\" (from the 2000 release \\"Light Years\\"), a hard-line trasher of a dance track, but \\"Boy\\" is R&B backed fun.  The only track that looses me is a repetitive acoustic to disco and back again song called \\"Burning Up\\".  Perhaps it might have sounded better on the European import without any bonus track or the Japanese edition that also keeps it at the way end.  Although a loser of a song to me, it doesn't manage to destroy the album.  <br />I must admit that I'm getting sick of hearing the \\"la la la\\"'s of \\"Can't Get...\\", but the album is all around fun.  It's packed with excellent euro-dance fun that will hopefully translate well into America.  Its been a while since anyone in the states has heard anything from miss Minogue, but I have any idea that \\"Fever\\" will leave people wanting more, more, more.  Also, order it soon so that you can get the USA exclusive bonus tracks.
B00005NW00|4.0|Most song on this cd i like. my favorite song is toxicity.  i used to like chop suey but man, i've heard it over a million times. well, you won't be wasting your money. SOAD's first CD is pretty much the same.  I bought this one first and you should too.  It's rockin'.  I would like these word to go out to everyone who reads my review \\"do you cy when angels deserve to die?\\" and \\"do angels ever deserve to die\\" well, bye.  Don't forget to buy SOAD's Toxicity and there self-titled album it's not a waste of money.

0060930187|5.0|Before reading &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; I read &quot;Ariel,&quot; Plath's collection of poems that really address the climax of her depression with such great poems like &quot;Daddy&quot; and &quot;Lady Lazarus.&quot; But it was only after I read &quot;The Bell Jar,&quot; that I truly appreciated Plath's genius and sophistication as a writer. One of the reasons Plath was such a genius was her command of the English language. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; does not read like a novel, but more like prose, which made the book a quick read. <br />&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; tells the story of Ester Greenwood, a young woman interning at a woman's magazine in New York City. The reader fully witnesses Ester's decent into depression and her institutionalization in a mental hospital. Like her poetry, &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is semi - autobiographical and very emotional. Plath also leaves the ending of the novel ambiguous, I do not want to give the ending away but I will say this, do not expect any sort of resolution. <br />All in all, I would recommend this book to Plath fans and those who appreciate a clever, wonderfully written piece of literature.
B000000WA2|5.0|the great escape is without a doubt blur's best album; anyone who doesn't think so knows nothing about music. this album is them at their height of craftsmanship and musicianship, lyricism, politics and vision. and for everyone who thinks they got more masculine and dark after this, the great escape is easily their most hardcore, neurotic album. damon's vocal delivery is stingingly over-confindent and sharp (surely he's coked up), the bands dynamic is at its tightest, and the production ironically, i believe in ten years time, will hold up as their best. most of all of course this is in the top ten coolest guitar albums ever made, graham coxon only went downhill from here. even johnny radiohead never topped this.. the only reason some people are turned off by this album is in the strong british accent in damon's vocals, yet he's making fun of britain more than anything. and also people i think are simply overwhelmed and intimidated by the talent, imagination and intelligence of this album. all of this maybe amounts to the great escape being the most underrated album of our generation.

We bought Shrek for our grandkids for Christmas.. it was played the entire week after Christmas almost non stop.. and I enjoyed listening and seeing it each time.. unlike some of the others that kids will play over and over, this one made me smile, laugh and almost cry over and over and over.. I Love It and recommend it highly!

B000056NX5|5.0|I'm only thirteen but I was twelve when I first saw this. I really enjoyed it and watch it frequently. It's a musical that people of all ages enjoy. I think Tim Rice did a brilliant job on the lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber did a brilliant job on the music. I think all of the cast were brilliant especially Glenn Carter (Jesus), Jerome Pradon (Judas Iscariot) and Tony Vincent ( Simon Zealotes). There was no effort in Glenn Carter's voice. He was incredible and a great actor. The music is wonderful. The film and music is creative genius. There is no end to the good comments I could give.Tony Vincent was also brilliant. He looked great for the part of Simon, he's a brilliant actor and one of the best voices in the cast. I think that a lot of young and older people don't understand the story of Jesus but I think that if they watch this then they will start to understand what happened between him and Judas and that Judas was not the bad guy. God intended Jesus to die and decided he would be the one to betray Jesus. I think that it could not have been written as better as it has been. If Jesus knew he was God, then where's the pain and real part of the story? In my opinion I think it was brilliant and I give it 5 stars. Not just for the film but also for the music, cast and the way it was written.

If war really is hell, than this is your one-way ticket. the film opens with Sheen in Saigon having a deppresion[and an amazing heart attack scene in his hotel room], and waiting for his next mission. He gets called to the base and is told to go deep into enemy territory and kill a colonel gone insane[played by Brando].<BR> Which follows is an amazing display of action scenes, some amazing performances by Sheen, Brando and once again, the notion that war really is hell. The insane colonel is played well by Brando, and his little hide-out is incredibly dark and spooky, a world turned completely upside down. The best scene in the film is when Sheen is making his way into Brando's \\"hut of hell\\" in his final attempt to put him down. A classic scene in filmmaking, and an awsome movie not be missed.
B00005JKYS|4.0|Many war-movies have graced the screen but none have managed to convey the universal losses like We Were Soldiers in heartfelt sincerity. The movie adapted from a memoir by Moore tells of the Landing Zone-X Operation spearheaded by First Battalion of the Seventh Cavalry in Ia Drang valley where Moore with his 400 men was ambushed by the overpowering 2000 Vietnam conscripts and regulars. <br />It is not a hard-hitting documentary of American military operations gone haywired like Black Hawk Down and neither is it a movie that decries war with embittered cynicism like Born on the Fourth Of July or Platoon. It aims to salute the bravery and courage of the soldiers for their altruism in Vietnam War in an old-fashioned style like that Of Green Beret in 1968 but of a different theme.<br />As such We Were Soldiers are bound to be sentimental where amidst the political backstage there are the wives at the Fort Benning, Georgia including Madeleine Stowe and Keri Russell offering solace to each other when their husbands are mired in the holocaust. Their roles are unfortunately stifled.<br />It is where in the battlefield that the men are given enough screen time to impress. Moore performed by the dignified Mel Gibson is humanized by his sensitive portryal; Sam Elliot as the gruff sgt. major Plumley; Greg Kinnear as the over-confident pilot Crandall and Chris Klein as the ill-fated Geoghegan, Barry Pepper as the journalist who survived to tell the tale. Mel Gibson teamed with Randall Wallace who scripted Braveheart compensates his sentimentality with realisitic portrayal of bloodshed and is ghoulishly haunting when it films the piling corpses, sweltering bullets and imminent deaths mainly capturing the downfall of American soldiers in their tragic end. <br />We WERE SOLDIERS luckily casted away the stereotype as committed by Saving Private Ryan to acknowledge the grief and devastation to both parties. It is at its best a respectful tribute and one war-movie that examines the afflictions of war to Vietnam and American in enlightening honesty.
0446677450|5.0|Yeung Shu Wing<BR>City University of Hong Kong<br />This book teaches you how to manage your money by illustrating a simple and true story of the author, thus it is very easy to read. There are three main characters in the story, they are rich dad, poor dad and the author. Poor dad is the father of the author, he is with high education level and with a stable job but he always fall into financial problem. While poor dad is the father of the author¡¦s friend, although he¡¦s only a college graduate, he becomes rich. The author began to learn from his poor dad when he was 9 years old, and he finally becomes rich too.<br />The author points out that high education level, hard working are not the necessary factors of being rich. On the contrary, the only way to be rich is to let money works for you. In the book, the author introduced some of his own theories on Finance, although some of the theories are different from those academic theories, they were make sense and easy to understand. The author brought in the most important idea: everyone should carefully manage his/her own Balance Sheet. In which we should try to increase assets in the Balance Sheet by purchasing assets that will create and generate value, such as shares, bonds; At the same time, decrease liabilities by buying less assets that will depreciate over time, such as premises, cars. The author explained that if you buy in assets, they would generate assets over time. On the other hand, when purchasing liabilities, they would make people falls into risk of working for money and repaying debts. If you look at this book, you will definitely know how to balance your Balance Sheet.<br />This book is totally different from books that teach you generate wealth, it teaches you financial knowledge instead. Hence the earlier you read this book, the earlier you know the way to manage your money and to be rich.

B00005221M|3.0|When you read these reviews, make sure you're reading the reviews for the DVD, which is very poor, and not the reviews for the VHS, which is superb. Like many people, I couldn't wait for the DVD of this wonderful movie, but no DVD has ever disappointed me as much as this one. I accept the fact that Mann may have had a different vision for this movie than the commercial version, but it is an inferior version (with which we can simply agree to disagree) but it is also poorly produced technically and that is inexcusable. The DVD should have at least included both Mann's version and the original commercial version. Perhaps one day, someone will wake up and the original version of this movie will be available on DVD, but it isn't at present.
0062502182|1.0|In this childish fable our young hero learns to speak with his heart (also with the wind, with the sand, and with the sun), and meets magicians and alchemists, who teach him that if he follows his dream (i.e. his personal legend) then all the world will conspire to help him. Most importantly he learns to read the universal language written in omens that guide him along his way. Books are not really helpful for him; at the beginning he is reading one (and using it as a pillow), but once the quest starts he stops reading altogether. A fellow traveler who reads a lot is subtly made fun of, and is left behind.<br />Well, I see precious little wisdom in all of this. Of course you should follow your dreams, but to believe in omens as a guide, or that if you really want to realize your dream then the world will conspire to help you, is simply nonsense. This book is not about wisdom, it is about superstition...
0385505833|4.0|I'll be honest-I nearly didn't read this book.  I'd received it as a gift from a close friend who knows my reading predilections well--and also knows I've avoided Grisham for a while now as I'd come to see his novels as overly repetitive and, therefore, boring. But every time I'd see her she'd inquire about the book, so, with a sense of dread, I sat down to read it.<br />It turns out that Grisham has finally diverged from his mass-manufactured overly frenetic pulp thriller habit and actually whiten a very different sort of story.<br />Grumpy Luther Krank and his sweeter wife, Nora, having just shipped their daughter off to Peru and a stint in the Peace Corps, decide to skip Christmas this year to forgo the gifts, the tree, the decorations, the cards, the parties and to spend the dollars saved on a 10-day Caribbean cruise.  Luther wants a vacations from all the Christmas stress and, besides, the cruise will cost less in the long run than indulging in all the holiday hoopla common to the Krank household at that time of year.<br />Unfortunately for Luther, his decision places him in the vortex of a social storm.  Friends, family and neighbors weigh in to communicate the lack of wisdom in such a decision-it seems that Luther's expenditures-or, more precisely, the lack of them--are an issues fort many of these folks.<br />The book is a comedic farce-casting comical aspersions on the social conformity, holiday hoopla and overt commercialism that have come to be so much a part-if not the reson for-Christmas in the U. S.---particularly in the `burbs.<br />A last minute development cause Luther to reevaluate this plan and provides a window for all to reevaluate the meaning of Christmas as well.<br />This is a sweet story with cranky, quirky-yet recognizable characters.  It is told with warmth and affections, not usually traits one associates with Grisham.<br />A lot of people criticize the book as being lightweight.  True, it's not War and Peace, but it never aspires to be.  What it is is an actual story told from the heart aimed at evoking genuine emotions with humor and affection.<br />A lot of folks act like that's some sort of cop out by Grisham.  Those people need tog et a life.What it is is an actual story told from the heart aimed at evoking genuine emotions with humor and affection.  <br />A lot of folks act like that's some sort of cop out by Grisham.

B00003W8NM|1.0|Back in the early 80's, Warren Zevon released a song called &quot;Ain't That Pretty At All&quot;. It's about feelings of alienation and the search for real meaning amongst the superficiality of modern culture, summed up neatly in its recurring line<BR> &quot;'cause I'd rather feel bad<BR>  than not feel anything at all&quot;<BR>It's a pretty good song (more of a rant, really); Zevon's a great songwriter and this is about par for him. It's currently available on his &quot;best of&quot; CD. <BR>Which pertains to &quot;Fight Club&quot; in this way only: in about 3 minutes, Zevon manages to make the same point that the makers of &quot;Fight Club&quot; waste two hours of our lives to ham-handedly try to get across. Zevon's take on the topic has the virtues of wit and brevity, while the film offers up only pretentiousness and incoherence. Lots of able talent on hand here, but the net result is unwatchable dreck. I can't remember the last time I hated a movie this much.
B00003CXSP|4.0|When &quot;Hannibal&quot; was released as a book, I was one of the people who lined up to buy it.  At that time I felt it was a let down from &quot;Silence of Lambs.&quot;  While it was quite readable it lacked some fundamental level of excitement.  Because of that I did not go see the film when it was first released.  Now I find myself having mixed reactions to the DVD release, and for reasons almost the exact opposite of those I held against the book.<br />Don't get me wrong.  The film is really much better than the book.  The casting of Hopkins and Julianne as Lector and Starling is perfect.  The script is riveting and all the other qualities are almost too good.  In fact I would be tempted to give this every star possible except for one thing.  Ridley Scott, as director, has chosen to base the film on the book, but he deviates from the novel at several key points.  Scott himself admits that he was trying for a new interpretation of Lector the anti-hero.<br />Viewers will have to decide whether this is an issue for them.  It didn't really bother me until the ending itself, which is simply not what writer Tom Harris has intended.  I felt it was completely out of character with the rest of the film as well.  It is clear from Scott's commentaries on the film that this ending is exactly what he wanted.  Oddly enough, the extra material includes an alternative ending which I think is much better, even if it doesn't follow the book either.<br />What's good?  Almost everything else.  I've already mentioned the great acting, but what really makes the film is the great cinematography and a mindboggling score.  Right from the beginning you are confronted with a film too serene and beautiful to be a simple horror movie.  It has a lean and solemn poetry that, perhaps, gives us a glimpse into Lector's own mind.  From out of the most nerve-wracking of pieces and fragments Scott has created a romance that has no physical components - a tragicomedy where we expected a horror film.<br />Despite of my dislike for the ending I still would label this film a must see.  The Special Edition includes omitted scenes and trailers, Multi-Angle Vignettes, a series of 'the making of...' discussions and all the other paraphernalia of the gimmick overladen DVD issue.  Two discs of shivers and fun.ilm.<br />Despite of my dislike for the ending I still would label this film a must see.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|The brilliance of this movie lies in the fact that it takes a simple message that we've all heard a million times in our lives (Drugs kill? tell me something I don't  know...) and presents it to the viewer in a way that shatters any illusions He or She might have left...<br />Yes watching this film is a disturbing experience but don't let that stop you. This is one of the best movies of the decade and the fact that some people dare to compare it with Traffic just because it deals with the same issue is a disgrace. Traffic is a like Disney movie (both in its simplicity and its naivety) compared to this gem. Try trainspotting instead and you are getting closer.<br />The fact that it deals so effectively with both youth addiction problems (Heroin) AND at the same time with 'adults' addiction problems (legally prescribed amphetamines is just one example) is an astonishing  feat and it shows the great potentials that this young director has.<br />The acting is also very good from every member of the cast but its Ellen Burstyn's performance that really steals the show. As for the visual tricks, while the camera work is great at times, after a certain point it becomes a distraction from the main story.<br />And while the need for experimentation is an integral part of being 'young' this movie should help you clear out any illusions you might have about drugs. If not, you are on your own...
B00005V9HA|4.0|It has always been difficult to find anything original in film, especially in the horror genre.

B00005NWM3|4.0|Nickelback, for all that they are accused of, have managed to produce a Top 40 hit, as well as selling LOTS of this CD.  Overall, this CD kicks a**, and anyone who loves rock and roll will agree.  As 'derivate' as they are accused of, I must admit I had to laugh.  It really comes down to what CD you want to pop in your player...and did Nickelback ever taken a lot of second seats?<br />Sounding like you have been through a lot of pain seems to be what really sells these days, so get this CD for that reason alone...however if you want to put that aside and get this CD for it's merits alone, go for it...and I do not hand out that advice easily.  ...some great stuff to rock out on while the rest of the world is going on with other stuff......
0062515675|4.0|I can't really remember what this book tought after 6-7 months. I remember some of the important stuffs like embracing the precense, having purpose, meditations....etc. However, it doesn't help too much...You can find these kind of teachings on any self-help books. I would recommend books by famous authors such as Napoleon Hill, Dale Carnegie, Lao Tzu, Clement, Og mandino, Dr.Joseph murphy and David Schwartz....etc and many more. If you really feel like reading this book, it's best to borrow it from the library and read it in few days. it's not long at all.. and story telling format helps readers to read it in less than 7-8 hours. I don't have any favorite books right now but I really liked Lao Tzu's &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; translated by Brian walker or Gia-fu Feng. Good luck with further readings.
B00003CWRX|3.0|From the very opening shot, as a blindfolded Al Pacino is raced through the streets of Gaza to meet the leader of the Hezbollah to negotiate an interview with 60 minutes, you know that style is going to be important component of this movie. Before that, even, if you're paying attention, since it's a Michael Man flick (he of Miami Vice and Manhunter).<br /><br />And like Manhunter, style gets the better of content, to the point where the content jackknifes halfway though and the film morphs from a fairly routine Whistleblower expose (like Silkwood) to a Testament to Journalistic Integrity: Russell Crowe's victimised whistleblowing ciggy scientist almost completely disappears from the last forty minutes as Pacino battles with CBS legal and corporate honchos to get the segment aired in the name of truth and justice.<br /><br />Meantime, the style grates - from the elaborate opener in Palestine which, while impressive, is irrelevant to the film except to show off Al's commitment to his profession, to the silly music and the the endless shots of the backs of heads - especially Crowe's, but towards the end of the film, everyone else's as well. Maybe Mann was trying to invoke some imagery with this, but I couldn't figure it out, so it just annoyed me, especially since it highlighted, in Crowe's case, a very poor wig.<br /><br />Crowe did his best to rustle (ha!) up a Kentucky accent, but still was miscast - I don't think the Wigand character was a hollywood hunk. Pacino carried the film and Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace was spot on.<br /><br />While it's undoubtedly an entertaining film, just too much about it was cliched or needlessly modish for it to make a real impression, so I reckon it's destined for the half price hire section in the video store.<br /><br />But cheap at half the price.<br /><br />Olly Buxton

B00000K0YC|5.0|In Sonny Rollins I find the best of both worlds: the endurance and enthusiasm of a John Coltrane, yet the story-telling capabilities of a Dextor Gordon; and I believe Saxophone Colossus, one of Sonny's best recordings ever, illustrates this very well. What I particularly enjoy about this recording however is the interplay between Rollins and Max Roach. Roach's drumming seems very inventive here, and this recording is living proof that modern-day drum machines and rhythm sampling dramatically shortchange the listener. Finally, I know that many listeners who would like to get into Sonny's work are usually directed to this recording first. Not a bad recommendation, but in my opinion, his 1990 recording &quot;Falling in Love with Jazz&quot; will make you do exactly what the title suggests. It is not nearly as well known, but the musicianship and range of styles seem quite amazing, and it is hands-down my favorite Rollins recording, with &quot;Saxophone Colossus&quot; and &quot;Tenor Madness&quot; both coming in close second.

Eventually, if u actually enjoy reading or aren't lazy, you will want to read the full blown edition, which is far better then a rehash, as it will actually feel like a novel instead of just clifnotes, as many parts i found, didnt stand out as they should have.  i feel that if u get this book, get the full, unabridged version.

But then I saw it a second time....<BR>It's not that it's a bad movie, but, like someone else said, it DID feel rushed. They tried to hurry along scenes that should have been way more drawn out. I know it's a movie aimed at kids, but it could have been longer and people would not have minded if the movie had just gone at an even pace. But it was rushed and it skipped over important scenes and rushed on to the next one. And, although the kids were cute, their acting was not top-notch. I know, I know, I can't demand Oscar-winning acting from kids, but their expressions of fright were so fake and they just didn't act natural. Seriously, when you are scared, do you slowly back away with your eyebrows up and your mouth open and your eyes bugged out??? They were just trying too hard.<br />Nevertheless, I gave the film 4 stars because it was very faithful to the book which I appreciated and it was a good movie.
1558803602|5.0|A loose reworking of Victor Fleming's 1943 World War II drama A GUY NAMED JOE, ALWAYS has to rank as perhaps director Steven Spielberg's most unfairly maligned movie. Even though it has a very old-fashioned feel updated to the late 1980s, this is still a fine movie done with real poignancy. This is nowhere near the bottom of the Spielberg canon; that dubious distinction belongs to \\"1941\\" and HOOK.<br />Richard Dreyfuss stars as Pete, a dare-devil aerial firefighter with a penchant for taking a lot of unneccesary chances in his line of work. As much \\"fun\\" as he has, he is worrying not only his partner Al (John Goodman), but also his one true love Dorinda (Holly Hunter). After much pressure, including Hunter's threat to leave him, he agrees to settle down and become an instructor for up-and-coming flyers in Colorado after one last mission. But on that mission, in the process of saving Goodman when his plane catches fire, Dreyfuss loses his life when his aircraft explodes. Goodman is horrified, and Hunter devastated.<br />In heaven (or a burned-out section of forest), Dreyfuss is met by a guardian angel (Audrey Hepburn, in her final role). He comes back to earth as a spirit, to help a rookie fire-fighter (Brad Johnson) learn the tricks of the trade.  Johnson does this and more; unfortunately, he also falls head over heels for Hunter, and Dreyfuss feels the pain of having to watch this, not being able to let go.  But Hepburn gives him very good counsel, and he is redeemed by saving Hunter from a fiery death in a flight through a nightmarish firestorm.<br />One of Spielberg's most touching movies, ALWAYS was unfairly castigated by critics as being heavy-handed and manipulative. I, however, am extremely cynical of such critics who only analyze certain films and don't really FEEL anything. This is a film of pure emotions, ranging from comedy, both dark and slapstick, to tear-jerking drama to a suspense and terror-laden climax. The cinematography and the special effects aretypical for Spielberg--convincing and top notch. Spielberg, however, wisely, does not stint on the drama. Dreyfuss and Hunter are excellent, as are Goodman and Hepburn. Johnson, often heavily trashed, does a fairly good job with his role, complete with his John Wayne imitation (specifically borrowing a line from John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE).<br />A typically fine score by John Williams, which presages his work for Spielberg's controversial 2001 sci-fi drama A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, tops off ALWAYS, one of the most misunderstood movies of recent times. For poignant romantic drama, this is an essential movie, a true must-see.
078322804X|5.0|In the 20 years since this film's release, the Blues Brothers have been overexposed, yet for all the theme park impersonators and lackluster sequels, the original skits and film retain their magic, in part because of Aykroyd and John Belushi's frenetic energy and the fun of the film. With over two hours of slapstick comedy and great music, you'd be hard pressed to find a more entertaining film in cinematic history. It's impossible to walk away without humming the soundtrack and smiling.<br />As the supplemental material on this DVD reveals, that's partly due to how much fun the cast and crew were having. Aykroyd, Belushi and director John Landis love the music it spotlights and the over-the-top humor it features, and it shows, both in the loving treatment of performances by such R&amp;B legends as Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin and Cab Calloway, and in the audacity of the car crashes and physical comedy.<br />This is one of those rare films for almost EVERYONE. Although some parts could seem raunchy or misogynist or sacreligious, Belushi and Aykroyd are charming enough to dispel hard feelings. This is a film you can watch with your kids and your grandparents, your girlfriend and your brother, and you'll all have a great time.<br />The DVD could be better. The sound and picture qualities are flawed, and the supplemental material is uninspired. Although the one-hour documentary gives a revealing look behind the scenes -- particularly from Landis, who enjoys talking about his work and knows how to tell stories -- Universal misses the opportunity to delve more into the music of the artists behind the film. As for the restored scenes, most of them (excluding John Lee Hooker's extended musical number) add little to the film and are the often confusing result of screenwriter Aykroyd's attempts to explain too much. They slow down the pace of the film, and they would have better served either as a separate &quot;deleted scenes&quot; feature or as an optional version.<br />Butwith a movie this entertaining, why quibble? &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; is an essential addition to any film collection, especially when the DVD preserves the widescreen ratio. You don't want to miss a milimeter of the car crashes.
B00003CX9E|4.0|I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I was NOT into black and white. I had only heard of his radio speech and the scare it had caused. My grandfather was visiting and I had no choice, but to sit down and pretend. I stopped pretending fifteen minutes into the movie and was not only entertained by the movie, but by my grandfather's incite on the movies of this era and breakthroughs this particular one brought to the movie industry. the fading in and out of scenes, the ending focus on \\"rosebud\\", etc. and the acting which was not a dramatic portrayal, but an almost real one compared to the acting of that era was something you only see again maybe 15-20 years later. Since then, I have seen it two other times and as a 23 year old and then a 26 year old, found it even more riveting. so why not five stars? Well, it is still a movie from a different time and has that time stamped on it from the very beginning. I still watch old movies trying to broaden my horizons (whatever that intails), but I can't find that common cultural binding point with them and they fail me. Orson Welles did that. His political and social commentary and understanding of the human spirit seemed to generate that for me and I am grateful to both my grandfather and him for being able to entertain me 60 years later.

Don't get me wrong, the movie was exceptional and wonderfully done, but there were some things left out of it.  This is understandable.  If they brought the book over exactly as it is written it would be too long.  <BR>  The movie looked excactly how I pictured the book.  Everything was a treat for the eyes.  They casted incredibly well.  I didn't see anything that was contradictory from my mental image.  That is saying a lot for an adaption.<BR>  The movie is great fun to watch, but for the avid Harry Potter fan, I think the book is twice as fun.
B000002NBY|4.0|Paul Simon took an unusual turn in his musical career with the release of Graceland.  The many African rhythms on this record are quite creative.  In addition, the use of the accordion, bass, and brass arrangements are quite captivating.<br /> Of course its the vocal stylings of these talented African Musicians that really knock the whole thing home.  How about the harmonies on the I Know What I Know track?  What spirit, it sounds like Paul recruited some true songbirds for that track.  Homeless is especially creative as the acapella groove just feels right.<br /> The singles-Boy In The Bubble, You Can Call Me Al, and Graceland probably have the most captivating tunes.  But this release stands tall on style points as the International appeal of this record is far reaching and very influential.
B00005TT77|3.0|Ok...I suppose my opinion may be a little bias considering I am a huge Beatles fan. I was a little nervous to listen to tracks from this cd. Alot of artists have been sampled throughout the years..which is cool, but when it comes to my Beatles..it better be damn good. First off, Eddie Vedder was great, his rendition was unique but still honored the original version. Revolution and Let it Be, were a different story. I felt these songs were &quot;changed&quot; to much from the original version. The Beatles were and are awesome and in no way do their songs need to be changed. I will probally order this cd simply because I am a huge Beatles fan and feel for the most part that it is a good cover of their songs. Lets just say 70% of the cd I feel is pretty decent. I guess when it comes to the Beatles I like their songs just the way they are...so Let it Be:)

The words that best describe it are bold and brassy; and Barbra Streisand is PERFECT as Miss Dolly Levi, the matchmaker.  <BR> The supporting characters are expertly cast, and do a good job (Although Babs steals the show =)<BR> It has a lot of awesome songs, including 'Sunday Clothes' 'Love is Only Love' 'So Long, Dearie'...and all the other numbers. Excelent choreography. <BR>  Babs, obviously, has an encredible voice: Michael Crawford's (Cornelius) is decent; Walter Mattheu's is DREADFUL, but it doesn't need to be lovely to carry off the songs he's given.<BR> Watch this movie. Don't go in expecting anything deep or elegent, but do look foward to a good time. Hello, Dolly! comes THIS close to surpassing Seven Brides for Seven Brothers as my favourite musical of all time. I have been informed (glower) that Babs is no longer cool: all of you who apply to that school of thought---still your resentment, for she is definately cool in here.
B00005Y228|4.0|My daughter and I can't stop dancing to this album.  I was nervous at first because I usually don't buy an album after hearing one song.  Let's just say this is a sure fire party album to make you shake the blues away.  Hats off to the producers.    <br />Harlem is bumpin tonight with this album.<br />I look forward to more on this artist.
B000007SPT|5.0|4AD's best album by far.  Lacking the grandeur of Filigree and Shadow, this album is stripped to the bare bones of beauty and sadness.  This is This Mortal Coil before the unnecessary numerous musical interludes that detract from the flow of the album; the few that the album has are marvelously blended with the beauty of the stark lyrical interpretations of popular songs.   Breakthrough vocals by Gordon Sharp (who, with his band, CINdYTALK,  has yet to achieve the grace he obtained on this album) and Robbie Grey of Modern English.  Any disc with Lisa Gerrard is worth owning, and if you think you are a serious record collector, what are you doing without Song To The Siren(a now classic track)? Just light some candles and buy it, for god's sake!
B00005QIPH|5.0|People complain on how low music sales are and how music's dying out.  These same people aren't giving any true musicians the attention they deserve.  The Strokes are not the best musicians, but they have one thing that a lot of modern artists are lacking....HEART!  And that heart shines through on this album.  I had no idea who the Strokes were until I found them here on Amazon and still was hesitant.  Here we have something different and breaking away from the standard.  This album is totally rocking in every way possible, if you just let loose and follow the Strokes.  Let them take you on the wild ride and sweep you away.  If you still aren't impressed then please, for the love of God, give this to a true music fan, someone who can appreciate this gem.    \\"Is This It\\" may be overhyped, but the hype isn't always bad, especially in the case of the Strokes.  I'm not an MTV fan whatsoever and don't even watch that lackluster channel...if you like these guys check out the White Stripes and the Shins.  You're in for a treat, with this album...
B000000H3W|5.0|If you get this CD, you will truly understand the power, speed, technicality, and all-out exhilaration that comes with the very best of heavy metal. This is truly the first that I have ever purchased that I can listen from beginning to end without skipping a single second. Sepultura's Arise has that capability. This is the album where Brazil's metal boys became men, and began composing tighter songs with more articulate riffs and even some tribal stuff. Chaos A.D. was the natural progression from here. To think that this was released only in 1991 is unthinkable. In that year, alt-rock had swept away most of 80's glam-rock, and thrash metal giants had considerably sunk in people's eyes. Metallica had slowed down to half their pace, Megadeth had been done with Rust In Peace and begun their own 'Countdown To Extinction'. Pantera had only just appeared on the scene, and Slayer's Seasons of the Abyss had dissappointed many, not being the successor to Reign in Blood people wanted. In that odd time, Sepultura released this masterpiece. &quot;Altered State&quot; has a wicked tribal beginning, and acoustic guitar undertunes throughout. &quot;Dead Embryonic Cells&quot; was the hit single, and thrashes very well. Kisser's guitar lines are very prominent through all 6:41 minutes of &quot;Desparate Cry,&quot; and their cover of Motorhead's &quot;Orgasmatron&quot; is commendable indeed. Sepultura has proven with this album and Chaos A.D., the heights of their career, that they are the TRUE masters of thrash metal.
0380817683|4.0|I really enjoyed Rachel's Holiday. I wasn't really expecting much more than another chick flick book, and although you get that with this novel, you get much more. This book has all the components of the currently popular single-girls-come-to-terms novel and much more. Watching Rachel slowly begin to realize that even though she's only a &quot;social user&quot;, she's exactly like all the other addicts in the rehab center she goes to.<br />This book is funny, witty, sharp, entertaining, highly readable, and it even made me sniffle once or twice (of course there are some kleenex commercials that do that too, so don't read too much into that.)
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory is 1 of the best CDs ever. I iove it! It features Papercut,One Step Closer,(music video)With You,Points of Authority,Crawling,(music video)Runaway,By Myself,In The End,(music video)A Place For My Head, Forgotten,Cure For The Itch, and Pushing Me Away. These songs are amazing, and they really make you think. Believe me! Listen to the samples. And look for the DVD that shows the rare music videos of Papercut and Points of Authority. It also has two songs never heard before. Well if you read this thanks..................Oh and one more thing LINKIN PARK kicks...
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Summary:<br />Hilariously funny and enjoyable movie with great music, great DVD features.<br />Review:<br />Great story with a solid script with good cohesion, flow and development; great acting voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow), great animation, design and implementation, great direction and great movie.  Great DVD features that are extensive and  generous!  And, a wonderful Filmakers' Commentary.<br />My kids loved the movie, got some of the good jokes, love the story, and enjoy playing the DVD Special Features including games, a Kareoki video and others.<br />Mike Meyers shows himself to be a gifted comedian with lots of wonderfully creative ideas and a moral to tell in the end. <br />Storyline<br />A charming ogre (Myers) is coerced into rescuing a feisty Princess Fiona (Diaz) with an overly talkative donkey (Murphy) in order to get his swamp back from the overcompensating (read that \\"short\\") Lord Farquaad (Lithgow).  Princess Fiona is obsessed with having \\"loves first kiss\\" with her \\"true love\\", and of course, cannot wait to be with her great Lord Farquaad whom she supposes is her true love.<br />Moral: <br />There may be much more to people than meets the eye!

B00003CXE7|5.0|Summary:<br />A general becomes a slave, who becomes stronger that Caesar.  <br />Solid script writing with good cohesion, great acting from a deep and solid cast, great (and eerie) music, fantastic sets (a real coliseum, and surreal special effects), great directing, great Director's Commentary by Ridley Scott and great DVD special features includes a short documentary on gladiators. <br />Review:<br />Movie mixes some history with good story telling and truly great special effects - the creation of an accurate Rome and the Coliseum.  Good intrigue, and twists, along with some robust (bloody) gladiator fights.  This movie makes Russell Crowe, and he makes the movie.  Joquin Phoenix delivers a great performance being a demented Caesar (Comodus) who gains audience sympathy with his sick and twisted weaknesses (his search for being loved).  His sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is exceptionally regal, without being overly affected.<br />Richard Harris does a surprisingly great job and his short performance sets the stage as Caesar Augustus - the great leader and empire builder whose failed fatherhood (to Comodus) leads to the conflagration between Maximus and Comodus.<br />Story:<br />Rome's greatest general Maximus (Crowe) finds himself thrust into slavery when he narrowly escapes being murdered on the orders of Comodus (Phoenix). Maximus' personal mission is to avenge the brutal deaths of his wife and son against Comodus; then to join his family in the hereafter.  Fearful for the life of her young son Lucilla (Nielson) gains hope in staging a revolt through Maximus when she finds him alive in the Coloseum.  Because of his fierce fighting style, Rome loves the slave Maximux and Comodus cannot directly kill him. <br />Negatives:<br />Some of the gladiator fights are detailed and therefore gory, so be careful who you see this film with.<br />Also, the pagan concept of death and the portrayal of the \\"hereafter\\" feels spiritually empty.  But, that was Rome
B00005YTFG|1.0|This film is simply AWFUL!  That says it all.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have been a Harry Potter fan for quite some time and have read all the books out so far, some more than once. I loved the first movie and even tho Harry seemed like a real character the movie gave him a 3D quality all his own. I think it helped to understand the story line better to have read the books. Now when I read the next book I will be able to see the characters in my mind's eye and live their adventures along with them.
B000021XR5|5.0|Trying to decide which STP album is the best is nearly impossible to do, because each has something different to offer.  Core is the heaviest, Purple is the catchiest, Tiny Music has the most original sound, and Shangri-La-De-Da has the most heartfelt lyrics.  Which album you like the most is really just a matter of personal preference.  No. 4 in many ways is like a greatest hits album, in which STP shows that it can still pull of the sounds it used on all three previous CDs and then some.  Usually I'm not drawn to this kind of album but for some reason No. 4 is the one that I would consider my favorite STP CD.  It just has it all, every song sounds completely different and yet the CD somehow just flows together perfectly.  Also, there's none of the weak moments here that can often be found on previous STP albums; producer Brendan O'Brien's recording technique is cleaner and much more focused than usual.<br />Down-Heavier and darker than anything off the first 3 albums.<br />Heaven and Hotrods-Sounds kind of like Crackerman from Core.<br />Pruno-Think Jane's Addiction.<br />Church on Tuesday-A lighter feel, like a Tiny Music song.<br />Sour Girl-STP breaking some new ground with great success.  <BR>Slow, sad, reminescent of the Beatles.<br />No Way Out-Some definate rap-rock influences in Weiland's vocal here, but don't worry its far from being a Bizkit song.<br />Sex and Violence-Agressive song that makes use of an awesome sparkly glam effect during the prechorus.  Short and to the point.<br />Glide-Very polished, falsetto rock song that'll make you wonder how Weiland learned to sing that high.  One of the best on the album.<br />I Got You-It has a classic, country feel and takes some time to love, but it'll get really addictive.<br />MC5-Sounds like it was recorded in only a few takes, but that makes it somehow better, giving it a raw, punk feel.<br />Atlanta-Along the vein of an acoustic Kitchenware and Candybars from Purple, but much better.  The most epic, gorgeous ballad STP have ever turned out with the possible exception of Wonderful.
0060922583|5.0|This is a fascinating book that tries to relate the holographic theory of existence to other paranormal phenomena, such as out-of-body experiences, near-death experiences, and U.F.O.s.  The book is well researched and well documented, and the author works hard to maintain scientific validity while exploring very strange and controversial theories.  Michael Talbot does a good job of communicating complex issues and theories to laymen.  This is a very interesting and provocative book - highly recommended.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is the album that marked the fall of Manson.  People started seeing him as something ridiculous, a sell-out, something almost as fake and disposable as all the other generic rock out there.  You see, Manson committed the most dangerous move in the game of maintaining a loyal fanbase: he completely changed his style.  I don't think there's been any other artist in the nineties, in fact maybe no major artist in rock music EVER, who has changed his sound quite so drastically in the course of just one album.  And yet Manson gets absolutely no credit for this.  Then again, I guess that's not surprising when you consider the standards America judges its music by.<br />Anyhow, to set the record straight, Mechanical Animals is not a sellout.  Its glossier, of course, the song structures are much simpler, the goth stuff is all gone, but that doesn't change the fact that its a great artistic statement and shows Manson taking a huge risk by throwing out practically all of the elements that made Antichrist Superstar such a smash.  Not to mention that half (7 out of 14) songs on this album could be considered ballads, something that hardly helps an artist's commercial success in the land of hard rock.  Holywood is the sellout album, taking the theme of Antichrist and repeating it in more commercial song structures.  Mechanical Albums is Manson's equivalent of Nevermind, an album so amazing that you can't help but grow to love the slick production and verse/chorus/verse songstructure that many people think somehow completely invalidates the artistic value of an album.<br />With all that said, I also have to note that this is Manson's darkest and most depressing album. (...)<br />Lastly, Manson's wit and dark humor highlight a handful of songs, from The Dope Show \\"drugs, they say, are made in California\\" to \\"User-Friendly,\\" which uses some nicely timed female guest appearances.
B00005K3OT|3.0|...that just happens to go on and on for 2 hours and 2 minutes. Considering its relatively simple plot, that's just a bit 2 long for me! :)<br />CHOCOLAT (2000) is, however, a well-filmed and well-acted story of a young Gypsy-ish French woman named Vianne (wonderfully played by the wonderful Juliette Binoche) and her ten-year-old-ish daughter who breeze (literally) into this small, old-fashioned--and traditionally Catholic--French town and proceed to cause a major stir in the values--and the loins--of many, by opening up a decadent--and mysterious--Chocolatier right in the middle of the solemn period of Lent.  This will not do, according to the town mayor (played by veteran British actor Alfred Molina), and an over-protective mother (believably played by Carrie-Ann Moss of THE MATRIX) who scorns her own mother (played by the always-wonderful Dame Judi Dench), whom she considers an infidel--so much so that she won't let her mother anywhere near her own grandson.<br />So, things basically progress from here [SPOILER ALERT]: Vianne quickly becomes known for her ability to prescribe the 'right' kind of chocolate for each customer as a cure for his/her societal 'ills'. Eventually she comes to 'cure' the entire town, whilst finding true love for herself in the form of Johnny Depp, as an Irish \\"river rat.\\" The End. :)<br />Juliette Binoche is glowing throughout, and was deservedly nominated for Best Actress. She makes you believe in her character as someone who possesses special powers to discern what is lurking deeply in people's hearts (I know, that kind of sounded like THE SHADOW, didn't it?). Judi Dench is virtually unrecognizable in her role of an old free-spirit who's lived most of her life in the town as a shunned figure; she was deservedly nominated for Best Supporting Actress.<br />However, the film is ponderously directed by Lasse Hallstrom, who directed the similarly slow, but superior, THE CIDER HOUSE RULES (1999). This style itself wouldn't have been much of aproblem here if the ending weren't so obvious from about the halfway point. As a result, it does become a bit boring.  The two best things about CHOCOLAT are: 1) The subtle acting performances from Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, and even hulking Peter Stormare (remember him as the strong, silent kidnapper in FARGO?); and 2) The delicious scenes of chocolate-making, which made me really wishing I had some of those wonderful confections.<br />Bottom line: Decent film, a bit too long, very well-acted, will make you crave chocolate--bad!!! MODERATELY RECOMMENDED
B000021YQV|5.0|I remember the first time I saw the video for Sugar back in 1998, just when good rock music was starting to die off, and it seemed like just another nail in the coffin.  Something about it reminded me maybe of what Twizted might sound like if they decided to make music on nothing but guitar, bass, and drums.  This was not a good thing, to say the least.  Then I heard their song Spiders and actually starting laughing because it was such a lame, sloppy attempt at a ballad.<br />Maybe I was missing something.  But then again, Chop Suey, the first single from Toxicity didn't impress me very much either, especially with its somewhat annoying chorus part where he sings \\"trust in my self-righteous suicide\\".  Whatever, lets just say its grown on me since I saw the awesome video for the title track Toxicity and finally decided to buy what so many people have been calling \\"the album of the year\\".<br />The thing that makes Toxicity seem so fresh is how unconventional it is; there's nary a standard song structure to be found on the entire album.  Its prog-rock that actually works, something that's extremely rare in today's music.  Probably the only downside to the album is some of the lyrics, which can seem downright silly at times.  \\"Prison Song\\" is a conspiracy theory that the government wants drugs to be sold to the people so it can lock them up and build a lot more prisons throughout the country.  Ridiculous, to say the least.  However, its still great to actually see a band challenging authority in America, especially now when most bands like U2 are wrapping themselves in the American flag and talking about how wonderful this country is.  Even better is how the band slams Hollywood; if you've ever been there for even a day you'll know that Toxicity is a much more fitting name for it.  The city's been in decline since the late '20s and is practically a ghetto by now.<br />Anyhow, I don't know where they're going to go from here but for now System of a Down have made a greatrecord.
B00003CXTF|5.0|Ok, I have read a million different reviews for this film. And I personally think that most of the authors are sadly mistaken.I must agree that it may not have been Afleck's best part, but at least he was exploring a new endeavor. I don't think it's right to attack someone for trying new things! Now, second of all Michael Bay and Bruckheimer NEVER ONCE claimed this movie to be a documentary. People are bashing this film for some of the innacurate details and for some of the major parts of the real event that was left out of the film. And I am so sick and tired of reading about it. This movie was about getting the feel of the personal side of that war. That the attack affected people's lives in a tremendous way. Everytime I watch it I try to put myself in a similar situation. And am devastated each time. So for anyone who enjoyed the personal side of Titanic and Armageddon I believe will enjoy this film! Have fun all!!<br />Oh, and anyone who enjoys beautiful music should buy/download the soundtrack. Especially the tracks &quot;Tennessee&quot; &amp; &quot;Brothers&quot;.
6304143206|5.0|For all of you who are complaining about the edits and &quot;tweaking&quot; of several elements in this film, you can relax now.  In the 20th Anniversary TV special broadcast on NBC, Spielberg himself, said that when the Special Edition is released on DVD, it will contain BOTH the revised edition that is coming soon to theaters, AND the original 1982 version.  At least he's giving us a choice.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python -- what we laughed at B.D.(Before Dilbert). The Far Side of British humor. Monty Python and the Holy Grail -- their first feature film -- it's a good romp. I wondered before I bought the DVD if in this fast food, fast paced, \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" times if it would still be as funny.<br />The duel with the Black Knight would stand up.... but what about the Killer Rabbit? The banquet scene a la songfest... \\"Whot? THE CURTAINS?\\" The French guard... \\"Run away!\\" \\"Run away!\\" \\"Help! Help! I am being oppressed!\\" Yes, no, not even the Killer Rabbit paled with age. Someone get me a tissue -- I laughed until I cried.<br />The DVD quality is astonishingly good for an (originally) low budget flick. You are offered the options of 5.1 Dolby, Dolby Digital or good old mono. Like everything Python, even the number of commentary and subtitle options are beyond the beyond. I particularly enjoyed the cast bitching. Excellent. Just excellent.<br />The bonus materials add an exorbitant amount of value. The Monks sing-a-long segment is extremely well done. I was able to figure out the difficult hand movements immediately. \\"THWACK\\"<br />There is a lovely travelogue. Michael Palin and an old guy go wandering around some Scottish castles and glens. You get to see the inside of the castle on the island in the middle of the lake. \\"Do they host B&B guests?\\" was my only question.<br />Legos. The singing knights recreated in plastic animation. Near 'bout priceless.<br />But, even with all the extras: moaning and groaning, dancing Legos and at least, every bit of 10 minutes of additional animations -- not to mention the incredibly useful short about coconuts -- I think it is worth buying just for the film. Just to have it in your possession. So at anytime, you are a mere flick of the remote away from \\"Ni!! Ni!!\\"<br />And I would positively say this, even if they had left out the additional 24 seconds: it's worth it. It is cheaper than a single hour with a mental health professional, even after you have met your deductible.fessional, even after you have met your deductible.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This was an excellent film.  I won't bore you with the same details that others have written, but I would suggest that you watch \\"Spy Games\\" and \\"3 Days of the Condor\\" as a double feature.  I found myself contrasting the two films and the roles that Robert Redford played in each film.  Both are definitely worth watching.
0452281881|4.0|I know someone who worked in that agency (obviously McCann Ericsson - London) and not only are some of the stories true, but the characters are very much real. The obvious salt and pepper has of course been added to create more drama, but surely everyone who slaved in any ad agency will relate to some of the incidents and events. Captivating, I went through the book in a straight 5 hours or so. Very funny in many passages, tears literally rolled down my cheeks more than once.<BR>My only negative thought is that the attempt at explaining who's who in the beginning will probably not be clear enough for many outside the industry.
B000000W5F|5.0|Mick once said that, to paraphrase, \\"If I'm still singing 'Satisfaction' when I'm 40 I'm gonna kill myself\\". Maybe he wouldn't have needed to go that far, but they certainly needed to quit releasing albums and touring. Can anyone (other than a hardcore Stones fan) really remember anything they released after this album? All mediocre at best. But this one wasn't.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence is not the greatest album, but you have to give it credit.  A few of the songs are good, such as Achilles Last Stand, Nobodys Fault but Mine, and For Your Life.  Tea Is For One, Hots on for Nowhere, and Royal Orleans are so-so, while Candy Store Rock is just bad.  Bonzo's Montreux, (Recorded in 1976, but never released until Coda, 1982) would have been a better choice for this album.  Below are my five star ratings for each song:<br />Achilles Last Stand: *****<br />For Your life: ****<br />Royal Orleans: ***<br />Nobody's Fault But Mine: ****<br />Candy STore Rock: **<br />Hot's on for Nowhere: ***<br />Tea is for One: ***<br />~Presence isn't the best album in the world, but for [money], you can't go wrong.
0385501560|3.0|I was choking to get through this one.  I loveF.C. and Survivor but it took me a while to get through this one.  But i thought the sex-addict premise was very original and cool, but the plot that based around it wasn't as interesting.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|I had heard many good things about Session 9, and I was very upset that it never had a theatrical run here in Rochester, N.Y.; I always prefer to see horror movies in a theater- they're scarier that way. Anyway, I ran right out and bought Session 9 on DVD as soon as it came out, and despite the great \\"Buzz\\" on the film, I sat down to watch, and was prepared to be disappointed. (Usually, the more I look forward to seeing a film, the bigger a letdown it turns out to be...)<br />  Well, the opening shot of a wheelchair sitting in a hallway of the abandoned Mental Hospital chased all my doubts away! From that promising (and CREEPY AS HELL!) opening shot, session 9 fulfills all of it's promises.<br />  The film tracks the weeklong efforts of a 5-man Asbestos Removal Crew, as they struggle to meet the insane deadline that their boss has set them for the cleanup of the aforementioned abandoned Hospital. The Boss, Gordy, is in desperate need of cash, and if the crew finishes in a week, the state has promised a $10,000.00 bonus. There are problems among the other men, too. One has stolen another's Girlfriend. Gordon's nephew is inexperienced, and, unknown to the rest of the crew, is afraid of the dark. And Mike, who longs to leave Haz-Mat work behind for the Law career he blew off Six Years ago, has just found a box of Audiotaped Psychiatry Sessions between a Psychiatrist and his Multiple-Personality patient, Mary Hobbes......Mike soon becomes obsessed with the tapes, sneaking away from the job to listen to the increasingly frightening sessions (Session 9 is the final tape), and read Mary's case history.<br />  It isn't long before a crew member turns up missing, tempers flare, and the truth about Session 9 becomes apparent.<br />  Director Brad Anderson has crafted a truly amazing film, due, in no small regard, to the incredibly forbidding setting of The Danvers State Hospital. The building is the TRUE star of the film, and the lush way that she is filmed only adds to the creep-out factor. Even though I KNEW THE END (Because some idiot posted a review here that blew the whole thing.....THANKS, JACKASS.), it was still shocking and sad to see it happen. I really got to know the characters; even the ones I didn't like had redeeming, human qualities. The final line of dialogue in the film is one that will forever be ingrained in my memory. I watched the end Three times last night, and I still get chills down my spine thinking about it....amazingly well-written. It's a crime that this movie wasn't given more exposure, especially in light of the success of Films like The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, and The Others...Could the horrible Blair Witch II have given distributors cold feet...?<br />  The DVD comes packed with extras; The commentary track is very informative, and there are 10 minutes of extra footage, mostly dealing with a sub-plot that was entirely cut, and a different ending that is equally chilling.<br />  Anyone looking for that true rarity, a well-made Horror movie, needs to pick up Session 9.
0812548094|1.0|This series is one of the worst that I have ever read.<BR>This is mainly because of the repetition and out right stealing of the books.  What do i mean by stealing?  Just that, this book has taken plot elements and other things from Jordan's tepid Wheel of Time series.  Take the main character is a man with a &quot;gift&quot; of magic that will drive him insane, unless he trains it, the group that trains him put a collar that controls his &quot;gift&quot; (the seanchen from WOT) and besides that, that group is a group of women who study and such and tend to act like the Aeis Sedai.<BR>On top of all this, the disturbing quality and violence of this series starts to get so insane as to make it sickening.<BR>In the end there's nothing for me to suggest this book for one to read, while the first book was okay, and had some great scenes in it (but still was stealing from Tolkien and Jordan amoung many others), this book is just plain horrible, go read something good instead of wasting your time with this horrid book.
B000026156|5.0|Dave Holland has developed his ensemble writing and arranging beautifully and consistently over the years. Any one of his albums can be recommended without reservation, from solo bass and cello, on to his duets with Rivers and Steve Coleman. His recent big band builds upon his greatest strengths while creating a powerful democratic ensemble for the expressions of some of today's best players.  Holland's two greatest strengths are good taste and and a consistent imagination for what sounds good, regardless of complexity and virtuosic playing.  OK, that's three.  Hard to stop.  This album, the genesis of Dave Holland as leader, was a youthful work, with all the implications of that word (for a delicious cross section, try the Circle-Paris Concert,  consider the trios with Corea and Altschul, consider projects with Braxton and Wheeler and bathe in the rich ensembles of the 80's forward).<br /><br />While you can spend a jazz-life marveling at the virtuosity and sonic beauty of his playing, the most delightful thing about this album, for me, besides the Dionysian spirit of the free-time passages and the brilliant interplay of Sam Rivers and Anthony Braxton, two very different but synergistic wind players, is the perennial Holland ability to write tunes that are playful and catchy at the same time that they are diving boards for the most unfettered but inspired improvisations.  That's right, catchy.  And somtimes, as in the title tune, modest and beautiful.  Every piece is a smile-inducing surprise, as long as one has no aversion or knee-jerk dismissal of \\"free\\" playing.  One can listen to \\"Four Winds\\", in its constantly shifting accents and meter, then skip to the next decade's \\"Homecoming\\" on \\"Seeds of Time\\" straight on through to the present and hear what, in my pretty full experience, is non-pareil - dauntingly tricky tunes that maintain a playful catchiness, so much so that the casual listener will never have to know that time signatures are all over the map - the listening is as challenging and enjoyable as the best Bartok or Stravinsky, but they swing and you can hum them while driving.<br /><br />Then the ensemble - though I am partial to the band with Kenny Wheeler and Julian Priester, Holland is the Mr. Spock of the musical mind-meld with his drummer, as well as the ego-less complement to his soloists and unerring counter-pointer in his band arrangements.  drummers Barry Altschul, staccato, driven and precise; and Jack DeJohnette, flowing, utterly free in the range of dynamics and locked into a pulse that allows him utter virtuosity such that the time signature disappears and re-emerges as if by magic, could not be more different.  Holland sounds like a twin of each, DeJohnette a prolific partner in countless contexts over the years.  Here, it is Altschul playing with such energy and obvious fun that one cannot fail to smile at his most spontaneous inventions, nor tap one's foot to his swing.  Oh yeah, this \\"free\\" music is my favorite example of how swing can breathe in the absence of conventional rhythm.<br /><br />Rivers is a revelation here, though his Blue Note recordings of the 60's were up there with the work of his more famous contempories. To this day he is a neglected paradigm unto himself, a wind-master whose re-emergence as a recording artist should not be missed; nearing 80 now, he is as hip then as any young cat, with a wisdom of the years and the chops of a prime genius.  Braxton - also a paradigm unto himself, is at many points in his career indecipherable and seemingly intentionally subversive of the basics of playing a horn and respecting a tune - yet he can at best be riveting.  Here, he is inspired, and in a rewarding partnership that, 30 years ago, may represent his most sympathetic context in which to sound out his spirit.<br /><br />Holland's playing is wonderful to the ear and to his bandmates, as described.  Important to aficionados of technique, dave's playing doesn't sacrifice the visceral WEIGHTof the bass sound, the way so many post-LaFaro players do. Holland works his magic, at any speed, at any level of spontaneous invention or complexity, with a rich, consistent and controlled technique and sound that does honor to Mingus, and that I dare say would have made the fiery taskmaster smile proudly.<br /><br />This album, along with Ornette Coleman's \\"Change of the Century\\" and Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" or \\"Meditations\\" is essential for anyone wanting to venture beyond the mainstream and have both a sturdy bridge to the tougher terrain and a reference standard for how the bravely avant-garde (\\"advance-guard\\", reconnaissance into uncharted teritory) should sound.of the bass sound, the way so many post-LaFaro players do.

B000002J27|4.0|OH, THEY SURE DON'T MAKE PROGRESSIVE ROCK THE WAY THEY USED TO! TRICK OF THE TAIL is one of the best GENESIS albums.PHIL<br />COLLINS really sounded wonderful on this and the next three<br />GENESIS albums, as a vocalist that is. His voice sounded so<br />natural in these acoustic settings and surroundings, it's a<br />shame he completely abandoned singing this type of music in<br />later years! About half of this album is GENESIS at their melo-<br />dic best.No other prog rock band could do the mellow, acoustic<br />stuff better than GENESIS did on this wonderful album. MY favor-<br />ite songs are the three mellow ones, ENTANGLED, RIPPLES and MAD<br />MAN MOON, and the heavy prog rocker that opens the album DANCE<br />ON A VOLCANO. The guitar playing is fabulous and the production<br />may be their best ever.DANCE is one of GENESIS'S most exciting<br />songs. TONY BANKS was also hitting his peak as a songwriter on<br />this album. The only two weak tracks, to me, are ROBBERY,ASSAULT<br />AND BATTERY and SQUONK. The latter has a mighty big guitar riff<br />in it, for GENESIS that is, but other than that it's not a very<br />exciting or interesting song.<br />  A GOOD ALBUM!
0471413909|4.0|The Paleo dietary theory is looking better and better as time passes.  I've been successfully losing weight by following principles similar to Cordain's, even before I read his book.  Cordain should be commended for defending a thesis that is politically incorrect on many levels.<br />The Paleo theory offends Creationists, because it assumes an evolutionary explanation for human origins and why our bodies seem to thrive better on hunter-gatherer foods than on \\"our daily bread.\\"  <br />It offends free-market zealots, because it implies a criticism of the way American capitalism produces the toxic waste it calls \\"food.\\"<br />It offends the charlatans in the weight-loss industry, who offer the simplistic explanation that Americans are getting obese because they are \\"eating too much,\\" instead of scientifically looking at the consequences of WHAT they are eating.<br />It offends the American medical and pharmaceutical industries, because it argues that a proper diet to prevent cancer, \\"Syndrome X,\\" and other degenerative diseases makes more sense than developing exorbitantly expensive (i.e., profitable) therapies and drugs to treat them after the fact.<br />It offends the social-engineering goody-goods (mostly on the Left) who had the government dictate carbohydrate-heavy nutritional guidelines to us which have proved disastrous in practice.<br />It offends vegans, because it argues that humans need to eat animals for optimum health.<br />It offends technological cornucopians of the Julian L. Simon school, because it challenges common beliefs about \\"progress,\\" and whether our planet can produce enough of the proper sorts of foods for human well-being.  Cordain points out that with current technology, only about ten percent of the world's population could be adequately sustained on a Paleo-compatible diet. Unfortunately, the world's impoverished billions have to take their chances with their suboptimal grain-based diet. <br />In light of this, about the only ideologues this theory doesn't offend are the neo-Malthusians who have been arguing all along that the world is way over-populated.  It's not often that a diet book presents a worldview radically at odds with the usual range of beliefs in our society.  Cordain's message deserves a wide and thoughtful hearing, for what is more important than our health and the food we eat?
6305358567|4.0|Actually,I give this movie 4 1/2 stars. It's not quite Peter O Toole's &quot;The Lion in the Winter.&quot; But it is not far behind. There is so much to be said for this movie. In today's techno world, where even some Shakespeare movies have given way to Hollywood, this is a masterfully done movie that relies on character development, a superb script, and beautiful scenery as opposed to effects. The movie grabs our attention right away with Bloody Mary's psychotic and ill use of power. Soon afterwards, we see Elizabeth's dangerous state. When Elizabeth survives her half sister and becomes queen, she sees that the game has only just started. She is faced with several decisions regarding her personal state as well as the state of England. One truth this movie reveals is that whatever the faults of her father King Henry VIII were, he was a strong and able king for those hard times. Many people seem to overlook the facts that King Henry VIII (1) Furthered constitutional governing, (2) Authorized the Bible's translation into English, (3) Built up England's navy very well, (4) Kept order in a hard time without any wars resulting, and (5) Satisfied Parliament by removing England from Rome's grip. (When he is spoken of, he is spoken of well.)It may help us to appreciate this movie more if we remember that Elizabeth's grandfather King Henry VII ended The War of the Roses; her father King Henry VIII, pulled England through the Reformation. And Bloody Mary quite undid the fine work of her father and grandfather. And it was up to Elizabeth to fix this. Another thing I must say about this movie is that the violent scenes are done well. Many movies tend to glorify in violence, and to make it worse, they add low humor at the so called 'bad guys' expense. THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE AT ALL! In this movie, it is clear that the violence is quite forced. It is not delighted in, and there is no low humor involved. Also, our attention is well kept between Elizabeth's personal emotional struggles as well as her struggles to restore England to the state her father and grandfather did. It is very tragic that the simplistic &quot;Shrek,&quot; special effects Sci Fi, low humor, no story action movies, or simplistic bood and guts movies tend to dominate the market. Yet this movie which is so masterfully done has a limited popularity.

0451169514|5.0|I never read Stephen King before, too much blood and gore {Carrie, Shining, etc.}  Then my son read IT.  He insisted I had to read it.  It has me hooked on certain Stephen King books.  If you don't read King, this is a must to show you he is a great writer of scary stories with great insight.  I have read most of his books now.  Dreamcatcher is on the same level.  Do not judge King on the moivies, books are far better.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is the funniest film that I have ever seen. The viewer must be in the right type of mindset when watching this film, or they will not get many of the subtle jokes hidden in the script.  Also, I recommend watching this at least several times to really pay attention to the details of the movie.
0140042520|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is interested in reading a book about the Beats. Kerouac's sense of humanity and ability to put it down on paper is amazing. Read this book if it's the only Kerouac book you will ever read! You won't be sorry!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple's 2nd album, the oddly titled \\"When the pawn\\" is one of those rare albums that come around about once per decade that subtly raises the bar on music.  Unluckily, Apple had the misfortune of creating one of the grandest pop albums during a time when boy bands and rap-metal were prospering.  Yet now all of a sudden, Vanessa Carlton, Michelle Branch, and Avril Lavigne emerge as popular artists.  Granted they are mere imitators, but to ignore Fiona's influence in the popularity of talent (or at least the appearance of talent) would be ignorant.  So in a way, Fiona has raised the bar, despite an incredibly strong current of bad music and bad attitudes about music fighting against her influence.   <br />\\"When the Pawn\\" is excellent on many levels in terms of many things- like all modern masterpieces in any art form- should be.  The lyrics to be found on When the Pawn seem to cover a wide variety of messages and viewpoints without ever commenting directly or changing the outward subject matter.  All the songs appear to be about failed relationships, but upon further notice, one can see that Apple is assessing many different aspects of the human condition.  For instance, \\"On the Bound\\" covers that overwhelmed feeling of knowing that the entire future is waiting...and who knows if she can handle it?  Will she be able to meet expectations, personally, romatically, in terms of success?  Big questions with no easy answers.  \\"To Your Love\\" is another song that appears to be more simplistic than it actually is.  \\"Please forgive me for my distance, the pain is evident in my existence\\" sings the chorus and for a while, we think that Fiona is referring to the same standard fear of intimacy found in Dr. Phil books.  Yet, there is a remarkable sadness to the song that one has to tap into through repeated listenings (and readings of the booklet).  During the uber-powerful bridge, Fiona sings lyrics like \\"My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon around you/but by the time i'm close to you, I lose my desideratum (desire),\\" and the realization occurs that Fiona is speaking not only about romantic intimacy, but about her inability to connect with people- how she tries to make a connection, and when she actually nears it, she loses her desire to.  It's powerful, sad, metaphorical yet direct.  <br />\\"Limp\\" the angriest song actually covers a wider terrain than one might immediately imagine.  Sexual metaphors thud and pop with Apple's voice. \\"You fondle my trigger then you blame my gun\\" she hisses in the verse.  Whether or not she is talking about the sexual mind games men and women play (especially in relation to feminism), or something else is up for interpretation.  But what is clear is that Fiona has greater lyrical (and even socio-political) ideas on her mind.  <br />The rest of the album's lyrics strike a similar chord of universality.  While this is a remarkably personal album, and certainly the lyrics are specific to Fiona, I think most people will be surprised by how much they relate to what she is saying.  <br />As for the music, it is as equally  complicated and multi-layered as the lyrics.  Jazz frequently edges up on her music.  As on the Phrygian structures during \\"To Your Love\\" \\"On the Bound\\" and \\"Fast As You Can\\" as well as her frequent use of minor7 and major 7 chords.  One can also not forget the extremely jazzy voice of hers- an improvising instrument in of itself.  During \\"Paper Bag\\" her voice leaps and swirls like a John Coltrane solo.  All of her songs seem to effortlessly connect jazz with pop and clearly some songs swing more to one side than the other.  \\"I know\\" is a nightclub song filled to the brim with quiet intensity, fitting for a night at the Blue Wisp.  While \\"The Way Things Are\\" covers more angst-ridden, almost Nirvana-ish terrain.  While other songs incorporate a third influence altogether like \\"Mistake\\" which proudly proclaims its blues influence with 1/4 chord structure, and an identical guitar solo to George Harrison's on \\"Yer Blues.\\"  If the lyrics seem layered and powerful enough, the music is right there shadowing the intensity.<br />Edgy, vulnerable, beautiful, intelligent are adjectives that can be ascribed to any aspect of Fiona- the woman, her lyrics, her music.  To miss out on When the Pawn would be an incredible misfortune to music lovers across the globe.  Its greatness can't be aptly described in an Amazon.com review, but Fiona has proven herself a musical genius with a lot of artistic ideas to share- and plenty more to come hopefully with her long awaited 3rd album in tow.  Couldn't recommend any contemporary album more than this one.
B00005NWM3|4.0|With a huge success from \\"How You remind Me,\\" Nickelback have shot from the west coast of Canada to being a big name in music today. Here's the track breakdown for \\"Silver side Up\\":<br />1. Never Again: A song about domestic violence. This is the most   pissed off I've ever heard these guys. 9/10<br />2. How You Remind Me: The single that launched them to the top of the charts. Need I say more? 10/10<br />3. Woke up this morning: Love the guitar solo here. Fairly good rock song. 9/10<br />4. Too Bad: The next single. A bit angrier than How You Remind Me,     but still as catchy. 10/10<br />5. Just For: Really Hard, and doesn't that opening guitar sound kinda like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"? 8/10<br />6. Hollywood: Nothing really stands out here, I usually skip this.  6/10.<br />7. Money Bought: Some great lines in this one. 8/10<br />8. Where Do I Hide: My personal fave. Harder than the singles, but  Nickelback sounds better like this. 10/10<br />9. Hangnail: My second fave on the CD, for all the same reasons as the first. 10/10<br />10. Good Times Gone: A switch to slow rock , but still as good as  the rest of the songs. This features Ian Thornley, the lead singer of Big Wreck, on guitar. 9/10<br />In general, if you buy this CD for \\"How You Remind Me\\", you may be in for a bit of a surprise. However, if you can stand harder music, this is a good album.
B000002MFQ|5.0|This follow-up album to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; is spectacular.  The songs on this album are the greatest yet.  Pay particular attention for songs such as, &quot;Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Altered State&quot;, and &quot;The Bell.&quot;  These songs are not only catchy, but the harmonizing with multiple instruments in these songs is excellent.  Instruments used are very obscure, yet they all sound great when put together.  A must-have for any New Age, Progressive, or Alternative fan.
B00005RDSM|5.0|Classic. Must buy for any toddler/kid collection. Excellent story rendition, animation, music.
B00005YTFG|3.0|I found two faults with this movie, both are the directors.  I did not understand why everyone was trying so hard to please the Duke.  It seemed odd to me that the owner of such a sucessful club would all but give it away just to get someone to invest in a show.  Then I watched the out takes.  Cut from the movie is about 15 or 20 seconds that sets up the story and explains everything that is to follow.  That 20 seconds could not have been that important to the running time. It is vital that you see this or the movie won't make sense.<br />My second problem is with Mr McGregger.  He is a fine actor, but the man is not a singer. He can however yell very loudly off key.  Why was a roll with so much music, given to someone who can not  sing ?  I also wondered why his voice was so much louder than EVERYTHING else going on around him.  If having him play that part was so vital they could have dubbed the singing, or at the very least lowered his volume.<br />I liked the movie, once I understood what was going on.  I suggest that you watch the out takes at the end first.  Then watch the movie, you'll understand it better. Oh yeah, keep hold of the volume control to turn it down a little when Mr. McGregger sings.
B00005T30L|5.0|Probably the best praise I can offer for \\"Ghost World,\\" directed by Terry Zwigoff, is that the film had me laughing heartily from the start nearly to the end. Yes, it's a great comedy. But it's also a surprisingly melancholy and touching character study that is graced with superb performances by an excellent cast.<br />\\"Ghost World\\" tells the story of Enid (played by Thora Birch) and her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johannson), recent high school grads who are struggling through this transitional phase in their lives. Early in the film the girls, who scorn much of \\"mainstream\\" society, play a cruel joke on an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi). But what begins as a joke leads into a quirky, engaging relationship between Seymour and Enid. The main story is well complemented by some equally quirky subplots, all of which blend together to form an effective larger story.<br />\\"Ghost World\\" is filled with witty, funny, irony-laden dialogue. And these great words are delivered with flair by the wonderful cast. Birch really shines as an offbeat leading lady; her performance has bite, but she's also appealing and vulnerable. Johannson complements her well as pal Rebecca, and Ileana Douglas is a lot of fun as Enid's politically conscious summer school art teacher. And I can't say enough good things about Steve Buscemi as Seymour. He takes what could have been a stereotypical antisocial loser and instead brings real depth and humanity to the character.<br />The great script and performances are well enhanced by thoughtful, inventive production details; \\"Ghost World\\" is almost as much fun to look at as it is to listen to. This is a really outstanding film that effectively deals with such universal issues as alienation, nonconformity, friendship, and the transition to young adulthood.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Believe me, the first time I listened to this CD... I was bored out of my mind. It was really surprising how different this was from the rest of Incubus' records. Be warned; this CD is much more softer then what you would expect from Incubus, however, it soon grows on you after listening to it for a while. If you can appreciate this new sound Incubus is offering, then you will definently love this record. <br />1. Nice to know you 10/10 (My 2nd fav song)<BR>2.

I think that Morning View is definently worth buying. Just be open minded and appreciate this cd for what it is. Once it grows on you, you'll realize how beautiful this music really is.
B000055ZB8|3.0|An unsettling masterpiece that seemingly is without origin. It says 1922, but it could easily be 1522.  There is an incredible attention to cinematic narrative and detail - all with static shots -- and the screen's creepiest Dracula.  Sadly, I agree with the others.  The organ score is bland and detracts from the horror, while words like &quot;doofus&quot; and &quot;cheesy&quot; are apt words for the modern soundtrack (the best way to imagine how it'll sound in 20 years is to think of what a &quot;modern&quot; soundtrack from the 70s would sound like now).  Years ago, there was a VHS version that had the perfect soundtrack, which was seemingly composed with an organ that came from the same murky past as the movie itself. The movie isn't the same without it.
B000021YQV|5.0|I can't stress enough how great this CD is. Litterally every song is great... and on top of that, there are a lot of them. Unfortunately, some are VERY short and seem rushed. But in the end, the record just can't be any more awesome then it already is. System of a Down is one of my favorite bands, just behind Linkin Park, ADEMA, and Korn.<br />My favorite songs would have to be Chop Suey, Forest, Shimmy, Phycho, and Deer Dance.<br />The sound is hard, fast and loud and the lyrics are equally awesome. <br />If you like this type of sound, then you definently HAVE to own toxicity. Trust me, its worth every penny.
0679729895|5.0|Roald Dahl is at the peak of his powers in this collection.  For anyone who knows him only as the author of the Willy Wonka books--or who thinks of him purely as a children's book author--this is the book to change your mind and make you think admiringly about Dahl's considerable powers as an adult writer.<br />The book is comprised of gem after gem.  Two of Dahl's most famous stories are here.  One is \\"Lamb to the Slaughter,\\" about the wife of a police detective who kills her husband in a most unconventional way and then disposes of the murder weapon in a manner that would make any criminal proud.  The other, \\"Nunc Dimittis,\\" describes the lengths to which a society smoothie goes for revenge.  <br />Dahl's descriptive powers are basic, but his imagination is limitless.  He manages to calmly, smoothly pull you into his stories and make the most outrageous things seem perfectly in keeping and perfectly normal--while still just a bit askew.  <br />The stories are all vintage Dahl.  Each has elements of the macabre and the grotesque, couched in the comfortable trappings of middle-class life: marriage, tidy houses, bills, resentment, secrets, tidy houses, and so on.  Dahl pulls off the neat trick of making the macabre laughable, though--he's not trying to scare the reader as much as make us shout with laughter and recognition and then settle back to enjoy a shiver of anticipation.  In \\"William and Mary,\\" the terminally ill narrator is propositioned by a neurosurgeon friend to give his brain up for experimentation after death.  Despite the gruesome details, the story is hilarious:<br />\\" . . . So when I get you on the table I will take a saw, a small oscillating saw, and with this I shall proceed to remove the whole vault of your skull.  You'd still be unconscious at that point so I wouldn't have to bother with anaesthetic.\\"<br />\\"Like hell you wouldn't,\\" I said.<br />\\"You'd be out cold, I promise you that, William.  Don't forget you DIED just a few minutes before.\\"<br />\\"Nobody's sawing off the top of my skull without an anaesthetic,\\" I said.<br />Dahl doesn't get any better than this!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Like some people, I always thought of Britney Spears (and still do!)as terribly overrated, especially when it comes to bubblegum songs, and lyrics overloaded with cliches that many people have heard in other songs before. But, I thought I'd take my chances buying this record, because of the club favorite \\"I'm A Slave 4 U,\\" and you know what? I actually enjoyed this album! Even though my statement about the lyrics remains true on this album (-one star). Blood flowing songs such as \\"Lonely,\\" \\"Overprotected,\\" \\"I Love Rock & Roll,\\" electronic-crazy \\"What It's Like To Be Me,\\" and sweet innocent lullabys \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" and \\"That's Where You Take Me,\\" shows that Britney deserves a little more respect.
B000000Y2R|5.0|No serious libary of jazz recordings could possibly do without this one, and if one had to buy, say, only ten records, it would be hard to give it a miss. To me, none of the five musicians ever played better and more excitingly than on this occasion, and the music is both stirring and profoundly moving. I remember that until I first heard this, many, many years ago, I had not actually been a Parker \\"fan\\". He had always struck me as brilliant, clever, inventive, etc. - but generally just too intense. Also, many of the early tracks are too short for my taste. But here you hear \\"Bird\\" truly on fire in a way which is still intense, but not as exhausting as sometimes, as he has more time to develop his stunning solos. I still think that there is no better way to hear Parker than on this record, and it would be worth buying just for him. But all the others are great too: Dizzy tearing away with tremendous wit, suppleness and intelligence; Bud Powell marvellously \\"jazzy\\" and profound; and the other two crackling along in a melting pot that is a perfect fusion (before \\"fusion\\" as a genre came to torment us). Highlights? Difficult to choose, but \\"A Night in Tunisia\\" never sounds better than here, great tune though it is anyway, and \\"Hothouse\\" is an immensely moving theme, conceived - and here executed - with great originality. There are some other records probably as good (e.g. \\"Kind of Blue\\") - but I doubt they come better than this, recorded on what turned out to be a very special musical occasion resulting in a real treat.
