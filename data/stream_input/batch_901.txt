B0015DROBO|5.0|This book has satisfying character development and fascinating characters, insight into Swedish culture and socialism, a complex plot, and situations you come to care about.  Best of all, novel 2 is just about to be published - a posthumous gift from the author! EXCELLENT!  Number two is just as good.

0440241030|4.0|Reacher's back and this time it's personal....no, wait a minute. It's always personal and oh yeah, with a vengence. Hey, let's face it, Jack Reacher is our new action hero. Bigger than life, better than the bad guys and able to leap tall plots in a single bound but that's what we want and that's what we expect with the series.<br />  If you're true fan the book won't disappoint. If you're a marginal fan you may whine a little asking 'How can he do this or that when others can't?' It's simple: he's Jack Reacher.<br />  Like John Wayne, Jack Bauer, Obi Wan, Dirty Harry, Chuck Norris and Rambo Jack Reacher looms larger than life and should, quite frankly, in an escapist thriller. It's fast, furious, action packed and with an assortment of bad guys (this time it's a host of Mercenaries) that Reacher takes on.<br />  A NY Times critic gave a backhanded compliment to Lee Child saying he's 'The best thriller writer of the moment.' Yeah, well it's book ten in this series that runs into the bestselling category so the moment seems to have some staying power.<br />  It's a thriller folks with a noteworthy lead character and like our other action heroes I'm guessing we'll soon see Jack Reacher on the big screen.<br />  THE HARD WAY is a good thriller. Whether it's Child's 'Best' in the series is something only you can determine and usually only after you've read the others.<br />  A good read.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I am a 49 year old artist and cartoonist. There are only 4 graphic novels that hold a place of honor amongst the dusky confines of my towering alchemical library. THE DARKNIGHT, THE CROW, V FOR VENDETTA, and WATCHMEN. My anthology of the WATCHMEN comics is a Limited Edition Hardbound Original that was purchased upon its publication as a novel from the Sci Fi Book Club back in the 80s. I have not read the novel in many years. I felt that maybe I should before viewing the film. But, I'm grateful that I did not. I wanted a fresh perspective on the story and the film. And, I felt that reading the novel again might provide too much distraction with detailed comparisons in the differences between the novel and the film. I wanted Zack Synder's WATCHMEN to wash over me as a stand alone piece of art, so that I might fairly assess its narrative power as a film. And wash over me it did. Like a bloody mushroom cloud!<br /><br />This film packs a visceral one-two punch. I don't remember the novel making quite the same impression on me. (I'm skimming thru the novel again for the first time in over ten years.) To be fair, film is a more visually impressive medium to begin with. So, comparisons to the value of a film over its graphic source is rather moot IMO. Both should be judged under different aesthetic guidelines. Both the novel and the film are INCREDIBLE pieces of work!<br /><br />Why Alan Moore refused to include his name on the credits of WATCHMEN, as well as The Wachowskis' brilliant retelling of V FOR VENDETTA, is beyond me. For the second time Moore's work has received a masterful treatment on the themes and philosophical overtones of his fictional sensibilities. This film is just as thoughtfully and lovingly crafted as was V FOR VENDETTA. I think that Moore owes these filmmakers his gratitude instead of any derision or scorn that he may have directed at these films. Two of humanity's most important literary achievements have now become important literary films. I know of only 3 that have never strayed far from the author's original intent. All are based on graphic novels. The above mentioned graphic novels, and Frank Miller's 300. (Although a great film, I felt the DARK KNIGHT strayed wildly from the novel.) Score TWO great graphic novel films for Zack Synder. Nice work, Zack! Another gorgeous comic book brought to stunning realization! It is fairly obvious that a filmmaker that choses to film a graphic novel already has a storyboard to work from. Conceptualization is already realized in the form of the artistically rendered panels of the novel. The visual style of the author's storytelling language is already in place. This is probably why these films work so well. And this film works gangbusters!<br /><br />Beautiful production design, costumes, and special effects. (Be aware, the film violence is far more graphic than the novel's.)<br /><br />The performances are flawless. Especially Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Holy Dark Night of The Soul, Batman, is this a powerful performance! Pitch Perfect! Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan is wonderfully bored, stoic, and reserved. And, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian is all too human and entirely out of control. A wonderful job by the rest of this great cast.<br /><br />What is not touched on enough about Moore's stories, that have been made into films, are the very themes that confront us RIGHT NOW as human beings living on this planet. V FOR VENDETTA and WATCHMEN are filled with far more philosophical questions, than answers. Moore's warnings about a harsh reality looming in our near future were penned way back in the 80s. They are now clobbering us right in the kisser. Time is running out for this world. (Symbolized by the watchmaker and the doomsday clock in WATCHMEN.) The abuse of power and technology, crime, terrorism, moral bankruptcy, dwindling energy and natural resources, corporate control, push button annihilation, and the unstoppable cause and effect juggernaut of man's self-destructive nature. Is conservative libertarian vigilance justification for anarchy or the death of innocents? Do the needs and rights of the many outweigh the needs and rights of the few? \\"Moral ambiguities.\\" (This was the original title of my review until I saw it flash across the screen in the Special Features Section. Apparently, I drew the only conclusion that Moore and the filmmakers intended me to have. Bravo!) If you want to make an omelet, you have to break a few eggs. Or do you? Do the few, with power over the many, have the right to decide who lives and who dies on a planet that is living on borrowed time? Everyone will draw a different philosophical conclusion for themselves after being confronted with the moral questions posed by the brilliant WATCHMEN. (and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.) Personally, I think that I side with Rorschach. I find it frightening to live in a world where the powerful few, have so much control over my destiny, and, where the masses are dissolving into one ugly self-serving carnivorous beast. Who's side are you on?<br /><br />WATCHMEN is heady, mature, violent, and tendentious stuff! A great great film based on a great great novel!<br /><br />My advice to those that have not read the novel: do the contrary. See the film, then read the novel.<br /><br />Enjoy.rvative libertarian vigilance justification for anarchy or the death of innocents?

0547995660|5.0|This story is set many generations in the future. The world described is in some ways like our own, but in many ways different. Jonas, the hero of the story, lives in a commune where life seems ideal. Each person has his place in the group and knows exactly what is expected of him. What is demanded rarely seems too much. The physical needs of each person are met and nobody goes hungry or homeless. The way people dress, the things they own and the houses they live in have conformity, so nobody is jealous or thinks overly much of themselves. People's mental well-being is looked after by rituals such as the evening \\"Telling of Feelings\\" and the morning \\"Telling of Dreams\\". In this apparently model world Jonas is eleven and waiting the December ceremony when he, and all his year, will officially become twelve. At that ceremony each child will be allotted a new role, which will be their career for life. As Twelves they will undergo an apprenticeship for that career, though their schooling will also continue. Jonas finds it hard to describe exactly how he feels about the coming ceremony. Will the Elders choose a career that is right for him? What will it be? Will he be a success at the task, or will he fail, as some do?<br /><br />This is a very interesting and exciting book, which encourages the reader to think about the society in which he or she lives. Is the way our society does things right? In what ways could it be improved? Of course in countries like Israel and Russia people have really experimented with living in communes. Were they successes and in what ways were they failures?<br /><br />The first half of the story rolls along at a leisurely but stimulating pace as we get to know Jonas' family, friends and world. In the second half the pace quickens as we are confronted with some emotional facts about the way the commune really works. These truths lead to exciting developments and a very well written climax.<br /><br />Jonas is described well as a character and he comes across as a quite ordinary boy who in many ways is much like us. The book demonstrates how ordinary people, when they act on their conviction, can become 'heroes' without really meaning to. The character of the old man, called The Giver, is also drawn quite well. In his personality we see someone who has born much pain, has thought much about what is right, and yet who in many ways is powerless to make changes for the good. Right answers are not always easy to come upon.<br /><br />This book can be read by children eleven and up, though I must point out that it covers issues which may be disturbing to the less mature. This would be a fine book for a school report as it contains much to be discussed and is at the same time a delight to read. This book is a winner of the American Library Association's Newberry Medal.he comes across as a quite ordinary boy who in many ways is much like us.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|It is pretty sad that some people don't realize how good director Dick Donner is.  First Superman film is classic, unfortunally he couldn't keep on the gig.  What is important to realize from this version is that, even when is FAR from been finished, Donner treats viewers with respect and not like morons instead of Lester; I mean, c'mon!:  Magic Kiss, celophan S, Pink bears on the floor?.  Don't get me wrong, I did loved Superman II when I was a little boy, but now that I see the Donner version, I can tell you right here and now that it is WAAAY superior.<br /><br />Brando was completely necessary on the story given that, even in comics, it is Jor-El whom is more attached to Superman than Lara.  I saw in other review that Brando's acting on this part was flat and lack of humanity... well, guess what: Jor-El is not human!!.  Not even half of it like his son. He is more a Demi-god with advance understanding of things and problems, and that's why he had to be a little dry, however the story is so well written that I couldn't avoid to feel a little sad when he say good bye to his son.<br /><br />Ladies and gentlement, THIS is how a Superman movie must be made.  Not the original Superman II nor even the long boring Superman Returns is as good as Donner incompleted non-budget version.<br /><br />This is a must have!!!.
B0013XW2F4|5.0|A must-read for anyone seeking to be an educated, well read person with a good understanding of our literary culture.  My father bought me this book some 50 years ago, when I was a young teen.  I read and re-read the stories, especially on \\"dark and stormy nights,\\" in front of a blazing fire.  The binding eventually failed, pages were lost, but I was astounded to find the SAME edition in the Doubleday volume -- same typeface, paper, everything!  So I bought a new one for myself, and one for my son.  I envy him, discovering 223-B Baker Street for himself.  \\"Come, Watson, come!  The game is afoot!\\"
0061139378|5.0|Neil Gaiman has a knack for young adult fiction - his [[ASIN:0060530928 The Graveyard Book]] is an imaginitive re-working of Kipling; in _Coraline_, he similarly shines.<br /><br />Young Coraline is bored in her new house, her parents ignore her, and the people who have apartments in the house are all old and a bit nutty.  Then Caroline finds a secret door that takes her to \\"her other mother.\\"  Think _The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe_ with a gothic, sinister twist and you're close to the mark.  Initially Caroline is smitten with her \\"other family\\" - until she begins to pay closer attention to her surroundings.<br /><br />Gaiman's target audience here seems to be the 8 - 13 year-old set - as a previous reviewer mentioned, its horror writing without the gore, hence its age appropriateness.  I'm sure this scares the bejesus out of them.  For older readers such as myself, there is also much to enjoy here, from Gaiman's witty dialogue (the exchanges between Caroline and the cat were a favorite) to the clever story line.  Its a quick read at just over 160 pages, but an entertaining one nonetheless.

B0019IB0II|3.0|Dr. Taylor embarked on her academic journey seeking to discover the organic cause of schizophrenia, the disease that tormented her brother. Well into the research phase of her career, Dr. Taylor's brain experienced an organic failure of its own.<br /><br />The story of her experience and recovery was interesting enough, and her thoughts regarding in effect volitionally rewiring the brain to think positively have a grain of truth.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor's stroke caused organic damage that left her with what was in many ways a blank brain slate. I did not begin to understand the cellular dynamic that allowed Dr. Taylor's brain to heal.  But I do know that not all organic mental health disease - which we may discover some day is all mental health disease - can be vanquished by an act of will.<br /><br />Dr. Taylor was in  a unique position to do a forensic examination of her versus her brothers' non-volitional organic brain illness.  The workings of the brain are as much a mystery to us today as the workings of the body were 200 years ago, and perhaps she didn't address it because she just doesn't know.  But \\"I don't know\\" is a totally acceptable answer - sometimes the most important thing is to ask the question.
1400049628|5.0|While this book is generally listed as a \\"humor\\" book, it's important to note that the humor doesn't lie in a series of jokes or off kilter dialog but solely in the dry, serious manner in which Mr. Brooks presents his material.  While I'm usually not a fan of parody, this form of it kept me turning the page until I was done (at which point I promptly got up and ordered World War Z by the same author which is, if anything, almost a sobering political and interpersonal critique as presented through the context of a zombie apocalypse).    I have to admit, I may carry a bias on this subject, ever since I was 7 years old and snuck downstairs to watch \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" on television one night (and then promptly ran into my parents room nearly in tears) I've been avidly hooked on zombie movies.  I've gone out of my way to watch EVERYTHING zombie related I can get my hands on, from the massive blockbuster hits and artistic masterpieces like Dawn of the Dead and Lucio Fulci's \\"Zombi\\" to the most obscure (usually absolutely laughably bad) such as Burial Ground and even books, comics (Walking Dead is brilliant) and other related media.  As such, when I read this book it was from the perspective of someone who's been avidly immersed in zombie lore from the time he could first say \\"they're coming to get you Barbara\\".  I can't say for certain it would hold the same appeal to someone who isn't as into zombie lore as I am.    What I can say for certain though is this is an extensively well thought out book detailing every nuance of anything you'd ever need to know to deal effectively, safely and efficiently with an invasion of the living dead.  Even if one isn't a zombie fanatic as I am, I honestly can't imagine anyone not being taken aback by the organization, conception, and research that has clearly gone into it's creation.    Truly Mr. Brooks, you've offered up a parodic masterpiece in this work, kudo's to you and my most fervent recommendation to anyone who hasn't hadthe pleasure of leafing through this work.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|Hello everyone! This is my first review so bear with me.    I just got the Watchmen Night Owl Ship Edition today in the mail (only took 4 days from the release date to my house in Minnesota) and I am very pleased!    I was a little disappointed on the size of ship which is smaller then I thought but is not a reason to re-consider. I do not recommend people to get this unless they are DIE HARD fans like I am. If you are just buying this as a person that liked the movie, just pick up the normal 2 disc blu-ray edition.    The ship's detail is VERY great. It does not have an interior (I expected that) because of the lights inside. When the lights are lit on the water, it glows a tinge of blue that is great.     Another downside to the product is that the discs aren't in a real Blu-Ray case. They are in thick, plastic - like, sleeves. For me that is disappointing because I have a collection of Blu-Ray's and I want to add to it with this great film. But a small price to pay for this great product.    Now the actual Blu-Ray is VERY good! Only thing I disliked is that it doesn't start on an actual \\"menu\\" but just commences the original Director's Cut. You may bring up the sub-menu though.    The maximum mode for the film is great! It does behind the scenes on the entire film with Zach Snyder, comic book comparisons and storyboards! I am watching it now and I am very impressed!    And the film itself is breathtaking! Every scene is so vibrant and fresh! It follows the graphic novel so well too! It also looks INCREDIBLE on Blu-Ray.    If you are a big fan of this film get this edition today!
0765340798|4.0|The final book in the trilogy ties up all the loose ends. In this one, we see how the Bene Gesserit started their breeding programs, how mentats came about, and the beginnings of the Spacing Guild. Unlike the previous books in the trilogy, this one picks up speed at about half way through the book. There are a number of stories which must be brought to their conclusion. The ending of this book leaves open the possibility of continuing the story surrounding Omnius and Erasmus. I believe they will make an appearance in Dune 7 and 8. Like the previous books in the series, this one lacks the \\"feel\\" of the original Dune novels, but it still makes for good sci-fi reading

B000YABIQ6|4.0|I am late getting on the \\"Mad Men\\" bandwagon. After watching the entire first season (devouring it more is more like it) I can now see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />\\"Mad Men\\" is a period piece; the period portrayed being the advertising world of New York in the early 19060's. Like any good period piece, the costumes, sets, tone, etc. are all faithful to the time period which it is supposed to be set (as far as I can tell). However, also like any good period piece, the characters, fleshed out and fully human, show that no matter how much things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />The characters in \\"Mad Men\\" are all playing the hands they've been dealt. It's entertaining to watch the men of agency Sterling-Cooper enjoying the privileges of being white, male, and professional at the time: at the office they smoke like chimneys, drink like fish, and are free to sexually harass the hell out of every female in the vicinity. However, the series quickly goes beneath that surface to show the complexity behind that seemingly chauvinistic situation. Many of the men, despite all their bravado, are mostly frightened babies, often buckling under the pressures of professional and family life. And many of the women, although seemingly submissive, expertly manipulate their situations to their advantage. Nothing is ever quite as it seems.<br /><br />Even when it ventures into sensationalistic territory, \\"Mad Men\\" always maintains an air of dignity that keeps it from devolving into the sad state of many \\"edgy\\" cable shows, where the need to shock is constantly overpowering the need for believable character development. I'm hoping that the series continues to take the high road and continue to develop these fascinating characters for years to come.

B001GM28HO|5.0|I tend to steer away from buying top 40 and stuff everyone else knows.  There are many indie artists more deserving of our money.  But, here we have to most absurd, perplexing, and insanely fun recording by whoever Lady Gaga is... and I love it.  I only broke down to give a better listen and to purchase because she did something most artists should do... she sang.  Like, did some how is this going to work style acoustic covers of what I assume are her hits from this album.  THAT is when I realized this is not the daughter of [[ASIN:B0000004YR Samantha Fox]], and she actually has talent.<br /><br />I have to investigate, but isn't there some connection between Lady and Rhianna? (however the heck you spell her name)  Maybe not.  I just remember seeing the two names together somewhere.  Maybe a scary duet.  Who knows.  Well. actually, Rhanoonie is a perfect example of what is wrong with this failed music industry.  If it were not for the mega Rhininninoo production team, brilliant marketing, clever fake scandalizations, and the glory of a technologically advanced vocoder systems, Rinnho would not have a career.  I say this with uninvited experience.  Rhino opened for a concert I went to during the time she stole Tainted Love and murdered that song about murder.  What I heard was scary and I could have swore kittens were being tortured backstage.  And of course, she pointed the mike toward the audience so we could sing for her because she cannot, I guess.  ... anyway... I say all this as Lady Gaga is quite a surprise, but showing us she is more than a T&A lure.<br /><br />Each song is perfect in a sense that nothing is taken seriously, has a bit of a bite, a little naughty, has a good beat and you can dance to it kinda thing.  My housework has never been done so quickly for quite a while as I dance with my vacuum.  And rides to work feed my humming for the day.  So, if you are a fan or new to her as I am, go to \\"that\\" video site and search her name and the word \\"acoustic\\".  There are a few songs she does completely stripped down to her actual voice.

0307588335|1.0|The only \\"colossal failure\\" is this guy's hairpiece and his inflated sense of self-worth. The guy was a 40+ year old VP. Typically, VPs on Wall Street are 10-15 years younger. Besides the recent college graduates, VPs are the most junior people on a trading desk.     The guy would have had no contacts with any senior executives at Lehman and certainly knew no one at the Federal Reserve or Treasury who ultimately decided the fate of the company.     It's doubtful he was \\"one of the most consistently profitable\\" traders at Lehman given his 4 years of experience at the firm. And if he was such a successful trader, why wasn't he retained after the merger?     In effect, this book is a shameless grab for attention from an individual who was too junior to have the least bit of insight into the demise of Lehman. Buy the book if you want to help the author get a new toupee, otherwise please save your money.
B000A0GP18|4.0|\\"The Longest Yard\\" (2005 Version) is a remake to the original \\"The Longest Yard\\" released in 1974 that starred Burt Reynolds. This time around, comedian Adam Sandler replaces Reynolds in this good remake. \\"The Longest Yard\\" also stars Chris Rock, Nelly, James Cromwell, William Foryster, & Burt Reynolds making a return & having a significant role in the movie as well. The movie also has a great deal of former NFL players & WWE wrestlers to portray certain roles in the film such as Michael Irvin, Bob Sapp, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, & Bill Goldberg among others.    The movie starts out with Paul Crewe (Sandler), a former NFL MVP pro quarterback star suspended indefinitely due to shaving points off a football game, goes on a huge wrecking spree as he (while intoxicated) crashes his girlfriend's car while on a big police chase from the cops. This little wrecking spree would indeed send Crewe to Allenville Prison.    While in prison, Warden Hazan (James Cromwell) asks Crewe to be the quarterback for his semi-pro guards football team to win back the championship. Crewe rejects the offer at first & would be given a hard time from the warden until Crewe agrees to do anything that the warden wants. After spending a week in the hot box, the warden gives Crewe another chance to be the quarterback for the guards, however, Crewe comes up with an idea for the guards to have a warm-up game against the inmates before the season starts with Crewe being the quarterback for the inmates. Crewe then gets Caretaker (Rock) & Nate Scarborough (Reynolds) to help him recruit the meanest, ruthless, & biggest inmates for his team.    At first, the inmates only joins the team to get revenge on the guards for the hard time they recieved from the guards while doing their time in prison but as time goes on they earn the respect of each other. When it comes to game day, Crewe just plays the game for the warden but as the game goes on, Crewe realizes he wants to win not only the game but also friendship from his team of inmates. When it is all set & done, Crewe, along with his team of inmates, gets the best of the guards & Warden Hazan.     \\"The Longest Yard\\" is a very good remake in contrast to the 1974 original. Though not the greatest football movie, it still holds that football feel to it & is a good movie to view sometime. I recommend this purchase.
0439023483|3.0|The story told in this book is wonderful, captivating, and emotionally involving. I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters, and I loved the action and suspense. My one problem is this: the premise of this book the \\"Hunger Game\\" itself is almost identical, in purpose and actuality, to the \\"the Program\\" of Battle Royale a book which takes place in an alternate version of Japan. Though the results of the \\"game\\" are ultimately different (from what I remember) than those in Battle Royale, the idea that the game was the basically the same didn't sit well with me. I am, however, planning on reading the second book, with hopes that it will have a more original premise.   Ultimately I recommend this book, just keep in mind that it 100% original, and if you like definitely look into Battle Royale.

B00288KNLS|5.0|I was looking forward to this as soon as it hit tehatres. Unfortunately my busy scehdule prevented me from getting to see it and oh how I regret it. Coraline, directed by Henry Selick (of Nightmare Before Christmas, and James and the Giant Peach fame)is an amazing journey of one lonely, misunderstood, and grossly ignored young lady, who find's everything she's ever wanted in \\"Other World.\\" \\"Other World\\" is a mirror image of our own world that Coraline finds one night behind a wallpapered door, that had been bricked up when che discovered it earlier in the day. In this world there are \\"Other\\" versions of all the people she has just recently known, except with one difference, they are overly attentive to Coraline (even getting her name right, which no one , save for her parents can get right), and they all have black buttons for eyes. That is the first hint that something is very wrong with this place. But \\"Other Mother\\" is very convincing with her sweet personality, and amazing cooking abilities.<br />It isn't long that Coraline finds out exactly whats going on and the journey takes a rather dark turn, with dark parodies of the entertaining beings the \\"others\\" once were. Henry Selick is a stop motion GOD, and he trully excelled here. This film surpasses his past efforts, with a story based on the superbly talented Neil Gaiman, it's an instant classic.<br />HOWEVER this movie is NOT for little children. You know your kids best, but this movie has some really disturbing imagery, and the Button eyes are the least of it.<br />Finally the 3D version really pops. I personally have never been a fan of 3D as it utes the colors too much except for a few (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow), but wow do the colors that show glow. And let's not even start on the craziness of the effects. Needles, ramps, mice, cotton candy, and more come flying at you and it just gets better. Definitely a keeper. I can watch this ANYTIME!
B0026RHR6K|1.0|There's still another minisode and a movie coming out... this is not the complete series by any means.  Save your money and wait for xmas imo.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|These guys simply rock! They're not you're typical gothic band. There are too many metal bands that boasts a female vocalist. However, very few make my list of \\"Godess\\" status and is soley based on merit of the singer and the overall quality of music produced. Epica sticks with the same winning formula and the result if pure majestic. The growly male vocals does add a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" contrast to a lovely operatic voice. Well worth the purchase, in my opinion.
0060922583|5.0|This is an interesting book by an author who passionately believes that existence and physical reality perceived through consciousness is generated by a holographic phenomenon. In other words the holographic universe creates reality. This book is described in three parts; the first part describes the central concepts of physicist David Bohm and neurophysiologist Karl Pribram. The second and third part of the book does an exhaustive review of the work of many psychologists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and neurobiologists who have expressed strong support for Bohm-Pribram holographic concept to explain phenomena such as; near death experience, out of body experience, telepathy, ESP, etc.<br /><br />The summary of this book is as follows: The holographic concept is a form of quantum mysticism extrapolated from two theories. One due to David Bohm who proposed that the universe and physical reality is a holographic structure; and the second due to Karl Pribram who proposed that consciousness perceives reality through the holographic structure. The holographic paradigm is rooted in the concept that all organisms and forms of matter are holograms embedded within one universal hologram. A hologram is two-dimensional photographic pattern of interference between coherent light reflected from the object of interest, and light that comes directly from the same source or reflected by a mirror. When this two-dimensional image is illuminated from behind by coherent light, a three-dimensional image of the object appears in space, but without illumination the image appears as blur. The characteristic of a perfect hologram is that all its content is contained in any finite part of itself: If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser, each half will still be found to contain the entire image of the rose. Indeed, even if the halves are divided again, each snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original image. The reductive or deterministic approach doesn't work, which means that components or parts doesn't make the whole. Bohm used this analogy to explain quantum entanglement where the separated quantum particles \\"communicate\\" with each other regardless of the distance separating them, which is a direct contradiction of special theory of relativity. Bohm suggested that particles remain in contact with one another because at deeper level these particles are not individual entities, but extensions of the same fundamental reality; the separation is a mere illusion. This phenomenon is illustrated by \\"Bohm's aquarium.\\" Imagine an aquarium containing a fish, which you can not see directly, but this can be seen indirectly from two television cameras, one directed at the aquarium's front and the other directed to its side. As you stare at the two television monitors, you might assume that the fish on each of the screens are separate fishes, because the cameras are set at right angles, and the two images are different. But as you continue to watch you will notice that when one turns, the other also turn; when one faces the front, the other always faces toward the side at right angle. From this you will conclude that the two fishes are instantaneously communicating with one another, but we know that it is not so. Bohm suggested that this is precisely what is going on between the particles in quantum entanglement.<br /><br />In a holographic universe time and space are no longer viewed as fundamentals, because concepts such as location and time breaks down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate (as in quantum entanglement described above). At its deeper level reality is a sort of super-hologram in which the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. Support for Bohm's quantum physical ideas came from unexpected sources when neurophysiologist Karl Pribram invoked holographic model to explain memories, which are dispersed throughout the brain. Pribram suggested memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image. In other words brain itself is a hologram. Pribram's theory also explains how the human brain can store so many memories in so little space. A human brain memorizes of the order of 10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime. How does brain translates the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses (light frequencies, sound frequencies, electro-chemical potentials, and so on) into the concrete world of our perceptions? Pribram argues that encoding and decoding frequencies is best performed by a hologram. Just as a hologram functions as a sort of lens, a translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent image, Pribram believes the brain also comprises a lens and uses holographic principles to mathematically convert the frequencies it receives through the senses into the inner world of our perceptions. It is only in the holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted out and divided up into conventional perceptions. This essentially means that consciousness creates the appearance of the brain, the human body and everything we regard as reality.<br /><br />When holographic models of David Bohm and Karl Pribram are put together the world becomes a secondary reality. Primarily the world is a holographic blur of frequencies, and if the brain is also a hologram which selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions, then the objective reality cease to exist. This is in agreement with Vedanta philosophy (Hindu philosophy) where Maya, an illusory power creates the illusion which we believe is physical reality, but the universe is one whole entity called Brahman. We are essentially \\"receivers\\" floating through a kaleidoscopic sea of frequencies of a super-hologram.<br /><br />1.

1594488916|5.0|At first it is hard to believe that this is a true story - someone driven to collect rare books to the detriment of their freedom.  Bartlett does an excellent job of contrasting the thief Gilkey with his pursuer, the rare book dealer Sanders.  Sanders refers to himself as a \\"bibliodick\\", a detective who is as obsessed with catching Gilkey as Gilkey is obsessed with \\"getting\\" rare books.    If you collect anything you will see a bit of yourself in Gilkey, and if you dislike thieves you will feel a bit of Sanders' ire.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I loved this movie.  The Director's cut is fantastic.<br /><br />HOWEVER....  When it comes to the extras I feel like I've been taken advantage of.  I've seen almost all of the behind the scenes stuff on You Tube and the music video sucked, but most importantly - there's no audio commentary.  You have to wait until December and buy the NEW New and Improved 5 disc version!  It's kind of a rip off but since I got a good price from Amazon.com I'm not complaining too much.
0316010669|2.0|The premise behind this book is to enable/train the reader to learn how to \\"thin slice\\" a person or situation and gain \\"instant knowledge\\" with very little input. The author goes on and on about various examples of how many people were able to do this. However, that's not exactly what is going on. In the first example, he uses a story about a statue that one muesuem bought that turned out to be a fake. Several experts were able to just look at the statue and get a \\"feeling\\" or a \\"strong sense\\" that it was a fake. They couldn't explain how they knew, they just knew. This is what the author wants you to be able to tap into.<br /><br />The reason that these experts were able to do that is because they are EXPERTS! The know what to look for instinctively. It's like an inspector examining something in their off time. They know what to look for. I have a friend who loves movies. He really enjoys pointing out the dot in the upper right corner of a movie. He tells me that they come in pairs all the time. Guess what....he is in the movie production industry. That is how he knows.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is more than thin slicing. It is more along the lines of thick slicing. It totally goes against the whole premise of the book. Why would an author stick something in there that doesn't support his basic idea?<br /><br />The nice part is that this book leads the reader to real material. You can look up the refereneces for some real reading. The author mentions Dr. Paul Ekman. Great stuff there!<br /><br />Also, the book is a very easy read. It is a fun read. It gives enough information that you feel like you did read something, but it is definitely nothing that I would reference in real work.
B0000CABBW|4.0|Nice tale of courage, triumph over adversity, and coming of age. Keisha Castle-Hughes is endearing in her role as the young Pai. She keeps her spirits high and doesn't let even her ultra-grumpy, ultra-traditionalist, anti-girl-power grandfather keep her down. She really does seem like she has a destiny to fulfill. Her tribe needs somebody to ride the whale, which is their ritual tradition the next leader must pass. Problem is she's a she. No dudes there to do it. She's a natural leader and can ride the wale, so like so-what if she's a girl and her being female breaks with tradition? Her tribe and in particular ole grandfather must struggle with this. And the movie is beautifully shot, many memorable images, great performances and it manages to keep from getting corny.
0545128285|3.0|Entertaining but very short.  With only five \\"wizard-fairy-tale\\" equivalents (none of which were longer than maybe a dozen pages), there's just not all that much here.  While the stories themselves were acceptable, the accompanying \\"commentary\\" by Dumbledore does add to them quite a bit.<br /><br />It made for a quick read but in no way is essential to understanding the events in 'Deathly Hallows' - I'm glad that I got this from the library as I just can't imagine spending money on a book that I was able to breeze through in about half an hour.
B00260HH3K|1.0|I already wasted enough time watching this movie, so I'll keep this short:  The plot and characters have nothing to do with the anime/manga. Instead, we get the stereotypical soap opera teenager trying to hook up with chicks in high school. Basically Disney Chanel material.   Production quality is as poor as daytime tv. In fact, this movie feels like watching an episode of Power Rangers, and I don't mean that as a compliment.
0448444216|3.0|It goes through all the farm animals: the sounds they make and what they do.  My 4-year old knew all this but my 2-year old benefitted.  The flaps may as well have been pages since they're almost the same size as the page and open in the same direction.  I think flap books should be more interesting.  Overall, it's a cute basic book.

B001C48EF6|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of historical/period/costume dramas; so after viewing the trailer online, I knew this would be something I would be interested in!  Having already seen \\"Mrs. Brown\\" (starring Dame Judi Dench, and Bill Connolly), and \\"Victoria & Albert\\" (starring Victoria Hamilton, and Jonathan Firth- yes, Colin Firth's brother)- I already knew a little history of H.M. Queen Victoria.  Despite a couple of inaccuracies, I still found the film very enjoyable.  This was only the 2nd film I had seen either of the two leads in. Emily Blunt in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", and Rupert Friend in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" 2005.  Being that both of those roles were only supporting characters at best, I guess I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was pleasantly surprised though, to see both of them shine in their roles (Emily especially)!!  My only complaint is that it was over too soon!  (But since the title is \\"The YOUNG Victoria\\"- I guess it stands to reason.)  If you're interested in learning more, I would recommend viewing the two films I mentioned earlier.  As others have commented, the cinematography was beautifully done; the locations, and costumes are breathtaking!  Also, it's only got a PG rating!!<br /><br />  As I said in my comment to the person who only gave this film a 1 star rating.. Despite it not yet being available in the US- the film IS available for sale on Amazon UK for £11.98 (and various prices on eBay, etc.).  If you decide to purchase the dvd (which is \\"region 2\\" or \\"PAL\\" format), keep the following in mind:<br />- To play on your computer:  As long as it has a dvd drive, and the free download \\"VLC Media Player\\" (there may be other free programs, but that's the one I have) you can.<br />- For watching it on your regular TV: Getting an expensive \\"region free\\" dvd player isn't necessary- although, they may have gone down in price since the last time I checked. Personally, I have a GPX brand dvd player (product # D1816SIL) that I bought for $25 a couple of years ago, that plays PAL dvd's just fine! Whatever brand you choose, just look on the product description/box and see if PAL format is included.  ...Happy viewing!dvd's just fine! Whatever brand you choose, just look on the product description/box and see if PAL format is included.  ...Happy viewing!

159448385X|4.0|This story, really one of the plight of Afghan women over the last 30 years or so, is really, really well written. The two main characters are described from their girlhoods (which are very different) to their achingly mirroring adulthoods.<br /><br />The plot lines fly and tie in all of the recent history of Afghanistan, which is utterly horrible.<br /><br />It is a captivating, fascinating, emotive read.<br /><br />But the thing that really, really gets me about this book is that there is only one male character who I didn't absolutely want to reach in and strangle. Most of the men are monsters; the few who aren't are weak, lily-livered fools.<br /><br />Through the book, I kept asking myself WHY? Why didn't we just let the soviets do whatever? I do have sorrow for the women, but it just seems like they understand that the men who are left know of nothing but brutality and war, and that they will never care to know anything else.<br /><br />It makes me ill, knowing that these fictional characters are really too true to life. It makes me sad, knowing that they achieve power all through that part of the world. It makes me angry that I can do absolutely nothing about it, but I have been made to care about it. Futility pisses me off. Which is why this book got 4 instead of 5 stars from me.<br /><br />(*)>
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I just had the opportunity to watch Micheal Moore's Sicko. I had heard about the movie when it first came out, but didn't have the opportunity to purchase until a few days ago. I bought it from Amazon.Com and it came within three days.<br />My doctor had been asking me over the past several months if I had seen it, and I told him, \\"no.\\"<br />After watching the movie; now I know the reason that major insurance companies and Pharmaceutical companies didn't want anyone to see this movie. Hence the title \\"Don't get sick in America\\" is more than appropriate. We as the one of the wealthiest if not the wealthiest country in all of the western world should have a health care system far better than Canada, the UK, France and Germany as well as other countries. I was simply amazed with the reception that American citizens received in Cuba. A communist country that didn't seem to be communist at all. Free health care for the men and women Micheal Moore brought to Cuba, mainly to try to get medical treatment for the 9/11 rescue workers that were not getting the medical benefits that they should have been getting at home, only to receive proper medical treatment in a country where they were not citizens. I commend Micheal Moore for exposing the Insurance companies, and the HMO's for the greedy companies that they are. Finding almost any reason to deny them the medical treatment that they needed, and in some cases died because of the lack of treatment, and disrespect for those who paid into the insurance companies, and still denied coverage that they didn't want to pay. There was nothing \\"experimental\\" about some of the treatment options, but rather that the Insurance company did not want to pay for the treatment that was needed.<br />I was deeply saddened when a child died from a high fever because the Insurance company whom her mother was covered under denied her the treatment that could have save her life. So in essence Kaiser is guilty of negligent homicide, but no one will ever be charged for the child's death. Only in America could this happen.<br />I was appalled that men and women were dropped off on skid row in LA because they were not able to pay for treatment. This is not the America I grew up in, and it is not the America that I want to live in. Micheal asked the right questions: If Canada, the UK, France and other countries can have a Universal Health Care System, then why not America? There isn't anything Social about Universal Health Care, but big Insurance companies and some in Congress and even past presidents have said that Universal Health Care is Socialism. So be it! At least all Americans will receive the same level of treatment that our elected officials receive, but their greed gets in the way of sound judgment, and they cave in to the demands of big insurance and big pharma, and line their corrupt pockets with their tainted money. Lives that could have been saved were lost at the hands of greedy CEO's whose job it was to keep the cost of health care down, and make it more profitable for them, at the expense of the most needy in America. It is because of this greed and corruption that our health care system is in shambles, and a shame as well. I wonder what Canada, the UK, and France, and Cuba really think about America and the way our citizens are treated.<br />So, the title for this entry is quite on the mark: Don't get sick in America! If you do, and you have health insurance your carrier just might tell you that the treatment you need is \\"experimental\\" and deny you the coverage and treatment that you need that could possibly save your life. All the claims that were denied were frivolous at best, a common Yeast infection is not a real cause to deny someone treatment for a medical condition. The truth is the carrier did not want to pay for her treatment plain and simple.<br />So in closing all I can say to those who control the health care system in America: \\"I hope with all that is within me, that this will come around, and you are DENIED the treatment that you have denied so many others, all for the sake of saving a buck.\\" I hope all of you who work for insurance companies who constantly deny claims so you can earn more money all get sick and die, for you so richly deserve it! You know, it is true that what goes around eventually comes around. So be careful of whom you deny treatment, it just might bounce off them and stick to you!<br />May you all walk in dung forever!!!ED the treatment that you have denied so many others, all for the sake of saving a buck.\\" I hope all of you who work for insurance companies who constantly deny claims so you can earn more money all get sick and die, for you so richly deserve it!

0385342020|5.0|Oh, how I love Sophie Kinsella. Her books never fail to keep me engrossed and make me laugh. Her writing style is perfect and I eagerly look forward to all of her books. Twenties Girl was a masterpiece. I read it in one sitting because I couldn't put it down! The story is a comedy, a mystery, and a drama all rolled into one. If this is your first Sophie Kinsella book you're in for a treat - and you'll want to read all of them.
0307266303|5.0|The author didn't come up with the idea about running shoes being a disservice out of no where. It is backed by several reputable studies, which I have read, that produce quite a lot of evidence for running shoes causing injuries. I don't doubt that they do help people as well. But that doesn't mean they don't cause more problems than they help.    But I digress, I loved the book all around.     People are products of nature. Our ability to produce technology has lead to huge leaps in our enjoyment of life and our longevity. But it's also caused us alot of problems. We (as humans) always marvel at animals and what they can do. Animals are able to eat the food that is perfect for their bodies based on the information nature has given them. As a result, most of the time their bodies operate as perfect machines in nature, designed to fill a niche for the purposes of serving the planet. Humans are no different regardless of what we want to believe. If we lived the way the nature intends us to live, we would be better off.     Why do you think doctors tell parents to keep shoes off kids as babies? because you need your feet bare to learn to sense the ground and learn your bearings with the earth. They don't want babies in shoes because they also cause problems with the growth of their feet. Why we think this magically changes once a baby starts walking, I don't know.     Anyhow, this book was excellent, and I'll probably read it a second time just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't been said. This movie is amazing and destined to become a cult hit. The Blu-ray is beautiful and the Director's Cut is the best version. The Hollis Mason scene in particular is amazing and touching and I can't think of why they took it out of the theatrical cut. The special features are great and the Maximum Movie Mode feature is incredible. Maximum Movie Mode is any movie fan's dream director commentary and there is also blu-ray live which is a very cool feature (and will be even cooler tonight because Zack Snyder is hosting a live showing of Watchmen with him answering questions which will be archived to view if you miss it live). Only the blu-ray technology offers these amazing features and the future of viewing movies at home is looking very bright thanks to blu-ray. I've never been one to pay attention to studios or anything, but lately I've been very impressed by Warner Brothers and their movies, and this movie on blu-ray is the perfect example of a studio caring about their films and the people. Get this movie!
B0029NY9YO|3.0|i got done watching this movie only twenty minutes ago.i was so moved by it,i rushed right to my dinosaur computer and put forth this review.               i thought this movie was going to be a stupid x-men rip off.it was however not that at all.whoever wrote and directed this movie will sink to any low.there is no line that they will not cross.there is rape,a pregnant woman being executed,a 6 year old girl being mutilated and fed to dogs and thats just the worst stuff.this movie is very graphic and very detailed.i think i have a very good stomach for movie violence but this is just sick!not to mention the rape victim continualy says she didnt mind.its beyond what should be allowed.i know that goes against the first ammendment but this hollywood crap asks once again \\"were they right?\\"     ok,that off my chest,the movie was a secret society type movie.i hate it when the movie is very secretive and stuff until the end.i mean why advertise it as a comic book movie at all?why not \\"mystery\\"?then we would know we will sit through 90 plus minutes of questions and 5 minutes of confusing answers.  also,the super heroes werent even in thier prime ,they were all old.it was like a million dollar version of mermaid man and barnacle boy from sponge bob.it had that 1920s jazzy feel to it.  now,the super heroes are viewed as the bad guys in this one.they were brutal and the enforcers and it pissed people off.  the 2 biggest losers in the whole movie are those who survive too.that was no good.of course i cant say who here.  this one guy called \\"comedian\\" was played by wayne gayle from \\"natural born killers\\".he was a very nuerotic wanna be cop gone tv parasite in that movie.i dont care if he is iron man or comedian or who .he is always going to be that dorky talk show guy.  but,there were some good points.the \\"smartest man in the world\\",was a great character.and dr manhatten was one of the coolest characters of all time even though he seems like a silver surfer rip off only he teleports.he is way cooler than silver surfer though.his ho-bag girl friend sais something like \\"everthing is quantum mechanics and alternate universes with this guy\\".its cool to see that they took a genius and made him cool.  the special effects were both good and bad.the nuclear holocaust was less than stellar.most of the stuff with dr manhatten was awesome!but,the violence was either cool stuff we wanted to see as pre teens like knees getting snapped and the bone coming out OR was totaly gross,way too much information and just gross!  so thats why i gave it a 3 star rating.the awesome stuff is 5 star quality.the bad stuff was 1 star quality.[i couldnt give it less].so theres your average!

0385737947|4.0|I read The Maze Runner a month ago when I had the good fortune of getting an ARC from a friend. Its a twisted book in that the premise is that a bunch of boys are placed in a maze. They try to escape while various experiments are performed on them, for what purpose we're never quite sure. But, we get the idea that all isn't well where they came from and it might be better in the maze. I can see why people might be tempted to compare this novel with Hunger Games, but don't fall into that trap. The two novels are very different in that Hunger Games was a character driven novel while The Maze Runner is plot driven. I thought the material presented by Dashner was quite imaginative and well timed. The tension built as the novel came to a close, making me wish it was already in publication; then the next book in the series would be that much closer to the printing press. All in all, an excellent read!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|One great aspect of the beauty of nature is at least, in viewing.  The better the quality the greater the experience.<br /><br />I own the DVD version and just bought the BD version.  I have seen in true life, a modicum of some of the items shown on this show:  I've dove with whale and other pelagic sharks in pristine waters, been in underwater caves, been in planes high enough to see great swats of the  south American continent, the pacific and a few others.  What you see on these BD disks is closer to real life than the DVD.  A problem at times is footage itself, some are highly telescopic, some were not the best conditions for photography or possibly the camera itself ... such as the ultra fast slow motion shots of the great white shark.  Many shots rival IMAX quality.  As a nature buff, these videos bring me back to places I love, and have put on my list to visit.  If you can't be there, BD is a good home substitute, no expedition to the Yucatan or the deep oceans will cost you $50, and few can have an IMAX screen in their living rooms.<br /><br />I do agree with many reviewer comments than these disks contain less critical material than the DVD version, but its clear to me the BD version is far better than an  upconverted DVD version.  I compared them side by side, switch between playing DVD disks in my BD player or my DVD player; in resolution only IMAX or true life seems better than the BD.
B00005JPLW|5.0|There are some critics and viewers out there who can't stop criticizing this movie. They keep saying that \\"300\\" is historically inaccurate, and that it's either for or against homosexuality (due to the excessive violence, the physical appearance of the Spartans, and Xerxes in particular). Oh, come on, people! This is a MOVIE!!! It's not supposed to be 100% accurate. And it isn't trying to spread racist, homoerotic, or homophobic messages. What it's really trying to do is re-enact the battle between the Spartans and the Persians, through Frank Miller's stunning vision. It's all about the action and the fantastic visuals, so it's basically a visual feast. Sure, it might look like that it parallels many events in the present (like the War in Iraq, or California's Proposition 8), but that's not what it's about. So try to ignore the critics, and enjoy this wild spectacle: full of action, blood, and some chilling music.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I remember my science fiction film class had a day devoted to Bladerunner (the movie adaption of this book).  It involved talking about the plot of the movie, characters and watching the movie.  I thought it was interesting but didn't really think the movie was all that great.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of years and I'm asking friends which book I should get next on my Kindle.  One friend suggested this book.  I looked into it and noted that this was the book that Bladerunner was based off of.<br /><br />I'm really, really glad that didn't turn me off of reading this book, because as someone who didn't find Bladerunner memorable, I found Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep incredibly exciting and truly gripping.  I loved each electronic ink page.<br /><br />I won't get into details here, since many reviews have touched on the plot, characters and other overarching themes.  I will say this: if you're a Vonnegut fan, you'll like this.  If you didn't enjoy Bladerunner very much but like sci-fi books, do yourself a favor and give this a read.  It goes by quick... but it'll definitely stick with you.
B001JKGF9A|5.0|Few words can be written that add anything of value to the discussion of Richard Dawkins' popular and controversial work. For or against, if you are looking to understand the atheist perspective, [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]] is perhaps its finest summary.<br /><br />But this review is not about the book itself... rather, it is about this 11 CD unabridged audio edition by Tantor Media.<br /><br />Many books lose something in translation from print to spoken word. This one truly gains. The complete words of the text are read, with feeling and clarity, by the author and his wife. As one might expect from a professor and an actress, their voices demand your attention, never boring during a lengthy philosophical or scientific aside, never incendiary even when universe-shattering blasphemies are uttered.<br /><br />In sum, I recommend THIS God Delusion above all other versions.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Just finished watching the Blu Ray 3D version of CORALINE and was completely satisfied. The glasses have a magenta lens over the right eye and a green lens over the left eye. The view through them is balanced. In other words, you do not feel you're going blind in one eye. I viewed this on a 48 inch Panasonic plasma monitor. The detail is beautiful and when the first button falls into the titles, I had a big smile. Rarely did I see double images. I was also very pleased as the tunnel stretched out behind the secret door. As you would expect, the beautiful color seen in the 2D version is lost while viewing the 3D version, but felt that CORALINE was much more colorful than previous 3D movies I've viewed at home. CORALINE wins over JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH as the best 3D home viewing experience.
0385340575|3.0|Jack Reacher is always entertaining and die hard fans will love the book despite its flaws.  I found it to drag along a bit and was even more of a credibility stretch than his previous adventures.  When suspense and reader interest relies heavily on unlikely human feats and the violent abasement of multiple characters as opposed to solid plot development, it is time for the author to reevaluate direction.  Other reviewers have taken issue with the political overtones and to be honest, they offered an interesting perspective.  It may be time for Jack to give it all up before he becomes a caricature of himself.
B001MCBEQE|3.0|Orwell's text on his time spent among the lower echelons of Parisian and London society is great, and though it is a bit dated by some of its topics (for one, can you imagine a casual ward in London in the present day?) the sentiments and deeper observations that the sharp Orwell makes of poverty and the rough lifestyle are excellent and worth reading. But I'm sure many people with a deeper knowledge of Orwell have said much more enlightening things about this text -- that's not my point.    Mobi's translation of Orwell's original work. A colorful (and probably very entertaining, were it not censored) discussion of blasphemies and obscenities is ruined by censoring, leaving it entirely up to the reader's imagination as to what he's talking about -- I ended up skimming through the section because without actually knowing which profanities he's referring to, the discussion is almost useless.    Also, there were more than a few typos in the transcription. I understand that with translations from British English to American English, there are small differences in the spellings of words; translating from older English to contemporary English will reveal different spellings as well. However, these were more just common errors in simple everyday words, and I suspect (and hope) that these were not Orwell's errors, but rather someone much further down the publishing line. It's a minor annoyance.
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|This is exactly the kind of movie that concisely conveys what sort of generation we are raising - overweight, insipid, listless, boring, directionless, and dull. All those expletives still do not do full justice to the abject uselessness that is this film - one that meanders through scene after scene of some of the worst dialog you've ever heard - and the 'performances' are merely afterthoughts. Consider this a lab experiment gone wrong and all the mice are dead. Yet as a viewer, I bravely soldiered on, half-expecting the movie to raise its' bar and 'take off', so to speak. Unfortunately, this never quite happened.<br /><br />Prime fault lies with the director and the uninspired performances by all the leads - but really, there is only so much they could do with such an over-the-top storyline that gives fantasy fiction a bad name. This wasn't the weakest story in the cannon - in fact, Lord Voldemorts' origins were explained here (in possibly the most interesting segments), and it also does contain Dumbledore's death - which came and went in the space of one minute (even less, I think). Considering the film kills off a major character, it seemed unusual that this was almost clinically filmed, with no interest in actual emotion or depth. A huge failure, all things considered.<br /><br />The need to portray the children here as 'grown up' was most vile, with hideous love triangles that would test the patience of even an infatuated adolescent. For the rest of us, it was more proof that the series has far outstayed its' welcome, considering that past parts, such as 'Azakaban', were so dark, gothic and beautifully directed. This one is soulless and tepid - and by the time the endless Quidditch matches come your way, its clearly a case of one too many. Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks throughout the entire proceedings in a performance that can only be called 'mind-numbing'. The same can be said of poor Maggie Smith who looked utterly bored with everything.<br /><br />Gigantic plotholes seem to permeate the Harry Potter landscape. For example, everytime Hogwarts is under threat by 'dark forces', the combat strategy is to send everyone to bed. \\"Off to your rooms, children!\\" certainly can't work here, could it? But still, this is what they do. Also, Dumbledore can apparently travel at will to any part of the world in a split second, but at the end of the movie, he is trapped in a cave with Harry, and they use a good half hour of the films time to move from one end of the cave to the other using a boat that they manually pull out of the water. Ridiculous.<br /><br />That said, it bears reminding that this is a childrens' film, and thus, expectations can never be too high. For what its worth, the first three or four Potter films were enjoyable and had its' moment in the sun. The deja vu you feel while watching this is inescapable, and this is the first Potter movie adaptation where nothing will make sense if you haven't read the book first. The final scenes which consist of Ron, Hermione and Harry gazing at the sky is meant to be 'breathtaking' but it only angers you as they come up with the most repugnant script to accompany this segment - everything is a mismatch, things aren't explained properly, and all of a sudden, the movie ends.<br /><br />Two Generous Stars.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Let me start by saying I did not read the graphic novel.  I think that is probably a good thing as most of the negative feedback I've read is from people that compared the movie to the GN.<br /><br />The story line was not only engaging it was nearly the perfect balance of action and character development.  I was rooted until the credits rolled.<br /><br />The sound track was an added bonus, I particularly liked the Philip Glass Ensemble.  Each track was a nice accent to the scene it was associated with.<br /><br />I can also appreciate how this was viewed as revolutionary in its day.  To see the other side of your heroes, to know that there is a very thin line that separates them from us.  To see their weakness, their subtle genius and the daily uncompromising struggle to keep evil at bay.<br /><br />I was genuinely surprised not only at the ending, but the outlook the heroes took.<br /><br />As for the picture and audio.  Incredible.  The teleportation scenes the sound of crashing glass, I haven't been this blown away in a long time.<br /><br />My only regret is that we probably will never see a sequel to the unmakeable movie.<br /><br />As for my favorite character; it's a toss up between Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan.  No regrets from my purchase.<br /><br />Now to get the novel and read what I missed.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|I remember when I first heard about Star Wars The Clone Wars last, and I was both intrigued and skeptical.  It turns out that there were good reasons for both.  I grew up when the Star Wars Droids cartoon showed up on Saturday mornings, and I remembered how it was difficult to translate the epic nature of the movies into animation.  In some ways, that challenge is still there today in spite of advances in graphic capabilities through CGI and other techniques.<br /><br />It seems clear that Lucas is targeting children with The Clone Wars movie and animated series because the rendering of many of the characters is rather, well, cartoonish.  The characters where this is most obvious are Count Dooku, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  If the target audience was older, we would see a different style either along the lines of the Marvel Comics animated series such as X-Men and Spiderman or something in the Manga/Anime genre.  The latter would also be any interesting tie in to the more Easter themes that underlie the Star Wars mythology.<br /><br />In addition to the visual differences, the story for The Clone Wars also seems to come up short of the Star Wars standard.  I think there are a few reasons for this.  It is about 45 minutes shorter than Episodes II and III that envelope the timeline of The Clone Wars.  The plot is fairly simple in that Jabba the Hut's son has been kidnapped.  Obi-Wan is dispatched to negotiate a treaty, and Anakin and his new pupil Ahsoka are sent to rescue Jabba's son.  There is little doubt who is behind the kidnapping based on what we already know happens prior to and after The Clone Wars.  The limitations seem to hamstring the story, and it plays out more like an episode of Scooby Doo.  There are some decent battle scenes, but overall, the story will leave most die-hard fans wanting more.<br /><br />The characters come out as a mixed bag.  The new characters are hit and miss.  Ahsoka is actually pretty well done.  Assigned by Yoda to be Anakin's pupil, she acts in many ways as a mirror to him.  She is young and brash and even reckless.  The dynamic between her and Anakin really works.  Anakin, however, is not the only one who now has an understudy.  Dooku now has an apprentace in Asajj Ventress.  Unfortunately, she comes off as a rather inept Sith.  However, the biggest character disappointment of The Clone Wars is Obi-Wan.  In addition to being hard to look at visually, the voice job by James Arnold Taylor really comes up short.  While the other characters who have different voices are close enough, there is little doubt that someone else is pinch hitting for Ewan McGregor.  Of all the characters to get wrong, how could Lucas expect fans to accept this version of Obi-Wan?<br /><br />All that being said, I expect kids will absolutely love The Clone Wars, and they are the true target audience anyway.<br /><br />The special features were a bright spot.  It was interesting to hear the director and producer explain what they were trying to accomplish with both the movie and the animated series.  The music for The Clone Wars is pretty well done, and I liked learning how it came to be.  Other features include the complete webisodes and trailers.  The total of the special features comes in around an hour, and again, these are fairly well done.  However they are also likely to be lost on the target audience, i.e. children.

B001V9LRV0|5.0|My Dad received this for Father's Day and couldn't stop until he was done watching it...lots of extra things he had never seen before and he was thrilled!!
0060194995|3.0|I thought this book was fairly dull reading, notwithstanding its \\"classic\\" status.  Certainly it enunciates every desirable goody-goody piety - both those common to all decent people, and those especially desirable among late 20th century American liberals (Low Class Whites Bad, Low Class Blacks Good, Too Much Religion Hypocritical and Bad, that sort of thing).  But I didn't enjoy it that much, and think Mr. Finch's high ethics are unfortunately matched by his mediocre skills- his supposedly withering cross-examination (consisting of about ten questions fired at a silent witness) was really an argument disguised as a cross-examination, the sort of thing that a good judge would not allow.
B0026P40NU|5.0|Notwithstanding the louche, proto-punk appeal of the leading actors, this is more than just a romp dealing with the \\"alpha-fops\\" who founded the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.  The name reflected their rejection of Raphael's \\"grand manner\\" as they championed a more realistic style combined with symbolism (mostly Christian and mythological).      Peter Bowker's well-judged script focuses on the professional and personal lives of the charismatic Dante Gabriel Rossetti, the urbane John Everett Millais, and the manic William Holman Hunt.  The dialogue blends Victorian idiom with contemporary expressions and delivery.  The lush production is based on Franny Moyle's [[ASIN:1848540507 Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites]]. A brash, fantastically comedic glam-rock score by Daniel Pemberton accompanies scenes of artistic creation, of sex, and of the Brotherhood swaggering abreast through London asserting their brilliance.      Using a fictional narrator (the diffident but awestruck diarist Fred Walters), the dramatisation remains historically faithful.  Flame-haired hat-shop girl turned model/Muse Lizzie Siddal, models for Millais's iconic ''Ophelia'' in a full bath warmed by dozens of candles; Charles Dickens pours scorn on Millais's ''Christ in the House of His Parents,'' accusing it of blasphemy;  the repressed influential critic John Ruskin (Tom Hollander - wonderful) is sexually repelled by his wife Effie, leaving the way open for her to fall in love with the engaging, affable Millais.      Pacy and racy, the story follows the hungry, ambitious group through the  dingy brothels and shops, on their search for Muses and models; in their studios, getting and losing inspiration - and having sex; humbled by old fogeys, while seeking sponsorship at Royal Academy exhibitions.  Oozing talent and testosterone, Rossetti (Aidan Turner), emerges as the leader of the pack, although the personalities are all distinctive and beautifully acted.    For some of theBrotherhood and their models, dark outcomes lay ahead (notably not Millais - he became President of the R.A.) But that's another story.  For now, this is a very watchable account of the bright young things in the prime of their inspired lives.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|Do not listen to fan boys of the ff series, half of them probably haven't even played the game. New characters are unoriginal and look like girls. All Previous characters fail to make a decent appearance in the movie. It was short and unexciting. Unfaithful to the game. The beginning tells about the game yet the whole movie leaves unanswered questions to both people who played the game and who haven't. The whole movie is based around Cloud and and a new character Kadaj. Obviously and expectedly he got the movie was about him but he was practicly the only character in the whole movie. This movie is the greatest upset to Final Fantasy. JUST PLEASE LET THE SERIES DIE HERE AND MOVE ON WITH FF. Final Fantasy seven was a great game but please let the ff7 series die off and continue with future ff titles and let final fantasy 7 be FINAL.l
B001FB55H6|5.0|Movie was amazing. That's all you need to know.     Was very refreshing to not see big name stars in it too. Makes it where you focus on the character rather than the actor playing it. The actors were perfect also.     Best movie of the year.
0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner kept me up to the wee hours of the morning as I raced to the finish. I loved it in every way: the pacing, the characters, the plot. Thomas wakes up to find himself in a box that opens up to the glade, the central part of an elaborate maze where monsters dwell. From the moment of Thomas's entrance into the glade, he works to try and recover any part of his memory while also trying to solve the maze and stop the deaths of the boys who live in the Maze with him. I would say this book is a cross between Ender's Game and Lord of the Flies. It's a tale that is expertly woven, true to the target audience of teen boys, and filled with enough action to keep me up all night. The only downfall of the book was realizing I have to wait for the sequel. I look forward to reading more of Dashner's work.
B001GCUO16|4.0|Not sure why some hate this movie so much. The movie and story is great. It breaks down the origin for people who are not comic book readers in a well-done way. If you were to get the entire origin on film, it would be a tv series not a movie. Action was great, Jackman was great, Sabretooth was great... The rest of the cast was good...     One problem I have with it is hollywood taking and changing an existing character to create a new one? You will see. Not sure why they do this when there are so many characters to chose from already.
B0028K3192|2.0|Maxwell's Unplugged and especially 2001's \\"Now\\" are among my favorite recordings period. Not just Maxwell but in my whole collection. While my have correctly noted that the release is short, that does not bother me as it's a fairly priced release and I would rather have a tight set of songs than a bunch of filler.<br /><br />The problem that I had with this release is that with the exception of \\"Pretty Wings,\\" which is a satisfying song, Maxwell's material here is weak and he does not use his amazing falsetto anywhere near enough. \\"Bad Habits,\\"  sounds more like Lenny Kravitz than Maxwell and while there is nothing wrong with an artist taking different roads, here he sounds like a second rate version of Lenny rather than a cooler Maxwell.<br /><br />This review might get many not helpfuls as hard-core fans sometimes don't think that their favorites can do wrong, but I've played this release several times and all it makes me want to do is listen to Maxwell's better releases and hope that the second part of this 3 tiered project is better. For now give Chico Debarge's amazing \\"Addiction\\" a try as it trumps this release in every way.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|Nothing need be said about the origins of this film. In this review I've decided not to focus on comparisons to the graphic novel but simply on the film itself. It's an interesting mix of good and not so good elements. Here's the not so good:    1. Poor choice of background tracks to many scenes. Some of the songs kill the experience flat and give you '80's cringe.    2. Ultra gore in some scenes feels like it belongs in a different movie and may create a feeling of distaste for some viewers.    3. This is a stripped-down version of a 5-disc release coming later in the year (think Hellboy) and the extras are very weak. More studio double-dipping.    4. Make-up and acting of key political figures is below bar with that of the main characters to the point of pure caricature. Nixon is the worst offender - his extended nose makeup is so overdone that his scenes seem like they belong more in an episode of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\"     5. Image quality on the DVD itself could have been better in parts: In large areas of flat color some MPEG artifacting or blurriness is evident. Please note: I am not reviewing the Blu-ray version.    6. Explanatory dialogue ending is a little confused and cliched.      The good elements would have to include:    1. Good direction, cinematography, art direction, editing, and costume design.  2. Good acting from the main leads.  3. Entertainment value.    All other credit would have to go to the original graphic novel creators: It's their vision and storytelling we are seeing up on the screen. The director should be commended for remaining faithful to their vision.    This could have been a 5 star DVD if the studio hadn't been so greedy, had stronger quality control, and the director had made some slightly different decisions along the way and in post-production.
1596912863|4.0|This novel was never meant to be evidence of a grand social experiment.  It is not supposed to be a weighty study of the modern woman's expectations regarding relationships with men.  No, people, this book was written for fun.  As proof I give you the dedication:<br /><br />  \\"For Colin Firth<br />  You're a really great guy, but I'm married,<br />  so I think we should just be friends.\\"<br /><br />I laughed out loud and got myself psyched up for a real adventure.  Now how could anybody read that and not realize that this author was out to have some fun and entertain some readers along the way?  And that is exactly what she did for me.<br /><br />I love the writings of Jane Austen and when this character, Jane Hayes, admitted to having read and reread all of the Austen books many times (except Northanger Abby, of course) I knew I had found a soulmate.  What a wonderful concept, to give a modern day woman the opportunity to completely surround herself in Austen's 1816 to possibly find her own Mr. Darcy.  Or, maybe to find that her fantasy about any man ever being Darcy was completely unrealistic.  So, that's what this novel did and did it very well too.  Why not just read it as a romance?  Why try to analyze it to death?  It IS fiction, it doesn't try to be anything but fiction.<br /><br />I loved it.  Because of my expectations regarding this book (thanks Elizabeth!) I stopped in the middle of a paragraph of another book when the UPS delivery guy dropped this package on my doorstep.  From then on there was nothing else going to happen beyond me reading this book.  Jane Hayes discovered that living in 1816 wasn't such an easy thing to do.  Meeting any man and staying within the strict social guidelines was not just difficult but a virtual minefield of potential disaster.  While navigating this minefield she discovered truths about herself which she had never wanted to face.  And once she thought she had mastered that particular truth, it would pop up again and she would have to refine what she thought she had already learned.<br /><br />Don't be uptight and legalistic regarding either the writings of Jane Austen or the modern woman's guide to male/female relationships.  Read this book because it is funny, insightful, entertaining, engrossing, sweet, and because it allowed at least one woman (albeit a fictional one) to search for her own Mr. Darcy in an imaginative and satisfying way.  The writing is fantastic, the premise ingenuous and the results absolutely satisfying.

B001FB55H6|3.0|I have to say the movie itself is 5 stars, but the \\"Director's Cut\\" packaged here is worth only three.  Basically if you're a casual \\"Watchmen\\" fan then you're better off with the shorter (and cheaper) theatrical cut of the movie.  If you're a rabid fan then wait until December when the ultimate edition with the \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" woven in is released.  This \\"director's cut\\" edition then really falls in the middle and serves little purpose unless you've got money to burn and need to have every edition of the movie.<br /><br />The extra 24 minutes of footage are OK, but most of it wasn't necessary.  The death of Hollis Mason (not a spoiler if you've read the book) seems pointless and distracting and the motivation for it is hazy at best.  The only other real scene is Laurie--Silk Spectre II--breaking out of Rockefeller Base to stay with Dan--Nite Owl II.  It's not really adding anything critical to the plot.  Rorshach dealing with cops in the Comedian's apartment wasn't necessary either.  (It's like in \\"Star Wars\\" films where they have all those pointless shots of ships flying into or out of ports; we don't care HOW they get to or from there, only that they do!)  Similarly, shots firing on Archie after the prison break don't add anything.  I thought the most interesting addition was the brief scene after Rorshach meets with Dan where he goes on to himself about why he has to investigate the Comedian's death.  This ties nicely to the later scene in Antarctica.<br /><br />One plot hole not solved for me in this edition is:  where does Silk Spectre II get the gun she shoots Ozymandias with in Antarctica?  Maybe someone can clear that up for me.  Does he just keep guns lying around for her to find or did she always have one and not use it?<br /><br />So, again, unless you can't wait until December or you're as obsessive as Rorschach when it comes to collecting \\"Watchmen\\" stuff then you might as well wait.<br /><br />That is all.
0515123447|2.0|Mike's been told that Lee Child rocks.  He was misinformed.  Lee Child doesn't rock.  Far from it.  At best, he's a poor man's Elmore Leonard, without the snappy dialogue.  At best.  If that.  Child writes in choppy sentences.  Like this.  Supposed to convey a sense of urgency I guess.  Kind of Hemingwayesque I guess.  Or maybe Chandleresque.  Mike doesn't know.  Or care.  This is bad writing, cheesy as hell.  Cheesy.  As hell.

1572814349|5.0|I'm fussy about tarot decks. Having painted my own in the 70s, I've used it excusively ever since ([[ASIN:0312329725 Cilla Conway's The Intuitive Tarot]]), and although I've seen many others that promise much, at the beginning, they all have disappointed me after a closer look, and I had never managed to find another deck I could use. But this week I was shown Kat Black's Golden Tarot and I realised that it was exactly what I was looking for. It stays close to the Rider Waite interpretations, though with extra richness, so not only can I use it at medieval festivals, I can research all the paintings as Black details every source material she's used.
B000YABYLA|2.0|As far as the technical making of a movie, it is good. As for the concept, it is flawed. It makes the world seem much cleaner and easier than it is. You leave the theater and everything is fine. That is not how real life works and this oversimplification only glorifies teen pregnancy even if it does not seem to in the eyes of some.    The adults are stero typical, like the ones in Dirty Dancing, are all written like they are idiots who were never young. You are almost amazed that they could work in society at all due to their unending stupidity and inability to comprehend the world around them. Then juno's best friend's strange attraction/crush makes no sense, there is no reason for it unless you chalk it up to high school/teen attraction of a pretty girl which is cheezy. The disconnect between the adults and her friend and juno feels abnormal. They have no emotional connection between them. If it were not for the background music enforcing sentiment and fabricating emotion, there would be little.    It is full of inconcistencies which some others have pointed out like  why would juno's parents, being so dumb and backwoods in their ideas, name their children \\"juno\\" and \\"liberty bell\\"? Those are 60's hippie child names but these are not hippie parents! Come on! Apparently no one actually read the script and asked any hard questions.    The girl playing juno was never pregnant and I doubt the writer male or female has been either. Nothing about real pregnancy was even mentioned in the movie. It was all someones idea of what it might be like to be pregnant, clearly not written from experience.     Not a good role model movie, not a good movie at all.
0156012197|5.0|I don't know what the translation is \\"supposed\\" to be but I found this to be one of the most beautiful books I've ever read!!  For everyone and anyone who is a child, or a child at heart; for those of us who ache and yearn and love to think, feel, create AND..love...read this book!!  I can't and won't describe anything about it other than it's mysterious and lovely and gentle and special.    A REAL treat.  A treat for and from the heart.
B002BBJ52U|3.0|I watched this movie almost reluctantly. I actually ended up enjoying it a lot more than I expected. Nicely-done and believable performances from the whole cast, particularly Jennifer Connolly and Jennifer Aniston. Without giving too much away, I'll say that a couple of scenes with Aniston actually got me a little misty-eyed... but then again, I've been known to cry at life insurance commercials.  The thing that nearly spoiled this movie for me was the fact that the main \\"playa\\" guy in the movie ends up falling in love with the clueless, grasping, hopelessly romantic girl.  We all know that smooth guys never go for that girl.  The clingy girl will ALWAYS be left high and dry and wondering \\"What the F just happened?\\" when Mr. Wonderful turns into Mr. Emotionally Unavailable and fades away after a couple of dates, or after she sleeps with him.<br />Ah well, may be this unlikely happy ending will appeal to you hopeless romantics out there.  If so, \\"knock yourself out.\\"
B00005JKDR|5.0|I recently re-watched this film (the last time having been when it was int he theaters), and found it just as entertaining to both myself and my child movie-watching companion.<br /><br />THEN: I went to the theater with two young (6 and 3) boys, who were enthralled throughout.  The younger boy demanded a Boo doll for Hanukkah.<br /><br />NOW: Watched it at home with my 3 year-old niece whose attention did not waver (and that's a trick) throughout the whole movie.  She was completely committed to finding out what happened to that little girl.<br /><br />Half the fun of this movie is watching a child watching it, really.<br /><br />The voices of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, et al. simply enhance the immensely enjoyable and creative storyline.  Comic timing amongst animated actors hardly gets better than this.
0385341008|4.0|I found the letter style story fascinating. The way people write in letters especially about tragedies they've endured is mesmorising The friendships, wit, banter and some of the horrible events and themes discussed often in long vivid passages were quite dramatic. Most people get up and keep going on with life and even though the memories stick with them. They begin to experience joy, laughter and even other sorrows again.<br /><br />Loved the book--made me want to find out more about the occupation of the Channel Islands. .
B001FB55H6|3.0|I bought this thinking it was the definitive copy of the film.  I had heard rumors about a super multi disc version being released and I was waiting for that one but in searching Amazon I saw no mention of it so I bought the Blu Ray version.  Opening my DVD I found a flier mentioning the Ultimate version coming out in December.  Boy was I mad.  I loved the film but now I feel I got robbed.  I doubt now I will buy the newer version because I have this one.  Beware that you are getting the version that you want.
044024367X|5.0|The sheer number of reviews means that my 5 stars probably will not affect the average rating much, but I still want to give this thriller a big thumbs-up.      Critics are mentioning the political opinions that Child works into the plot, so if you disagree with those author opinions -- well, OK.      As for its view of religion, there is an evil preacher, but his cult is so clearly depicted as a real nutjob cult that I find it kind of baffling if real Christians are taking offense at it. In fact, another character shows up who's a really cool minister. It wouldn't surprise me if Child did this specifically to show that his villain does NOT represent the ministry as a whole. How the taggers and reviewers who call the book \\"anti-Christian\\" missed that, I don't know, but I did not find it anti-Christian at all, and I am one.    But as a thriller, it's one of his best, and I say that after being a bit disappointed with some plot silliness in his previous book (Bad Luck and Trouble, which was fun but deserves lower ratings than this one, as a story).    Here, Child takes a hard-to-make-suspenseful scenario and makes it a true nail-biter. There's plenty of action, but the plot does require Reacher to do a lot of information-gathering, and long journeys by foot.  It's hard to keep the suspense high even through these passages, but Child does it. You can feel the tension, the disorienting blackness of a night crossing from one town to the other on foot, the teeth-grinding frustration Reacher feels, but must accept and cope with, when the suspect strands him out of town.  The bits of the plot come together nicely, and the answer (for this reader) wasn't obvious early or uncovered too quickly. Interesting, believable local characters, with complex personal lives, are there too.      Unless you really can't stomach cynicism about the Iraq war, you'll be greatly entertained. If the politics will mar the experience that much for you, skip it, but it's a good GOOD entry in the series.
0141183101|5.0|Almost a century after the book's publication the most crucial problems it discussed are as current as they were during Forster's life. The impossibility of communicating across the divide of culture, religion, and race, seems to be even more alive then when he saw it. The value of the novel lies not so much in representing it but in the fact that Forster offers a way out - personal contact.<br />The story takes us to India of the 1920s - we follow the path of a young Englishwoman who goes to marry a British official but wants to know \\"the real India\\". This she never achieves but she gets to know something by far more important - herself. Her inept attempts at connecting with India and Indians make other characters of the novel learn more about themselves, force them out of safe shells in which they lived. The lesson is painful but at least for some of the characters opens the door to a better life.<br />There is little chance people will suddenly like Muslims, Pakistanis, gays, lesbians, Moroccans, Turkish, Kurds etc etc - there is a chance (a very slim chance, Forster would be quick to add) that a specific American and a specific Muslim, a Turk and a Kurd, an Israeli and a Palestinian can be friends. The world may not want it, the people that surround them may not want it but the results depend on us alone. If we do not try we only have ourselves to blame.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is my all time favorite record of artistic performance in the entire book of human history. If I were to make one of those ridiculous \\"Chuck Norris\\" references, where Chuck does something that is totally unbelievable and astonishingly amazing, I would say: \\"Chuck Norris was at the S&M concert!\\"    In the past ten years (yes, it's really been ten years since it was recorded), I have listed to this album, all the way through, thousands of times, and I've actually listened to it about ten times this week alone. At least once a year I get this album off of my shelf and listen to it at work, sometimes for about a month straight.    Throughout early Metallica history, James Hetfield never once had a singing lesson, but his music was, and still is, of the best. Picture this: Two hours of some of the best Metallica songs of all time, performed live, after decades of experience as a band (as well as prior experience working with Michael Kamen), James actually went out and took singing lessons before this concert took place. The song \\"No Leaf Clover\\" truly shows the results of James' singing lessons, as he perfectly moves between extreme tones and smoothly reaches pitches he has never used before. \\"No Leaf Clover\\" also features some of his \\"secret\\" riffs that he wrote throughout his career, but never had a chance to finish until Michael and the band decided to make this album. In this song, the beginning lyrics \\"it feels right this time\\" truly ring true as \\"No Leaf Clover\\" is performed, for the first and only time. Just knowing a little of the history behind the song truly enhances the overall experience.    I could write about each song individually, but I am sure you do not want to read a book, or you would be shopping for books instead. So, I will leave the rest of the album as a pleasant surprise.    For the first listen, I highly recommend ensuring you are in the optimal setting before listening to this album. The room should be dimly lit; you should have nothing onyour mind, being totally open to the music, but not to distractions; be sure to setup a high quality surround sound stereo system; and ensure that you will not need to take a break for about two hours: Then listen to the entire thing all the way through. After that, buy the DVD and watch it on a very large display, in the same setting. You will not regret this life experience!
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|Okay, so everybody is all shook up about the fact that it didn't stay so true to the comic books. News flash for ya-They RARELY do. It's an amazing film with great special effects and amazing acting. The film caused an uproar with a few of my friends because Gambit didn't have the correct accent, so what? THe film was made for people to watch and enjoy it, not be critized to the extent where people just don't want to talk about because people have been so harsh about it. What I really enjoyed, was that after the credits, they set it up for the next one, when Wolverine is to have his big fight with the Japaneese dude.   Another thing, I read a review on here where someone said that Storm wasn't in it, she was. You just weren't looking hard enough. She was in the cages by where Scott Summers was and also in the scene where he is leading them out to the helicopter.  What I have enjoyed doing after seeing this film, twice, is watching the cartoon series X-Men:Evolution, it gives some of the background for most of the characters in the film. Don't miss out on one of the best summer films yet, not counting Star Trek.
073510073X|5.0|If you are an HSP, this book is required reading.   This HSP personality type describes me so well there must be something to it. I wish I had known about this years ago; it would have saved so much anguish and searching to find myself.  I also highly recommend the book \\"Making Work Work for the Highly Sensitive Person.\\" Excellent, excellent guide to finding work you like, even love.  [2011 Update] My thinking has evolved in the years since I wrote this review. I have decided that HSP still is a valuable description. But, for me at least, it describes my mental state after suffering too much trauma and stress, and from managing those stimuli poorly. I no longer think HSP necessarily describes a distinct personality type, although some of us are pre-disposed to being more sensitive, it's true.  The best thing I have found to manage all this is the book [[ASIN:159257243X The Complete Idiot's Guide to Zen Living, 2nd Edition]], as odd as it may seem. This book has been life-changing. It's not a religious book, it's a book about finding peace and about managing the stresses of life.  I also highly recommend [[ASIN:1452898057 Train Your Brain....Engage Your Heart....Transform Your Life: A Course in Attention & Interpretation Therapy (AIT)]].
B00288KNJU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I consider myself a fan of Tim Burton and a big fan of Neil Gaiman, but hearing this would be stop motion animation and that it was PG made me think I could very well not like it. Man was I wrong. The story is dark, fantastical and really bizarre at times, and the animation... I never seen anything like this. The 3D on the Bluray is AWESOME.
0307460444|4.0|I wish this had been available last year when I did cupcakes for a friends wedding.  Out of all the books I purchased and looked through this has one of the nicest selection of ideas for decorating cupcakes.  You will find whimsical, elegant and everyday ways to make your cupcakes stand out.  Techniques are well explained and the pictures are great.  I like the fact that they did not use one standard recipe and then just change up the flavorings to get a bunch a \\"different\\" recipes which in my opinion is total rip off when purchasing a cookbook especially if the recipe is just okay to begin with.  A lot of different textures in the cupcakes with the selection of recipes available.  Some are dense while others are lighter in texture which is really nice.  Like brownies everyone has a different idea of what a good cupcake should be like.  I would recommend this over almost every other cupcake cookbook I have seen to date.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I became a fan of Muse since I heard the singles off of Absolution and slowly built up a discography of them.  I have every full length album they've put out and a punch of the singles.  BH & R is by far the best.<br />The tracks, taken by themselves, are masterful.  They are musically complex, lyrically brilliant, and have a certain dark epic-ness to them, like they should be played at the end of the world.<br />When taken as a continuous album, BH & R is  the greatest musical achievements of the new millennium.<br />If I had to pick the best tracks off of the album, they'd be Map of the Problematique, Starlight, and Knights of Cydonia.  I truly believe that Knights of Cydonia will be my generations Bohemian Rhapsody.  Listen to it, you know I'm right.<br />Map of the Problematique is simply a great song.  It reflects on the world at large in an incredibly entertaining and deep style.  It also has this certain indescribable pull to it.  You should definitely also pick up the Does it Offend You, Yeah? remix of it.<br />Muse is a meaningful, relevant, slightly dark, brilliant band and this is their best effort so far.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|(No spoilers - don't worry.)    By some fortunate twist of fate, I won tickets to the London Premiere of Inglourious Basterds. Here's what it was like.    Sitting snugly in my seat in London's Leicester Square Odeon, a buzz fills the room as people are ushered into their seats and away from the Red Carpet and Paparazzi outside. Popcorn and Doritos are sold at nearly six dollars a bag but nobody is counting the pennies as they eagerly await Quentin Tarantino's new offering to the world of cinema. In stylishly late fashion he takes to the stage, confidently wielding the microphone like any good stand up comic.     \\"Are you ready to see some Basterds!\\" He yells. And in true panto tradition, the audience scream \\"Yeah!\\"    \\"ARE YOU READY TO SEE SOME BASTERDS!\\" He yells again.    \\"YEAH!\\"    \\"Say what!?\\" Quentin calls out.    \\"YEAH!!!\\" We cheer.    \\"HELL YEAH!\\" He calls back.    \\"HELL YEAH!\\" We reply.    \\"THEN LET'S GET THIS MOTHER ****** STARTED!!\\" He screams. The audience erupt in cheers, and with everybody psyched up and ready, Quentin throws the mike to the floor with a bang, the lights go down and he exits stage as the curtains part and the movie begins.    So, my review:    Lawrence Bender (Tarantino's Producer since Reservoir Dogs) in an interview about Inglourious Basterds said that it had the layers of Pulp Fiction but with more maturity, because, in fairness, Quentin's had 15 years to grow, learn and develop, although his last two outings of Death Proof and Kill Bill showed little sign of the writer/Director maturing, merely stamping his mark on genres that weren't in the spotlight, and in some ways, recreating them.    So, did Inglorious Basterds live up to this claim of the new and matured Quentin Tarantino? Well, yes and no. Tarantino's staple dialogue, when not pushing a story, is often crude. That, for once, is not the case with Inglourious Basterds, so perhaps that can be taken as a sign of maturity. The dialogue is excellent, as expected, but at times without the poetic rhythm that his first three pictures had in abundance. The only drawback of this is that on rare occasions you'll find that you've zoned out for a moment, but, with a Tarantino film, chances are you'll see it again sometime and catch up on missed dialogue. It is dialogue heavy, which today's audience seem to shy away from, however it is always better to see a film driven by a good script rather than special effects.    The story is layered in true Tarantino fashion. The Basterds themselves could have been developed more, since there are many and we get to know so few, however this isn't a small film like Reservoir Dogs, revolving around a group of Basterds as the trailer makes out, and there are plenty of other characters to compensate for it.    Also, as we've come to expect, the film is violent, which I didn't think would bother me, but it's the only thing that left a bitter taste in my mouth. I'm pretty desensitized to violence on screen and have been for many years, but I expected the violence of Inglourious Basterds to be understandable under the topic of War. I also expected a few points to emphasize the cruelty and senseless of war, but I found that in many ways this was a glorification of war and Quentin has used it as a playing field for his imagination without considering the consequences. As Uncle Ben taught us in Spiderman \\"With great power comes great responsibility\\" and when I was going into Inglourious Basterds, I felt that the uneducated audience who love Tarantino might leave this film having learned a few things. Sadly, I don't feel that is the case, and for me that is its only downfall. It's becoming more and more obvious that Quentin Tarantino makes the films that Quentin Tarantino wants to see, and while that is precisely why they're so good, I do find that if he was a little less self indulgent he could make something just as hip, funky, violent and entertaining, but with more depth.      However, as a crafted piece of work, in script, style and care, it fires on all cylinders. I do not believe that a Tarantino film will ever not live up to the standards we've come to expect and I honestly feel that he is the most reliable director in the world today, but while some are calling this a more mature piece of work, the reality is that his first two ventures on the big screen were in fact more mature and with less glorified violence than what he is making now.    Be that as it may, he is one of the few Director's who I feel is really worthy of the title 'Artist', and if somebody is an Artist then they should be free to make what they want. Tarantino is fortunate enough to be able to make what he wants without being hampered by producers, and while I wouldn't want it any other way, I believe that for a man who's first three films often had the theme of honour cropping up, he has now made a war film with little to no honour or respect for the real people who suffered and died in World War 2, and although it's entertaining, that sure as hell doesn't make it right.      Enough said. Go and make up your own minds about it.      Peace.
B00005214X|5.0|And so, armed with a pretty great portfolio of songs rejected by John and Paul, the quiet Beatle decides to blow his wad and release the whole damn thing in one go as a triple album. Classic little-brother move there. He was king for a day. Foolhardy at first glance--some would argue he should have rationed this A-list material out more carefully--but it was probably a good idea. Judging from bootlegs from this era, even minor songs that never saw the official light of day were more compelling than what would come later. In short, George was in the zone--a place he'd never been, and would never be again. I think it was a smart move going for broke here.    That said, I've always had reservations about this album. George had an exasperating habit of keeping his sly humor out of his songs, leaving us with his rarely attractive sermons (and what a born scold he was, even before he found God--maybe that was why he could relate to Dylan). And, as George rather grumpily suggests in his liner notes, Phil Spector's often magnificent production does, at times, steamroll over the delicate material. Still, he has Phil to thank for crafting the only sonically rewarding album in his catalog. Overblown at times, perhaps, but this is a sublime piece of record-making.    I've been terrorizing the wife and kids for the past year with my guitar-playing around the house, and in learning the 'All Things Must Pass' songbook I have gained a new dimension of appreciation for these strange, beautiful constructions. George knows when to haul out the Dsus2 and the F#m7, but also knows when to keep it simple. It's that uncanny Beatles-coached balance of instinct and hyper-fluent attention to detail.     I have little patience for the George Harrison cult, those people who would have us believe that he was the equal of (or better than) John and Paul. He wasn't. But there is such a thing as a George Harrison Song--with its own lovely qualities, born right out of that Harrison hard-drive--and itfinds its perfect moment in this very necessary, if never repeated, freedom-drunk masterpiece.
1401201911|5.0|A self contained Superman story that was absolutely incredible. I'm not even a big Superman fan, but if I had to shove one Superman book into a friends face to read, it would be this one. Actually if a friend asked me to borrow my top favorite graphic novels, this would be one of them in the stack along with books like Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, Sandman and Hellboy.   But let me tell you how I really feel...   :)    The artwork is very nice all the way through the book. I have no complaints here. Does a beautiful job bringing the story to life.    The story in case you haven't figured it out yet, is sort of a \\"What if\\" Superman landed as a child in the Soviet Union instead of America. It seemed so simple and so well done that I just couldn't believe it had not been written until now.   Luthor, Green Lantern Rings, Wonder Woman, Batman...All play more than exciting roles in this book.     It ends very well, with a full circle of events that I found brilliant. .   Highly recommended

They also confirm that a great book, no matter how long (the Trilogy, at least the Spanish translation which is the one I read, sums around 2100 pages), will always leave you craving for more. That is exactly what happened to me with the Millenium Trilogy. It had been a long time before I stumbled with books which, on one hand, I couldn't wait to finish, and on the other, wished for them to never end. That was definitely the case with this Trilogy. Besides, it is amazing for a writer to succeed in writing a series of books in which all of them are so interesting and compelling. However, it should be noted that while a person may read the second book without having read the first, in order to appreciate and enjoy the third you must have read the second, because it picks up exactly where the second ends, while the second begins about a year and a half after the events depicted in the first.<br /><br />It is really a pity that Stieg Larsson died before completing his project of writing a ten-book series starring Salander and Blomkvist. I don't tend to be sentimental about things or persons I've never known or met  but I truly feel a great loss because of not having the chance of reading the whole ten book series and discovering the \\"whole picture\\" as Larsson envisioned it. Without a doubt Larsson was an extremely gifted writer. Larsson's style is so compelling, his characters are so human, they have great qualities but also great flaws. Definitely, books that anyone who enjoys suspense should not miss.
032147404X|5.0|An excellent book which has easy to follow instructions for learning how to better utilize your dSLR. If you are one of those people (like I am) who hates math equations and technical jargon, this book is definitely a must-have!

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Watching this for the first time on blu-ray met my every expectation:  friggin sweet!<br /><br />1)Resolution - The screen resolution was amazinging with crisp contour<br />  lining for picture capturing and backdrop color scheming.<br /><br />2)Contrast - Just the right amount of lighting for the color.  Not too<br />  bright; not too dark.  You don't have to necessarily turn out the light<br />  to watch it unless you're into optimization.<br /><br />3)Extras - The added scenes added, I believe, are explanitory to the<br />  addition of the original and it, of course, makes the movie (which is<br />  already a great anime) friggin sweeter!
B002HEOLH0|5.0|Daughtry's Second Album is just as great as his first.  The collaborative effort with Chad Kroeger from Nickelback makes the first single \\"No Surprise\\" one of the best songs of the collection.  Chris Daughtry's brilliance in song writing and delivering the message helps bring this star to the forefront of rock.  However, he also shows his craftiness to sing ballads, like \\"Call your name\\" and the duet with Vince Gill, \\"Tennessee Line\\".<br /><br />His unique style, with a little more creative freedom in this work, will make any Daughtry fan happy to purchase this album.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.

B0001O3YD0|4.0|When I first seen this movie in 2000 or it didn't impress me very much. I watched it again recently and it has become one of my new favriotes. The way it was shot was unique and it has to be appreciated. I like the mix and variety of the characters.     It's really no surprise in retrospect this movie spawned a couple sequels and some pretty good video games.
1563898586|4.0|For 10 bucks you will find no better example of fine colorist work.  Dimagmaliw has an amazing ability to find colors that convey tone and establish setting.  He then works them into complementary collages that dazzle the eye. Even if you already know the story, you will likely find this volume well worth it.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I bought this cd because I had to have about 4 of the songs. As I've listened to the cd I've come to really love almost all the songs on the album. They're not all my typical style of music but sometimes that's a good thing. I'm really glad I bought it.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|Good fun movie, very violent so keep that in mind.  It was not meant to be historical, the made that very clear.  The blu ray quality does seem questionable though.    My biggest interest though is people who need to mock the US over this.  First this is a movie, second historically speaking the US does not routinely run around as an oversized empire.  The past 2 decades we have been wandered aimlessly I admit but not hardly is it routine.

031606792X|5.0|What I like best about Breaking Dawn: In this book, it becomes obvious that Bella has always known \\"what's best for her.\\" Instead of having everyone else try to take care of her and \\"fix\\" her, it becomes obvious - even to Edward, that she really has known what she is doing from day one. She is an amazing heroin in her own way and I thoroughly enjoyed watching her develop the respect, admiration and devotion of all her friends and family - best of all her self.    I was shocked to read that some people didn't enjoy Breaking Dawn. It hadn't occurred to me that anyone wouldn't find it as delicious as I did. I guess we all have our own opinions.    For me, Breaking Dawn was as good as Twilight. I hate to compare and I did like them all but Twilight (book 1) and Breaking Dawn (book 4) were beyond satisfying. I was so happy to put the Twilight Saga to rest with a happy ending because I love ALL the characters so profoundly. I read book 4 in 2 nights (not bad for the mother of a toddler) and then re-read it so I could enjoy it even more while taking my time. It was even more satisfying the 2nd time. All the characters introduced as well as reappearing in book 4 were as interesting as ever.
B001V9LRTM|3.0|I just got the 40th anniversary directors cut on Blu Ray, and I am a bit disappointed. the movie looks just like the original movie - you have to play the 2nd disc to get the extra music scenese - I would have thought they would have re-cut them into the movie disc...
B001ER4CTI|5.0|I already owned this movie but had to buy it anyway.  What sole me was the \\"extras.\\"  The book, the plastic encased photo, the cards.  Wow.  All in a beautiful box.  I just had to have it.
1416585710|1.0|I usually read a book a week and usuually read two Stephen King books a year (I began reading him with the Dead Zone). I read Cell earlier this year and breezed through it (although I was disappointed with the ending). Unfortunately Lisey's Story is the total opposite. I've been reading this book for two weeks now and I'm only on page 150. I have no interest in returning to this book at all. I'm finding it very boring.    I have a library consisting of over 1000 books and I have a policy of once I start a book I have to finish it. I'm reevaluating that policy now.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Im sorry if I offend someone by writing a review on a book I've never read, but obviously enough,I need tech help.  Normally I'm a technologicly literate guy, but for whatever reason, the book _The Ghost Brigades_ wont let me purchase it! I've restarted my Kindle, but whenever I select the book, it tells me that no further information is availible, then gives me the plot overview. As previously stated, HELP!  Thanks,  Theo
B001I82RU4|3.0|I bought the \\"Twilight\\" LP thinking I was going to get what was decribed: a gatefold cover, an LP & posters.  That isn't what I got.  I got a plain single-pocket sleeve, no posters, an LP & an info sheet.  The music is fine, I wanted the LP for collector purposes...and it wasn't at all what the page describes. I'm disappointed.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|The ninth album of a-ha is called 'Foot of the Mountain' and it is absolutely wonderful. I've had it for a little over a month and listened to it many times. My favorite track has to be 'The Bandstand' but all the songs with the exception of 'Start the Simulator', that one I just can't grasp, are brilliant. They are great summertime tunes to blast in the car with all the windows down especially 'Riding the Crest'. I would highly recommend any a-ha fan to buy this cd and introduce it to non-fans. I already have four converts. Morten Harket's voice is still so clear and strong as it picks you up and carries you through such breathtaking soundscapes.  It is so hard to believe that he will be 50 years old September 14.  I hope you will buy this cd and enjoy it as much as I have.
B001993Y2C|2.0|This really should be 149.99    When it hit's this price point I'll bite.  Till then I suggest just keep waiting.    Blu-ray in general needs to realize just because it's blu-ray you can't expect people to be okay with paying *that much more* DvD's sold because $14.99 is a impulse buy were has $24.99 is much less so.  That and many people are re-purchasing movies that they already own in DvD and it's hard to justify upgrading in many cases.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Marquis de Sade's tale involved no one over the age of 14 .. the people in this film are all adults! This completely undermines the shock value of this movie.  Maybe it is simply dated, as the scenes in the average popcorn flick of today, such as Hostel II, are FAR more realistic and \\"disturbing\\" than this snore-fest.  My 12 year old son fell asleep on the couch trying to get through it.  (His only comment was a suggestion that if I liked this I should watch a video he has bookmarked call 'two girls and a cup' .. since he says that actually shows what this movie badly fakes .. and that it seems to be popular with the juvenile humor set, I think I will pass).    Martha    I will still give it 5 stars, only because I am judging it by other movies of its time, not by todays more tolerant standards.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|Simply put one of the worst movies I've ever watched, I kept waiting for it to get good...IT NEVER HAPPENED
B001ILHY1I|5.0|This is my first review.   I DVRed this movie cause myfiance didnt want to watch it the night it was on.   Seriously, it was a great movie.  from start to finish.     I have watched many movies from blockbuster/movies on demand , but this is one I did not fast forward through.   I know Jason Stratham is known for his driver sense.  F it - This is a good movie.  The ending is cheesy, but the action is great.  And if you really want to dissect the movie, there are a lot of opportunities - from cutting winning, slay, pride, go to town.  It is a decent movie, One to actually watch.
B00005NMVP|5.0|Of the different versions of Al Stewart's magnum opus out there, this is the best sounding to my ear.  The original compact disc, like so many others from the mid-eighties had that thin, tinny, almost transitor-like quality to the higher frequencies while the Rhino release of [[ASIN:B0001XAS1W Year of the Cat]] suffered from a slight over-compression of the dynamic range.  I've listened to all three on very good equipment, and I can whole-heartedly recommend this version over the others.<br /><br />Of all the albums Alan Parsons produced outside of The Project, this is his favorite...and with good reason!  Even the weakest song, a toss-up between [[ASIN:B00122PVV8 Midas Shadow]] or [[ASIN:B00122MCMY Sand In Your Shoes]], is a great composition, performance, and production.  And as good as the depiction of Basque separatists is in the tersely engaging [[ASIN:B00122KCSU On The Border]] or how innovative the production and arrangement on [[ASIN:B00122MCOC Year Of The Cat]], a song like Stewart's personal favorite [[ASIN:B00122KCW6 Flying Sorcery]] almost steals the show.  Stewart has always been a very strong lyricist, but the lyrics of this song would be timeless poetry even without a note of music to support them and, as such, are nothing short of transcendent!<br /><br />I really have a difficult time imaging anyone who wouldn't enjoy YEAR OF THE CAT.  I once knew someone who said she didn't like Stewart's voice, but even THAT was her only complaint.  If you've never heard this album you're really missing out not only on a landmark artistic statement, but one heck of an enjoyable listening experience.  You may even consider investing in an entry-level audiophile sound system to really take in [[ASIN:B00122KCWQ Broadway Hotel]], [[ASIN:B00122RRFQ One Stage Before]], and [[ASIN:B00122MCOC Year Of The Cat]] in all their stereophonic glory.

1848373104|5.0|MY DEAR READER<br /><br />I cannot but be rendered in the highest of spirits upon completing this volume yet again, as I have always preferred extensive reading to trivial pleasures.<br /><br />Dwelling on particular passages and turns of phrase, I am reminded of how ardently I admire and love the prose that issued forth when Miss Austen put ink to paper many a fortnight ago.<br /><br />Neither common, nor dull, nor threadbare, each chapter engrosses completely with accounts of gentlemen of handsome countenance and ladies both sensible and silly.<br /><br />And though its conclusion is known most intimately to my own heart, anxiously I turn each page to venture ever farther away from the misconstrued encounters and lamentable conduct of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />When finally all is concluded and the mistress of Pemberley assured, only then can I chuse another distraction to engage my solitary hours. I wish nothing less than for you to know the same adoration yourself.<br /><br />Yours, &c.
B00110K62U|4.0|This video is not the actual musical, but as close as you will get so far on video.  The performers are costumed but the chorus is not.  The final song with ValJeans from around the world is worth the price of the video.  Even chairman Kaga from Iron Chef is there. If you are looking for the music this is the video for you.  If you want a video of the whole musical this falls a little short.
1400031362|5.0|In _Morality for Beautiful Girls_, Alexander McCall Smith treats us once again to our favorite characters working through new mysteries.<br /><br />Mma Makutsi gets a more of the spotlight this time, and entertains us with sides of her we haven't seen before. Likewise the shop assistants at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.<br /><br />The mystery of Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's change in behavior commands our attention early on. Hats off to McCall Smith for weaving a common but stigmatized illness into the story line, through a character he has already made us like and respect.<br /><br />As the novel wraps up, Mma Ramotswe puts an important \\"Government Man\\" in his place but neglects to solve the mystery of the child we met in the second chapter. Will we ever find out this boy's history? I plan to keep reading to find out.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Kathryn Merteuil (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her step-brother, Sebastian Valmont (Ryan Phillippe), two jaded Manhattan teenagers, make a bet. After reading an abstinence manifesto in seventeen magazine -- \\"Why I Plan to Wait\\" by Annette Hargrove, Kansas City, Kansas -- Kathryn bets Sebastian that he can't seduce this paradigm of chastity and virtue. It just so happens that Annette Hargrove (Reese Witherspoon) is their headmaster's daughter, and she will be in town visiting. If Sebastian fails he has to give Kathryn his beloved 1956 Jaguar XK140 OTS (Open Two Seater), but if he wins he gets something he has wanted ever since their parents were married but could never have: Kathryn.<br /><br />--------------<br />Kathryn: So there's your psychoanalysis, Dr. Freud. Now tell me, are you in... or are you out?<br />==================<br /><br />Sebastian keeps a journal detailing his and his step-sister's conquests and deceptions. It is titled Cruel Intentions, an apt description if ever there was one. They seduce for the sport of it, merely because they are bored. Innocence and good reputations are destroyed for their amusement. Sebastian is even more treacherous than he is attractive. Every woman he has successfully pursued has regretted it. His therapist, Dr. Greenbaum (Swoosie Kurtz), is dismayed to learn that Sebastian has seduced her daughter Marci (Tara Reid) and posted the results on the Internet. Bunny Caldwell (Christine Baranski) didn't fare much better when her daughter Cecile (Selma Blair) fell into the half-siblings' orbit:<br /><br />---------------------<br />Kathryn: Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. When I'm through with Cecile, she'll be the premiere tramp of the New York area.<br />===============================<br /><br />The scene where Kathryn teaches Cecile to French kiss ranked the film at #32 on Entertainment Weekly's \\"The 50 Sexiest Movies Ever\\" (issue #1023, November 28, 2008). Cecile is played by Selma Blair, recently seen on the canceled sit com, \\"Kath & Kim,\\" as Kim Day, alongside Molly Shannon, as her mother, Kath Day. In real life, Selma is good friends with Reese Witherspoon, and was also in Reese's film, \\"Legally Blonde.\\" Selma has the luscious full lips of a Liv Tyler and also share's Liv's ability to play ripe for the plucking, but none too bright ing&eacute;nues. As Cecile Caldwell, she is putty in Sebastian's hands:<br /><br />---------------------<br />Cecile Caldwell: This sure doesn't taste like an iced tea.<br />Sebastian: It's from Long Island.<br />================================<br /><br />For the viewer, a big part of the fun is speculating about the personal lives of the actors and actresses, and comparing and contrasting what you know about them with the characters they play in CI. Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon were married, and by all reports they made a great couple; but have since divorced, allegedly due to Ryan's infidelities. Could the fact that Witherspoon's career was going so much better than his have been a factor? She won the Oscar for \\"Walk the Line\\" while he was nominated for a Worst Actor Razzie for \\"54.\\" Phillippe had this to say about working with her in \\"Cruel Intentions:\\"<br /><br />\\"It was great. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Not only personally but professionally. She was an asset to the movie and we begged her to do it. She didn't have as colorful a role as Sarah's and mine, but she did an amazing job. Really elevated the piece.\\"<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Annette: How can someone so charming be so manipulative?<br />====================================<br /><br />Perhaps being manipulative is a way to charm. At any rate, all the actors in CI gave great performances, relishing the chance to play such charming, though admittedly manipulative, rogues. Phillippe and Witherspoon, in particular, were so into their roles that at one point she slapped him, unexpected and unscripted, and the director left it in the final cut.After this very intense scene, as soon as the director yelled, 'cut,' Ryan Phillipe went behind the set and threw up. An early role of Ryan Phillippe was in the soap opera \\"One Life to Live\\" as Billy Douglas (13 episodes, 1992-1993). This was somewhat of a groundbreaking role, because Billy Douglas was one of the first gay characters on a soap opera. Of course, I am not insinuating anything about Ry here, not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar, with the other juicy, colorful role, also gave a great performance as Kathryn. She is perhaps best known as Buffy Summers, from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" (145 episodes, 1997-2003), but she is also an Emmy Award winning actress for the soap opera, \\"All My Children\\" as Kendall Hart Lang (25 episodes, 1993-1995). She is married to actor Freddie Prinze Jr. Sarah was in at least 6 movies with Prinze. Two Scooby Doos and in \\"She's All That,\\" she is unaccredited Girl in Cafeteria. Both she and Ryan Phillippe were in 1997's \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\\" along with Jennifer Love Hewitt. For some reason I can never resist the temptation of saying \\"Jennifer Love Hewitt.\\"<br /><br />Same goes for \\"Swoosie Kurtz.\\" Swoosie Kurtz has the distinction of being in both \\"Dangerous Liaisons\\" and \\"Cruel Intentions,\\" two films based on the novel \\"Les liaisons dangereuses\\" by Choderlos de Laclos. She was also in \\"Reality Bites.\\" Tara Reid, besides being a major party girl and friend of Paris Hilton, was in \\"The Big Lebowski\\" where she played Bunny Lebowski.<br /><br />Roger Kumble, the director, did a fantabulous job. He wrote the script, based on the book by Choderlos de Laclos, in only 12 days. CI is fluff, but the 'project is elevated' by the high caliber acting. Besides those already mentioned Louise Fletcher, who has over a hundred film credits and an Oscar for playing Nurse Ratched in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" (1975), was Helen Rosemond. Right from the first frames of CI to the last you are impressed with the stylish look, the witty dialogue, and the taut directing.<br /><br />There is also great music by Placebo, Blur, Counting Crows, The Cardigans, The Verve, Johann Sebastian Bach, Skunk Anansie, Marcy Playground, Fatboy Slim, Aimee Mann, Faithless, and, in an homage to Stanley Kubrick's \\"Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Symphony #9 in D Minor, Op. 125, 'Choral'\\" Parts of this film look like music videos, but that is not a put down. The opening in particular, is a visual feast. The closing is not bad, either, with The Verve's \\"Bittersweet Symphony.\\" Did you know that it was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, though the lyrics were by Richard Ashcroft and it was performed by The Verve? Actually, Richard Ashcroft sampled the strings from The Andrew Oldham Orchestra's version of \\"The Last Time.\\" The Rolling Stones sued, and though Ashcroft had layered lots of stuff over it, for instance, the violin lead part, the judge ruled that they had used too much, and gave Mick and Keith 100% composer credit. For Ashcroft, it was a bittersweet symphony indeed, and a fitting close for \\"Cruel Intentions.\\"<br /><br />-----------<br />Sebastian: Why can't we be together?<br />Annette: You wanna know why?

B000ALZHUC|3.0|Alright so I bought this CD from a local purveyor of metal albums, mostly because they didn't have anything really interesting at the time.     So I bought this.     I've heard of Sodom, both in name and the odd song once in a while. And no, it never really moved me the way the first time I pleasured myself did, I figured buying this album would be enough impulsiveness to get it out of my system before I cursed out the nearest toddler solely for the rush it would bring.     Anyway, after giving this album a good listen and a few days to soak into my brains, I can only say, with an air of frozen pizza in my breath: \\"It's ok. Not amazing. Not awesome. Not Earth-shakingly, towel-snappingly wicked cool. Not terrible. Not a chop in the pills. Just ok.\\"     The riffs aren't particularly catchy or inspired. Distorted, fast,  and aggressive. Although that all means pretty much nothing when there isn't much of a musical motif around. The solos aren't much to hear (WOW! He hit higher notes during them!). They aren't bad solos, but neither are they good. I guess they exist in a realm that knows not any emotional response. The bass is.... well it's a metal band, you're lucky if you hear it for more then four consecutive seconds. Drums are just drums, they keep time. And the songs as a whole are about as motivating as giving an old man a sponge bath with your bottom quarters. I didn't really feel anything. The songs didn't make me bop my head to the beat or shake my fist in rage at the man for always trying to bring me down. Nor did I burst into a hoedown or wave my hands in the air like I just don't care. Any kind of reaction would be sufficient.    Okay, I am not easily impressed. Not at all. Not even by a magician doing card tricks with his anus. Whether that makes me more \\"metal\\" or less I really don't give a blanking blank. Yes, Sodom is a metal band. Yes, I like metal music. No, I am not going to worship every single metal band in existence because I have to or face trampling from the massive, ignorant hordes of sheep who all feel the need to prove something. This is an OKAY album. But it's nothing special. You could look up about a million billion underground black metal bands and find the same thing in a only slightly different package. Like swapping Coke for Coke Zero: same pisswater, different can but without all the stuff in it!    So Sodom is just that: It's the middle child. It's the band that is good enough to warrant a listen and then move on to anything else. If it were any worse, people would flock to in the same amazement people flock to a man thinly spread across the street after a horrifying automobile accident like butter on toast. And if it were any better people would swarm the way they do to hearing \\"FREE POPSICLES\\" on the street when it's a hundred and four out. So in a way, this album just shows that if you are good enough, but not great, you too can receive the same indifference I feel for this album.     Maybe their other stuff is better, I will have to hear it.
B0002KPIKA|3.0|I won't bother to repeat any of the historical information on this very musical opera.  I enjoy Baroque opera, both Handel and Vivaldi especially.    But the staging and costumes were just horrible!!  True fright wigs, awful dresses, no sets, lighting cast on screens which made the actors look weird.  Terrible.
B0010DRYRI|5.0|I originally panned the two-sided DVD but recently bought the Blu-Ray so I'm totally redoing my review. The Blu-Ray is, as I have stated above, GORGEOUS!!! Colors are crisp and vibrant and the music is wonderfully clear. Is it possible that Blu-Ray could be better than the theatrical release itself? I can only imagine how this would sound with a personal theater sound system!

B002866UOE|3.0|I'm a fan and while on previous CDs, I could press repeat on any track and be happy for it to play over and over, with THE END, there are only three or four songs that had the same effect on me (e.g., track 1). Even then, the track 1 single that has been playing on the radio for months now has something like a minute of random narration before the song starts up. While this maybe an attempt to be \\"artsy,\\" I want to listen to music right away, not a message with no beat. If I want a book on tape, I'll buy that. Otherwise, it does seem to me that they really went into techno influenced music big time. The rhythm is really lost in many of the tracks by strange changes tempo and suprise breaks for \\"deep voice\\" narration. I don't mind the socially influenced songs if they have a good melody (like a few tracks on the second CD to a lesser extent), but for a group that's known for pop, the techno mixes really through me (especially, tracks, 2-7).
1439157383|1.0|UPDATED TO ADD SPOILER ALERT!!!  Thanks, Emma, for letting me know!<br /><br />I thought of giving this book two stars because of the concept.  Also, because it is rare to find a book that gets worse by the chapter.  The concept of telling the stories from seven different points of view promises to be interesting, but ends up just seeming lazy.  The author doesn't really flesh out the characters enough to give them each a unique point of view, so it ends up that she is just telling the same story more than once.<br /><br />Aside from the implausibility of the book as a whole (several knowledgeable reviewers have commented on the rigorous rules governing organ donations, especially from donor children), the ending is the biggest cop out to resolving a story ever!  And, even if you are okay with the ironic-tragic ending, the last/epilogue chapter (the first time we hear from the sister directly) is even more ridiculous.  Are we supposed to believe that Kate not only rose from her death bed but pirouetted out of it to become a dance teacher?  Are we to believe that, without any intervention other than his father telling him that he knows what he did, the brother stops being an arsonist and becomes a cop?  The father has a brief spate of alcoholism but then is okay? Nonesense!<br /><br />I think the bigger crime is that the book did not explore some of the more interesting, but perhaps less dramatic themes-for instance, that of the brother, whose childhood is cut short by his ailing sister, but who has no direct role to play in her illness because he is not a good genetic match.  Instead, the author does a halfhearted attempt at a love-lost; love-found story between the lawyer and the court liaison, which is also never really fleshed out very well.<br /><br />C'mon!  If you are going to write a book about something this compelling, don't be so lazy about it!  Do the research, take the time to develop the characters, and write a good book instead of a marketable movie treatment!
B00005JPNY|5.0|No movie will ever be as good as a book, namely because you're not making it. For a movie to be as good as a book for a specific person, that specific person has to make the movie. That said, the movie is saved by the actors. Although passing of the movie is a bit off (and the ending is a let down, especially now that we're pretty much assured of there not being a sequal) and the substance may be thought of as a cop out regarding going the safer route of not making more explicit reference to the evils of the church (regardless of what you're opinion is, if the book makes specific reference, you're going to offend anyway, so better to make the movie closer to the book), the actors, especially Dakota, saved the movie in my mind. The newcomer's passion comes through her eyes and makes every scene she's in great to see.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Heh.

I was rooting for them from the very beginning.  Sam is up there with Edward and Jace in my book.  I love that from the very start he was careful with Grace. Their relationship is romantic and sweet. I never minded the long amounts of time they spend in this book doing absolutely nothing because I felt like I was in the room with them. Weird but true. The storyline is a take on the werewolf story that I have not heard before.  I like Maggie's version of werewolves. I am sure that you will too.  Two friends have already gone out to buy the book this morning after hearing how much I enjoyed it.  This book is the first in a three part series and I can not wait for the Fall of 2010 to see where the story takes us next.
031606792X|2.0|I love this series, but my heart literally broke with how wrong it ended. I believe the author was trying to finish the saga too quickly and so put a million different, unrealistic endings to the entire story. Way too far-fetched in my opinion. If Ms. Stephanie Meyer wants to take this one back, I hope she does. I think we will all forgive her if she re-writes this catastophy and maybe even fit in another book.

1416550534|5.0|The book reminded me of THE THIRTEENTH TALE and also REBECCA...set in London during the time the wealthy had housemaids and servants.<br /><br />It reminded me of THE THIRTEENTH TALE because it was an elderly person telling the story of her life from a housemaid to a lady's maid to being an archelogist.<br /><br />It reminded me of REBECCA because of the time and the life style...love, murder, family, loyalty is all wrapped up into a fantastic read.<br /><br />ENJOY!!  I loved it....didn't want it to end.
B0021L8UPI|4.0|I didn't want to see the Orphan until I read a spoiler review that gave away the ending. I would normally never read such a thing, but I had no intention of seeing this flick until it hit DVD. The concept behind the twist intrigued me enough to shell out some money and see this movie at matinee price. I wish I hadn't known the secret while watching the film, but I still was entertained thanks to some fine acting from both leads and a great performance from the little girl who played the evil Esther. Isabelle Fuhrman was only 11 or so at the time this was filmed, but as far as child actors go, she was the best I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />I have a couple of gripes. I hated all the times the music built up and the camera zoomed in behind a character only to find there was nothing there in the first place. I know it's a horror movie, but they managed to avoid most other cliches, so why keep throwing this one around? The film is also about 15 minutes too long and I thought the last 1/4 or so dragged a little bit.<br /><br />The weird and unique twist ending, along with the acting, elevated the Orphan from 2 and 1/2 to a 4 star rating from me. The movie reminded me of The Good Son with Macualay Culkin at times, but this one has a much more serious mean streak, most of which involving young kids. This is rated R for a reason. It's way more brutal than I thought it was going to be, especially in the murder scenes commited by the child.<br /><br />Overall, Orphan was worth the five bucks I paid to see it and it definitely should be a rental for any horror or suspense fan in the near future.
0312370849|5.0|Excellent author...everything flowed smoothly...too bad history wasn't as smooth and kind.<br /><br />The book was about when France was occupied and specifically V&eacute;l d'Hiv when the French police were instructed to carry out the horror at the camps by the Germans...July 16, 1942, was the roundup of Parisian Jewish Citizens.<br /><br />It makes you cry and hope that history won't repeat itself
B000X16OPQ|5.0|Great DVD, anyone who trashes it, is just bitter. Video quality isn't perfect, but not bad. Audio is fine. Amy though is at her best. I've not seen her 100% lucid for an entire performance until now. She jokes with the crowd, is full of rhythm, animated (for Amy) and is spot on vocally. Backup guys are just the best as always... a very, very fun concert, we smiled the whole way through. Highly recommended if you're an Amy Winehouse fan!
0385341008|4.0|Pretty good...a little confusing with so many characters, but not bad. Setting is on an island off of Great Britain during WWII and the characters were writing back and forth to each other and met a few times on the island.
0061231401|5.0|This book started a little stale and quickly action thrillertook off! Didn't want to put it down. I got caught up in the suspense and the characters. Great read!
0061765236|5.0|A little depressing...everyone was so perfect and so happy and the ending was so very sad. You never know how some people think about their situations and how they consider solving them.<br /><br />All in all I really liked it...it was the second Jodi Picoult book I had read.
B00288KNLS|2.0|...yet this is being touted for children all over the place. Let's face it, we live in a time where adults are so self-centered that a movie about a child wanting to seek escape from preoccupied, self-absorbed parents for a better, ideal version only to have that turn into a nightmare (so it's best to stick with the lousy parents one has, right?) is a pretty pathetic premise for a children's story.    But this is just one aspect.      Coraline is a strange kid. She's very angry, bitter, sarcastic, quick to act out and storm off and not all that likable. She's also strangely not a girl, but not quite a tom-boy. I don't know what she is. An \\"adultified\\" child with no real set gender. That's the best way to describe her.      But it gets worse. We have a whole host of sour, negative, non-life-affirming characters and two old ladies who were former burlesque dancers, if not strippers--and one with weird, enormous boobs of which there is one stage scene where it's borderline porn and I'm hardly a prude.    My question is: what does this have to do with a story that's supposedly for kids?    There's much violence and lots of scary imagery. Stuff I believe is just not right for the young. They have lots of time to enjoy the plethora of violence in our media. Why start so early?    What really disturbs me are the people that are putting this out and the film reviewers raving over this monstrosity.    This film should be a PG-13 at best. It reminds me of PAN'S LABYRINTH--which is actually better than this strange story about ideal parents turning into monsters and real parents who are self-absorbed and negative but, hey, they are better than the option! \\"So be happy, Coraline, go away and let me get back to my lap top and cell phone.\\" seems to be the message.     This is the whole point of the movie, folks. And to think we once had  a world where the adults were concerned about children seeing the famous death scene of a doe's mother in BAMBI.    It's shuddering to see thatnot only is something like this marketed to children, but that the adults doing the promoting are oblivious to its strange, dark, and disturbing message.     Parents be warned.    (I would have rated this one star were it not for the artistic merits.)
0375842209|5.0|What a great book even with all the heartache and pain of the characters....the characters are unforgettable....I didn't want the book to end......the idea of death being narrator was quite unique.<br /><br />I can't believe this is a YA book, though....I think it is pretty intense.
630587493X|2.0|Yet another retelling of the Pinochio story about a robot (Robin Williams) who strives to become human. In the process he gains self-awareness, invents artificial organic-mechanical hybrid organs, learns to love and eventually die. What he strives for is humanity and I have to question, what is so great about being human that one would give up a rich, productive and essentially immortal life and choose to die? That is the central point of the movie and the explanation is filled with lots of sentimental new-age platitudes that are heaped on top of this movie with cynical smugness. The screenwriters primary job seems to be to manipulatively reinforce the belief that humans are somehow innately superior by the simple fact of their humanity and all that entails. I'm just not buying it. This is at best middle brow entertainment masquerading as humanist discourse and is Robin Williams second most icky role (see the insufferable Patch Adams for his worst), being filled with ridiculous \\"moving\\" and \\"noble\\" speeches on the virtue of humanity, blah blah blah. Mr. Data wants his motivation back. But then what did I expect? This is big budget Hollywood entertainment so be prepared not to have your heartstrings tugged, but yanked and yanked hard. I don't have the time to wallow in sentimental drivel and I wish I could have the time I spent watching this thing back.

B001FB55H6|3.0|I've ordered three Blu-ray movies from Amazon.com and each one of them was sent in a bubble envelope mailer instead of a cardboard box.  Each one of the movies arrived with slight-to-moderate damage to the Blu-ray case (amaray).<br /><br />The present version of the Blu-ray case is relatively flimsy compared to the standard DVD case.  I hope someone comes up with another, sturdier version.  Of course if you buy a Blu-ray at the store and take it home it probably won't suffer the same damage mine did.<br /><br />Amazon -- are you paying attention?<br /><br />I opened the BD case hoping to find a booklet that would list all the bonus content.  Nope.  There ain't one.  But there IS, however, an insert telling us that a 5-disc ultimate collector's edition of the movie is due out in December 2009.  The insert includes directions on how to get a $10 discount on the Ultimate set, but you have to join the studio's rewards program.  There's always a catch, isn't there?  Join the rewards program and they will email you the discount coupon/code a few weeks before the DVD street date.<br /><br />Interesting that this release of \\"Watchmen\\" is an extended cut and that there doesn't appear to be an option to watch the theatrical cut.  What if you are one of the folks that likes the theatrical cut better than the extended cut?  Are you just out of luck?  Will you have to purchase the Ultimate Collector's edition to see the theatrical cut (if it is even included)?<br /><br />We had the same problem with \\"Amadeus\\".  A Director's Cut was released on DVD and, later, Blu-ray that didn't include the option to see the original theatrical cut instead.  Personally I prefer the theatrical cut of that film.  Seems unfair that we grow to love a certain version of a film and then are asked to buy a DIFFERENT version of it if we want to have a copy to own.<br /><br />\\"Watchmen\\" is the same way.  It would have been nice to walk out of the theater knowing we could buy the movie we JUST SAW when it comes out on DVD, perhaps with the option of seeing additional footage too.  But no -- can't do that.<br /><br />It's like a meal at a restaurant where the dish is prepared one way for dine-in customers and a different way for take-out orders.  What if you want take-out but like the dine-in version better?  Sorry.  Too bad.<br /><br />The other issue is the sound mix.

That's for concerts, not home video.  It is especially noticeable in the opening scene.  I live in an apartment with reasonably thick walls, but I still have to play this BD at lower-than-normal volume and turn on the English subtitle track.

B002BIULQ2|5.0|I am a nanny to 3 children, 2 boys and a girl, ages 11, 9 and 7. I figured only the girl would want to see it and at first I was right. Then when asking again all of them wanted to go. I thought it would be an OK movie, with teenage junk in it. Boy was I wrong! This movie was wonderful. It had a good story, with a great meaning behind it that EVERYONE could understand, and it was great for all ages of the kids. Music was terrific too! I'll be buying the movie so we can all enjoy what we missed on it the first time seeing it. Thanks to all that were involved in the making of this movie. It so nice to be able to take the kids to see something that is appropiate for all of them and that they truly enjoyed.
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson the software techie by day, and Neo the computer hacker by night. In the Matrix, Neo waits for an answer of the question of existence as he stares at his computer screen. The answer comes in the form of a message on his screen, and this leads to his meeting a mysterious woman, Trinity, who introduces him to a dimension where reality and illusion are fused. Morpheus is the leader of this group of futuristic warriors, and tries to explain the existence of the matrix,  a type of artificial intelligence system. Morpheus opens Neo's mind to some startling news: that people are being imprisoned in a form of reality, and that Neo is \\"the one\\" who will break this code and free, both physically and spiritually, those who are trapped. Neo certainly has his doubts, but as he examines the world around him, he realizes that this is the chance he's been waiting for, and it seems that destiny has called.     One of the refreshing aspects about the Matrix is there is some \\"meat\\" to a special effects genre that by now has become mostly visual eye candy for the masses, as special effects extravaganzas in the past decade that overdose on CGI could take a lesson from this film. After all, The Matrix is not ALL about special effects, and incorporates a well-crafted conflict within the film's first twenty minutes. There is a certain amount of good versus evil within the film, and nothing is as cut and dry as it appears. Neo's existence is pivotal to the world that Morpheus introduces him to, and there is a certain amount of build up between not only what Neo believes is real and what is illusion, but also what his ultimate fate will be. Neo's uncertainty about the world is the centerpiece for his choice to join Morpheus, and, he has a slight reluctance because he knows once he's in, there's no turning back.    The aggravation with a film like this is the poetic license, the proverbial \\"easy\\" button given once the theme of appearance vs. reality is introduced. After all, many inconsistencies can be explained away by the use of the \\"oh, but it was just part of a dream\\" or \\"it was only in his mind.\\" Because of this, you have to have some \\"logic blinders\\" at certain points, but I guess that is to be expected.     I thought the first two-thirds of the film were the strongest in script, tension, and visual display, but that the last thirty minutes seemed to \\"cave in\\" to the sol-mo \\"shoot `em up\\" style typical of action films. This conclusion is victimized by seemingly never-ending shooting sequences and kung-fu martial arts with blaring techno music in the background. It becomes a bit too repetitive and drawn out.  Still, with its flaws, The Matrix has an adequate mix of edge, fantasy, innovation and philosophy without crossing the bounds of outright insanity, and is vastly superior to the spawn of effects clones spewed out in the past decade.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Love the album.   I've been following the band since they first released their 1st album.   A change is always good.   A good change even better.  This is a feel good cd.  My wife and I enjoy cruisin in the city listentin to the soft base and contagious beats!
B000T2OMX0|5.0|If I were to pick a top ten list of favorite classical works (or groups of works), Bach's cello suites would be on that list.  Bach's ability to provide something of a harmony and counterpoint in pieces for solo instruments is something unequaled in western music and is surely the mark of genius.  That being said, the cello suites, like Handel's Messiah, Beethoven's sonatas, or Mozart's concertos, are works which have been recorded almost to death.    Harmonia Mundi, however, has a knack for recording the best of the young and relative unknowns, many of whom have something new to say about old favorites (Tharaud, Tiberghien, Weisser, et al).  While Jean-Guihen Queyras is a relative unknown among the likes of Yo Yo Ma or Pablo Casals, this recording of the cello suites prooves he is a worthy rival.  In many respects, to my ears he is much preferred to his more famous artists.    Being works for a solo instruments, the cello suites can sound monotonous when played by the average musician.  This is not an issue with Queyras.  The phrasing is always songlike.  The music dances when it needs to dance, and laments when it needs to lament.  The standout piece here would be the Prelude to Suite 3- on paper little more than a succession of arpeggiated chords and a few scales, but in the hands of Jean-Guihen a brilliantly performed piece with forward momentum and heavily contrasting dynamics and moods.  The playing is suave and elegant, and each phrase is lovingly constructed.    If I were to pick one recording which I believed truly captured the pathos which was capable from Bach's score, this would be it.    Regarding sound quality, the flawlessness from Harmonia Mundi is no surprise.    Once in a while I will stumble across a recording that demands I stop, listen, and do nothing else.  This is one of those recordings.  I'm pleased to see Jean-Guihen Queyras's output increasing.  Surely, this set (a bestseller for Harmonia Mundi France) has gained him much recognition as aformidable virtuoso.      This is a can't-miss for any serious lover of Bach.  Curious listeners will also find themselves rewarded by this marvellous playing.
B00192IV0O|4.0|Black Eyed Peas have a unique sound which is good. I don't know if that many people are going to like this CD, or not. The E.N.D. is different from their previous albums. I think The E.N.D. stands out from all of their previous albums. This isn't my favorite Black Eyed Peas album, I really like Monkey Business a lot. The E.N.D. could have been better, some of the songs on this album I could live without, then some other of the songs I really enjoy listening to.

As the TWENTIES GIRL relishes the twenty-first century, she and her hostess begin to discover they have much more in common than they thought especially on what matters in life as each wants to find love someone to love and be loved eternally.<br /><br />This is an amusing paranormal chick lit tale stolen by the zany flapper girl mentality of Aunt Sadie who demands her great niece find her lost necklace that means everything to her and orders her to loosen up and have fun while seeking the \\"One\\".  Lara is terrific as the second banana in spite of being the main character.  Except for the overused lists that are an overkill method in the sub-genre, Sophie Kinsella provides a super jocular yet poignant relationship story.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001U7FWM8|5.0|As a listener of all music (and I really mean ALL) this contemporary album takes me everywhere I want to go, yet never sounds like any of its references.  \\"Southern Point\\" is at times sentimental and nostalgic post-psychedelic rock, but slaps you in the face with something like you've never heard the second you get comfortable.  Grizzly Bear gives its nods to the defining moments of 20th century pop with arching vocals and a tad of doo-wop (that they do so well) in singles \\"Two Weeks\\" and \\"Cheerleader.\\"  But as a music lover who is always interested in the less-conventional side of things, Grizzly Bear does that too--coming out of nowhere with songs like \\"Fine For Now\\" and \\"I Live With You\\" (perhaps my favorite of all).  You're left asking yourself \\"What year is it? And what planet am I on?\\"
B001RTKXM8|5.0|What is it about French films that makes the best of them so deeply reflective in a way that few American and British films achieve? Maybe it's that France itself is such a beautiful and evocative country, maybe it's that the French have a lifestyle that, for us non-French, appears so stylish and romantic... whatever... but when they get it right they really are in a different class, and \\"Paris\\" most definitely gets it right.    Beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted, and underpinned by a superb soundtrack, the film explores \\"real\\" peoples' lives slowly and above all subtly. Not a great deal happens, and there are no conclusions to the stories involved - a guy gets diagnosed with a life threatening heart condition, another chap falls in love with one of his students, a lonely single mother and a market stall trader are hesitantly drawn together, and an African dreams of getting to Paris to start a new life. That's about it really. But it's the way that this is all put together & explored that makes the film, and which achieves its objective of trying to capture what Paris is to people who live there or dream of living there - which of course means that its infused with their, often vague, hopes & fears and it has no clear & tidy \\"Hollywood style\\" endings... life's not like that.    At times funny, at times charming, and ultimately quite moving, Klapisch directs the film without reverting to heavy-handed sentimentality or high drama to make his points.... in fact, exactly the opposite: witness the fleeting, beautifully poignant shot at the end of the film as the African compares the view on the postcard of Paris that has driven him to make his journey there, and which underpins his hopes for the future, with the reality of it... nothing more needs to be said or filmed to capture what he must be feeling.    Perhaps the greatest credit to \\"Paris\\" is that, even though it's two hours long, subtitled (which is never the easiest way to watch a film), and devoid of any clever plot twists or unexpected surprises to hold your attention, by the end of it all... you really don't want it to end. It's that good.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Just to clarify, there's a lot of things going for this little strobe, ease of use, from i-TTL (and with BackLight) to Manual modes, 3 groups, 4 channels, endless numbers of wireless strobes combined etc. Everything that need to be said has already been said with it's on paper improvements. It definately delivers more power than the SB-800 and is definately easier to use as well. The only thing that bothers people perhaps is the size, yes it's larger than the SB-800. It doesn't bother me the slightest, it is very well made. I rarely use it as on camera flash, and prefer to use it as remote on stands and clamps whenever possible...    There's a lot of people selling their used SB-800s at higher (same price as SB900)prices on Ebay. For those of you who are worried about the thermal cut-off problem, well don't be or I could be extrememly lucky. The new 5.02 update for strobes \\"brand new\\" with the firmware 'already installed' are good to go. Why are they selling their SB-800? Profit and to buy the newer SB900s..... probably!     So what warrants me to say this, well I have four, and just for fun, I set them off at 200mm zoom and fired them off continuously for a good two minutes (no one shoots this way)for as fast as it could recycle. Does the temperature go up, what do you expect? Does it cool down... fairly quickly.... Yes!     Mine is not so much a review but an update for those who may be buying today. I went ahead with the thermal cut-off problem in mind and purchased two... it was good and already had the 5.02 firmware installed.... and then bought another pair (same firmware). All good. Just so you know and help you make up your mind when purchasing. I know those of you who purchased ones earlier with the problem maybe upset, I would be too!    This strobe has had a lot of stick for its earlier days (or months) but it's teething problems seems to be over. I use them with the eneloop AA batteries and takes four. Happy lighting and hope you have the same good experience.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|\\"Watchmen\\" is visually arresting - it has action, humor, and it provokes some thought, so there's a good mix here, if you like a little meat with your parsley. While the\\"director's cut\\" clocks in at just over three hours, it's well paced.  Like other people have said, it's not a \\"popcorn flick\\". Be forewarned - it ain't \\"X-Men\\".<br /><br />Just don't let anyone tell you \\"it's like nothing you've seen before\\"!  I'm not arguing where certain concepts may have  originated,  but if you've seen a lot of movies, you'll see the influences here:  \\"Dark City,\\"  \\"The Incredibles,\\" \\"Mystery Men,\\"  \\"Seven,\\"  (think about it - put John Doe in a mask, and you pretty much get Rorschach),  \\"Fight Club,\\"  Julie Taymor's \\"Titus,\\"  the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy, \\"Sin City,\\" \\"Batman Begins/The Dark Knight,\\" heck, even the live version of \\"The Tick\\"...

0307588335|4.0|This is a great chronicle of the demise of Lehman Brothers - the place I called home for six years.   Mr. McDonald discusses all of the events leading up to the failure in intricate detail.      As he mentions, Lehman was a champion of Diversity.  This was reflected in diversity of ethnicity, diversity of gender, diversity of sexual orientation, etc.  Regrettably there was no diversity of thought.  His experiences show this detail at the highest levels of the firm, but in truth it existed throughout.  Only those with similar backgrounds, similar educations and similar opinions were promoted.  I was so frustrated with this lack of meritocracy that I left the firm for another opportunity in May of 2008.  Little did I know that acting on my frustration would shield me from much of the damage.    I highly recommend this book - specifically as a lesson in the dangers of hubris.  When those in power are no longer willing to even entertain the possibility that they may be wrong then failure is the inevitable outcome.
B0021L8UPI|5.0|\\"There's something wrong with Esther,\\" say the ads for \\"Orphan,\\" and indeed, there is. I could just end the review with that, as it does pretty much tell you everything you need to know about the main character, an adopted girl who promises heaven and delivers hell. But then I'd miss out on the opportunity to tell you about all the other great things it has to offer. This is a truly great horror movie, ambitious enough to be frightening and absorbing, confident enough to toy with the conventions we know all too well, mature enough to rely on the talents of actors instead of the sex appeal of teenagers. Its greatest achievement is transcending the cliché that is the precocious yet evil child, and while I'd like to elaborate on that, I'm afraid the nature of the plot doesn't allow for such details. Regardless, what happens is most likely not what you think will happen, which is to say that you'll actually be surprised.    Esther is played by Isabelle Furhman, a twelve-year-old playing a nine-year-old, although age doesn't count much here. She speaks with a flawless Russian accent and masterfully runs the emotional gamut between sweet and sadistic. Esther is a consummate manipulator, able to advertise herself as the nicest girl you'd ever want to raise as your own before switching gears and making those who stand in her way suffer. We first see her sitting all alone in the classroom of an orphanage, painting a colorful and happy picture that tells a story. Her dress is nice, if a little old fashioned, and the ribbons she has tied around her neck and wrists make her look like a princess. When she smiles, it's not the toothy perfection of a mouthwash commercial but a real girl's smile--so cute and innocent and loveable. Her words are eloquent, and she definitely possesses a wisdom beyond her years. Maybe the trauma of losing her parents back in Russia has forced her to grow up a little too fast.    For these very reasons, she immediately attracts the attention of a couple looking to adopt after a miscarriage claims the life of their third baby. Here enters Kate and John Coleman (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), who both carry a lot of baggage. Kate, once a successful piano teacher, is a recovering alcoholic who feels nothing but guilt. John, an architect, is a nice enough guy but takes everything at face value, a character flaw that ultimately proves disastrous.    Esther is adopted. Now things start to get tense. At school, she's made fun of for her clothing and her old, dilapidated Bible, and she screams bloody murder when someone goes to touch the ribbon on her neck. At home, she's hated by the Coleman's son, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), who rightfully feels ignored by his parents. She soon forms an unhealthy bond with the Coleman's deaf young daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer), who eventually sees things that no little girl should ever have to see. As for the relationship between Esther and Kate, it gets progressively worse while the relationship with John gets progressively better. But Kate knows that there's something wrong with Esther, and it has nothing to do with the little things like dropping an F-bomb; it has to do with serious things, like Esther being present when her mean schoolmate falls from the top of a playground set and breaks her ankle.    One of the nuns from the orphanage, Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), seems to think Kate is on to something: \\"Trouble has a way of finding her,\\" she says of Esther, believing that a mistake might have been made in the adoption process. But what if they were nothing more than accidents? What if Kate is wrong? Is it possible that she's venting her resentments on a girl who has been through a lot? Is it possible that she should be back in rehab? Kate's therapist, Dr. Browning (Margo Martindale), seems to think so, and apparently, so does John. But what about their children? Let's just say they know more than care to admit. Think of it in terms of one of Esther's paintings; when you lookit in a different light, you'll find that a completely different story is being told.    \\"Can you keep a secret?\\" the ads ask us ominously, if not altogether unexpectedly. Indeed, you should keep the film's big revelation to yourself, even if you found it unconvincing. Suspension of disbelief is required of you, yes, but fortunately, this is one of the few recent horror films that earns it. Why? Because the story doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks--it's a thriller that actually thrills. There are moments that seem to be leading up to a tired horror cliché, only to throw us off guard with ... nothing. When a door or a medicine cabinet is opened, blocking the camera's view, what do you expect to see in the shot when the door closes? In this movie, you're never sure whether or not someone will suddenly appear out of nowhere. If it does happen, chances are it's for reasons other than a quick scare.    The more lasting scares involve Esther, who at one point or another makes use of a hammer, a gun, a vice, a knife, a pillow, a retractable blade, and a match with a bottle of lighter fluid. Even a car rolling backwards down a hill in neutral finds its way into the story. As has been repeatedly said, there's something wrong with Esther, a girl who makes little Rhoda from \\"The Bad Seed\\" seem like an amateur. \\"Orphan\\" is a first class shocker that begins with a nervous whisper before building to a cry and ending with a scream. Director Jaume Collet-Serra and writers Alex Mace and David Leslie Johnson actually made an effort; yes, their film is scary, and yes, their film is disturbing, but more to the point, their film is engaging.
B000E5N62U|5.0|There is no sense arguing  whether Morph The Cat is a good album. Either you like Donald Fagen's high end jazz pop or you don't. The music is well written and immacualtely played: that is a given. More interesting is if Morph The Cat works as a concept album about post 9/11 New York. This is debatable.<br /><br />Obviously, the title track, \\"Mary Shut The Garden Door,\\" and a lot of the other pieces here contain obvious referances. But then there is \\"H gang,\\" and \\"What I Do.\\" On the surface, these, and others, have no connection to  New York life after the towers fell.<br /><br />Or do they? \\"Jade Pagoda Of Fun,\\" seems like an almost-trite love song until you consider the idea that the lovers are looking for a hiding place, safe from the storm clouds outside. \\"Mona,\\" dances inside all night. Where was she dancing on 9/10/01? Fagan gets love advice from Ray Charles--is he going back into his teenage mind, trying to escape the modern threats of New York City? Who knows?<br /><br />You're walking a fine line when you use the term concept album for Morph The Cat. It is obviously not in the 60s/70s sense that Tommy or Preservation Acts 1&2 are. There is no linier story. But themes emerge: facing death, goverment control, and escaping into one's own apartment, pagoda, or fantasy. The towers are no longer standing, but a big, benevolent feline has taken their place.<br /><br />There is not a huge sense of menice outlined by Fagan here. In many ways, those September morning attacks feel like a long, long time ago, and the panic has long left the Big Apple. We have adjusted, maybe even gotten too complacant. Fagen does not use a storyline to deal with this, but uses small details, seperate vingettes, to speak about how 9/11 still impacts us subtlely, with almost invisable changes we may not even be consious of.<br /><br />His intention or not, the album completely works on this level. Of course, the music is exceptional as always.<br /><br />An album to buy, as pleasing to the ears as stimulating to the mind.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|It's mind boggling how Modonna stays on top of the game.  This tour is just simply insanely ridiculous and I mean that in the most complementary manner.  Just wow!
0786948523|2.0|If you ever looked at the info on this book it claims to have 500+ monsters in it, this is both a lie and not a lie.    It is a lie: if you think of different monster meaning \\"skull lord and orc\\"  It is not a lie: if you think of each monster in it as different like \\"orc raider and orc bezerker are 2 different monsters\\"     That statement was made meaning the latter.    One thing upon opening it to the CR section is that you will realize that if you compare it to the 3.5 monster manual that the 4th edition book has 8 monsters to fight for brand-new heroes while the 3.5 monster manual had over 2 dozen!
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell weaves facts, statistics and linguists in a way that is easy to read and understand. I highly recommend this book to educators. In Chapter 8: Rice Paddies and Math Tests, the author theorizes that one reason Asians consistently outperform westerners on math tests has something to do with linguistics: \\"Four-year-old Chinese children can count, on average, to forty. American children at that age can count only to fifteen,\\" because of the brevity of Chinese number words. This concept, while new to me, makes sense. The underlying premise of this book is basically, the harder one works, the luckier s/he gets (not a new concept) and that approximately 10,000 hours invested in any discipline or endeavor will likely result in the type of success that others are quick to dub \\"genius.\\" I was fascinated by Chapter 4 in which Gladwell makes  comparisons between Robert Oppenheimer and Chris Langan, suggesting that Oppenheimer's great success was due to his ability to be articulate and charming. There are also lessons within for parents who want to raise successful children.
1402714580|5.0|My mom has an old copy of Little Women at her home but since my husband is in the military and we move frequently, I wanted my own copy that I felt comfortable packing and shipping. This book is beautiful and I'm so happy to have it in my collection. I love the cover illustration and I'm just really pleased with this purchase overall. It seems really durable so I think it would be an excellent choice for young women.
B00004XPPC|5.0|Arguably the best dramatic war film about WWII in the Pacific.  There's no arguing, though, that this film was exceptionally well made and eagerly viewed by audiences around the world in the late 1950s.  Not only did the film win several Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Producer, & Best Cinematography, but it also won a number of British and other foreign film & acting awards.<br /><br />The awards were neither gratuitous nor for lesser known film categories.  The acting was stellar with Sir Alec Guinness (also of Obi Wan Kenobi \\"fame\\" in the Star Wars trilogies) & Sessue Hayakawa rendering powerful performances as the British & Japanese senior officers, respectively, at the Kwai POW camp.  Jack Hawkins & William Holden give strong performances as well, although in much smaller parts -- Holden was the only well known American actor in the film, by the way.<br /><br />The story is slow in parts by today's fast-paced standards, but the plot has a few twists, especially at the POW camp that enables the story to build to a stunning climax.<br /><br />The Colonel Bogey March, the most popular & memorable of the songs from the musical score was a best seller after the film was released.  It wasn't written expressly for the film; in fact, the \\"March\\" was written by a British band master in the early 1900s.  It was, however, a tune that many people whistled after viewing the movie.<br /><br />For those who find film adaptations of popular books to be at odds with each other, I think that those who've read Pierre Boulle's book before or after seeing the movie were the beneficiaries of a double treat.  Both were excellent works.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  Who knows?  It just might give you the urge to whistle!
B001FB55I0|2.0|I won't add any spoilers here for those of you who don't know how the movie ends. I liked the movie... until the end. What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me. Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful album.. she is PERFECT!!! Her songs contain very beautiful melodies that her voice tackles very well. i love it    The emotion in her voice is heartbreaking, she is singing beautifully sweet and then like nothing her voice turns into this powerful instrument with such rawness that makes chills go down your spine! she is absolutley wonderful. My Favorite song is Wasted, it's an absolute jem. The Story, Have You Ever, Cannonball Until I Die and Shadow On The Wall are some other absolute DIE-HARD favorites. The're ALL amazing!    I Love This woman. BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I loved The Big Lebowski. The Dude isn't quite an anti-hero, or a reluctant hero, or really a hero at all, and I really liked the way he just got drawn into such a weird plot simply because of his name. What really made the movie interesting, though, was how well it played with all the elements of the private detective genre without really having a private detective. Think of Jack Nicholson in Chinatown, but make him a stoner and a bowler who likes white Russians, and you'll get The Big Lebowski.    Also, it's the minor characters who make this movie really shine. Walter is brilliantly written and acted, and the bit characters like Donny and the actual Big Lebowski never stop being funny. I especially liked the Big Lebowski's executive assistant, who reminded me of Mr. Smithers from The Simpsons. It's no wonder this thing has become a cult classic.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Hands down the greatest piece of film I've ever seen. This isn't a series you would only want to watch once. I watch the whole series at least 3 or 4 times a year. Anyone who gave this less than 5 stars either was sent a defective product or isn't American because if you don't enjoy Band of Brothers you obviously don't have the American spirit that drove the US to victory in W.W.II. You won't regret buying this, I promise!
B000001EUP|5.0|What can I say; I was a freshman in high school and this album literally changed my life! I heard the opening screaming note of \\"No One Like You\\" roar out of the stereo from the back seat of my mom and dad's '78 Toyota Celica and yelled to my parents,\\"Wow! Turn that up!\\" I'm 43 now and have been a Scorpions fan ever since. As soon as I had saved up some cash, I went to my local record store to purchase this album and was pleased to find that \\"No One Like You,\\" the album's AOR hit, was not the only great song; in fact, they are ALL GREAT! Dieter Dierks production is immaculate and proves that there's something to be said for analog recording technology after all. Every song is a gem, and, this album, like virtually all Scorpions albums, contains a splendid mix of fast, moderate and slow tunes.     This album is the pinnacle of Matthias Jabs guitar work. In fact, I would argue that this is perhaps the most fierce guitar work ever recorded on an AOR friendly, hard rock album, excepting maybe Van Halen's \\"Women and Children First\\" and \\"Van Halen I.\\" I read in an interview that Jabs recorded the album on a late 60's Les Paul, one too valuable to take on the road (hence, the use of the flashier looking, striped Gibson Explorers for the live shows).     This album has appeal across ages, genders and musical tastes (the title track, \\"Blackout,\\" is my three-year old son's favorite song). I could go on and on about the quality of this recording but my words would still fall short of expressing the hard-rock mastery that is \\"Blackout.\\" Amazingly, as great as this album is, I personally feel that 1979's \\"Lovedrive\\" album is even better. Do yourself a favor and purchase both \\"Blackout\\" and \\"Lovedrive.\\" Once tasted, you will find your appetite for more Scorpions to be insatiable. Tracing their roots back to 1966,truly, Scorpions are among the progenitors of hard rock/heavy metal music.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|This 6th movie in the Harry Potter series is tough to follow if you haven't seen the previous films. It picks up right where [[ASIN:B000W7F5SS The Order of the Phoenix]] ended, with characters all but lunging forward without backstories explained at all. If you are unaware of the importance of Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter) for example, you'll not know why she is so intent of killing Harry.<br /><br />It makes \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" into a transitional film ala [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back]]The tone moves from whimsical to dark, adolscence can be dangerous, and there are things about your family you may not want to know. This time, it is James Broadbent who carries secrets about the Dark Lord Voldemort that Harry and Dumbledore must find out. Ron and Hermione have trouble with love. Professor Snape (Alan Rickman, getting more from this role than ever) gets to slither into his darkness. And finally, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton, who finally gets to act instead of posture) reveals where his hatred of Harry originates.<br /><br />With all these \\"dark secrets revealed,\\" \\"The Half Blood Prince\\" doesn't answer them. The movie is still dazzling (the river of souls is amazing) and Hogwort's still inspires. The gang is acting their ages and getting up to age appropriate mischeif. But the movie ultimately stalls out...making it the weakest of the series so far.
B00005QBER|5.0|I first learned of the \\"Lovedrive\\" album in 1982 through Hit Parader magazine. Hit Parader used to have a feature in which a then-contemporary rock star would rate his/her top ten albums of all time. I was into Iron Maiden then and was intrigued when Dave Murray, Iron Maiden guitarist and the  featured album ranker in one issue of Hit Parader, rated \\"Lovedrive\\" by Scorpions as one of his favorite albums. I had recently been turned onto Scorpions through the success of the \\"Blackout\\" album (another great recording)and was curious as to why Murray thought so highly of Scorpions \\"Lovedrive.\\" I was already a fan of Scorpions but only owned the \\"Blackout\\" album. I thus sought out the \\"Lovedrive\\" album based on Dave Murray's recommendation and my own love of \\"Blackout.\\" When I found \\"Lovedrive\\" in my local record store, I was blown away by the album cover (what high school freshman boy wouldn't have been?); in fact, I felt that I was getting away with something illegal even being able to purchase the album as a minor. Can you say, \\"breast?\\" I knew you could.     All kidding aside, Dave Murray was right about \\"Lovedrive.\\" This album has to rank as one of the best rock records ever made; perhaps THE best hard rock album ever. The mixture of heartfelt (not cheesy) ballads, pure rocking metal, mid-tempo AOR prototype \\"hits,\\" immaculate production and arguably the best song writing ever produced by Scorpions, make this a must have recording.     Coming at the juncture of what I term \\"Early Scorpions\\" (with Ulrich Roth) and \\"Classic Scorpions\\" (the hit producing version of the band), this album reveals a group poised for the big time but not quite there yet in 1979; at least not in the U.S. market. Though the Ulrich Roth material from 1974-1978 is fantastic and foundational for any serious rock guitarist, 1979's \\"Lovedrive\\" marked the departure of Roth and the '70's vibe. In came a newer, more polished, more modern (at the time) sound that was ready-made for public consumption.Obviously, Scorpions would go on to greater fame after 1979, but never greater writing, production and musicianship all in one package. Like Dave Murray, I highly recommend \\"Lovedrive.\\"     I'll go one step further and recommend all Scorpions albums from 1972 - 1985 (I'm a fan of ALL their efforts but the average consumer should probably focus on the Scorpions music within these years). Keep in mind, if you purchase any Scorpions albums produced before 1979's \\"Lovedrive\\" album, you are getting a different experience. Roth era Scorpions is essentally a more progressive band; well worth checking out if you appreciate great musicianship, but not the slick, \\"pop\\" hard rock of the 80's. Pre-Lovedrive Scorpions were a band of great musicians, ultimately divided by divergent goals. Rudolph Schenker and Klaus Meine seemed to focus on the goal of hitting the proverbial \\"big-time (check out the song \\"Top of the Bill\\" from the \\"Intrance\\" album) whereas, Ulrich Roth was idealistically focused on producing music that appealed to his soul. This noticeable division in style and purpose made for great hard rock albums with a twist of diversity; however, the unified goal was lacking. Conversely, Scorpions from \\"Lovedrive\\" onward reflect musicians on a common mission to become superstars; a mission in which they succeeded.    By the way, I would like to offer a correction to a previous reviewer who said that the solo in the song,\\"Always Somewhere,\\" was performed by Matthias Jabs. I'm quite certain that it was performed by Rudolph Schenker.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline (NOT Caroline) Jones (Fanning) is a very unhappy girl.  Both her parents are far too busy to pay much attention to her; she misses her friends back home; and the young boy who lives next door is a real pest.  The only solace she finds in her new apartment is a strange door that appears to be bricked up...until the sun goes down.  For that's when Caroline gets to go visit her Other Mother, a gracious woman who has all the time in the world for her beloved daughter.  There's just one little hitch: Coraline's Other Mother wants her to stay...forever.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is from the mind of Neil Gaiman, so you know it's going to be twisted and disturbing.  And it is; this is one of the more frightening family films ever made.  The imagery is surprisingly horrific; perhaps smaller children won't pick up on the subtleties, but their parents certainly will.  The voice cast, featuring supporting roles by Terri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Keith David, and Ian McShane, helps create an atmosphere of spine-tingling suspense.  The real standout, though, is Dakota Fanning.  In previous film roles, she's been precocious and downright annoying; remember \\"War of the Worlds\\"?  No?  Well, sorry for reminding you.  But here she's fantastic; she does what many voice-over artists fail to do: lend her animated character real life, real personality.<br /><br />The overall effect of \\"Coraline\\" can be a bit numbing (I only gave the film 4 stars because, near the middle, it sags a bit, once the wonder has worn off).  Maybe it's different in 3D; I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet.  (By the way, the DVD--and presumably Blu-ray--comes with both the 2D and 3D version of the film, so you can experience the movie both ways if you prefer.)  However, this is certainly a film you should watch if love a good old fashion Grimm's fairy tale.  That's what Gaiman and Selick have created: a modern-day fairy tale, complete with horrors and morals and a talking cat.
0385341008|4.0|This is one of those books that you buy on a lark because you want something not-very-taxing to read. And then.  And then, you find you can't put it down. There are spots where it's a touch awkward, and the plot is sometimes a little predictable, but the characters are so well drawn you find yourself not minding terribly.  The great wonder of this book is that the authors were able to give each person a unique voice, no small feat considering that this is a series of letters and there are quite a few characters.  I'll read it again, and recommend it liberally.
B0029358GM|4.0|Lead singer/songwriter Jeff Tweedy seems to be no longer obsessed with being a shapeshifter.  Wilco has re-invented itself so many times it's hard to keep track.  The sonic experimentations of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot led to the schizophrenia of A Ghost is Born, which led to the quiet, subdued (some would say, boring) Sky Blue Sky.  One never knew what to expect from the next record, and it's been hard for even the most die-hard Wilco fan to follow Tweedy down each path he took.    Wilco (the album) seems to be an attempt to strip away the chameleon-like feeling of the past albums and to let listeners know more about the \\"real\\" Wilco, the one that is interested in simple melodies, creative rhyme signatures, and just a twinge of country.  To me it's akin to Radiohead's album In Rainbows, in which the band took all of the experimentation they did before and used it on a set of songs where they realized they no longer had anything to prove.  The music can stand on its own without unnecessary whistles, bells, angst, or other masks that may entice the ears but keep the listener's soul at a safe distance.    Wilco (the album) begins with a love letter to fans in Wilco (the song), which is equal parts tongue in cheek and honest ode, and leads to two more songs which are notable for their lyrics.  Deeper Down is ostensibly the story of a boxer who comes to some sort of metaphysical realization about life, and One Wing has lyrics that will make anyone who has just broken up with someone simply cry.  Bull Black Nova is the Kidsmoke of this album, but is much more focused - a good thing.    The winner of the second half of the album, to me, is I'll Fight, which you will find yourself singing in spite of yourself.  There are very few filler songs on Wilco (the album), and it truly has the best flow since YHF (album flow has never been Wilco's strong suit).  It makes me wish that Wilco's next set will be similar in feel to this, but it's Wilco.  Who the hell knows.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I have a laptop in which the sound output is very low and hard to hear. I travel and watch movies on my laptop. The E5 did nothing to increase the volume levels. I will be searching for another option.
B0028K31CE|4.0|That seems to be the common complaint. It's too short for today's standards. Even so, the quality of music is incredible. Lots of work was put into making this album and it shows. Though it would have been nice had they included an extra 3 songs, even if it did take a bit longer. If you are a Maxwell fan, you will definitely love this album. From the smooth and blue, Bad Habits (my favorite song) to the inspiration help somebody. All the beats and vocals of this album are very unique, something very hard to find nowadays. Definitely recommend it to anyone. 4 stars.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I teach 5th grade, and one of the treats I have given my class over the years was to read a chapter from Coraline by Neil Gaiman.  My students will beg me to please read from Coraline, as I do the voices while I read the story.  This comes in handy when you want them to do their work, but you need a little motivation.  When I heard that it was to be made into a stop motion movie, I was ecstatic.  It was even more exciting to find that the people behind the classic Nightmare Before Christmas would be in charge of bringing this quirky little story to life.  The one apprehension I had was that I create my own voices for characters when I read aloud to my class, and after reading this book aloud for a few years, I had developed my own interpretations of how each character sounded. This is a great story to tell aloud, and it creates a lot of tension which leaves them hanging on begging for more.<br /><br />So how does the movie compare to the book????  From the very beginning, a reader of the book will notice that there are some differences.  The movie is set in America, while the book is in England.  There is also a new character created for the movie.  You will not find Wybie anywhere in the book.  After watching the whole movie, I can understand why Wybie was placed in the movie.  Without him, Coraline spends a lot of time talking to herself.  While that may work fine in a book, it doesn't really translate well on film.  Therefore, I think that the inclusion of Wybie helps to carry the narrative along and it also provides a companion for Coraline.  The one thing that annoys me is the fact that the character of the Other Mother is nothing like I portrayed her when reading the story to my class.  This is not really a criticism, it's just that I had created my own version of her in my head, and it didn't correlate with the version in the film.  I'm not complaining about this, it was just a little bit of a distraction for me having read the book many times.  The rest of the characters and the story follow very closely to the book.  Of course the filmmakers had to add some scenes in order to flesh out the story so it could fill the time requirement as a feature film.  I don't think that any of the added material detracts from the story as a whole.  I have never seen a film adaptation of a book that was EXACTLY like the book.  Afterall, they are two different mediums, and each has its own requirements in what will work to tell the story.  This is a great adaptation, and I know that any fan of the book will not be dissatisfied by this movie.<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on the 3-D version:<br />First of all, I would suggest that you read the notice about what settings on your TV will provide the best conditions for a good 3-D viewing experience.  It also works better to view this in a darkened room.  Since this has become a new trend in recent films, I have had the opportunity to see 3-D films both in the theater and at home.  Of course, current home theater technology does not lend itself to the pristine digital 3-D process by which this film was shown in theaters.  However, I will have to say that it is the best 3-D effects I have seen in a home setting.  Needless to say that the 3-D glasses do wash out a lot of the vibrant colors that are present in the 2-D version, but enough of the color is left to enjoy the beautiful artistry that went into the making of this film.  I would suggest that the viewer watch all of the credits, as there are several characters flying around in the background. If you watch all the way to the end of the credits there is a nice little 3-D effect at the very end.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />This is a great interpretation of a wonderful book, and I would heartily recommend this to any viewer.cters and the story follow very closely to the book.

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Here we have a wonderfully produced semi-epic film, with sprawling scenes... film art at its best; however, it really drags in terms of action.<br /><br />In a more positive defense of the film, if you are really into historically-based movies, I think you'll enjoy this one a great deal. But like similar productions such as [[ASIN:B00007G1WH Becket]] and [[ASIN:B000RF7XYY Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots]], in an effort to accurately convey the tale the details here prey heavily upon the final achievement.<br /><br />The Story: It's all about the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry [Tudor] VIII and one of England's most renowned and controversial queens. There's a particular focus on Elizabeth's troubles with both Spain and with the large Catholic population of her country. (Henry VIII had been excommunicated by Pope Clement VII. The King had married the sensual Anne Boleyn, [mother of Elizabeth I] absent the Pope's approval of an annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then Henry subsequently established the Protestant Church of England.) The story also involves Elizabeth's rocky relationship with her Catholic cousin and rival for the British throne, Mary Queen of Scots who was ultimately executed by a malevolent Elizabeth.<br /><br />I feel additionally compelled to remark that the casting for this movie was near-perfect as were the indoor sets and outdoor locations. For this specific reason, I would especially recommend that you view the movie in its widescreen version on the biggest widescreen television you can find.<br /><br />In summary, if history is your thing, you'll likely award this 1 hour and 55 minute film four or five stars. If not, you'll probably be bored to tears.<br /><br />TIP: Many public libraries carry this DVD to loan out free-of-charge... you might consider borrowing it and afterward purchasing it if it turns out that you enjoyed the film.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|i just can not believe that this new star trek movie has been getting rave reviews world wide,have any of you so called fans even seen star trek before? it seems not! yes it's pretty and fast and sexy but it's more like fast and the furious in space then star trek,and for the writers and j.j to just dismiss 40 years plus of trek history and throw it all out the window is a crime against star trek,so go slam this review and say i am hater but i love star trek and this new movie is not star trek.!
B0000TB014|4.0|Love this DVD, bought it a few years ago and lost it. Repurchased again following Michael's untimely death.     Wonderful purchase if you just want the videos, which are fantastic. I'd love a behind the scenes video at some point, but that wasn't the point of this DVD.    The ONLY disappointing omission from this DVD is \\"In The Closet\\" which was not only a great song, but a really great video. Very adult, sexual, and broke a lot of boundaries.    Other than that, a great pickup. Definitely buy.
044024367X|5.0|At last, we get a look inside what is wrong with extremist Christianity. It's fiction of course, and the suspense is over the top! What's with the red calf? Why do right wing Christians want to destroy the Earth? According to Child, and others, they think that they can bring about the apocalypse. Guess they didn't read the Bible. And neither did the whacko in Lee Child's terrific book. In the end, he got his. . .
B001FB55H6|3.0|For the most part, Watchmen is a decent movie. Up until the end of the movie, I was loving every minute of it. The film was staying 98% true to the graphic novel and then it all fell apart within the last hour. Things are cut, changed and the lack of urgency about saving the world is missing. In the novel, there is a real urgency about Dr. Manhattan and his need to return to save the planet, but the emotion of it is lost in the film. The main reason being things being cut, crucial parts being left out, and other plot points being changed (as mentioned before). I had to explain what was happening on screen to help fill the gaps to the others I was watching it with who haven't read the book. That's bad when there are pieces missing I have to fill for the film to make sense.<br /><br />Between the two (book and movie), the book is better. I'd recommend this movie probably more to those who haven't read the novel. That being said, I still liked it overall for the most part. It's not a waste of time, but what could have been a great movie ended up being just good to okay.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|my 10 year old son has never been into star trek but we had watched all of the trailers and couldn`t wait for the movie to come out. we were not disappointed! he now can`t wait for it to come out on dvd , so he can watch it over and over. we are anticipaiting the sequels or maybe even a new tv series!
0307266303|2.0|This book is an interesting read, but it branches off onto too many tangents to live up to its title.  If you can stand the lectures on the crimes of wearing a running shoe (instead of running barefoot!) and running shoe companies, the touting of a vegan diet, and the off the wall anthropological theories (humans evolved as a race of runners so we could chase down antelopes for dinner once in a while), then you will like this book.  I couldn't stand the backtracking in the story line.  It just seemed as if the author took a bunch of articles that he had written for magazines and said, \\"I'll slap them together and call it a book!\\".  About 1/4 of the book is actually dedicated to the telling for the story of the race and of the great runners of the \\"Hidden Tribe\\".
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was not a Doogie Howser fan, and not a fan of musicals... With that in mind, trhis movie, DVD or musical (however you want to categorize it) is witty, entertaining, sarcastically funny and truly original.  You MUST watch this internet phenomenon turned musical DVD!!!
0785123490|4.0|As a kid I was an avid comic book collector and one of my favorites was the Infinity Gauntlet/Wars series.  At the time, the Infinity Wars was out at new stands let me able to collect the short series.  However, I was desired to read the prequel to it.  I did find and buy the Infinity Gauntlet #1 but never invested in more.<br /><br />Move ahead some 15 years later; I decided I needed to get to know the Infinity Gauntlet story.  It is great there was a graphic novel of the entire series in one book at a discounted rate.  I finally read through the story and must admit it lived up to all my imaginations with one exception.<br /><br />That exception is the non-inclusion of the prequel Thano's Quest into this which would have made it much more complete.<br /><br />The artwork is great as you get to see many, many popular Marvel Universe characters duke it out against the almighty Thanos.  You will also see godlike entities in the cosmic universe that are not typical in the X-men, etc books.<br /><br />Overall, this book would have been perfect if it included that Thano's Quest; so I can only give it 4 stars out of 5.
0385341008|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and was so sad when it ended. I wanted to know more about the characters, what happened to them, and so on. And that is so rare in books these days, to have characters you care about and want to learn more about.<br /><br />The author's research was painstaking, about the German occupation of the Channel Islands. What I liked it that she presented both sides--that there were both good and evil Germans, and good/heroic and evil islanders.<br /><br />Anyway, this was a book with a very engaging, interesting and likeable main character, a cast of great supporting characters, and a believable and happy ending.
B0001VV1GK|3.0|Remembering how much I loved my 1970s-era Fisher Price parking garage, I bought this toy for my son's second birthday. He's now almost four, so I have developed some perspective on it. The good news is that he still plays with and enjoys his parking garage two years later. I've liked that it is wood, not plastic, and he has enjoyed incorporating it with his trains, trucks and cars.    The bad news is that the elevator essentially broke after a couple months of play. My son isn't rough with toys, so this was a surprise and a disappointment. It gets stuck going down and an adult is generally needed to push it firmly but gently to the bottom. We've tried to fix it to no avail.    My parents still have that old Fisher Price parking garage. After more than 35 years, it is still going strong. The elevator dings at each floor like it did when I was a kid. And the wrap-around ramp lets you race the cars to the bottom, which is always satisfying. Half the time, we're hunting around for the Plan Toys ramps, which are needlessly removable. Kind of wish my parents would send out the old toy.
0439023483|5.0|To be honest, this book shocked me. I'd been hearing nothing but great reviews about it from everyone, and when the online book club that I belong to selected it to read, I was happy to have a reason to pick it up. I didn't really know anything about it, just that everyone kept saying what a powerful book it is. And they aren't wrong.     The Hunger Games takes place in an undetermined future, in a country that is now known as Panem (once North America). Panem consists of the Capitol, the ruling city, and 12 districts surrounding the Capitol. Once, there were 13 districts, been during an uprising, the Capitol demolished the thirteenth district. As a constant reminder to the remaining twelve districts of its authority and power, each year the Capitol requires a pair of tributes from each district, one boy and one girl, be selected in a reaping and then be sent to participate in the Hunger Games, the ultimate in reality television; the Games are broadcast for the entire country to see. The idea is, each of the 24 tributes are places into the Arena, an ever-changing venue built each year for the Games, and they are forced to fight to the death, until there is only one tribute standing. That tribute's district is then honored for the next year.     Katniss Everdeen, 16, has been providing for her family ever since her father's death in a mining accident. Her best friend, Gale, has been providing for his large family as well. This will be Gale's last reaping. At the age of 18, he will no longer be required to participate if he is not chosen this year. Katniss' younger sister, Prim, barely has a chance of being chosen. At just 12, Prim's name will only be in the reaping once. However, when Prim's name is chosen, Katniss jumps to her defense and volunteers to go in her place. The other tribute from District 12, Peeta, helped Katniss years before, when she was on the edge of starvation, and she hates that she feel that she owes this boy and is still required to kill him ifthe opportunity presents itself.    Beyond this, I don't want to say much more, because any more that I reveal about the story will lessen it's impact when you read it. Needless to say, Suzanne Collins does not sugar-coat the necessity to kill your rivals in the Hunger Games. This is not an easy task for the participants, and Collins makes you aware of that every step of the way. The tributes are all very real, three-dimensional characters, each with their own agenda and tactics for staying alive. Collins does an amazing job of creating the conflicting feelings in Katniss; is it possible that she can be a good person, and a cold-hearted killer at the same time? Underneath the brutality and the crooked means by which the tributes are placed into their predicament, you can't help but feel pity for them; that they are forced into this situation against their will, and are forced to make such adult decisions at such a young age seems almost intolerable for them at times.    With a bleak and sometimes desperate story that is sprinkled throughout with glimpses of hope, Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games is a fast-paced, no holds barred thrill ride of a book, that will leave you literally hungry for more at the last page.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|God, I love Mastodon.  Their rampaging debut album \\"Remission\\" established them as a force to be reckoned with in the metal world, and subsequent releases have done nothing to dull any enthusiasm for their work.  And while people can debate whether their latest release, the concept album \\"Crack the Skye,\\" is their best work--I'd still go with \\"Leviathan,\\" but that's just one man's opinion--there's no disputing that it marks yet another step forward for a band that's made a career out of them.  While this is still undeniably a metal album, it goes even further toward establishing Mastodon as one the most progressive-minded bands in the genre, almost as comfortable with a big melody or an acoustic guitar as a skull-crushing groove.  I read somewhere that this album was borne at least partly out of some heavy LSD use by the band's leaders, which goes a long way towards explaining the hallucinogenic atmosphere that pervades most of the tunes.  The band is also continuing to move towards a somewhat more accessible songwriting style, with recognizable choruses and melodies in pretty much every song--those looking for the uncompromising stomp of \\"Remission\\" may be disappointed, at least initially--but as a tradeoff, they're exploring even more of a dynamic range here than ever before, which is really saying something.  The quality of songwriting here is easily on par with such classics of the past as \\"Master of Puppets\\" or \\"Rust in Peace,\\" and the level of ambition is even higher.<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" starts the proceedings off impressively, opening with a midtempo chug and some surprisingly melodic vocals, steadily building to a wide-open, almost bluesy chorus.  Lest anyone thing the band is losing their edge, though, \\"Divinations\\" is a pretty big contrast, a monstrous rollercoaster of a song that goes right for the jugular with some stabbing thrash-metal riffs and frightful howls, and incorporates touches of melody in the chorus and the guitar solo without sacrificing any of its dark intensity.  Quintessence is the only track here that doesn't quite work--the guitar work is pretty nice, but it veers back and forth between the band's psychedelic and metallic moods without anything ever really catching the ear.  The ten-minute-plus epic \\"The Czar\\", while similar, works significantly better.  It starts out slow and repetitive, establishing a hazy, hypnotic vibe that it abruptly tears asunder about a third of the way through, kicking into high gear with an eyebrow-singeing riff and (most welcome of all) a heavy dose of Brann Dailor's trademark frenetic drumwork, before easing back into a more laid-back feel, highlighted a guitar solo that surely ranks among the band's most tuneful to date.  \\"Ghost of Karelia\\", while it initially doesn't sound like anything to write home about, turns out to the a grower of the first order: between the bottom-heavy guitar work, pummeling drums, and vocals that range from haunting to brutish, the band ensures that you really feel the slow, grinding progressions.  The title track is practically a crash-course in songwriting for metal bands, moving effortlessly back and forth between its monstrously heavy verses and a soaring chorus that will rattle back and forth in your head for days.<br /><br />Of course, in the end everything else turns out to be little more than a warm-up for the incredible, multifaceted epic \\"The Last Baron,\\" which cycles through so many sounds and feels that it's virtually indescribable.  That the musicianship on this song is practically beyond compare is a given, but what's even more impressive is the way everything coheres in spite of its unpredictability, the way it builds and releases tension, and the way the band comes back with another scintillating volley of sound just when there's even the remotest threat of getting boring.  It's a fitting summation of the band's career to date, and has me already rigid in joyful anticipation of the band's next release.  There may be few certainties in life, but a classic Mastodon is album is quickly coming to be among them.fe, but a classic Mastodon is album is quickly coming to be among them.
B00127RAJY|3.0|It is annoying that you can't fast forward the video, but now that I know I have to let it play, I just put it in my DVD and get my shoes on, etc.      As for the workout, some of the exercises seem odd to me.  Level 2 has a lot of exercises in the plank position.  I prefer to switch it up and not be in the same position for three exercises in a row.  I really dislike that.  There are a few exercises that seem bad for your back, especially if you have lower back trouble.  I don't like the walkout push-ups in level one.  If you can't do a push-up in boy position (up on your toes), it does not seem as effective as just doing modified push-ups.  Again, one plank position exercise after another.  I don't like the double-jump jump rope cardio exercise.  I jump rope 30 minutes a day, but I don't come too high off the ground because I don't think the impact on your back, neck and knees is good.  The double-jump roping cardio puts too much strain on my body.        What I like about the video is that I really feel that I had a high-impact workout in a short amount of time.  I do like a lot of the exercises and maybe I just need to replace some of the cardio ones I don't like (i.e. doing \\"butt-kicks\\" instead of the double-jump roping one).  I also love her ab work-outs.  I like the exercises she chose and feel like it's just the right amount.    I mute Jillian's talking and listen to music instead.  While some people may need to be pushed to their limit verbally, I prefer a more positive approach.  The negative \\"Hey Buddy, this hurts and I know it\\" reminder makes it feel more difficult than it really is.      Overall, I'll keep switching around between levels 1, 2 and 3 and replace some of the exercises I don't like with some I do.
B000ION79Y|3.0|After watching Into the Sun earlier we had the opportunity to make it a double feature Saturday when Attack force also came on tv hours later. Being the Seagal fans we are this was an opportunity we simply couldn't pass up. It kind of felt like an old school Saturday when we used to spend our evening watching some hilarious flicks, except 2 key members were missing. None the less it brought Sid's mind back to the good old days which is always a welcomed occasion.<br /><br />In Attack force Seagal plays Marshall Lawson and has unleashed his finest mullet to date. This thing is good, we want to be friends with it. It pretty much looks like his ponytail also gained weight forcing to stretch wide for a full mullet/Myers effect that cannot be contained. Aside from his mullet Marshall lost his strike force/competitive eating team by a group of government tested freaks. Marshall discovers the military secret and has to take on the US army along with the super warriors in a battle royal of hilarious proportions. Throughout the film there is a very strange dubbed effect going on. Sometimes Seagal's mouth will be moving but a different voice is heard not matching up with his lips. The voice sounds nothing like Seagals, much like the Pesci voice in the edited tv version of Casino. Awesome! 1 star right there for it's b dubbed goodness. You can tell a lot of effort went into this one.<br /><br />Attack force earned itself 3 stars in our eyes despite mostly terrible reviews from the masses. Both this and Into the Sun got bashed but actually turned out to be pretty entertaining. You just have to love what Steven has become. He has pretty much become the obese version of Johnny Cash because he wears black everything in every movie he's done since the early 2000's. At least he was somewhat understandable despite the dubbed issue. Try to watch anything he does now and you'll need to hire a translator to understand anything he say. This one would have been enjoyed back in the old days filled with laughs, especially from Santa.aughs, especially from Santa.
B00288KNL8|3.0|Please use caution if your child is under 12. My daughter is a mature 8 and I thought she would really enjoy this movie. She is not the dramatic type at all. So I was surprised when she said we had to shut it off or she would throw up. I thought maybe it was from watching it in the car with the 3d effects. But then she started crying. The crying lasted 2 hours. And then for several more at bedtime. She then wokeup with a nightmare about it.<br />I think it's a great movie for older children and adults. But if your children are young I suggest you watch the movie yourself first.<br />I do NOT think a PG rating was accurate whatsoever. PG13 would be better.<br />There is another part that you would find in animated porn that is not for children and was shocked to find a women was a huge exposed but bouncing up and down with a thong was in this movie.<br />The 3d also wasn't that impressive or even noticeable.
0375424474|4.0|I found this book quite good and very \\"fast\\" to read .  It started somewhat slow and for a moment I thought the book was too introductory.   That changed in the second half of the book (right after embryology).       A number of people on Amazon claimed the book was dull but I didn't find it that way.   Unlike some authors Shubin's passion for the topic does show on the pages and that kept it lively enough for me.       Some criticism I have is in regards to the analogies he gave (the bozo family for example).  Didn't like them and while I knew what he was getting at I thought it would confuse others who were less familiar with evolution.       That said it was a good \\"one night\\" book.
0684874350|5.0|I read this book 12 years ago and reread it again this week after Frank McCourt passed. I am still in awe of it and still tell anyone that it was and will remain the Greatest Story Ever Told! Yes, the Irish are lyrical and have the gift for great prose. The narrative of this memoir is so unique. Nothing short of genius! You should have a soft spot in your heart for your fellow man and not doudt that this tale is true. That would be a tragic belief. Thank you Mr. McCourt for your life and your tremendous contribution to us all and especially your students. They were the lucky ones.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This whole album is good.  I can play it all the way through.  I can't say that for any of MJ's other albums.  I remember Thriller coming out when I was in the 1st grade, then the Bad album after that.  But as far as when I was really at the age to get into music and when I started to appreciate it the most, this album was it for me.  I don't think it's a coincidence that this was the album that Michael had his hand in the most and thus is the reason that EVERY track is nice.  You cannot be disappointed by buying this album- guaranteed!   BTW- My favorite MJ song is \\"Rock With You\\"!!! So you know I like the older stuff too!!
B00005JPY2|1.0|Or<br />No Country For Old Super-Heroes<br /><br />THE WATCHMEN is another movie based on a comic book - er, GRAPHIC NOVEL. First  picked up in 1986 by 20th Century Fox, the project bounced around the world from the US to the UK to Czechoslovakia, resting briefly at just about every major studio in the world. There were multiple scripts drafted, multiple directors tapped, and a Who's-Who of Hollywood talent courted for the lead roles.  In the end, we got exactly what you'd expect to get: a mess.<br /><br />Think of THE WATCHMEN as The Incredibles, only a lot less entertaining. This is a live-action story of the last of the super-heroes. At the start of the film, we are treated to a wonderful montage that tells us \\"the story so far.\\" I'm not exaggerating when I say we're treated to it. It's the best part of the film. They should have stopped right there, but they didn't. And I hear that the DVD has 20 minutes MORE for us to suffer through. That comes to 182 minutes of watch-watching pain. I digress.<br /><br />THE WATCHMEN is set in 1985. Richard Nixon is somehow in his third term, the Soviet Union is about to nuke us, and a giant blue super-hero named Doctor Manhattan straddles the world. Naked. (He's naturally blue, too.) Doctor Manhattan is omnipotent which makes him boring. His pal is called Ozymandias, after the Percy Shelley poem. He's all-knowing which makes him petulant and boring. Then there's Doctor Manhattan's love interest, her mom, her former love interest (pretty but boring, boring in bad make-up, could be interesting but is as boring as day-old toast) and the Comedian, an absolutely unlikeable guy who rapes, murders, and laughs about it all. I wish he had been boring, but he was just disturbing.<br /><br />The only interesting character in THE WATCHMEN is Rorschach. His face is an ever-shifting Rorschach ink pattern, which is really cool but odd since he is the only one who doesn't waver in his ideals and commitment. He's a hard-boiled detective who has completely lost sight of the \\"the line.\\" He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line. Rorschach is really the driving force of the flick. His scenes are interesting, understandable, and move the plodding plot along. Even so, some of his scenes are gruesome and unnecessary for the character or the story.<br /><br />Honestly, I get disgusted remembering THE WATCHMEN, not because of the needless gore but because of the wasted effort. The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is classic, but the acting is dreadful and the story is deadly dull with a wholly unsatisfying ending. Yes, I admit it; I sat through the whole thing. I was just HOPING something good would happen. And it did! THE WATCHMEN finally ended.line.\\" He doesn't need no stinkin' line. He makes his own line.

0439023483|5.0|There isn't much to say about this book that the previous reviews haven't. All I really can say is that this is the most amazing book I've ever read. Seriously. I have never been much of a reader and this book surely changed that definition. This book is amazing. I can't say anything more. I guarantee I have missed quite a few nights of sleep imagining what Katniss and Peeta are up to. I can only wrap up this paragraph with three words: BEST BOOK EVER!
080017948X|3.0|Few comedies age well and so you are left with the rest of the package which is the overall storyline and theme and thankfully for \\"Groundhog Day\\" the storyline/theme is a good one.  What if you had the chance to relive a day in your life over and over again until you get it \\"right\\" and how would you use that chance?<br /><br />What starts out as an opportunity to live out all his selfish ambitions leads to despair and then to the realisation of what a life well lived truly means converting a selfish, arrogant snob into a more humble, giving person in what reminds me of a similarly themed Dickens story which ironically also has Bill Murray playing a lead in one of its many incarnations.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie I was less than impressed as not all the jokes hit home and I felt that it dragged on a little almost into boredom but years later after watching this a few more times I've come to realise that that was the director's intention to infuse the audience with some kind of sense of what the character was going through with regards the boredom and helplessness at having to relive the same day over and over again and now I appreciate this film for the classic that it is not so much as a side-splitting laugh a minute comedy which it clearly isn't now but it has still aged well as a modern day fable and as an overall amusingly good film.<br /><br />The only sad thing is the quality of this dvd which although sound-wise is okay does suffer picture quality-wise with white spots and imperfections on too many frames.  No special features to mention of here as well.  Here's hoping a good restoration effort is done soon both in terms of sound quality with 5.1 channels at least and picture quality- wise with anamorphic widescreen versions and good bonus features added as well surfaces soon preferably in both standard and Blu-ray formats.<br /><br />Good, amusing fable but not so good dvd version makes me recommend you wait for a vastly improved version to surface hopefully in the not too distant future.distant future.
1400063736|5.0|I have not stopped thinking about this book since I finished it nearly a month ago. The prose is so beautiful that several times I had to reread a section 3 or 4 times to soak it in.  The weaving of past and present is poignant, especially given that the central theme of the book is the tightrope walk between the trade towers, which is all the more surreal now that they are gone. The subtle beauty of this book is breath-taking. I will never forget it.
0385341008|5.0|As I finish most books, I feel a sense of accomplishment and look forward to my next read.  Approaching the end of this book, however, I was overcome by a sense of sadness, not wanting to end my literary journey with the wonderful characters I had come to know and love.<br /><br />As Juliet seeks the subject for her next book, she ultimately solves the riddles of her life.  Her experiences with the people on Guernsey open her eyes to the harsh realities of life during WWII, and how books became a part of their survival.<br /><br />I am sorry to place this book back on the shelf.  The memories I have of these endearing characters will say with me a long time, and I look forward to meeting them again when I choose to reread this one!
B001GCUER0|5.0|This is the best Drama, with the exception of The Wire, that has been on TV in the last 5+ years. If you haven't seen The Wire go buy Season 1 now and prepare to sit in front of your TV for the entire weekend! As for Mad Men, the great part is they managed to make it interesting with no nudity or bad language. The period set design is amazing, acting near perfect and script work top notch. What else is there to say, you will love this series.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|It's been tooooo long....We need a sequel to this film. The only person that can pull this off is Ridley Scott.
B000P0J0DI|3.0|There is no doubt in my mind that this is Clint Eastwood's best ever film effort and it is a testament to this movie's greatness that it has aged so well over the years and I'd wager will continue to do so for years to come.  The themes involved are timeless such as coming to grips with your true self, making sacrifices and hard choices for the good of your dependents, regret for life's past indiscretions, retribution/revenge and like in any true western justice meted out in dramatic fashion at the end as \\"good\\" triumphs over abject evil as personified in the form of sadistic sheriff Hackman.<br /><br />This film is so great as well because it blurs the lines between what is good and evil and does man really have the right to mete justice when as Eastwood's character so aptly puts it: \\"deserves got nuthin' to do with it.\\"  Did both cowboys deserve to die or was it just the unrepentent slasher for example?  How about Ned?  Many issues such as these are addressed in this movie and because it is not just the usual cut and dried western where the lines are clear this brilliant movie that engages the viewer on a more cerebral level makes this not only an excellent western but also a brilliant film regardless of genre to be enjoyed over and over again like a true classic should.<br /><br />I've watched this film a few times and I never tire of doing so in contrast with say \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" which I watched recently and realised that it doesn't reward repeated viewing as much although I have to say I enjoyed it a lot when I first saw it for example.  This is why \\"Unforgiven\\" ranks among the top 5 films that I have ever seen.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing though is the poor quality of the dvd.  The sound quality was okay at Dolby Digital 5.1 surround but the picture quality was very poor and certainly not commensurate with the sound quality.  The widescreen version side of the disc is the way to view it as the fullscreen side was pathetic as too much of the picture is excluded and for some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.<br /><br />I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.<br /><br />Updated 23 Aug 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of \\"Maverick\\" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.<br /><br />Recommended.some reason the picture quality is even poorer for that side of the disc.  White spots and other imperfections appear on too many frames and the images are blurred way too often as well.      I haven't seen the Blu-ray release but as the 20th anniversary of this film is coming soon, I'd like to see a Director's cut version with anamorphic widescreen and much better restored picture quality with good special features released either in Blu-ray or standard or both versions to do justice to a cinematic masterpiece.    This film deserves a lot better medium than this very poor dvd version.  As for me, I'll wait in hope for a much improved 20th anniversary release.    Updated 23 Aug 2011:    Amazon won't let me review this separately so I'll have to do this here: the blu-ray release is a big improvement over the dvd I reviewed above as there are now special features to speak about like the making of documentaries as well as the documentaries on Clint Eastwood himself and I especially enjoyed the tv episode of \\"Maverick\\" with Eastwood playing the villain for a change.  The picture quality has also improved although not in all the frames as the night scenes by the campfires for example are still pretty grainy although for the most part the rest of the picture quality is pretty good.  The audio in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround is also better than on the previous dvd release although it is not reference quality.  One is left feeling that further improvement is still possible and who knows maybe we'll get a digibook version in the future that will do just that.    Recommended.
1439138311|4.0|I was bored by the first 100 pages or so but decided to finish it. A wise decision! It is a brilliant novel. After a very slow start, it turns in to something of a page-turner as the main character's dilemma grows and isn't resolved until the end. Some very good characters and the descriptions of small-town Ireland and Brooklyn in 1952 are additional enhancements.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|This movie is a disaster but then again, a lot of our new movies have been disastrous lately. The plot is elementary, and I'm tired of prodigies trying to save the world. The characters are boring, typical and empty. I was still wondering what was the point of the boy trashing the car at the beginning... I mean... what was the point of all this \\" my father died, I hate the world\\" nonsense. Anyway, if you have a functioning brain, then I don't think this movie is for you.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|In a modern music environment that is often overun with visual gimmicks, PR distractions like bad behavior stories and other marketing tools, there still exists some phenomal musicianship and creativity if you know where to look for it. If you look here, you'll find it. Jeff Beck has always been a \\"Guitarist's Guitarist\\" with a creative approach and attitude that is completely unique. He really displays that here. As usual, he has found some musicians that can meet the challenge with phenomenal talent of their own. These are people who do not pursue the goal of having an \\"act\\" or a PR gimmick. They obviously only pursue a steady passion for raising their playing and creative ability. The instrumental interplay is very impressive and the constant musical sense of the performance makes it even more interesting. Add to that, some highly talented guests and this mostly instrumental and diverse performance is just a great ride.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Not only is this my favourite Disney feature film ever but it is also one of my top-10 favourite ever films.  It never fails to touch me whenever I watch it and it never gets old for me; especially now that this version has included a whole new previously excluded segment, \\"Human Again\\", and after watching it I can't imagine why they didn't include it in the first place as for me it actually improves the overall film by letting us have a glimpse at how Beauty and the Beast's relationship blossomed over time and I especially liked the scene where Beauty helps the Beast to learn how to read again.  Of course the musical number is also another brilliant Ashman/Mencken composition as well.<br /><br />No matter what your feelings of Disney you cannot accuse them of non-quality output and so you get an excellent value proposition that fully utilises the scope and capabilities of the standard dvd format medium.  We get 3 versions of the movie here and I enjoyed watching each one for various reasons: the special edition for the \\"new\\" footage, the original version to remind me of what I first saw at the cinema and the work-in-progress version to educate me on how such animation is put together.  The second special features disc has hours of material from documentaries to interviews and even games if you are inclined to play them.<br /><br />As for the main content i.e. the movie itself, the sound quality is excellent and so is the picture quality.  Ashman and Mencken's music and especially the lyrics are so good that they alone are responsible for at least 70% of what makes this film work so well.  I remember I actually bought the cassette tape of the soundtrack years ago and I wore out the tape just listening to the brilliant music.  Also the excellent voice talents that were perfectly cast and especially Angela Lansbury who ironically acted so well as one of my most despised film villains in \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" and has now become my favourite character as the kind Mrs Potts here.  In fact, one of the more touching scenes for me and also one of my favourites is the part where romance first starts to blossom for Beauty and the Beast and she is singing \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" in the famous one-take sequence.  Having recorded a number of times before on other people's cds as a guitarist I can tell you just how hard it is to do anything on a first take and so I only have great admiration for Lansbury in being able to do this.  It's a timeless rendition and a version that ages well and will continue to do so and I'm left feeling that the 90s dated sounding Peabo Bryson/Celine Dion version of the tune at the end is a poor sounding imitation that certainly doesn't touch me as much as Lansbury's version does.<br /><br />This dvd is already so good that I really can't think of anything to complain about or to suggest improvements on except perhaps that I'd like to see a Blu-ray version come out soon.<br /><br />Disney's best and a timeless classic makes this very, very highly recommended!In fact, one of the more touching scenes for me and also one of my favourites is the part where romance first starts to blossom for Beauty and the Beast and she is singing \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" in the famous one-take sequence.

I just could't put it down.<br /><br />If you liked the George Romero movies, and you loved the Zombie Survival Guide, this is a must have.  The book is a collection of short stories from those who have experienced the zombie holocaust.  You get stories from all over the world from soldiers, pilots, farmers, doctors, children, and others who tell it from their perspective.<br /><br />Max did a great job researching all the jargon, local expressions, and native language peculiar to each person giving the interview to lend each story an air of authenticity.<br /><br />Just get it, you know you want it.

1441498141|5.0|As a Christian, I struggle with the Bible on a daily basis - is it the Inspired Word of God or just some stories about the Creator made my men?<br /><br />Well, as someone willing to look at all view points, I read Origin (again - I read parts of it in school years ago - perhaps it was a first edition - but then I'm showing my age.  What struck me this time was how 'up to date' this book seems.  Considering how long ago it was written it seems very clear, profound and leaves one with a believe in natural selection without feeling that there still is a Creator of some kind.<br /><br />I think that Origin should be read by ALL people to get a better understanding of why religious wars are so unnecessary.<br /><br />10 stars for this history making book - one that changed the world, not just by bringing science to our world, but by shaking the shackles of bad church leaders who want to keep the masses in the dark.
B000068FY0|4.0|The album is great & I try to play it from beginning to end, as it seems to flow from one tune to the next.  There's some of what goes on in every day living in the words and what I find especially apropos in the summer of 2009 (in the USA) is the title song.      I bought this specifically to critique against my MFSL copy and what I hear is a boost in the mid & upper mid frequencies that make vocals and the higher piano notes a bit harsh.  What this leads to is listener fatigue & you either find something else to play or turn off the stereo.  Unfortunately, that is enough for me to not want to play this particular CD.
B001N26GFM|4.0|This is an interesting look at the Holocaust seen from many points of view. It's not without its flaws, but it does show many sides of this tragic historic time. A German boy and his family move to a new home during WW II.  His father is assumed to be a high ranking soldier at Auschwitz.  The story centers on the boy and how his parents try to keep the horror of reality of what is going on there from him. He slowly discovers the ugly truth a little too late!<br /><br />While the story is engrossing, I felt there was something missing in this heartbreaking film. I would have liked to have seen more detail and contrast between the father's point of view and his families'.<br /><br />This is not to say this is not worth your time, but it does fall short in some areas. The ending is haunting if a bit manipulative and adds weight to this sad story.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like Jillian and Biggest Loser--but I feel like this workout is kind of boring.  All the moves are basic and you repeat them a lot.  I wear my ipod during this workout because the music is horrible--and does nothing to get you moving.  At first, I only did the first workout, but now I usually do 2 in a row instead of only working out for 20 minutes.
1439157383|4.0|A fast-read, but too many side characters and sub-plots that don't add much.    The plot is a great idea but I am surprised people didn't like the ending.     The ending has NO long speeches, NO apologies, NO crying, NO late-night frozen yogurt and NO annoying admissions of vulnerabilities.    This is NOT Hallmark-Lifetime disease of the week stuff...this was chilly and shocking.    A welcome change from the boring, long, emotional endings that plague this type of story.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I am hearing impaired and the subtitles do not work.  I have read that there is a way to mess around with the way your tv is attached to your player that makes it sort of work but is it worth the trouble?    I would have wished for more historical accuracy.  I'm not terribly knowledgeable about this period but after a certain point I found myself muttering.. \\"Oh come ON.. no way they looked like that.\\" or \\"I'll bet what REALLY happened was WAY more interesting.\\"    It doesn't HAVE to be historically accurate to be entertaining.. it doesn't HAVE to have actors cast that remotely resemble who they are playing or have more to offer then eye candy to be interesting.  No one who knows me would fault my imagination and suspension of disbelief.  I could watch this story played by actors made out of legos probably and enjoy it.. but I need to understand what they are saying.
0385736002|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of fantasy but in 2001 I began reading the Harry Potter books and loved them.  I have tried reading other fantasy books for young adults but they are simply not as good.  I only recently discovered this series and I have to say that so far (I'm almost done with the second book) it is really good.      I have always been a fan of mythology so this is right up my alley.  I love that the author has taken many of the myths from the world over and combined them.  What an original and interesting idea.  I am also learning about myths that I had never heard of.  I am constantly googling these creatures for more information.      I am also caught up in the mystery.  It seems that in each book we learn just a bit more about the main characters, especially the immortal ones.  We are given enough information to keep us interested and left with just enough of a thirst for more to keep us reading.  I will say that if all of the mysteries are not cleared up and the questions answered by the end of the series (I believe there is to be 6 books in all) then I will be disappointed.  So far I am just getting the books from the library although if the entire series is as good as the first two and all of my questions are answered then I may consider purchasing the entire set to re-read.  I guess I will just have to wait and see.      The books do read fast; I am devouring them quickly.  I am eagerly awaiting the release of the 4th one.  As an adult and a teacher I would have no problem recommending these books for my own children and students to read.  I believe the trick to increasing literacy in our young people is encouraging them to read good contemporary young adult fiction.

0061689246|3.0|Unfortunately I seem to be one of the few people who doesn't get Neil Gaiman. I say unfortunately because everyone else seems to love him and it kind of makes me wonder what I'm missing out on. I did enjoy [[ASIN:0060530928 The Graveyard Book]], but that was definitely the exception and not the rule. [[ASIN:0061689246 Stardust]], much like Gaiman's other fairy-tale book [[ASIN:0060557818 Neverwhere: A Novel]], was missing something for me. The world didn't quite seem to work, nor did the characters. But whether it was the lack of description and attention to detail that is needed to build that crucial sense of ambiance, or the seeming gaps in character motivation that made the story read flat to me, I couldn't quite tell. All I can say is that I was not particularly gripped by either Gaiman's story or his style of writing.<br /><br />I did, however, appreciate his subtle sense of humor and also his simultaneous satirization and glorification of the fantasy adventure/quest plot form; but for a newcomer to Gaiman or the genre it might come off as either cliched or obscure. To these newcomers I would recommend reading [[ASIN:0060530928 The Graveyard Book]] first. But to all you raving Gaiman fans: read on! This is as typically Gaiman as it gets. I didn't love it, but boy do I envy you who do.

1439157383|1.0|Boy was I wrong.  I was irritated before I got to the middle of the thing.  For the life of me I could not understand why the author felt the need to write the chapters in each and every inconsequential character's point of view.  This may have been tolerable if the characters played faithfully to the plot, but instead, the author takes off on twenty uninteresting, unrelated tangents that (I think) had the manufactured purpose of trying to endear the reader to the characters.  But if I had wanted to read a book about a pyromaniac emo-kid, I would have picked up THAT book.  If I had wanted to read a book about a couple rekindling some fifteen-or-something-year-old  flame, I would have taken a stroll down the romance aisle and had plenty to choose from.  I wanted to read ANNA'S story.  I wanted to read about her struggle, her internal conflicts.  I wanted to see justice served, even if it was at a terrible price.  And I suppose Picoult had put some of that in there, but my satisfaction kept being interrupted by possibly the most irritating cast of adults I have ever come across in literature.      Anna's 18 yr old brother is such an insulting depiction of teenage angst that any young reader is likely to be offended; her father is boring and pointless (what in the world does his firefighting life have to do with anything?); Campbell is an excruciatingly cliche a-hole (we don't really care what the dog is for, and the longer the mystery wore on, the more annoying it got), and his romance with Julia is perhaps the most irrelevant thing taking up the pages of this book.  Still, none of them can compare to Sara.  She is a hateful, hateful character.  I don't think that Picoult meant for her to come across as a liar, but the extent of her bs during the trial is infuriating.  Her \\"love\\" for Anna is belied by her actions and her history, the reader has already been shown that she really does not care about her younger daughter.  How are we supposed to believe that she loves Anna when she went through an entire pregnancy without even trying to think of a name for her?  When Anna was in the hospital for bone marrow transplant and Sara basically had to be forced to go visit her?  Sara's grief at the end of the story failed to draw any sympathy from me.  What was she crying about?  She got what she wanted, didn't she?    I was gravely disappointed by the outcome of the trial.  *SPOILER*  The story is supposed to be a battle of ethics.  We were rooting for this young girl to be free of the chains that have bound her since her birth.  Even though it would mean her sister's death, we wanted her to be medically emancipated, because what she was enduring was wrong.  Then, near the end of the trial, the reader is told that Anna didn't REALLY do any of this on her own volition - she's doing this at the request of her dying sister who is tired of fighting the cancer.  WHAT?  Talk about a betrayal of premise... now it seems that if Anna HAD wanted this of her own volition, she'd be wrong and selfish and cruel.  Suddenly the reader feels almost mean for being on her side before this cop-out twist of events.  Because Anna was being a good girl after all, and following her sister's wishes... not really fighting for her own rights.  What a cheat.    The ending of the book was the biggest disappointment of all.  Not disappointing - angering.  I invested my time and attention for an ending like THAT.  I suppose it was meant to be tear-jerking.  I just found it outright cowardly.  It was a melodramatic way of wiping the vital controversy from the story.  It occurs to me that Picoult was never, ever on Anna's side for any of this.  She betrayed her own protagonist, for goodness sake.  I have to say that this is the first time I have ever felt cheated by an author.  To Picoult, I would suggest that to actually write a GOOD book, she should decide BEFOREHAND what it is that she is writing about, and THEN write it.  What a waste of shelf space.  Save your money.
B00169N0BK|4.0|I have had a good experience with the munki in calibrating my NEC SpectraView monitor and Epson R1900 printer so that what I see on the screen is what prints- voila. The zipper failed on the pouch that holds the munki and xrite immediately sent a replacement at no charge and they were very nice about it- contra to some who have said they have a bad attitude. The Munki also worked beautifully with the NEC SpectraView II software for my photo monitor but at the moment there is an issue with Windows 7 when switching between X-Rite software and SpectraView II. My support experience with them has been very good. What some people may be experiencing is the complexities of color profiling because of the interfacing of other devices like printers and monitors. As noted by others this is not a simple process even if the Munki works perfectly. Incorrect settings in your other devices/software can cause all kinds of issues that are hard to track down. The only annoyance is that you have to go to Control Panel and Devices to disable \\"X-Rite Services (uncheck the box) in order for SpectraView to recognize the Munki in Windows 7. Then all works great until you want to use the X-Rite software again to profile the printer. I don't know whether NEC or X-Rite is at fault here but they ought to get together. Then using the X-Rite software for profiling my printer and SpectraView to profile the monitor would be a simpler process to go back and forth. Obviously if you don't have a NEC monitor or Spectraview this is a non-issue. Great product and would buy again. A real value too!
0385341008|5.0|This is a lovely book, much like an old classic. One friend described it as a \\"modern-day 'Jane Eyre.'\\" I think it's more like a 1940s-era \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" written or edited by Jane Austen with a heroine pulled back in time from 2009.<br />Whatever it is, it's great.<br />Written in the form of letters, it tells the story of a writer .... I'll go no further.<br />I was educated to the history of the German occupation in the Guernsey Island. I was taught about these Channel Islands off the coast of England.<br />And I was reminded of what a good book is all about.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|Ignore the complaints about the writing.  Abrams consistently surrounds himself with talented writers such as the Orci brothers and Alex Kurtzman who help him with well-written projects such as Lost: Season 1, Star Trek, and early Alias episodes, so no surprise, the plotlines of Fringe are creative and well thought out.  Unfortunately, the main character, Olivia Dunham is a cold, determined, career woman who is not relatable or even likable.  I've never met anyone whose favorite character on Lost is Jack.  Olivia won't be your favorite character on Fringe.  They even gave her a sister and niece midseason to add a pointless family subplot to make her more relatable and less one-dimensional.  Maybe Abrams has difficulty developing likeable main characters; I don't know.  Fortunately she is saved by the very interesting and likeable father/son combo of Walter and Peter.  Also notable is that the writers seem to be torn between a formulaic show such as CSI where each problem is resolved at the end of the episode and a series such as lost or 24 in which each episode is part of a main story.  Most problems are resolved at the end of the episode but many more span the entire season and probably into other seasons.

0810970686|5.0|If your kids know and love Jeff Kinney's bestselling `Wimpy Kid' books,  this latest installment will not disappoint.  If you and your family haven't yet read these hilarious cartoon novels, let this green-bound book be your delicious introduction.<br /><br />In \\"The Last Straw\\" we rejoin middle school student Greg Heffley journaling his frank opinions about school, suburbia and his own zany family.  But unlike Harriet the Spy, another intrepid chronicler of everyday American life, Greg's greatest ripostes are at his own expense.  He cheerfully confesses to an attempt to make change from the church collection plate and also describes digging up a time capsule and pocketing the contents.  (There's  an especially funny reflection about the dilemma of a young man with no clean underwear except a worn Speedo and a pair of Wonder Woman Underoos.)  Happily unethical, young Greg is always searching for the shortcuts in life. For example,  after he signs up with Boy Scout Troop 133, he is dismayed to learn he must earn a `whittling badge.'  Greg determines he can squeeze the soap into shapes instead of carving it.  After turning in a soap with four protuberances as a \\"sheep\\" Greg then turns it upside down and resubmits it as \\"the Titanic.\\"  While Greg will never make Eagle Scout, he does remains true to himself and his fear of sharp objects.<br /><br />One of the best things about this best-selling series is how addictive the books are to young people, even the reluctant reader.  If your child enjoys this book, he or she will happily move on to the original, red-bound \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,\\" ($[...]) and the second in the series, \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules\\"($[...])  There's also the fun \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself\\" book ($[...]) This orange-bound book will get your child to journal and answer some rather tough questions. A sample: True or False: Have you ever peed a swimming pool?<br /><br />It's interesting to note that Kinney, a former college cartoonist, worked on his Wimpy Kid concepts for six years before publishing in installments on [...]  To date, the online version has had more than 70 million visits.  Having won a vast online and print audience, `Wimpy Kid' is expected to move to the big-screen, with a casting call now underway for the film version of Greg Heffley's adventures.  [...]<br /><br />As with Charlie Brown creator Charles Schultz,  Kinney's work revolves around childhood events like the school Valentine party, sibling rivalry, or warming the bench during the big game.  But unlike Schultz, Kinney suggests that being the underdog is not so bad. In fact, the underdog may even get the last laugh in the end--or at least avoid military school.<br />Time will tell if Kinney's works deserve to be ranked with Schultz' Peanuts gang, or with Bill Watterson's Calvin & Hobbes series,  for that matter.  In the short term, these books will be a rollicking, well-read addition to your family bookshelf.Kid concepts for six years before publishing in installments on [...]  To date, the online version has had more than 70 million visits.

B001GZ6QC4|1.0|...this movie kind of sucks. WAY over hyped due to the untimely and tragic death of Heath Ledger. Hmmm..another painted specter died within site of a films release. Brandon Lee and The Crow. A far better picture than this one. While Ledger's performance was good, it was far from the legendary status everyone is bestowing upon it. If he had not died The Dark Knight may very well have slid into sequel oblivion. Minus the first star.    I loved Batman Begins. I avoided this one due to the fact that sequels are usually much less intelligent than the debut. This, while not as awful as Pirates of the Carribean and its ilk being to cute for its own good still became to familiar with its characters. Minus another star.    The reason I had avoided this to begin with...Maggie Gyllenhaaaallll. Not even after a case of cheap beer. Katie Holmes is not perfect but Maggie is butt ugly. Only Zellwiger or Barrymore would have been worse. Her character was not at all in line with the Rachel portryed in Begins. Katie Holmes opted for a lame chick flick rather that stick with this. I guess she is as nutty as her husband. Minus two more stars for the choice of Gylenggaalllll.    I have to leave one star, so I will not say anything else negative. There are some positives..though not enough to reclaim a star. Cinematography was killer. Wow scene in Hong Kong. Michael Caine is always great. I await the next installment and pray that the spirit a Rachel does not return to nauseate me. Where is the Penguin?
0385342020|5.0|I really fancied this book. I bought it to read during an airplane flight, but I couldn't wait - I read it in two nights before my trip. It's kooky, lovable and funny, but it also has strong characters and a great storyline. I love the supportive parents and the message of family. This book really helped soothe my spirit because of the \\"crossing over\\" aspect. I hope it gets made into a movie, so much opportunity here! Cheers to Sophie, twenties style, doing the Charleston - and that necklace! I'm a crafter and am excited to make my own version of it! Tally ho! Awesome book for everyone to enjoy!

0307588335|3.0|Just be forewarned the author is a Mick Sammy Glick and consequently a bit hard to swallow. He actually thinks he is a courageous warrior on the Wall St. battlefield. He never figures out that he never risked a thing except other people's money and his own think pathetic trading career. As the ex Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil said about Wall St. jobs: most could be learned in two weeks.<br /><br />The author does get into the inside of what it was to work for the nut based Lehman. However the reader must understand this isn't a tragic tale but rather one of 'just desserts.' Most get what they deserve a few don't and the company goes out of business. Thank you Jesus. Not a bad end for a bunch of screaming financial morons who essentially just bet other peoples money. Too often and sadly it was 'our money' and our economy that thye ruined.<br /><br />There are valuable lessons here. #1) The reader will quickly understand that never but never should a dime of pension money be given to the gamers at Goldman Sucks or any other Wall St. firm. Put the money in T Bill and forget about it. #2) Do not trust anyone on Walls St. One of the authors genius bosses goes to an Indian gambling Casino and is quickly down 165K but being a brilliant trader (the bum got away from Lehman with most of his money) he takes over the whole blackjack table and wins his moeny back and then some. Phew. Apparently this brillian risk taker never knew that at a casino the house takes 5% of your money at each hand. Ya cain't win sucka.<br /><br />But this boys will be rich boys tale is facinating cuase really in the end you know you'd meet an better/equivalent bunch of guys at any midnight basketball game anywhere in America. You will never hold Wall St. in awe again.<br /><br />So read this tale and learn. But remember the people you are going to meet are almost all white trash except for the Lehman corporate diversity guys who I guess were black trash.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Not being a huge comic book nerd, I went to this movie with my brother, who is. I immediately found out that it was more than just another comic book movie. It was an action-packed, thrilling roller-coaster ride of a movie that aimed to please not only the comic book fanboys, but also gain a mainstream following as well. It hit all the right spots at all the right times.   From the opening scene, to the ending credits, I enjoyed this movie more than even The Dark Knight 8 months prior. The biggest thing I liked about this movie was that it wasn't afraid to push the envelope of decency.     All sorts of comic-based movies like to be clean, cookie-cutter action movies with lots of explosions. Not so here. There is a solid plot, almost spot-on with the graphic novel (up until the ending, which they changed for a very good reason), and it has all the violence, sex, and mature themes of any other solid R-Rated movie. And solid this one is. Maybe some people got freaked out at Dr. Manhattan's manhood, but if you're so 'hung' on that, you probably weren't paying attention to the other subtleties that turned this movie from a good movie to a great one.  Some said this movie could never be done. I beg to differ. Five stars all around!    As for the extended scenes, I feel that they made the movie feel more complete than ever. I have yet to watch the special features on disc 2, but I'm sure they won't disappoint.    P.S. I'm not a huge enough fan of the movie to buy for myself the Ultimate edition this winter, but I'm sure my brother will appreciate it as a Christmas gift :)
B0029NY9YO|4.0|I wanted to read the \\"Watchmen\\" graphic novel before I saw the movie.  I did and I'm glad I did.  It was an intricate, convoluted bit of storytelling that never failed to fascinate... except for the ending.  I'll say it, and let the fanboys come out swinging:  the ending Alan Moore wrote in the book was preposterous.<br /><br />The movie changed it.  Somewhere, praise the lord and pass the red pencil, during the scripting process, someone had the guts to say, \\"You know, the original ending makes no sense. What if we changed it to...\\"  And they did.  And it does make a whole heap o' more sense than Moore's.<br /><br />Comparing a book to a movie is essentially folly.  They are completely different animals.  People make the mistake of thinking they're similar because you can compare plot points and snippets of dialog, but those parallel details don't add up to the gulf of difference between the two media.<br /><br />Still, that all said, I found watching \\"Watchmen\\" ultimately more satisfying than reading it because the filmmakers were smart enough to end it with an \\"Aha!\\" rather than a \\"Huh?\\"  Bravo to them.
0142403873|5.0|This is our favorite book by far-and that is saying something! We love to read as a family and when my daughter was about 2 1/2 she got this book and we have read it hundreds of times in the last year! My daughter loves the rhyming and the repeating of events. She loves the \\"silly mouse\\", and even better she loves pretending to be scared of the Gruffalo! It's the perfect length for a kids book and is so much fun to read because you can get very cunning, frightened, and then just plain silly when you read it! I wish all books were this much fun!
B000A2RRF4|3.0|Very disappointed with this DVD. Way too focused on the hysterical audience instead of MJ's performance.  Too much lip syncing on MJ's part also.
B000002LB6|3.0|I was enthralled with Vince Clarke since I discovered Depeche Mode's \\"Speak & Spell\\" and the Yazoo records in the early '80s.  I immediately loved Erasure's debut album \\"Wonderland\\" for the very reason an earlier reviewer said he liked it less than \\"The Circus\\" -- it was essentially the third Yazoo album with Andy Bell instead of Alison Moyet.  It took me a bit longer to warm up to \\"The Circus.\\"  I listened to this album a great deal in the torrid summer of 1988.  It was 21 years ago as it is now: I always wanted to like Erasure more than I do.    \\"The Circus\\" presents a brand of synth-driven blue-eyed soul, which is the best thing about Erasure.  Sometimes the sound is sexy and celebratory, as on \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"Sexuality,\\" other times it is melancholy, as on \\"If I Could\\" and \\"The Circus.\\"  Clarke, ably assisted by Flood, was adroit at retaining the robotic synthesizer rhythms I loved so well in Depeche Mode, but tempering these with soulful hooks and sugary electronic washes.  Perhaps it was Clarke's intention to give the \\"Circus\\" a festive circus-like atmosphere on songs such as \\"Don't Dance\\" and \\"It Doesn't Have to Be.\\"      \\"The Circus\\" is at its strongest on the title track, which is a labor ballad dressed in circus organ sounds structured in doleful staccato fashion, eerily reminiscent of Dell Shannon.  Other great songs are the bilious \\"Leave Me to Bleed\\" and the homoerotic anthems \\"Sexuality\\" and \\"Sometimes.\\"    The trouble with \\"The Circus\\" is Andy Bell's faltering vocal range in some parts.  He tends to lose control on low notes and seems to have difficulty recovering.  There is also a lack of depth in the production, which gives the music a flat sound.    My reason for giving \\"The Circus\\" three rather than four stars is rather biased.  On \\"The Circus,\\" Erasure establish themselves as a gay-identity band, most exemplified by the painful coming out song \\"Hideaway.\\"  This was certainly a smart direction for them and I think it has contributed to their 20+years of sustained popularity.  The gay audience, I have observed, is a loyal audience who will buy records and tickets.  However, as a heterosexual, it is a lifestyle in which I will never be a participant, so I feel like an outsider peering in.      This did not happen with The Smiths, which will always be one of my favorites, because Morrissey's lyrics were nuanced so I could identify with them on themes such as general alienation and feeling like the perpetual outsider.  Andy Bell presents a simpler persona than does Morrissey.      Furthermore, I found subsequent records, such as \\"Wild\\" and \\"Cowboy,\\" and the odious \\"Abba-esque\\" to present a Village People level of pandering to their fan base that was indistinguishable from satire.    The Erasure music that really grabbed me after 1990 was the album \\"I Say, I Say, I Say\\" with its impeccably superb production by Martyn Ware, and the song \\"Rock Me Gently\\" for the sweetness of its intrinsic beauty.    The other day I finally bought a second-hand CD of \\"The Circus\\" at a sidewalk sale and, as stated above, I wanted to like it more than I did, though I still liked it a lot.  \\"The Circus\\" takes its place in the canon of pop records in which I staked a personal claim as a teen, and will always enjoy.
0307266303|5.0|What I like most about this book is how it seems to be energizing our country.  Like everyone else, I loved this story and the inside look at ultra running and the wild tale of the Copper Canyon race.  But what I think is really cool is reading the other reviews and see that people are actually motivated to get off there butts and move!      People love to feel like they have an inside tract on hidden knowledge.  Running barefoot (or minimally shod) seems to be empowering people to get out there and get fit.  Time will tell if this is truly helpful or not, but it sure makes sense to me.      I enjoyed the friendly ribbing of the medical/podiatric field as well as the digs at Nike.  I am a doctor and spend a great deal of time trying to motivate people to wellness, rather than pick up the pieces when their body goes to pot.  Running is the best tool I know of to prevent most of the chronic illnesses I combat every day.      The real secret to running long term is being able to find a way to do it with that smile on your face that McDougall writes about.  If doing it barefoot gets it done for you, then I'm all for it.  A good first step to rediscovering the joy of running (like when you were a kid) is to read this book. Then pick a trail and go for it!
0679746323|5.0|Simply amazing. This book is a masterpiece of research combined with terrific storytelling.<br /><br />After reading several reviews which basically call this \\"fiction,\\" I was hesitant to buy it. I gave it a second look after Dennis Prager praised it on his radio show, and I am so glad I did. Here's my take on it: Although the authors leave you with no doubt they find Mao disgusting, I don't believe, like many do, that they are making these horrors up. You see, I have already studied the Maoist culture of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge (heck, I've been there). What was done by Pol Pot to Cambodia was pretty much a distilled version of what Mao did to China, condensing 30 or so years into 4. The Khmer Rouge was overthrown, and the evidence of their ghoulish murderous regime and devastating social experiment was exposed for all the world to see. However, in China, the long-dead tell no tales. Out of sight, out of mind, out of the historical record. This is real, people. These things really do happen - yes, even today.<br /><br />Some of the authors' assertions are speculative and too easily claim knowledge of Mao's mind and motives. But all this just inspires me to make further inquiry. Mao was so interesting, and despite its negative pitch I can see through this biography the admirable qualities he exploited to build his cult of personality.<br /><br />This book is long, but I never once got bored throughout all 616 of the \\"reading\\" pages [the book includes at the end almost 200 pages of notes, sources, and lists of interviewees, surely to counter the many who doubt its veracity]. To be honest, I'm kind of sad I'm finished with it, and not least of the many reasons why is the absolutely top-notch cover design by Peter Mendelsund. It's lovely to look at and hold, the paper quality and typography are excellent, and the book will not fall apart during the considerable time it may take to read it, which I'm glad I took the time to do.
B001VSZ7RQ|5.0|Well, I was never really a Keith Urban fan because I'm not really a listener of country music, but having said that, this album, this singer has won me over to his side. I'm not saying I'm country now, but what I am saying is this album is so good that it made me interested in listening to everything he's done and so I am now officially a Keith Urban fan. It takes a really good voice; creative writing and good music to win me over and this album, this man did all that and more on this CD. It's worth every minute you spend listening and every dollar to buy such an inexpensive good time.
0307454541|5.0|Despite its title, the plot at the center of the first of Stieg Larsson's Millienium trilogy isn't about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (\\"GDT\\"), but a belated investigation request on the part of a dying family patriach, Henrik Vanger, into the mysterious disappearance and presumed death of his beloved favourite grand niece many years ago. The eponymously named girl with the dragon tattoo is one Lisbeth Salanger, a hard as nails new age heroine spawned to survive the depravity and cruelty of our times, who gets co-opted to work in partnership with disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist to solve the decades old murder mystery. Blomkvist's own story book ends the novel and is really a subplot intended to beef up and generate interest in the characters of Blomkvist and Salanger who will presumably feature centrally in the following instalments of the trilogy.<br /><br />The sprawling Vanger family and their hidden intrigues are nothing more than the stuff of old fashioned murder mysteries in the P D James and Agatha Christie vein, yet why has GDT become such a celebrated bestseller, even courting the attention and generous praise of literary critics who customarily turn up their noses at books of this genre ? I put it down to the ingenuity of Larsson who has brought the old chestnut bang up to date with thoroughly 21st century characters with modern values like Salanger and Blomkvist without losing the essence of a classic murder mystery and introducing the delights of this classic genre to a young new readership. Scenes of countryside life inhabited by the Vangers alternate with often shocking scenes of sexual violence involving Salanger and even Blomkvist.<br /><br />Even if you don't buy into all that, GDT is still a pretty terrific page turner and a great read. Thoroughly deserving of all the praise lavished upon it. I can't wait to read the sequels.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I saw this twice when it came out.  Chris Pine was a witty, somewhat tortured, good-looking Captain Kirk.  Quinto was very well suited as Spock.  And, finally, Karl Urban did DeForest Kelley proud!  This was an amazing movie and so fun.  The best part was that you didn't have to know the original story line or be a fan.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This CD and DVD are truly incredible - just the process of how this was put together with musicians from all over the world is fascinating in and of itself.    But it does not end there, of course, you have extremely talented people performing some amazing classic songs all in an effort to shows that we really can get together and it will be alright.    The highlight tracks for me include \\"Stand By Me\\", \\"Don't Worry\\" and \\"One Love\\".  All of the original performers of the songs I am sure would approve how the material was presented, and I am sure Bob Marley is smiling somewhere right now.

B00005JPUN|2.0|Aliens from space land on earth and take over the human race.  This is essentially the story of this movie.  Unfortunately, it is also the basic story of hundreds of other movies, with recent ones being the Species franchise, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and various X-files episodes.  So does any part of this movie make it noticeably better than any of the other movies in the same genre?  No.  Yes there is the attractive Nicole Kidman, but her role in this movie could have been filled by dozens of other actresses.  Overall, an OK movie that is good space filler for a lazy night.

B000071K5L|5.0|Fifty years after its initial publication in 1960, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" has proven it deserves its place in anyone's list of the finest American classic literature ever written.<br /><br />Written a scant three years before Martin Luther King awed the world with his magnificent \\"I have a dream\\" speech, Harper Lee also stunned the world with a poignant story centered on the unconscionable treatment accorded to the black man in USA's Deep South.<br /><br />Tom Robinson, a productive, quietly proud and well-spoken black man who by today's standards might even be called an \\"Uncle Tom\\", is also cautiously subservient, withdrawn and all too aware of his underwhelming place in the society of Maycomb, Georgia, a sleepy white town in the heartland of America's confederate South.<br /><br />Tom stands accused of the rape of Mayall Ewell, the 19 year old daughter of a boorish ne'er-do-well white trash family that, to the best recollection of everyone in the town, has never put in a day's work in its collective life. Jeremy Atticus Finch is a gentlemanly white lawyer who, despite the virulent hatred his own community is directing at him, has decided to hold firm to his own convictions about the equality of all men before God and to accept his assignment to the responsibility for Tom's defense at his capital trial for the rape of a white woman - a trial that is expected to be little more than a formality with scant necessity for reference to facts and truth.<br /><br />\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is not a legal thriller, although it certainly could have been. Rather, it is a story about human behaviour - kindness and cruelty; bigotry, hatred and prejudice versus acceptance and friendship; humour and pathos in the presence of sadness and dejection. Told from the point of view of Atticus Finch's children, Scout and her older brother Jem, we are witness to their father's poignant heart-warming attempts to teach his children to become the kind of citizens that, fifty years later, are sadly still the exception rather than the rule.<br /><br />There can be few people (like me) left who haven't had the privilege of either reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or seeing the movie, but if you are among that small number, do yourself a favour. Read it sooner than later.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weisser than the rule.

1400031567|4.0|This book starts with two seemingly unrelated but equally gruesome incidents. In one, Swedish inspector Kurt Wallander is called out to a farm to investigate a complaint of a trespasser in the crop fields. There, he finds a young, obviously frightened girl. But before he can talk to her, she douses herself in gasoline and lights herself on fire. Not far from there, a retired politician walks down to the beach from his home before turning in for bed. There, he is hatcheted in the back by what appears to him to be a dwarf.<br /><br />This is the fifth book in Mankel's series about a Swedish detective Kurt Wallander. I haven't read any of the others, but it was easy to get a sense of Wallander's character and I actually liked the allusions to the other stories without much explanation.<br /><br />I don't read a lot of crime fiction, but a friend recommended this book, and it held up well to James Patterson and other similar books that I have read. It's fast-paced, smartly written and has plenty of twists and turns. Mankel deftly balances what he reveals and what he keeps a mystery, inserting just enough of the scenes where the crimes are committed to keep it suspenseful but not give too much away. It's also not a perfectly plotted crime novel--it's messy, with mistakes and dead ends, which gives it a more realistic feel. And Mankel adds pieces of dialogue and side plots about personal life to make him seem well-rounded without bogging down in it. Overall, a pretty enjoyable summer read.
B00004CWO8|5.0|To be perfectly honest I'm not a huge fan of ballet, nor do I have a great deal of experience where ballet is concerned. Nevertheless, I have never been more transfixed or entranced by a work of performance art than by Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake. It's truly provocative on so many levels. Every time I watch I get lost in the beautiful music, choreography, and above all the acting. The Prince's despair at the emotional and often physical distance of the people around him; his sheer, unabashed joy at finding that depth of love and acceptance in the Swan; and the tragic frenzy that is the story's end really make this a great thematic piece. Your eyes can't help but follow Adam Cooper's every movement, whether he's portraying the graceful majesty of a swan or the seductive villainy of the character's dual opposite. And the ending--simply breathtaking. At this point, it would be rather difficult for me to go back and watch a traditional version of the ballet, because I'd probably spend the entire time waiting for men in feathered knee-length trousers to appear :) I recommend to anyone who loves a bittersweet tale and dancing that does it justice! Beautiful!
B000HX1L6W|3.0|I was disappointed at first because the Hi-Res Stereo is no better than the CD version, both are compressed WAY TOO MUCH!  The Hi-Res Multi-Channel (5.1) tracks are much better in terms of compression (less) and dynamic range (more). If you have the tools you can make your own stereo mix from the multi-channel files.

B001H5X7JS|4.0|good movie, funny movie. Unusual movie.  The big surprise was Tom Cruise as an ugly, unappealing, unethical, balding movie executive. So much make-up it took minutes to recognize him. Like they said in the commentary, \\"it's hard to make that m***erf***er look ugly\\", but they managed it.  You can think what you will of his personal beliefs (and god knows, everybody thinks something about them), but he's still got the big nuts as a actor. Here he could be doing MI:4, and he goes and does this bit part playing a disgusting human being. And not only that, it's possibly the funniest part in the movie. It's hysterical. Kudos.

B001FB55H6|5.0|First off, if I hear one more impressionable dope, completely void of any critical thinking skills or any knowledge of our historical past, call the first 10 minutes of this movie \\"historically eye-opening\\" or \\"something to make you think about the progress of this country\\", I will jump out of my window.  I will do it.  I'm on the first floor, but still...I gotta bum ankle and it'll hurt.  The first 10 minutes represent an ALTERNATE TIMELINE.  A time-line which would have occurred had the watchmen ever existed.  We did not blow the heads off of hippies after they stuck little flowers at the end of policemen's rifles. Unbelievable.  You wish. This new generation scares me. Anywho, this movie is straight up awesome.  Off the chart awesome.  Superheroe's with messy pasts and psychological issues always make for interesting plots.  I wanted to launch into the philosophical debate that's at the very core of this movie, but it would probably spoil it.  Suffice it to say, if you like the dark realness behind the new Batman, you'll love this movie.
B00004RITP|4.0|Many conductors choose to conduct only the opening Adagio from this symphony, because it was the only movement fully completed by Mahler. Back in 1980, the young conductor Simon Rattle made quite a splash with his release of the Cooke version of the Mahler 10th as completed by musicologist Deryck Cooke. Others had recorded this completed version before, notably Eugene Ormandy, but it was the Rattle recording that really captured people's attention. I owned that version on LP, then some years later (it was released in 1992) purchased the EMI CD, which I still own.<br /><br /> In 1999, Sir Simon Rattle was appointed as the new music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, and he turned to the Mahler 10th for his first recording with that distinguished ensemble. This release was made from live performances that took place in September, 1999. The performances have almost a chamber-music kind of sound, which is a mixed blessing. On the plus side, the music seems lovingly played, with many lovely lines coming to the forefront. On the minus side, the music at times comes across as muted, restrained, almost timid, particularly in the opening Adagio. Although it may well be that memory has exaggerated what I actually heard at the time, I can recall being awed by the power that Sir Georg Solti unleashed from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on a London LP back in the vinyl era.<br /><br /> Also, there have been other versions of the 10th, such as Remo Mazzetti, Jr.'s original performing arrangement as performed by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Leonard Slatkin, reviewed above. One thing that sticks out in my mind about that version is that Mazzetti used a solo string bass in the last movement in place of the tuba that Cooke had used; the string bass sound struck me as much more appropriate. Telarc released a recording of the new Mazzetti arrangement performed by the Cincinnati Orchestra under their departing conductor Jes&uacute;s L&oacute;pez-Cobos (reviewed below), and there are versions by Carpenter and Wheeler on various labels.<br /><br /> So, where does this all leave the new recording by Sir Simon? If you are a Mahler lover, you probably ought to pick up this disk. Sir Simon loves this music, the orchestra plays with precision, and this really is a disk that Mahler lovers ought to hear. For those new to Mahler who want to explore the repertoire, this disk would be an excellent choice for a first 10th.ions by Carpenter and Wheeler on various labels.

B000001GRE|4.0|My mental benchmark for the Mahler 7th has been the memory of a live performance I heard with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Claudio Abbado, a bold, muscular performance featuring the powerful sound of the Chicago brass section. Those same forces recorded the work for DG, but at least in the LP version I heard, the whole enterprise was compromised by the engineering. On this new DG recording, the engineering is much better, and the interpretation is much different.<br /><br /> This is not a muscular performance. As you might expect from Boulez, the music flows forth with great precision, many lines being brought out with effortless clarity. Listening to this performance, I find myself being drawn to the woodwind parts, whereas under Abbado, I recall more the brass and the strings. DG's recording is exemplary, possessing both transparency and heft.<br /><br /> Haitink's 1982 recording with the Concertgebuow remains perhaps the finest overall interpretation, bringing out more of the mystery of the music than does Boulez, but the new Boulez provides a welcome complement to Haitink's approach, and the DG sound is better. Mahler lovers will want both, assuming they can still find the Haitink.
0316154687|2.0|About 7 years or so ago, a friend handed me a copy of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" insisting it was hilarious.  I read it and concur:  it was hilarious.<br /><br />Thus it was I picked this up without checking these reviews first.<br /><br />I'm not sure if Sedaris creatively exhausted himself with his first couple of books, but this book is nowhere near as funny or as memorable as that other one.  It's not really remarkable at all.<br /><br />It's true that occasionally his essays take a turn that makes you sit bolt upright, such as the trucker's creepy and unexpected digression (p. 66), but for the most part, Sedaris and I have little in common, so, since he lacks true genius, it's only occasionally that he can connect.  Maybe this is a little too harsh:  the book is not AWFUL.  But any way you cut it, I certainly won't be reading another Sedaris book.<br /><br />One thing that does constantly annoy me about Sedaris:  before reading any of his essays, you're expected to know that he's gay and has been living with his partner, Hugh, for many years in the north of France.  You're just supposed to know things like that.
B00000613T|5.0|Less than a year after L&oacute;pez-Cobos's Telarc Mahler 9th, the Boulez/Chicago recording was released on DG. I was so excited to hear it that I could barely wait to get home and slap it into my CD player! On hearing it for the first time, my thoughts were along the lines of, \\"Man, what a great piece of music, and what a great performance and recording--right up there with the Telarc. Which one will I actually wind up liking better?\\" Now here it is, time to write out my considered thoughts on these two recordings, and this time I am going to beat around the bush, at least for a little while.<br /><br /> One problem I encountered in preparing my comments was that I found it more difficult than usual to take notes while listening during those sessions where I tried to capture some of my thoughts on paper while switching back and forth between the two recordings. The music was so engrossing, the sound quality so captivating, and the performances so magnificent in both versions that all I could do was sit and listen in a glorious reverie of pure musical enjoyment. As a result, even though the Mahler 9th is a long and complex work, and even though I probably spent more time than ever before listening carefully to both recordings, I wound up with a much shorter set of notes than I usually do, and will accordingly wind up comparing the two recordings in more general terms than usual.<br /><br /> Listening to the first few minutes of both versions, in fact, gives the listener a sense of what the overall differences are going to be. The Boulez sounds a bit brighter, with individual parts, particularly in the woodwinds, seeming to stand out a bit more prominently in the mix. Control and clarity are paramount, but the interpretation never strikes the listener as fussy or overly analytic. The L&oacute;pez-Cobos version seems warm, tender, but never overly romantic. The recorded sound is slightly more distant, a bit warmer, and utterly breathtaking in its evocation of the concert hall, even in a mere two channels. One thing that really surprised me was that the Boulez performance seems perceptibly faster in the first movement than the L&oacute;pez-Cobos performance, but when I checked the timings, the Boulez performance actually is slower (29:17 versus 28:24).<br /><br /> As the two recordings unfold, the differences I have described above pretty well characterize them throughout. The Telarc sound is slightly warmer, more \\"homogenized,\\" and more like a real concert hall than the DG sound. But the DG sound is in its own way truly excellent -- clear, lively, and with especially good articulation in the lower strings. The timings in the second movement are within three seconds of each other, but to listen to the two performances, you would think that Boulez is faster. And so in the third movement, the lively Rondo-Burleske that is probably the most formally disciplined movement that Mahler ever wrote, but which still seems infused with wild abandon just awaiting to erupt. Both performances are tight and disciplined in their playing, yet both crackle with power and expression.<br /><br /> In the final Adagio, L&oacute;pez-Cobos truly does slow things down in comparison, taking nearly 28 minutes compared to the 21:25 spent by Boulez. Because of this longer timing, the Telarc recording had to be spread over two disks, which sell for the price of one, with the first two movements on disk 1 and the remaining two movements on disk.<br /><br /> It is time, I guess, to stop beating around the bush. Let me summarize my thoughts and recommendations on these two recordings. First, let me say that both are magnificent, simply magnificent. The performances are incredible, and the sound quality is glorious. The DG disk is a sparkling example of clarity and precision in terms of both sound and performance. It lets you here every little detail of the score, but never sounds exaggeratedly analytical. It sounds like the world's greatest \\"studio recording\\" ofthe Mahler 9th, and is certainly the best Mahler 9th I have ever heard on one disk. I cherish this recording and will play it often in future years.<br /><br /> The Telarc, on the other hand, has a warmer sound that sounds more like a live performance. Although I may regret being so bold in my statement, I find it the greatest combination of performance and sound that I have ever heard on any orchestral CD, and the fortuitous circumstance that such a combination would come in service of as great a work as the Mahler 9th makes this disk even more wonderful.

B000001GOZ|4.0|DG has essentially given carte blanche to Pierre Boulez to record what he wants with whom he wants, a fascinating prospect for CD collectors. His version of the Mahler 6th is fascinating for its clarity and coherence (the 4D sound helps here, too), and until the last movement, Boulez had me convinced that he really has empathy for this music. Unfortunately, the finale seems curiously restrained, and the whole performance seems to lose its point when the final movement proceeds without a sense of struggle. Still, for Mahler fans, this disk is worth hearing.

1416550542|1.0|This book is boring and simplistic; the characters are poorly drawn, the plot is silly and muddled; the story is foolish. Bad!   I was so excited to read this book, but leaden prose and a very poor sense of history bog down this silly plot. Morton has outgrown some of her more painful imitations of better writers, but the introduction of Frances Burnett is painful, a cheap joke; her ideas of how the classes interacted is banal and foolish; and her characterizations are desperately weak. For a mindless read if you are trapped somewhere like prison, I suppose you could endure it, but why bother when there are much better books out there?   At least she didn't steal her characters wholesale from Nancy Mitford this time.

B000W7FDBM|4.0|With Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince recently released in theaters, I thought it was appropriate to look back at Harry Potter's film legacy, and I'll be damned if there's a better place to start than with the original.    I remember when this film came out in theaters. My mom literally took me out of school to go to the premiere, and we were the second group in line with about a billion people behind us. I was a Potter nut, like most kids were at the time, and I was insanely excited to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed at all.    The film tells the story of Sorcerer's Stone in a nearly flawless fashion. Sure, there are things left out, but it's a book-to-film ADAPTION, not translation. The film still keeps all of the important and best parts and creates some pretty classic moments for itself.    The entire flim was very well done, and they couldn't have picked better actors for the leads. Snape did a particularly good job of capturing the character, as did Emma Watson when it came to Hermione Granger.    In case you've been living under a rock, the story of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about a neglected child whose parents are dead and is forced to live with his aunt, uncle, and abusive cousin. However, he finds out that he is actually a wizard, and he goes to attend school at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. He discovers the secrets within Hogwarts and gets to know all of the colorful characters within its walls.    The plot plays out brilliantly and the acting is spot-on for the most part, so why couldn't Sorcerer's Stone nab that perfect five stars? Well, it's the special effects. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some very cool special effects like moving pictures, the goblins, floating candles, and all of that jazz, but there is a problem. The CGI, even though it's used sparingly, looks AWFUL! Honestly, they look like they were zapped out of a cut-scene for a PlayStation One video game. Eight years ago this may have worked, butthe CGI techniques used here really haven't aged well. Plus, I hate CGI and don't approve of its use much at all anyway.    Both the Harry Potter books and the Harry Potter film series will be forever immortalized in not only American culture but damn near every culture that covers this world. This film is definitely worth seeing and rewatching again and again, with the only problem being it hasn't really aged all that well.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I expected this CD to be nothing more than an addition to the completist collection.  I couldn't have been more wrong with that expectation.  The selection, the track ordering, and work Giles Martin did to the sound combines to make it impossible for me to let it down.  It's been at or near the top of playlist since I got the CD, nothing will likely make that change.  It's one sweet compilation of George's solo years.  Yep, we've heard it all before, but not like this.  Not a bad career's work for an \\"economy class Beatle.\\"    It would have served the music and maybe the marketing to have stressed the clarity of the sound in this collection, hearing George as never before.  I'm not sure what, exactly, Giles Martin did with the masters, but he did it very, very well.  This is a keeper for the ages, and added to the list of albums to give as gifts to anyone I know, of any age.
B000002UAX|5.0|Without \\"The White Album\\", The Beatles would be remembered only as the popular group who recorded Sgt. Pepper's instead of the classic rock band they're known today and who have endured.     The sprawling 30-track double LP (their only 2 LP set) emphasizes how versatile The Beatles (individually and collectively) were. From rockers (like Back In The USSR, Everybody's Got Something To Hide, Helter Skelter) to pastoral ballads (Mother Nature's Son, Blackbird) to blues (Yer Blues, Birthday, Why Don't We Do It in the Road?) to experimental sound collage (Revolution 9) to easy listening (Good Night, I Will) to tin-pan alley (Honey Pie) The Beatles has it all.    The White Album was clearly intented to be their last recording. Everyone's glad they regrouped for the magnificent Abbey Road 6 six months later.    Everyone must own this recording!    [DW]

Remember Me? was a quick read, but it left me feeling flat.  After introducing the plot (with lots of potential for good reading), the story felt formulaic and predictable.  Entertaining parts of the story were not developed as they should have been--the whole book seemed rushed.  My weekend escape purchase left me disappointed.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|As a hardcore fan of the graphic novel I was terrified that the movie version would divert all the original Watchmen brilliance into cookie-cutter Hollywood dreck.  The mere fact that that didn't happen would be enough to get a stellar review out of me, but Watchmen the movie holds its own as a solid movie adaptation of a complex, haunting story.    Zack Snyder's directing is visually impressive without being distractingly oppressive, as it tends to be in his other comic-book movie 300.  The script changes grate on a purist like myself, but I can see how they would be necessary for wider audiences.  The acting is fantastic, particularly Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian.  With such a large cast of characters, the Director's Cut offers additional time to the development of each, bringing them closer to the three-dimensional, flawed, messy, morally ambiguous human beings they are in the source material.    While the movie never reaches the genius of the comic, its failings are due to the limitations of film as a medium.  Alan Moore's objection to the film adaptations is largely that Watchmen was never intended to be a movie, that things were done in comic-form that could only be done in comic-form.  I'm inclined to disagree- some things were done that don't translate, but the rest translates into a great movie that's both compelling and entertaining.
B002436WFI|4.0|[[ASIN:0061020710 The Color of Magic]] was the very first Discworld novel, published in 1983. [[ASIN:0060855886 The Light Fantastic: A Discworld Novel]], a direct sequel, and the second Discworld tale, was published in 1986. Pratchett's writing and plotting are better by several orders of magnitude in his later books. And the later books are less overtly satiric. The highly episodic nature of these first two novels must have made them tough to script. But, over all, this is a decent effort at a difficult task.<br /><br />The casting is generally good. Sean Astin is quite good as Twoflower, the Disc's first tourist. He was a controversial choice because Twoflower is from the Discworld's equivalent of China in the hearts of Pratchett fans, but Astin brings such strong skills to the role that it all works well. David Jason as the failed wizard - excuse me, \\"Wizzard\\" - is less successful. He's simply too old. And the script down plays Rincewind's strongest trait: cowardice. This is a man who knows how to say \\"Don't kill me\\" in a hundred different languages. Jason just doesn't fit the character. Jeremy Irons is superb as the Patrician. David Bradley as Cohen is at once not old enough and too old. He is obviously much younger than the 92 years Cohen claims. He tries to \\"act\\" older by being slower in fights, something that would surely have killed Cohen long ago if it were right. Tim Curry is completely right as the power-hungry, scheming Trymon, a larger role in the movie than in the books.<br /><br />Another problem is that Color of Magic/Light Fantastic cries out for a big special effects budget. Let's just say that The Mob, the movie's producers, didn't have Peter Jackson's budget. Except, perhaps, for the Librarian, they do reasonably well with what they had, and the final few scenes are especially good.<br /><br />Still, even a so-so Pratchett movie is still a Pratchett movie. If all of the jokes aren't there, and some destinations skipped or somewhat changed, there are enough laughs to remind you why Pratchett is a world treasure.<br /><br />Reportedly, The Mob will make [[ASIN:0060502932 Going Postal]] next, a much later, much better written Pratchett novel. I look forward to it, but in the meantime Color of Magic, if flawed, is still great fun. And the flaws may just be, like octarine, the color of magic, a pigment of my imagination.

0142410705|4.0|I really loved this book! I thought Collin's character is great. While I am a nerd, yeah I said it, I don't have intellectual super powers. Collin does! He is a child prodigy who speaks multiple languages, can anagram almost anything, and does math like a calculator. Even though he is a geek and doesn't totally fit in he still manages to date 19 Katherines (well 18, one dumped him twice). I also enjoyed how Collin's character was balanced out by Hassan, his best friend. Hassan had a much more laid back and slacker type attitude. I would say I fit right in between them in personality. Lindsey is the character I liked the most though. Lindsey reminds me of my sister, or at least what I believe she will be in the future. She lives life like a popular person in High School, but really she doesn't think that is her true self.<br /><br />The characters made this book what it is, but that being said, I also think the overall setting made for an interesting twist. John Green must love the idea of a road trip, as do I. He uses a road trip in this novel and in Paper Towns. However, in this road trip Collin and Hassan stay awhile. I have always wanted to go on a random road trip with no destination so I loved that.<br /><br />The only negative I have to say about this book is the footnotes, I liked them but then again I didn't. If I were to write a book I would probably need footnotes as my writing is sporadic like my thoughts. I write like I speak, nothing flows but the conversation is somehow linked in my head. So I am all for footnotes, however some of the footnotes were confusing and I often missed the little numbers in the writing when I was reading. So when I got to the bottom of the page I had to search for where it was input. Also the graphs did nothing for me, the were confusing and not so useful to the book. I get that John was trying to give his book a sort of textbook feel, so that's cool, but not my style. Had I been more of a mathematician I would have probably like that part more; I am struggling to get through the beginner classes my school offers before College Algebra, so needless to say I hate math. I am not sure I would have removed the footnotes or not.<br /><br />Overall I truly enjoyed reading this book. I am also glad I read it when I did. Since I read it following Paper Towns and after watching John and Hank's Brotherhood 2.0 videos a few more of the inside jokes caught my eye. Reading John's work along with watching him on YouTube made it seem like I was reading a book written by a good friend. I know that sounds weird but it's true. While parts of the book are scholarly others are totally from the mouth of a teen. John has this awesome ability to write incredibly well thought out books and not dumb them down for teens as so many authors do. He realizes we are smart, powerful and human beings!

B001CQONKY|5.0|Though, the team loses two of its most charismatic members, their exits are tastefully written. Sara Sidle having returned from a traumatic near death experience in conjunction with the demons with which she struggled throughout the show, not to mention the secret romance now under heavy scrutiny by department authorities, I can appreciate her sullen effort to get back on the job. Given, Warrick Brown's perilous history with corrupt officials, it seemed like the right way for him to go.    Cool guest appearances as always this season. Redman, Method Man, Katey Sagal, Rachael Harris, and a special reunion for George Eads with former Savannah co-star Jamie Luner.    Definitely the most graphic season, I've seen so far. But also some great comedy and a collaborative effort with another popular Bruckheimer series 'Without A Trace,' tells me this series will continue to move forward and break some new ground. I can't wait to see what new changes are in store next season and who else will appear or join this great cast.

B000E33VWW|4.0|There were two films about Truman Capote that were released in fairly quick succession. The first was this one - 'Capote', in 2005, followed by 'Infamous' a few months later in 2006. Both attempted to cover Truman's preparations for the writing of his hugely successful 'factual' novel 'In Cold Blood'.    Both tread the same path more or less, and even share the occasional line of dialogue. Comparisons between the two neatly highlight their strengths and weaknesses and this review may help to indicate which type of Capote 'reader' you are. What do you want from a film about T.C.?    It's easier to start with 'Infamous', curiously subtitled 'The Life Of Truman Capote' (which it certainly isn't). 'Infamous' is the one with the 'all star cast'. There's no doubt that Toby Jones makes an uncanny job of portraying T.C. but he's just a bit too overblown. Capote was certainly flamboyant but even he would not have worn some of the more outrageous costumes that are seen in that film. Toby's Truman is a slightly Disney version of the man. At one point he appears wearing an outfit that makes him look like a dwarf cowboy. This isn't right. Most of his contemporaries described him as extrovert but stylish. Not ridiculous.    The all-star cast in 'Infamous' is actually something of a distraction. Gwyneth Paltrow appears very briefly (and surely miming) as a torch singer. Why is she even there? As a lead actor you expect something else and then she's gone. Sigourney Weaver looks singularly as out of place and Sandra Bullock as Harper Lee? Well that's just plain wrong. She just can't pull it off. There's also a pre-Bond Daniel Craig playing murderer Perry Smith. With a somewhat laboured gruff voice and strangely plucked eyebrows he just ain't right. Perhaps a mistaken casting decision based on his ability to play unhinged characters. Who knows? As the film progresses these little bits of duff casting jolt the viewer back to realising they're just watching a film. Disastrous.    'Infamous' is also described as being based on George Plimpton's book 'Truman Capote' which is a bit silly for two reasons. Plimpton's book covers all of Capote's life (which the film does not) and despite this claim the film shows little of the insight we gain from Plimpton's book. Yes, the film does trot out some of Truman's more famous bon mots but if you are a fan these will just make you groan a bit. It's a bit 'T.C. by numbers'.    The film 'Capote' however, has just the one big name and he won an Oscar for his performance. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal is both restrained and considered. He clearly read an awful lot about Truman and the depth he lends to this performance is both chilling and moving. He understands Capote's razor sharp social skills and the methods he used to get what he wanted. This is a T.C. you can believe in.    Wardrobe also went to some pains to discover exactly what Capote wore and this is indicative of the commitment displayed by all who worked on this remarkable project.    Catherine Keener makes a truly fine Harper Lee and her relationship with Seymour's Capote is spot on. You really know that they've always been close. Theirs is a true friendship, warts and all and unlike Sandra Bullock, Keener doesn't wear a silly wig.    There's also a superb choice for the role of Perry Smith. Clifton Collins Jr turns in a brilliant performance and as this film centres on the relationship between Truman and Smith, his part in the film is absolutely crucial. The moments between this unlikely pair are handled skilfully and never sink to the totally unbelievable scenes between Toby Jones and Daniel Craig.    The look of 'Capote' is similarly classy. Its cinematography far outshines that of `Infamous' (and presumably on a far smaller budget). We believe this is Holcombe; this is Kansas in the late 1950's.    While 'Capote' reaches its 'impact moments' through sheer strength of acting and a fine script, 'Infamous' instead relies on Perry snogging Truman and similarly clumsy events. While Toby Jones' performance is without a doubt a sterling effort, he can't hold 'Infamous' on his own. With Philip Seymour Hoffman's superb efforts and the truly empathic understanding of director Bennett Miller, 'Capote' is the film which will stand the test of time.    'Capote' is a really great film and whilst the award of an Oscar doesn't necessarily denote a fine performance, in this case it truly does. Whilst not perfect this film just may, as it did in my case, have you reaching for 'In Cold Blood' again. It does what it's supposed to do. It's compelling, revealing, shocking and utterly memorable. What more could anyone ask?

1416562605|5.0|During the reading of The White Tiger I felt the pain and humiliations of poverty and low expectations of people not only in India, but everywhere. Especially relevant was the expectations that once a group was candy makers, or honey dippers then that was their starting point and most likely ending point in life.<br /><br />It isn't that people can't escape these circumstances, it is that the efforts of a poor person must be orders of magnitude greater and his luck much better than that of a rich person for the same rewards. The tendency to look at the poor as a sub-species is universal also, having recently read \\"Death of a Red Heroine\\" it is in the culture of China and being a resident of the US and previously of Europe, the same tendencies are everywhere.<br /><br />I am sure that this offends Indians who have escaped the pain through education, the book was based in and about the country they grew up in and have good memories, but to be it wasn't about India at all.<br /><br />It was about the poor and less fortunate, the idea if you can't learn to program computers or earn an MBA you are somehow open to mistreatment and abuse, the world is slowly leaving these ideas behind, but books like this make us speed up a little perhaps, or remind us not to get complacent when it comes to the reduction of suffering.
B002B0OVWA|5.0|This is a really interesting album.  That isn't always a good thing, but in this case, it certainly is.  I LOVE putting an album on, and not knowing where it's going from one song to the next, or even from the verse to the chorus of the same song.  Only a very few albums have surprised me that way in the past decade or so.  Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot comes to mind, but it wasn't as riddled with wonderfully infectious pop hooks as West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum is.  I really want to see these guys live in a small club.  I have no idea what the critics have to say about this album.  If they like it, they are astute, if not, they are idiots, but that's always the way, isn't it?  Thank God for the internet and streaming alternative music, or I would never have heard of Kasabian.  It's a safe bet they won't be getting a lot of air play in this new world order of Britney, Beyonce, Kanye and Pink.
1594201927|4.0|I don't think it's possible for a history book to be as compelling a read as a good novel, but this book by Niall Ferguson gets very close.  I found the book hard to put down at times, as I was engrossed in his telling of different phases of our world's financial history.  What makes the book fascinating is how he looks at major world events through a financial lens, explains how financial changes, innovation, and even stagnation contributed to, or sometimes were the major causes of, worldwide social and political developments.    A perfect example is how John Law - a convicted murderer, professional gambler, and possible spy - convinced the French to reform its finances in extreme ways.  Eventually, Law took control of the entire French economy - and destroyed it.  Hearing how he did it was interesting enough, but the destruction was so severe that France never recovered.  Ferguson believes that Law's actions may have led indirectly to the French Revolution.    While he mentions earlier periods, details don't really emerge until the 14th century, and even then most of the book focuses on the 19th century and onward.  This makes sense because this is when more financial innovation began.  The book spends more time on the last 50 years, maybe even the last 20, than any other period.  Which brings up one of the reasons I gave this book only 4 stars  - the book was apparently written to accompany a TV series, and after reading it you will notice its disjointed nature.  There are gaps and some of the chapters are somewhat oddly constructed.  Knowing that the book was to accompany a series of TV shows indicates why Ferguson wrote it that way; unfortunately, doing so somewhat reduces the quality of the book.    The only other complaint I have is with the afterword, which Ferguson titled \\"The Descent of Money,\\" a play on Darwin's \\"Descent of Man.\\"  The entire afterword tries to draw parallels between biological evolution and the evolution of the world's financial system.It's an interesting analogy, but Ferguson pushes it too far and spends too much time trying to explain why they are similar but not the same.    In the end, that's a minor complaint.  I highly recommend the book, and I believe that anyone with an interest in history - financial or not - will enjoy the book immensely.  The book is targeted at the layman, and it is a fun and easy read for someone with no financial background at all.  The financial professional shouldn't shy away from this book either, as it is one of those books that everyone can learn from.

B001N26GFM|3.0|I asked for the DVD for my birthday because I hadn't seen the movie yet. It was certainly not what I expected. Sure, as some mention, the story line is pretty unbelievable. I doubt there was any chance that an Ayrian boy could sneak over to a death camp. That is not the point of the movie though. The point was to show the tragedy of the Holocost on both sides. Yes, it was tragic for the German people too and the innocence lost among the youth. I would have liked to see it developed better showing more of the parents views but they made the movie really mostly about the boy. It just didn't seem well balanced to me but the acting was good.
0451450523|5.0|Unicorns, like Fairy Tales, are a rare and dying breed.    For me, the book broke down into three parts. I have not seen the movie and after having read the book, don't really care to.     Peter S. Beagle (PSB) starts the book off with a wonderful description of the last unicorn living alone in a forest. I'm sure the average reader can visualize a unicorn without any trouble, but I felt PSB described the last unicorn as if he had actually seen one.     The second part, where the last unicorn is with the traveling carnival, is where I started to have my doubts about this novel. From the very first pages it is clear that PSB loves to play the wizard of words. He uses alliteration and poetry like a sorcerer uses spells and incantations. The problem for me was that sometimes he can be a little nonsensical. For example, \\"They were like the noise bees might make buzzing on the moon. (pg. 47)\\".    Fortunately, the second part doesn't last too long and in short order the reader is taken to Hagsgate and King Haggard's castle, where I felt the story really started to get rolling.   What really impressed me were the dialogues between the characters in regard to the following questions:  1) How should a fairy tale end?  2) What is the role of magic/a magician in a story?  3) What is the role of the hero in a story?  4) Is it better to change, or stay the same?     All these are questions that reminded me of Joseph Campbell's THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES, a huge influence on the STAR WARS series and a guide to understanding the mythology of old.     Although the narrative gets a bit flowery at times, in general I found it really well done, especially the rhyming poetry. The characters took some getting used to in the carnival setting, but by the time they had all reached the castle all my doubts were cast aside.   Many may see this novel as a book for Young Adults. In spite of that I think that older readers will enjoy this tale of an older time, a tale where the fairy tale and the unicorn are not forgotten, but brought back to life.
B000002L68|5.0|\\"Purple Rain\\" was not a soundtrack album.  It was a studio release from Prince and the Revolution.  The soundtrack would have to most definitely include songs by other artists.  However, the Purple Rain album was not a soundtrack!  Some people have complained about the lack of songs from the other people in the movie.      I believe the description is incorrect on Amazon.  The mp3 version of the title track is not the original from the album.  The original from the album was far longer than 4 minutes.  I don't know why they don't have the original, but I would buy the CD instead just to increase my odds of getting \\"the real thing.\\"    The songs on the album were at the height of Prince's 80s fame.  I'd listen to Purple Rain on a regular basis if I could find the full version.  Some of the other tracks are more of a novelty for the sake of the complete album.
0061245097|5.0|I love this series.  I was roped in from the first book and didn't stop till I finished all of them.  This one picks up a few years after the first which I found really interesting.  I'm not sure I've ever read a series quite like that.  However, it does stand out among the other vampire books that I have read.  This book is more intense than the first in my opinion and it only gets more involved as you go.  But if you're looking for something different, interesting and fun...you must read!
B001684L0A|5.0|This is undoubtable one of the best series to be presented by HBO.  Some others have apparently found it dark, but life in those times was difficult and a struggle even for those well placed in society and these moments are well presented.  John Adams achieved a great deal, yet in American history and throughout the world he is not as well known as Washington, Franklin and Jefferson. This series certainly places him on an equal standing. The script is intelligent, very well crafted and holds your attention throughout.    The series is overall, beautifully shot with some frames simply stunning in the detail of the period.  The scene where Adams confronts the Dutch hierarchy is one that Rembrandt would heartily approve of and is worthy of framing. And other shots of interiors and lighting that would delight the Dutch painter Vermeer.  (Some clumsy handheld camera shots in the earlier part of the series and some awkward angled shots elsewhere can therefore be forgiven.)    The BluRay transfer is outstanding in 16:9 displaying incredible detail and the producers have thankfully limited makeup to look natural in this Hi-def format except of course for the French Court that showed how outlandish they looked in reality, not long incidentally before many of them literally lost there heads in the French Revolution.    I give it a definite 5/5, an absolute delight to watch.

055357342X|3.0|It was once said that the the longer a war goes on, the more the course of that conflict depends on chance. So it is in \\"A Storm of Swords\\" (hereafter SOS), the third volume in George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. With the War of the Five Kings still raging throughout Westeros, Martin's trademark reversals of fortune continue, and the course of the war reaches a fever pitch. While Martin continues his usual quality, this book is decidedly more uneven than the first two.    As with the previous two volumes, SOS is told through alternating character-chapters, with events viewed from different point of view characters. In a nutshell, here is each character's basic plot:    1. Davos Seaworth - The Onion Knight, rescued after would-be king Stannis Baratheon's devastating loss at the Battle of the Blackwater, returns to his lord's service and find himself at odds with the increasingly occult plottings of Stannis and the red priestess, Melisandre.  2. Tyrion Lannister - Disfigured in the Battle of the Blackwater and recovering slowly from his injuries, Tyrion finds himself a pawn in King's Landing politics as his father displaces him as King's Hand and he is watched with increasing suspicion. Soon, the tables turn with increasing speed as the political landscape of the capitol alters catastrophically.  3. Sansa Stark - Sansa soon finds that false hope and grand expectations are not what they seem, as events change sharply in anticipation of King Joffrey's wedding.  4. Arya Stark - After escaping servitude in Harrenhal, Arya finds herself with an increasingly motley crew of outlaw companions, striving to wrest justice - and a living - from the wrecked countryside created in the conflict's wake as she makes her way to Riverrun.  5. Catelyn Stark - Ensconced at Riverrun, Catelyn must deal with disturbing family revelations as well as the unintended consequences of some of King-in-the-North Robb Stark's ill-advised decisions, on and off the battlefield.  6. JohnSnow - Infiltrating the Wildlings at the orders of the Halfhand, John Snow finds that the Wildlings are not at all what he expected, and that his decision to watch, wait, and strike while among them may be more difficult that he expected.  7. Jaime Lannister - Released from captivity in Riverrun by Lady Stark in hopes of trading him for her daughters in King's Landing, Jaime confronts his own conscience and his sense of purpose after tragedy befalls him on his journey.  8. Samwell Tarly - Stationed with his sworn brothers beyond the Wall, Sam must deal with the difficulties of the terrors of the Northlands as battle finds the Night's Watch.  9. Daenerys - Forging plans to conquer Westeros with a group of new companions, Dany decides she needs an army to take back her rightful kingdom - and goes to great lengths to acquire it.  10. Bran Stark - Traveling north with Hodor and the Reeds, Bran continues his education in the ways of the Wargs.    The Good: Martin writes what is probably the most plausible fantasy around. His Westeros is based on England of the High Middle Ages, and he paints this world with an experienced eye for both historical and geographical detail, as well as psychological complexity. Additionally, Martin is adept at including twists and turns that continue throughout his books. Weighing in at more than 1100 pages, this book would seem to be a chore to get through, but SOS is crafted as a tightly-written page-turner (I finished it in about 2 weeks) that feels much shorter than it actually is. You feel that you truly do get to know the characters, both those whose points of view we experience, as well as the vast (almost Tolstoy vast) cast of supporting characters that populate this novel.     What keeps this series fresh is Martin's \\"Hey, That's Life\\" fatalism - he unflinchingly portrays the horrors of war, and tricks of chance and fate are ubiquitous. There is no grand destiny, and no character is safe. Martin pays homage to classic fantasy as well- there are discernible echoes of Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, and C. L. Moore to be found here. Martin also creates a lot of cognitive dissonance - some things that we have taken as gospel in past volumes are muddied and made ambiguous in this volume (for instance - is the Lord of Light truly evil?).    The Bad: As mentioned at the beginning of this review, SOS is pretty uneven. Some characters are especially well-written and intriguing, while others are an absolute chore to read. In a work of this size, certainly you can't expect each character to be literary gold, but I've come to expect a great deal from this series, and in this especially Martin fails to keep up with his usual quality. Martin also seems to lose his touch to impart awe and fear in magic. In the previous volumes, magic is little seen and when it is, it is treated with especial reverence and trembling. However, in SOS, magic is suddenly treated as almost commonplace, and when long-spoken-of but never-seen fantastic creatures finally appear they are not greeted with appropriate awe, but glossed over casually. I was very confused by this. Also, the general tropes of Jon Snow and Bran's storylines (one character having difficulty finding where his loyalties lie, and another learning how to use special magical powers)  are, unfortunately, fairly cliched and will be familiar to fantasy afficianados; Martin might have tried to introduce some more interesting innovations (he usually does) but for whatever reason failed to do so. Something additionally distressing about SOS is the number of misspellings, typos and grammatical errors. I don't remember seeing quite this many in the previous two books.    Overally, SOS is a good entry into an exceptional series and well worth the time and effort to read, but there are a number of failings that I hope Martin will correct in \\"A Feast for Crows.\\"
B000DZIGDU|2.0|I wanted to like \\"Jarhead.\\"  I am a former Army officer myself (by way of disclosure) but I have always had a soft spot for Marines.  This film has several problems that essentially will ruin it for almost any viewer.  There is virtually no plot, there is virtually no war, and the depiction in the film of the Marines does not cut the mustard in terms of accuracy or plausibility.<br /><br />With respect to plausibility--to take just one example, in the film a recruit dies in a live-fire exercise.  The drill sergeant curses up a storm, and things move on, apparently with no consequences.  What rubbish.  Anyone who has ever served knows that such events, rare but not unheard-of, involve huge consequences and the military (yes, including those tough Marines) take such events very seriously.  Generally losing a soldier or Marine under such circumstances is a career-ending move for the man in charge.  This flick implies that the Sarge went out for a beer afterwords and forgot about it.  Not likely.<br /><br />Another outrageous matter in this mediocre film was the notion that one Marine could (or would) pull a firearm on a fellow Marine.  Complete nonsense.  This would constitute, at a minimum, an assault under the UCMJ and would never be tolerated, not anywhere or anywhen.  A court-martial would be the inevitable outcome, probably ending with a bad-conduct discharge.<br /><br />The overall depiction of Marines was more or less a Hollywood stereotype.  Yes, combat troopers, whether Marines or Army, are loud, irreverent, and yes profane, but not to the idiotic extremes depicted in this film.  After awhile the endless (and they are endless in the movie) antics, yelling, and horseplay by the Marines starts to grate.<br /><br />I could have (barely) tolerated and forgiven the Hollywood stereotype of Marines if this film had had a decent plot.  Sorry, there pretty much is no plot.  I can handle the notion that the First Gulf War was 99% hurry-up-and-wait.  That is the gist of modern warfare, and probably most warfare going back to ancient Sparta.  But this is, after all, a movie with a presumed purpose of entertaining the viewer.  So we needed a plot a little bit deeper than the various Marines' girl friends being unfaithful to them.  But we don't get one in this film.<br /><br />There are some funny moments in this flick that redeem it from being a one-star, but this is not a film that most viewers would ever want to watch more than once.  RJB.most warfare going back to ancient Sparta.  But this is, after all, a movie with a presumed purpose of entertaining the viewer.

0316010669|3.0|I enjoyed the book and found the ideas about rapid cognition fascinating and mostly convincing.  However, Gladwell makes a serious misstatement of fact in the \\"First Back Bay trade paperback edition, April 2007\\", on pages 274 and 275 of the Afterword. Here Gladwell writes about the greater rate at which blacks in the US are arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for crimes than whites. He says \\"I'm not talking here about racial differences in overall crime rates. What I am talking about is this: if, for example, a white man and a black man are charged with the identical drug related crime, the black man is far more likely than the white man to go to jail.\\"  But he then goes on to quote statistics that he says come from an unnamed report from Human Rights Watch: \\"In ten states black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at rates that are 26 to 57 times greater than those of white men in the same state.\\" (no reference was provided). Appalled by this huge disparity I went on line to Human Rights Watch and found a report dating from 2008 that contains much of the same data, and seems to be a later version of the document Gladwell quotes (Targeting Blacks, Drug Law Enforcement and Race in the US, 2008 Human Rights Watch).  The report only claims that the rate of imprisonment for blacks, as compared for whites, when charged with the same crime is about 3 times higher.  HRW reports that the \\"26 to 57 times\\" figures that Gladwell gives actually is mostly a result of \\"racial differences in overall crime rates\\".  The higher rates of imprisonment and are so much because blacks are arrested and charged at much higher rates than whites. For these statistics, see FBI crime statistics [...].  These statistics show that a similar number of crimes are committed by black and white Americans.  But since the number of white Americans is around 4 times that of black Americans, this means that the crime rate for blacks must be higher, to yield the same number of crimes.  Since thereappear to be more whites than blacks that use drugs, The Human Rights Watch document speculates that the higher arrest rate for blacks is due to several factors: that law enforcement is more focused in cities, where blacks are concentrated (due HRW says, to racial bias), and more blacks who sell drugs do so in open air markets where they are more likely to get arrested than whites (who may sell among themselves, but in more private settings). Although the Human Rights Watch provides ample evidence of racial bias, it is not anywhere near the \\"26 to 57 times\\" rate of bias that Gladwell misuses.  He should fix this error.    Let me add here that I think the Human Rights Watch is mostly right in its assertion that the focus on imprisoning people for drug law violations has a hugely racially disparate effect and is unjustly and wastefully consigning large proportions of African Americans to ruined lives since they have to waste time in prison, then go through life with the stigma of having a prison record. Of all the arrests of black Americans, only about 16 % are for drug law violations however, so fixing the drug war problem will not fix the incarceration problem  I think the war on drugs is more of a war on the poor, and especially a war on poor blacks.  But Gladwell should still get his facts straight.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I felt the theatrical version of the film was outstanding and was very interested in this version when it was announced. There was almost nothing about that version that I did not like. I will not try to itemize the many differences in this version. About 25 minutes of extra film enlarges the parts of many of the main characters and includes the death of the original Night Owl with flashbacks of his own days as a hero. Overall the longer version does have some excellent material.     However, one of the parts of Watchman I was not as happy about was the very graphic violence which in the theatrical version was right at the edge of snuff film quality. This version adds extra gore and horrorific violence to almost every seen that was already almost too much. Unless you have a very strong stomach this is not the version for you.    Disk 2, the extra's disc is also a disappointment with very little to make it worthwhile.

One of the most disappointing purchases I've made in quite a while because of that. Had they let us know on the box what it really was, I'd have been ok with that, as opposed to the promise of a 3D experience that, well, sucks.
B001GCUER0|5.0|What sets Mad Men apart and above all the other dramatic series?  In addition to the excellent plotting, direction and characterization, Mad Men as a series doesn't patronize the viewer's intelligence.  We the audience can draw our own inferences, and make our own connections.  This is the first series in many years which actually assumes that the viewer can be entertained while still using her/his analytical thinking. British television mastered this combination long ago.  Now, fortunately we have Mad Men, Season 1, Season 2 and Season 3.            I only hope that Maggie Siff as Rachel reappears in Season 3.  Of all Don Draper's amorous liaisons, his relationship with Rachel is the most complex and interesting.
B0021L8UPI|5.0|Move over Samara, Wednesday Addams and all you juvenile miscreants.  There's a new pint-size queen of evil and her name is Esther.  Brilliant, charming and oh-so-talented, she harbors a host of dark secrets behind her  innocent, smiling face.  But when you finally learn what they are it'll probably be too late.    Anyone who has read my prior movie reviews knows that I love good horror   and suspense films.  Unfortunately, nowadays most offerings in the genre are long on gore and short on story and character development.  That's not so with this time around, though.  Heavy on atmosphere and with very little blood, the movie relies more on suggestion, dark sets and outstanding acting to create its air of malevolence and all pervading evil.      The story concerns a tightly knit, loving family that is nonetheless marred by tragic events in its past, including the father's adultery and the mother's tumultuous recovery from alcoholism.  But the most heart wrenching nightmare they have endured is the loss of their third child, who was stillborn.  It weighs especially heavy on the mother, who struggles daily to cope with her depression and crushing sense of loss.    Seeking to make some good come of the horrific event, they adopt a highly intelligent, articulate and artistically gifted young girl from eastern Europe.  Her name is Esther, and at first she brings happiness and healing into their lives.  But soon they find out that she is not what she seems, no, not at all.    In my opinion the film's strongest asset is the brilliant performance by 12 year old actress Isabelle Fuhrman, who plays the title character.  She portrays Esther as a complex, multi-leveled character who possesses both admirable qualities and pathologically wicked desires.      During the movie my feelings for her went from affection, to pity, then to uneasiness and horror as her deepest, most twisted secret was revealed in a climactic moment that had me on the edge of my seat.      Set in Connecticutduring a bleak winter, the icy scenery is the perfect backdrop for the tension that mounts throughout the movie.  Esther first takes revenge on a girl at school who mocks her for her unusual clothing and quiet, studious demeanor.  Then she turns on those who threaten to reveal her past.  Finally the family that has taken her into their home feels her wrath.  The mother alone suspects the truth, but finds herself outwitted by her psychopathic opponent at every turn.      The final 20 minutes or so were filled with twists that kept me befuddled as to how it would all end, and I am very good at figuring out hidden plot elements.  For example, I suffered the misfortune of figuring out the secret to \\"The Sixth Sense\\" very early in that film.    That was not the case this time.  The producers clearly took great pains to avoid the worn out devices used in one cheesy horror movie after another.  In their place they devised a story line so uniquely insidious that it hit me like a wall of bricks when it was finally revealed.    Haunting, disturbing, terrifying and unforgettable - all these words and more describe this outstanding film.  I strongly recommend you shell out the money for the tickets and popcorn and see this one on the big screen.  It's worth every penny.
0439813786|2.0|I thought the illustrations in the book where beautiful and loved that the novel was full of them.

It lacked magic and imagination.  My seven year old son barely remembers me reading it to him.
0199535639|4.0|The Woman in White is probably among the original \\"Gothic romances,\\" and thus its elements define the genre. There is the upper-class British gentry, the family's country estate, mysterious night-time visits (the woman in white herself), the dysfunctional and complex family relationships, the unspoken secrets, the innocent servant, the evil plot. And, of course, the love story between a member of the family (here the heiress, Laura) and the new servant (in this case, the drawing-master, Walter).<br /><br />It's all very melodramatic, the sort of situation in which people plight their undying troths -- but that's part of its appeal. It's what you want from a good escapist summer novel, and this one has remained a classic for 150 years.<br /><br />Though at first you may wonder why it's remained so, because this is DEFINITELY written in 19th century Victorian prose: long winded, florid, lots of verbal gesticulations, exhausting descriptions. It's also very much of its time. For example, one of the heroines (Laura's half sister) is overly aware of her sex's limitations: \\"If I only had the privileges of a man, I would order out Sir Percival's best horse instantly, and tear away on a night gallop, eastward, to meet the rising sun -- a long, hard, heavy, ceaseless gallop of hours and hours, like the famous highwayman's ride to York. Being, however, nothing but a woman, condemned to patience, propriety, and petticoats for life, I must respect the housekeeper's opinions, and try to compose myself in some feeble and feminine way.\\" Whew.<br /><br />Yet the story itself is so strong that you will, inevitably, forgive it its 19th century characteristics. (Though if you love Dickens and his ilk, you will probably love this book just as it is.) Because at some point in the narrative, you will want to know just how our hero and heroines manage to capture the evil wrongdoers who would mar the futures of such marvelous delicacy... oh dear, now I'm doing it too. In short: damned fine story, if you can get yourself past the old-fashioned writing style. Worth the effort to do so.ourself past the old-fashioned writing style. Worth the effort to do so.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|After releasing a promising first album and an EP, The Gaslight Anthem released \\"The '59 Sound\\" last year. Although it's the Jersey quartet's sophomore album, this disc sounds more like a strong, rip-roaring debut from a very focused band. The Gaslight Anthem have managed to record an album full of energy, cranked-up guitars, and deep lyrics without sounding muddy, confused or aimless, something few bands can achieve, especially in only their second full-length release.<br />The group's often-noted fondness for classic rock, Bruce Springsteen in particular, is evident in the lyrics, as lead vocalist Brian Fallon sings (key word: \\"sings\\" not \\"screams\\") Springsteenish observations of normal life and its hardships and celebrations, and never comes off as being generic. Fallon even borrows the lyrics of Bob Seger's \\"Night Moves\\" in the assault of an opening track, 'Great Expectations.'<br />The best songs on \\"The '59 Sound\\" (though they're all great) - 'Great Expectations,' the title track, 'Miles Davis & the Cool,' 'The Patient Ferris Wheel,' and 'Here's Looking At You, Kid' - would make a convincing seller for anyone who wants to show a grumpy disgruntled classic rock advocate that the Gaslight Anthem are a band who respectfully learn from their predecessors while forging ahead.<br />The energy and soul in \\"The '59 Sound\\" is amazing, and based on that, one can only hope that the Gaslight Anthem released an official live album soon.
630522577X|4.0|My wife is a big fan of My Fair Lady and I watched it with her. I am not a fan of musicals, particularly those that are almost three hours long. However, My Fair Lady pleasantly surprised me and I recommend it.    MFL is a great film in that it does everything well. The cast is excellent (even though Audrey Hepburn is just lip synching her songs). I liked the way the script developed several of the supporting characters. The visuals are amazing; the costumes alone almost make MFL worth watching. The story is great too; you care about what happens to Henry and Eliza. Finally, MFL might make you pine for the old-style movies; everything (sex, violence, language) is so coarse in the films that we see today; MFL accomplishes many of the same effects with subtle grace.    I give MFL four stars. After all, it is a musical and people keep bursting into song. Still, watching MFL is three hours well spent.

Poor translation (I really hope it WAS a translation), contrived metaphor (this includes and abundance of cliches) and little to no real, valuable insight left me wondering why this author is so popular. If you want an \\"inspiring\\" easy read, this book may be for you. If you're already a fan, sticking to his fiction may be for the best. 1400 yen and little to show.
1400063736|5.0|On the morning of August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit strung a wire between the new, not entirely occupied, twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. He proceeded to step out onto the wire, a quarter of a mile above the pavement, and walk across, eight times, for a period of 45 minutes, while office workers, commuters, and police looked on in wonder, admiration, and consternation.<br /><br />Colum McCann tells the story of this aerial crime, enriching it with the stories of ten people who saw or were affected by the aerialist's action that day, including an Irish-born \\"street priest\\" in the South Bronx and his brother; Petit's sentencing judge, his wife, and son; mother/daughter hookers; and computer programmers on the West Coast. The reader is treated to a series of narratives that could stand alone as short stories, but that are, in the end, interconnected on the day of Philippe Petit's performance.<br /><br />The novel introduces a stunning variety of social and historical issues that played out in the decade of the 1970's. The breakdown of social class is seen in the coming together of a group of mothers, mourning the loss of their sons in the Vietnam War, while celebrating their lives. The effects of poverty and drug addiction on women and children are illustrated by the \\"family business\\" of prostitution. The power of interlinked computers and telecommunications was in its infancy and creating excitement among the programmers who were thinking and dreaming big. The Vietnam War, moving towards its close in 1974, divided friends and family in New York City and elsewhere. The World Trade Center towers, newly constructed and occupied, represent a beginning in this novel, rather than the iconic destruction and terror we associate with them today.<br /><br />Reading this novel, I was struck by the vast changes in communication between 1974 and the present. The Manhattanites on the sidewalk looking up at Petit paused in their busy lives to try to figure out what was happening 110 stories above them. They could not check CNN or their smart phones, as we would do today. They couldn't go online when they got to work to learn about what they'd seen. Computer programmers on the West Coast, who heard rumors of Petit's stunt, hacked into the phone system and began calling pay phones in New York City, hoping someone would pick up and tell them what was happening. In the era of the 24-hour news cycle and the Internet, it is hard to imagine how slowly, just 35 years ago, a sensational story could develop.<br /><br />This book is extraordinary -- for its writing, for its depiction of 1970's New York, and for the way it captures the emotions of the lives being lived in its pages.ories above them.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I won't review the movie. You see my stars; You know it's good.<br /><br />I just felt someone should mention that the digital copy in the Director's Cut set is actually the theatrical version, and not the Director's Cut.<br /><br />I find this to be an odd choice: Now I still don't have a digital copy of the movie I purchased. What was the thinking here, Warner Bros?
B001FB55H6|4.0|\\"Watchmen\\" was famously considered unfilmable. Considering that fact alone, that this film is both faithful to the graphic novel, and highly watchable, is exceptional. Zach Snyder brought these characteristics to \\"300\\", and fans of both graphic novels should feel that he's done them justice. Snyder clearly has a great deal of respect for the visual aspects of the medium.    Not that \\"Watchmen\\" is for everyone. It's incredibly gory, at times off-putting. The fight scenes are unnecessarily long. The pacing, while fairly faithful to the novel, doesn't always translate well to film. Occasionally you'll find yourself tuning out, waiting to return to something like a core storyline. This is a problem shared by the novel, which essentially has an interchangeable third act, but it's even clearer in this medium.    It may be hard for some viewers to relate to the 1980's global thermonuclear war theme, but it's only a backdrop to the core theme of the novel - that human beings are vicious self-destructive animals, but also worthy of love and salvation - and it's updated in subtle ways. Notice how Snyder & co. skip past the terrorism-boogieman theme and focus on expansionist governments and rampant corporatism. Viewers of the Blu-Ray disc might appreciate the alternate timeline feature, which hints that, while it wasn't explicitly shown, Nixon was also on that grassy knoll...    I felt the only real miscue was the use of period music sync. \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" held up OK, but most others felt terribly out of place. Only Phillip Glass's cues from \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" really fit.
1595141715|5.0|I don't know even how to write this review properly. I bought this book around 2:30pm today and finished it at around 10pm. I stopped long enough to make dinner. I'm not sure if I held my breath the whole time or lived every page breathlessly.    It's a story about a girl who commits suicide and retroactively confronts the people in her life that ultimately helped lead her down the path to taking her life. It's a very heavy subject matter to take on, but I think it is done in the most honest way possible. Suicide is not logical, or reasonable. And Hannah, the girl in question, isn't any of these things either. She never really blames these people for her death though. She blames them for a lot of things, but not her death. Ultimately I think the story is about how we treat each other, teenagers and adults alike, and how we choose to behave towards others can have profound effects that we can't foresee. Hannah is unfortunately the target of too many people who don't think about what they are doing to her before they do it. And over time, many years and tragic events, she is rubbed down to nothingness, too numb to know how to deal with her own sorrow. I never cried for this character, who is sometimes awful and selfish and often sweet and kind and funny. But I understood her. I saw parts of her in people I knew in high school and after they were all grown up.     I think that, like Perks of Being a Wallflower, this book should be required reading for high school students and adults alike. It tells us a lot more about ourselves than we may be comfortable with knowing.
B001FB55H6|2.0|..these are the words I'd use. First let me say that my comments are on comparing the movie to the novel, and not about whether one might enjoy the movie for it's own sake.<br /><br />  I intentionaly read the novel before seeing the movie to be sure I'd get the authors intent, and not be influenced by other interpritations. A big limitation to making a movie from a book, are the blanks a reader fills into the gaps. What a person looks like, their personality. Even in a graphic novel, there are numerous bits and pieces an individual will create to complete a character. So it would be impossible for any film maker to satisfy every readers perception. Then add the time restrictions in trying to compress what some one may have read over a matter of days, into one seated viewing time, really isn't advisable.<br /><br />  And this is what I feel happened here. In the end, the characters Alan Moore created didn't ring true, nor did what I thought he was trying to express. I give Zack Snyder credit for trying to relay some of the novel's comments. But in the end, I felt it came off as a visualization of a comic book to appeal to the greatest number of potential movie goers... and not as a retelling of a graphic novel in another medium.<br /><br />  If you are looking for an adventure/action flick with flashy imagery (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), this is a fine flick. But if you're looking for a film to enhance what you thought and felt when you read the book, I suspect you will be more than a little disappointed.
B001FB55H6|1.0|I've never looked at the print version - I'm an animation, Anime and SF fan. I found this movie to often be nonsensical and too far over the top.  Yes, the sxf were decent, but not overwhelming, the plot was lame, and the protagonist was a wimp.  I agree with other reviewers - the $10 off the complete version when it's released?! Double-dipping to the extreme.
0143034901|5.0|I have been lucky this summer, every book I had been saving on my nightstand to read after school got out has been excellent.  The Shadow of the Wind probably is the best.<br /><br />I won't go into details about the plot, many here have said everything there is to say and probably better than I could. I liked the plot fine and I liked the idea of the cemetary for books - but I LOVED the writing.  I found myself rereading sentences or passages just because they were so beautiful. There have been few books I could say that about and I have been an avid reader for over 50 years.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I'm a watchmen fanboy, im sure that there are other reviews here that review the movie much better that I. I would like to comment on the Digial Copy that is provided by Amazon that is bundled with the DVD/Blue Ray.  For those of you that don't read the fine print, like me, the digital copy that is bundled with your purchase can be viewed anytime within 30 days of your purchase. However, once the digital copy has been started you have 24 hrs to view it as many times within the 24 hr period before your license for the digital copy expires. Then if you wish to view the digital version again you have to purchase another license.     This is my first time using Amazons digital video, and based on my experience my last. Granted, the digital copy was included with the DVD purchase but the restrictions were not made clear when I decided to buy the DVD. The digital copy was not a deciding factor in purchasing the DVD but was something I though would be a nice extra. I don't think the terms were made clear enough in what restrictions were placed on viewing the digital copy. Also getting a hold of a customer service rep. was hell, god help you if you are trying to find a phone number. Lucky i'm here, for those that are interested: US and Canada 1-800-201-7575
0765316897|4.0|\\"The Hero of Ages\\" is the conclusion to Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy, following \\"The Final Empire\\" and \\"The Well of Ascension\\".  Of the three volumes, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" is the weakest, though it serves as a decent conclusion to an excellent trilogy.<br /><br />At the end of \\"The Well of Ascension\\", the young Mistborn Vin was tricked into freeing the malevolent godlike being known as Ruin.  True to its name, Ruin has been busy spreading death, destruction and despair with gleeful abandon in the year since, while Vin and her husband, Emperor Elend Venture, desperately seek some way to stop it.  They are following a series of clues and secret supply caches built by the old Lord Ruler, who was killed by Vin in \\"The Final Empire\\".  The Lord Ruler had struggled with Ruin for a thousand years, and hid these resources for his followers to use in the event of his death.  Other surviving members of Kelsier's crew have split up to confront the most powerful remaining warlords, hoping to convince them to join with Elend and try to deal with the ever-present mists and choking rains of ash that Ruin is using to destroy the world.<br /><br />The conflict with Ruin, the associated backstory involving Ruin's counterpart Preservation, and the apocalyptic situation all give \\"The Hero of Ages\\" a much more mythological and cosmological atmosphere than \\"The Final Empire\\" and \\"The Well of Ascension\\".  The wide-ranging conflict, which scatters groups of characters to distant locations, also contrasts with the earlier books' focus on relatively few characters in a single city.  Sanderson seems more comfortable writing stories with cozier settings, and the broader scope also weakens what character development he attempts, which focuses on Sazed and Spook.  The story culminates in a conclusion that is far too \\"deus\\" for my tastes, and toes the line of what I can stand.<br /><br />At the same time, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" also lacks the compelling hooks that help make the other \\"Mistborn\\" books more interesting than standard fantasy fare.  \\"The Final Empire\\" has the \\"heist story\\" framework as well as the backstory of a world in which the Dark Lord had (apparently) defeated the hero of prophesy.  \\"The Well of Ascension\\" considers what exactly happens after tyranny is overthrown and victory declared.  In contrast, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" may be Sanderson's most conventional fantasy yet: the world is threatened by a powerful destructive force that the heroes must outwit and overcome.<br /><br />Even Sanderson's elaborate magic system becomes problematic as the ever-expanding details of the tripartite allomancy-feruchemy-hemalurgy construction multiply to a somewhat unwieldy size.  Many of the blurbs that introduce each chapter, which were used to great effect in the other volumes, now need to be omniscient explanations of just what exactly is going on.<br /><br />\\"The Hero of Ages\\" is a decent conclusion to an excellent trilogy, which manages to tie together all three books, and even hints at yet \\"another secret\\" lurking beneath the surface.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite rise to the level of its predecessors, the level we've come to expect from Sanderson.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|When Hollywood remakes a classic, it does so with a vengeance, in this case 1939s \\"The Women\\", a tale of New York socialite Mary Haines (Norma Shearer in 1939, Meg Ryan in 2008) whose husband is stolen by an opportunistic hussy. In the original, a careless gossip reveals a scandalous affair, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks poaching the man of a beloved, gentle woman and faithful wife. Like the current remake, no one suffers financial distress in either film. Where such movies served to distract a country burdened by the long years of the Depression, the 2008 version is nothing but a paean to Sex and the City and its ilk.<br /><br />The crisp, acerbic dialog that fed the drama of a heartless housebreaker determined to secure her future in 1939 has been watered down to support vague cameo appearances, but the context is lost in a twisted mess of improbable solutions and sloppy writing. When Mary Haines gathers with ladies in similar situations getting \\"quickie\\" divorces in Reno 1939, the modern group goes to a health farm, where Ryan smokes a joint with Bette Midler and ruminates on where she's gone wrong. While the first film offered fresh faces destined for long term stardom, Eve Arden, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford, the new one is a rogue's gallery of cosmetically altered actresses, some more gruesome than others.<br /><br />Meg Ryan- sporting a mouth that is part Meg, part Calista Flockhart and part Michelle Pheiffer- sullies Shearer's former role with braggadocio about her performance in the bedroom (something about nails and boards) and a hapless Annette Benning apologizes for exposing her friend to the rabid tabloid gossip. Bette Midler makes a bold, if shocking cameo, as though she stumbled onto the wrong set. And what could be more absurd than casting Crawford's iconic role with the sultry Eva Mendes (the extent of her role is a few lines delivered in sexy lingerie or in a bath tub)? Sadly, the coming to self of a married woman still in love with an unfaithful husband becomes Ryan's tongue-in-cheek parody of a new identity, complete with Annie Lennox anthem in the background.<br /><br />For all the wasted efforts of such greats as Candice Bergin and Cloris Leachman, there are a few stellar moments: 5 stars to Annette Benning for a performance that transcends the vapid material, a short, but punchy role by Debi Mazar, the gossipy nail lady who spreads the rumors and a terrific one-liner by natural comedic actress Ana Gasteyer. In contrast, Jada Pinkett-Smith is a brash lesbian, Debra Messing's considerable talent is wasted, and Carrie Fisher? Well, she's just... Carrie Fisher.<br /><br />An iconic comedy of manners and the danger of gossip is turned into a frivolous chick flick in an effort that does no justice to the sophistication of the original in this uncomfortable ensemble piece. It says something about the state of filmmaking for actresses over forty when all the public is offered is this warmed up hash with neither plot nor substance, a sad commentary when talented actresses are forced to alter their faces to remain relevant in a youth-obsessed society. Shame on Hollywood- and the screenwriter, producers and director- for presenting these actresses with such substandard fare.

0765350386|5.0|\\"The Final Empire\\" is Brandon Sanderson's second published novel, after \\"Elantris\\", and the first volume of his \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy.  As in \\"Elantris\\", Sanderson makes his mark by turning a fantasy cliche on its head, imagining a world where a hero arose to combat a Dark Lord -- and lost.  For a thousand years since, the immortal Lord Ruler has held complete power over a blasted world where a red sun burns in a smoke-blackened sky, brown plants struggle to survive amid rains of ash, and every night mysterious mists cover the land.  The Lord Ruler's early supporters were rewarded with noble status and magical powers of \\"allomancy\\"; his opponents were crushed and cast into slavery.<br /><br />It's in this evocative setting that a crew of expert thieves and con men (with, of course, hearts of gold) puts together an audacious plan to rob the Lord Ruler himself, and if possible destabilize his regime.  In the model of a \\"heist story\\" like \\"Ocean's Eleven\\", each member of the crew has a particular specialty, and most are \\"Mistings\\" with a single allomantic ability.  They are led by the charismatic Kelsier, who is the rarest and most powerful kind of allomancer, a full \\"Mistborn\\".<br /><br />The real focus of the story, however, is on the development of Vin, a young girl brutalized by a childhood on the streets.  Vin is also a Mistborn, and if she can learn to control her abilities, she could become a powerful and dangerous figure, perhaps even a threat to the Lord Ruler.  Recruited as Kelsier's apprentice, Vin is put to work as the crew's spy within the nobility, where she falls for Elend Venture, the kindhearted son of a ruthless nobleman.  Vin and Kelsier are the central figures in the book, with most other characters largely filling in their appointed roles.<br /><br />As the heist plot unfolds, some members of Kelsier's crew try to unravel the history of the Lord Ruler's ascension, which could provide the key to understanding and countering his power.  Clues to this mystery are provided at the start of each chapter, but in both this backstory and the \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy as a whole, \\"there's always another secret\\" hiding beneath the surface, helping to keep things interesting and engaging.<br /><br />If you're new to Sanderson's work, \\"The Final Empire\\" is a great place to start, featuring a captivating setting, layered plot and creative magic system.  Although the start of a trilogy, it stands up on its own and tells a complete story, even while hinting at deeper issues -- \\"another secret\\" -- lurking behind the scenes.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|I've never been much of a STAR TREK fan but it's not like I haven't tried. As a kid I watched the old series once in a while and also got to see the original first film in its initial theatrical release but was truly bored out of my mind. For whatever reason, this is a series that's never been too popular outside the US unlike, say, STAR WARS. That said, I had no intention of seeing this new film but word of mouth was just too good to ignore for which I'm glad as this is an exciting, non-stop action movie with great performances. I thought the new Spock was terrific, Zoe Saldaña absolutely gorgeous and it's hard to remmember any film in which a cameo by an old beloved figure has been so perfectly justified. The impecable special effects alone are worth the price of admission.  Now, to my amazement, I'm seriously considering buying this DVD. I guess this proves it's never to late to become a Trekkie.

B001UV6C4G|5.0|The book is all that is described previously.  The handful of characters are easily identified by their charm, personality, and wit within each letter, so they are not lost in the body of the book.  I was hesitant to begin such a novel, as the concept seemed disjointed for a reader. Shaffer and Barrows, aunt and niece, took a real horror, German occupation WWII, and spun a magnificent story around an unforgetable cast of very seemingly real people.  I rank this book among my other favorites, Glass Castle; and Water for Elephants.  A delight!
0307588335|5.0|The pulse of a Wall Street firm can be found on its trading desks.  Larry McDonald was a trader and he gives his readers great insights into what it was like to be at Lehman until a few months before the firm's collapse.  You'll enjoy his tales of pitting belief in the firm's outstanding credit analysts against the brute force of institutional clients.  You'll also gain insights into convertible bonds, an underappreciated class of securities that can help investors who take the time to learn about them.    The book has some shortcomings, which I suspect come from co-author Robinson's tendency to embellish.  Just ignore these and focus on the trading stories.  The book gives you a great feel for the quality and skepticism coursing through the many quality people at Lehman and how they tried to fight a blind belief in growth and buying things just because they had been going up.     After you read this book, you'll have a better understanding of the conflict--mindless momentum buying versus intelligent analysis--responsible for so much of the financial crisis.  Don't miss it!

B00009RDG9|4.0|Growing up in the 80s as a geeky kid with Cerebal Palsy, I grew to hate action films. Arnold Shwartznager and Chuck Norris seemed like idiots, and represented the right wing reactionary politics I despise. But seeing The Hunted  made me realize I don't dislike action films at all, just bad actors and comic book direction.<br /><br />The Hunted stars Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. Jones trains Del Toro how to kill with knives in the army, and the student sees the horrors of war in 1999 Kosovo. He comes home and begins to kill hunters, as he has become an animal rights fanatic. His exposure to violence has embeded violence into him. He tries to do the nobel thing, but does not realize his own pathology in how he goes about this.<br /><br />Assisting the FBI,  the teacher tries to track his renagade student down.<br /><br />The Hunted, is of course, directed by the great Biily Friedkin, and this makes all the differance. During a car chase on a  rainy cold day, the car is stuck in traffic, and you can see the driver tired, cold, struggling with the steering wheel. You begin to feel tired. Your arms start to hurt.<br /><br />In another scene, the instuctor teaches his students how to kill with knives, stabbing numbered points of the body. The instuctions are rote. Friedkin shows how young man are turned into murder machines with the same detatchment they are taught to drive or flip Big Macs. This is absolutely chilling, and not in a cinamatic, thrill-chill way. It really  sends a sick feeling through you.<br /><br />The teacher is chasing his mad student out of guilt for the methodical trarining he gave him. Later, they end up in a knife fight. These cuts hurt. You can feel them going into YOUR skin. The duel is long and you realize, it is protracted, disgusting work to knife someone to death. It is a mean, horrible busness, even if it is self-defense.  Only Freidkin can take what would be action fare and elevate it into an anti-violent statement.<br /><br />For the longest time, I have always thought Martin Scorcesse was our best filmmaker. His use of unique camara angles, imaginative transitions and attention to detail makes an extremely compelling case for this.<br /><br />But after seeing The Hunted--which made me revisit French Connection  and The Exorsist--my money is now on Friedkin. He may not have the flawless track record of Scorcesse, but his feel for the viceral is simply amazing. Scorcesse uses the physical to work your emotions. Friedkin uses the physical to work your body, actually giving you tactile sensations that make you feel what his charactors are undergoing. It is astounding.<br /><br />The Hunted is not a complex story, but the acting is fantastic, focusing on the emotions instead of the stunts. When you work with a director like Billy Friedkin, all you  have to do is act. Leave the action up to the master himself.Scorcesse was our best filmmaker.

B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Jumper reminds me of a more hyper kinetic version of \\"Highlander\\" - at least in the storyline - where one individual who belongs to a special mutant race that has existed over time must now fight for lone survival in the modern world.  Substitute the swords with the teleportation, and throw in a bit of the stylised action from \\"Wanted\\" and you have a nice wham-bam film.  The trailer for Jumper made the film look more complicated than it really is.  It's actually an easy film to watch.<br /><br />Hayden Christensen (admittedly not one of my favourites after Star Wars) - is very convincing in what could be his best role.  Samuel Jackson, as always - excels at whatever he's doing, and he's a bada** dude in this one.<br /><br />The film succeeds in moving the action from scene to scene.  Less successful and less convincing is the attempt to inform us about the Jumper's origins and their nemesis - the Paladins.  Because the film is so contemporary and slick in its style, sometimes it's hard to buy into the theory of an \\"age-old past.\\"  The ending could have been a little more mysterious...but this is a fun film.  3.5 stars.  Enjoy.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|If you enjoyed playing Silent Hill back in the day, you WILL enjoy this movie.  It's been almost a decade since I played they game, but this movie brought back some fun memories.  Like the game it's based on, it's atmospheric, gory, and tense.  I avoided it because of the bad critical reviews, but I don't think they approached this one from the right angle.  This is a superior adaptation of a video game.  If you haven't played the game, the Ring-like plot may seem hakneyed.
B00297FEUS|4.0|I purchased this cd thinking the sound quality would be way better than the original. I played both of them side by side and did not notice any difference. Did they even remaster it?? It is still a good buy as the 2nd disc is well worth the price of admission, especially the newly recorded \\"30', that song rocks. I think anyone looking for a better sounding Stay Hungry cd should buy Still Hungry because that cd has so much of a better sound than the original recordings. It's sad to say they had to rerecord them to make them sound better but that's what you get these days in the digital age. But everything aside this cd is still worth the purchase, buy it.
0312360266|2.0|I want to like this novel. I really, really do. The premise is kinda interesting. A school full of vampires. I like the originality of becoming a vampire not through normal sucking of blood but through being marked. I like the Cherokee lore fitting in. However, I find the childish, teeny bopper language to be utterly repulsive. (I am aware its for young adults, but do we have to dumb it down for them to such a level?) Picture four 13 year old girls with skimpy clothes and lots of glitter yammering away about boys in valley girl accents, and you have the voice behind this novel. Gag. Also, the occasional parenthesized opinions of the author/characters on sex and drinking comes off a bit preachy (as if the author is speaking to her daughter or students indirectly). All in all, I doubt I will finish the novel, and I certainly won't buy the next in the series. (Note: I did finish the novel. And I did buy the second in the series. They have a slightly addictive quality when you near the end of the first. Still maintain my previous complaints. So, in short, I'd recommend it for a quick, beach, trashy sorta read.)
B0011QC9U6|1.0|The only way I could tell this movie was about Beowulf was because one of the characters kept proclaiming \\"I am Beowulf!\\" Boring animation, a story only sort of related to the epic, plenty of cinematic action cliches. Pretty much a total waste of time.    It's hard to believe Neil Gaiman had something to do with this. It has basically spoiled Gaiman for me.

0375413405|5.0|The movie \\"Julie & Julia\\" is built around the astonishing idea that a fan of \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One\\" would cook her way through the book's almost-600 recipes in a single year. I've been using this book for three decades and I've only made a fraction of the recipes. But I've made that fraction so many times that the pages fall open to my favorite recipes.<br /><br />The other way to identify my favorites? Greasy pages. Makes sense --- Child knew, when Michael Pollan and Nina Planck were still in their cribs, that it wasn't real food that kills you, it's grotesque American portions. As Child gaily told her television audience, \\"If you're afraid of butter, as many people are nowadays, just put in cream!\\"<br /><br />Such bluntness was her nature --- and her charm. She came from money and privilege; the challenge of her life was to find something worth committing herself to. First came Paul Child. Then, at 37, came the Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris. And then, through a bit of luck, came an opportunity to work with Simone Beck on a French cookbook for Americans. As she tells the story in My Life in France, that book took almost a decade.<br /><br />Judith Jones was the first American editor to read the manuscript. She flipped: \\"I pored over the recipe for a beef stew and learned the right cuts of meat for braising, the correct fat to use (one that would not burn), the importance of drying the meat and browning it in batches, the secret of the herb bouquet, the value of saut&eacute;ing the garnish of onions and mushrooms separately. I ran home to make the recipe --- and my first bite told me that I had finally produced an authentic French boeuf bourguignon --- as good as one I could get in Paris. This, I was convinced, was a revolutionary cookbook, and if I was so smitten, certainly others would be.\\"<br /><br />Quality mattered. So did timing. \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking, Volume One\\" was published in 1961. In the White House was a President with a wife who loved France. Air travel was replacing ocean liners --- Americans in larger numbers were traveling to Europe. Frozen food and TV dinners were clogging the supermarkets; Child lobbied for accessible sophistication, and changed the way some of us ate.<br /><br />And then there was multi-media. WGBH, Boston's public TV station, invited Child to promote her book. The station had no studio kitchen, so she brought eggs, a whisk and a hot plate. On camera, she made an omelette, narrating the process with wit and confidence. A TV series soon followed --- she was Martha Stewart before there was Martha Stewart.<br /><br />Actually, she was much more. Back then, cooking was not a respected profession. She showed that it was a discipline --- and an art. And she legitimized the home-gourmet. Was cooking a chore? Not after you'd seen Julia Child, amusing herself as she prepared dinner.<br /><br />All these years later, I'm still charmed by Child's 13-page screed on omelettes. On the other hand, I never had much use for her pât&eacute;s or terrines, souffl&eacute;s or sauces.  Dessert still seems like overkill. And the seven recipes for kidney? Non-events. It's the classics that first appealed to me, and still do.Air travel was replacing ocean liners --- Americans in larger numbers were traveling to Europe.

B0021L8UPI|4.0|It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. \\"Orphan\\" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.     The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is \\"The Good Son\\" (1993), but \\"Orphan\\" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes \\"The Good Son\\" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.     This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that \\"Orphan\\" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible \\"Orphan II\\".

0446402397|2.0|The first half of \\"Child 44\\" is just incredible. A chilling look at an evil society and the monsters that it spawned, it lived up to all of the hype. Gripping, scary and just impossible to put down.    And then...    I won't go into too much detail, but all of a sudden, cliches, coincidence and an incredibly pat ending ruined all that had come before.    One of the most disappointing endings to any book that I have ever read.

I put in my previous Terminater DVD, and I couldn't believe it! The picture was better on the DVD, and it had way more special features too! Even though I paid fifteen dollars for it for the new edition, I STILL FEEL RIPPPED OFF!!!!!!     It feels like they just jumped on the blu-ray bandwagon making this and rushed into it. Cheaply!

B000Z27HLS|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this is the best of the new Jane Austen films broadcast on PBS. In fact, it is one of the best Austen films ever made - and definitely better than the 1980s version of the film (probably the only other version of Northanger Abbey made). The main characters are delightful, and touch one's heart, and the cinematographer's method of dramatizing gothic fantasies helps the viewer enter the heroine's mind and understand why she developed the misconceptions (although not total misconceptions) that she did. Highly recommended, and worth repeated viewings. The novel, probably the least known of Austen's novel, is just as much a delight as the film.

061891868X|1.0|This book starts off with an interesting review of the recent history of theoretical physics, but veers horribly off course when it starts talking about string theory. I was hoping for an interesting discussion of Loop Quantum Gravity, Lee Smolin's particular specialty, but instead found a poorly explained diatribe against string theory and string theorists. While he repeatedly claims that he has immense respect for string theorists, his ad homenim attacks against them make this claim doubtful. An initially promising chapter on sociology turns out to be the longest personal attack on string theorists the book contains. He concludes by summing up his seven complaints about string theorists (note, not string theory): These are: \\"1. Tremendous self confidence...2. An unusually monolithic community...3. self identification with the group...4. the boundary between the group and other experts...5. A disregard for and disinterest in other experts...6. A tendency to misinterpret the evidence optimistically...7.A lack of appreciation for the extent to which a research program ought to involve risk.\\" What does any of this have to do with science? Or the history of science? Or the philosophy of science? This is an entire book about how arrogant string theorists are. This type of writing belongs in a tween blog, not a respected academic's published work.    The book's sparse evidence is contained mostly in end notes and quotations. Several times I found that his explanations meaningfully distorted quotes that immediately followed. Passages from footnotes are misrepresented even more. This makes me very suspicious of any statement or argument by others that he paraphrases with no direct quote or footnote. Smolin seems to willfully distort the facts. Much of the book is about what string theorists have not done, always with the evidence \\"that I am aware of.\\" However, Smolin seems to have made no attempt to find out what they have done. For example, at one point he claims that attempts to research Bell's Inequality and hidden variable theories have been suppressed for decades. This is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. Decades have been spent designing ever more precise explorations of the foundations of quantum mechanics. Ironically, the same day I finished the book and wrote this review, Science magazine published an article describing the most recent significant experimental disproof of hidden variables theories with citations to many many other articles about the same topic. Smolin practically describes a conspiracy among powerful physicists to suppress this research. The low point of the book comes when this fact bending meets his ad homenim attacks. At one point after explaining his own views on the nature of time he claims that no string theorist has ever had a single original idea about time. What purpose does that claim serve other than to insult all string theorists? In what way does it enlighten the reader? The placement of this statement right after his own views on time emphasizes the real reason for the book: Lee Smolin's justification of his own arrogance. As a side note, I know two string theorists. One of them focuses much of his research on exploring the possibility of there being two dimensions of time. While he very well may be wrong (which he acknowledges, despite Smolin's claim that string theorists are overly self confident suppressors of alternative research) it certainly qualifies as original.    Don't waste your time on this book. It presents an extremely hostile view of theoretically physics that will give you nothing you couldn't learn from a better book.
0307454541|5.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is the story of a mystery surrounding a missing girl named Harriet Vanger.  There are many characters in this book, some may even say there are too many, but every character is involved in one way or another with the forty year old mystery of what happened to Harriet Vanger.<br /><br />Each character in this novel has his or her own story.  First and foremost there is Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist who is sued for libel after writing a scandalous and damaging article about multi-billionaire Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. The novel begins with Mikael's conviction, which he meekly accepts. The details surrounding his involvement with Wennerstrom are revealed gradually throughout the novel. Mikeal is sentenced to 90 days in jail plus a hefty fine.<br /><br />Erika Berger is Mikael 's co-worker and romantic interest. Berger is married, but her husband allows her to see Mikael on the side. The arrangement works for everyone involved. She is forced to take over their magazine, Millennium, which Blomkvist and her head up together, when Mikael decides to resign after his conviction.<br /><br />Now onto to Harriet Vanger. Shortly after Mikael's day in court, he is contacted by an attorney who represents an elderly but well known industrialist named Henrik Vanger. The Vanger Corporation has an extensive history, but is in a steady decline.  Mikael wonders what someone like Henrik Vanger would want with a man who was very publicly convicted of libel. Almost forty years ago, Henrik's niece disappeared without a trace. Ever since then someone has been torturing Henrik and sending him a pressed flower on his birthday, something Harriet did the birthday before her disappearance.<br /><br />Henrik makes Mikael a deal: spend a year attempting to the solve the case of his missing niece and he will serve him Wennerstrom's head on a silver platter. Mikael doesn't know why, but he accepts the challenge and moves into the Vanger estate under the guise of writing a biography of the Vanger family. Henrik is very adamant that the search into Harriet's disappearance must remain discreet.<br /><br />Before Henrik Vanger contacts Mikael Blomkvist to investigate Harriet's disappearance, he has him investigated. Here is where the girl with the dragon tattoo enters the picture. Her name is Lisabeth Salander. She is considered mentally impaired and must regularly report to her guardian appointed by the court. Lisabeth has a troubled past with abuse and borders on the sociopathic, however, her skills as an investigator are legendary. She is hired  by Vanger to investigate Mikael and then is asked to drop the investigation.  Mikael and Lisabeth, however, join forces and try to solve the unsolveable mystery of what in the world happened to Harriet Vanger. Lisabeth is a strange girl. She described as almost child-like. Most people mistake her for an anti-social anorexic teenager, but Lisabeth is actually a dangerously brilliant hacker/investigator with a photographic memory.<br /><br />The Girl with Dragon Tattoo is an engaging mystery that will grab you and won't let you go until you discover the horrible secret behind Harriet's bizarre disappearance. The novel almost reminded me of an Agatha Christie mystery with its list of suspects and possible motives.  Almost everyone is a suspect in Harriet's disappearance. The ending might be considered a cop out to some readers, but this was still an incredibly intense novel. I was sad to hear about the author's passing, but so grateful that he left us a sequel to this fabulous novel.nger family.

B000MV8AE0|3.0|This film is worth watching.  I won't bore anyone with the positive details.   My ONLY soar spot is the casting of Diane Kruger as Anna Holz.  This role was written to tap into the soul of the most complicated and distraught composer of our time.  Yet her performance is not entirely convincing.  It lacks passion.  It even seems bland at times.  I'm not familiar with any other of Krugers' work, but at best, she's a pretty girl who can read her lines.  That's all it takes in Hollywood, right?  As a lead role, I'd rather see Kruger in something made for the SCI-FI channel.  Maybe SPECIES 4 or 5.....whatever?  Sorry DK.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I've watched this show from the 1st season also like many other awesome fans of the show. This past season was great! Especially the battle between the angels and the demons. A whole new twist on the show this season with the introduction of the Angels. I wasnt expecting that but it was a cool idea. We all have to agree the couple of seasons were all about the Winchesters going after Yellow eye. Cool last name by the Way! Then came 3 when they were going after Lilith and the 4th with the new additions, the Angels. Anyway, let me just say that i hear talk about this being the final season. Id say to heck with that. They need to keep going with this show until it has nothing more to tell. I believe and this is just me and i dont know if anyone agrees. They need to keep going since this show is so popular. Very popular. We need to get the scare back like the 1st season. 2nd was good....3rd was too short. 4th was very good. Ive got some ideas if they wanna hear it for the show or maybe from the fans! The Winchesters should just keep driving and kicking butt! Even if its up to season 10. Thats just me though.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a new mom, with a one year old. I wanted something I could do at home in minimal amounts of time. I desperately wanted to get into shape and lose some pounds. I am 20 days into this video. I have conquered levels 1&2 so far. I have to say, Jillian is very motivating and encouraging, but this is not an easy workout video!! I was in tears after the first day and couldn't make it through the full 20 minutes. But, I kept getting back up to try it again. It took until day 3 when I could make it through the first 20 minutes straight. I do this video 6 days a week, and jump on my elliptical machine when I can. I have only lost 3 pounds, but I don't care what the scale says because I have dropped a full dress size! My abs look gorgeous, I am losing the \\"mommy\\" tummy, my arms are strong and fit and lifting my baby is even easier now. I love what it has done to my legs as well, my thighs are not rubbing together anymore!!!! I recommend this if you want to build up great looking muscles and strength. I am sure if I followed Jillian's recommended diet on her website that I would lose more pounds on the scale, but frankly, I am so happy with the inches I have lost! Over 2 on my waist alone in just 20 days. Just know it is not easy, but I have found it highly worth it!
B000R8YC18|5.0|I completely agree that child prostitution is despicable, but I felt that this movie did not glorify it and actually used it to highlight the absolute worst level of \\"scum\\" that Travis Bickle was cleaning out.  Harvey Keitel's character was so utterly loathsome, *especially* when he was lying to Iris and pretending to love her after the revolting things he had told Bickle, that I nearly told myself to never see another movie with him (all was forgiven though when Bickle blew him away).    I did not see Jodie Foster's character as an adult or depicted as one, even though I'm used to seeing her in movies as an adult.  She was a little girl who knew nothing about real life (quite clearly covering her immaturity/ignorance with astrology) and was being brutally exploited. Being a child prostitute did not \\"wisen\\" her to the world.  Incidentally, I could not fathom how John Hinckley found her attractive in this movie, although I think I can understand how Bickle's character inspired him after reading his bio on wikipedia.      My favorite scene in the movie was when Bickle walked straight up to Cybil Shepherd, who was completely out of his league, and bluntly asked her out with no games, no gimmicks, and no slickness, and then went on to have an incredible first date.  I felt that was the character's finest point- only to blow everything on the second date!  It seemed everything went downhill for Bickle from that point onward, from that big mistake that he made.  He shouldn't have tried to bring her into his world.  Wasn't he trying to get out of it?    I think that to a large degree, Bickle created his own reality and that was my take-away from this film.  It was not shoved down his throat.  He *chose* to work the late-night shift in the worst neighborhoods.  He chose to spend his free time watching adult movies instead of something more uplifting (although later, he seemed to gravitate towards watching romantic shows on TV).

0440238609|5.0|Philip Pullman has truly created an epic fantasy masterpiece.  Many may not agree but I believe that the three books that may up \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy will shine as a beacon in the literary world by joining other masterpieces like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\".  Reading these books transports you into another world that is once similar to our own and magically different.  Merely labeling these books for \\"children\\" or \\"young adults\\" can create a stigma that other learned readers may turn away from.  Yet thee books are unique in that they are accessible to children and interesting for an adult reader.  Children can enjoy the action packed story and adults can follow along and spot the numerous references to classical literature.  Pullman borrows from Milton and Dante to Blake and Homer.  Those concerned with these books as anti religious I feel are looking to hard into the book.  It is fantasy and while religion is included in the novels it in no way detracts from the novels.  Someone secure in their religious beliefs should not be shaken by something they read.  Do yourself a favor and read these books, you won't be disappointed!
031606792X|3.0|I read a review of one of the earlier Twilight books about how Meyer's characters roll their eyes far too frequently. After that, I couldn't help but notice...and it's true, people are rolling their eyes almost every other page...that makes a couple hundred eye rolls just in one book!  It even got me experimentally rolling my eyes a few times just to see if I perhaps did it more frequently than I'd imagined...but no, I can't say I do.  I can't say anyone does.  Eye rolls, begone!     That said, Breaking Dawn is very entertaining, albeit stretching plausibility to new lows. I suppose it's a vampire-story thing...kind of like how plausibility is completely suspended for the Underworld movie.  But--humans getting pregnant by vampires...very weak. I'd like someone to explain to me the physiology of vampire arousal. If they don't have blood, what is it that fills the penis to make it erect? Or, since they're already marble-hard, maybe no blood is needed--but then what would make it stand up?  And what is the nature of vampire sperm? Sheesh.    Another minor point of objection for me is that the first three books are spent with Edward stridently wishing Bella to retain her humanity. Breaking Dawn makes you wonder why, as apparently vampire life is totally perfect and wonderful and you get everything you could ever dream of, eternally.      I thought the climax of the story was lame as well.  No big battle between the vampires...I hope they change that for the movie.      Although I kind of enjoyed having some chapters narrated by Jacob, I found his voice pretty much the same as Bella's, except with a little more slang.  But I guess that's okay since everybody good ends up with the same personality and everybody semi-bad has the same personality.     Well, that's the gist of my criticisms.  Three stars for entertainment value; I enjoyed the read and can't wait to see how they make a movie out of it.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun. It's clearly not serious, and if you look at it as just a good way to spend a couple of hours watching famous actors get zapped (with two such performances by Jack Nicholson), you'll enjoy it. It's a parody of a lot of different things, including the alien invasion genre, War of the Worlds, and those big budget Hollywood disaster films that Irwin Allen used to make.    The really nice touch is that I could just see our leaders and scientists acting like this if actual aliens showed up. Thank heavens for Grandma!

B002436WFI|5.0|I know, I know... I shouldn't be such a fangirl when it comes to Pratchett, but I just can't help it! But then it's easy to gush when just about everything that's Discworld related has been either top notch or very, very close to it!<br /><br />The movie spans the first two books of the Discworld series, Colour of Magic & The Light Fantastic. I'll admit that even though I did like the first two books, they did take a bit of getting used to the different writing style. They did change a few minor details as well as leave out one or two bits, but it doesn't diminish or take away from the overall storyline. I won't go into detail about the books due to the sheer detail and the fact that so many others have posted information about the books over the internet.<br /><br />The movie brings back David Jason who had previously been seen as Death's assistant Alfred in Sky 1's previous adaptation of Hogfather. We also get such wonderful actors as Tim Curry & Sean Astin added into the mix. The quality honestly shows in the series & you can tell that the BBC tried their darndest to ensure that we got the best adaptation we can possibly get. That's not to say that this movie will appeal to everyone, though. If you didn't like Discworld to begin with, the odds are that many won't have their opinions changed... although I do predict that more than a few will become new fans.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|There's a moment during this lovely recording at which Cohen admits that 14 years had elapsed since he'd visited the UK at age 60. Back then, he says, \\"I was just a crazy kid with a dream.\\" In part, this admission reveals some of the charm and immediacy of this important recording.     Those who've savored Leonard Cohen's recordings since the early seventies know that he was always prime when he was live. He has always had resonance with his audience as a poet and musician. Here, he reaches the apex though, with an imaginative set list, natural sonics and back-up musicians who sound more loose and adaptive than those on Cohen's other live recordings.    \\"If It be Your Will,\\" both the recitation and song, are superb. The version of \\"Hallelujah\\" here corrects for all time the sense that this song is purely sacred (the melody might convince you it was) as much as an undissoluble mix of sacred and profane which so defines the way way we live and experience life.    The version of \\"So Long, Marianne\\" is the most rousing moment in this 2 hour, 25-minute recording, which demonstrates how profound much of the pop music which poured from the sixties and seventies was.\\"There is a crack in everything,\\" the poet says. \\"That's how the light gets in.\\" I guess so!    There are very few singer-songwriters who have managed to capture in music, lyrics and performance, as many of the universal experiences and emotions as Leonard Cohen does here. Dylan did.  Joni Mitchell did. Randy Newman did and so did a handful of others.    But aside from a couple of over-orchestrated cuts, this wonderfully serene concert recording reminds us why we're here bust also why love has vanished from so many domains in life in which it once held steady, through eg.:    * Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye  * Sisters of Mercy  * I'm Your Man  * Suzanne...    ...and so much more. Cohen reinterprets these iconic songs with quiet sincerity and pathos. Those who linger on the timbre of Cohen's voice had best search elsewhere. As for me, I love it.    My principal gripe -- as it always is with Sony/BMG -- is the utterly cheap and insensitive package design, which reflects the distributor's mandate to limit returns, but ignores the consumer's needs. Handle these discs carefully as you slide them in and out, because the package design makes them prone to deep scratches. Let's hope Cohen acquires the rights to his recordings and distributes them himself.    This concert says suggets we must remember who we are, but also to be mindful of the needs of others. It suggests that pop and rock needn't be virulent or ugly or destructive, but quietly, simply beautiful.    There are two other mass-produced CBS recordings which reflect some of Cohen's live panache, but none which do so as beautifully as this one.  What a wonderful, wonderful recording!    If you love gorgeous, resonant lyrics and utter sincerity in delivery -- AND if you love live recordings in which the audience and performer merge -- go for it without reservation.
B001TOD92C|4.0|This is a dark and depressing tale of Pro Wrestling at it's worst - the drug addicted athletes past their prime struggling to hear the audience one more time.  It's filled with black humor, and a grittiness not normally associated with the televised spectacle.  The movie has many great performances:  Mickey Rourke resurrects his career, while Marisa Tomei shows that she is not past her prime.    I give the movie only 4 stars as it is a fictionalization of an even better true story.  See \\"Beyond the Mat\\" for the original story of Jake the Snake Roberts.
B0011NVC98|2.0|Not Impressed With Beowulf.<br /><br />by<br /><br />James P. Zaworski<br /><br />I purchased this DVD with avid hopes of a good film.  With billing like Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins, I expected something interesting.<br />The story line is relatively faithful to the epic of Beowulf, but the visuals and special effects just didn't do it for me.  I'm sorry to say 'ho hum' to this, but it is just another of Hollywood's attempts to make a buck.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this DVD.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I watched this movie as someone who was a big fan of the original graphic novel and so from that perspective I thought it was an above average movie, not a classic.  I think the scope of the story as concieved by the book's author was just too big to do it justice in a movie format.  It was better suited for something like an HBO miniseries.  Its hard to get into all the details/backdrop of the characters when your constrained to a 3 hour movie timeframe so consequently character development suffers and things seem rushed.  Given all that I still thought the movie was really good because it did such an amazing job in bringing to life the panels of a comic book that I loved.  Its a very entertaining film with some great scenes.      Its worth noting that the graphic novel in which this movie practically mirrors in terms of story, characters and visuals was created back in 1986.  So when people say that Watchmen is influenced by this movie or its a rehash of that movie then the counter point is whatever came out after 1986 was influenced BY The Watchmen not the other way around.  Who knows, if this movie came out in 1986 it might have been considered ground breaking but over the course of 20+ years its probably not as fresh or relevant for some people as it gets lost amongst the shuffle of all the other superhero movies out there.
8590379825|5.0|What a pleasant surprise it was for me to discover this jewel of a book. Every few years I try to pick up another programming language in order to remain sharp in a competitive world. I've been using Perl extensively for many years now and was in search of a viable alternative. Lua is an unconventional language based on tables and it uses them in unexpected ways that make it a very powerful scripting language. Some of the new ideas are difficult to grasp at first, but the book provides a very clear and readable way of easing over these small obstacles. Boy I am sold on the concept and can't wait to start using Lua as an advanced productivity tool in my daily work.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya could be called the artist of the age. I am a great fan of hers and have most of her music.
B001KMB6YG|5.0|Based purely on the entertainment factor I give it 5 stars. I havent read the book from which its based so I wont compare. I find the movie young, hip, gritty, stylish, futuristic, with great action scenes and a very cool soundtrack. I agree the last few minutes is weird, but I don't think that alone should be reason to say the whole movie sucks. Mark's (\\"vin diesel\\") character is bad ass & I love his voice. I enjoyed the movie.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I had passed by this dvd days at a time at the store ignoring the sub par title and generic dvd cover art.  Only when I read the other reviews on here did I check out this movie. I can honestly say it was worth more than I paid for!     The special effects are great for a direct to dvd movie.  From the blood and gore to the space fighting to the beast the main character has to hunt down, all done wonderfully.      No matter how fantastic the special effects in a movie I can only enjoy a film if I get a good story as well.  The premise of the movie is good if not original, the whole vikings+something random, seem to be the new type of genre.  The plot moves pretty fluidly but is a little predictable. The acting is very well done and I for one can't say one bad thing about it.      If I have one gripe about Outlander its something that recent Sci Fi movies seem to be doing recently. And that is trying to sympathize or humanize the alien villain.  Especially in this movie where the alien is some sort of ultimate killing machine I can't understand why they would do that.  Ultimately, intentional or not, it makes me hate the main character a little despite of he goes through.  They really need to cut that stuff out! Just let the monsters be monster please!      But not even that detracted me from this understated gem.  Please people make this a cult classic or something and spread the word!    THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|I know many things have been said about this album, both negative and positive. There are so many things I could say about the music itself but I rather share my experience about its feel. First keep in mind that Pet Sounds is very dense and really is like a jazz record in the sense that it requires more then one listen to appreciate all that is happening.     It is my personal opinion this is one of the best records of all time because it captures a moment in everyone's life that we all experience in a very real way; becoming an adult. Brian wrote this album when he was 23 years old and it really captures the insecurities one feels when growing up. I am 20 right now and feel the way he did at the time so I can relate to everything he says in the record. When I hear the album at the right mood no other album can touch it; it is like an orgasm of the mind, if that makes any sense. At the right mood some songs cut you in the chest like a knife.     I recommend everyone give this a chance. But hear it more then once. I still remember the first time I heard the album; every song sounded the same, the singing was weird, and it was not very interesting. But one day after a long day I put it on and it was like someone had torn my heart from my chest showed it to me and said everything was okay. Highly recommended.     By the way if you still don't like the record hear some Smile tracks they are the complete opposite of this but still unbelievable, think Sgt. Pepper's on acid -yeah its that different. I still can't believe the same band did both one after the other.
B000660UN0|5.0|When I first picked this one up, I had high hopes for what I'd find within the cardboard confines of the packaging. What I found were a CD and a DVD that were both over the top in quality. Simply stated, this is Clapton's best work in interpreting the songs of Robert Johnson.<br /><br />The DVD opens up with Clapton rolling up in his Porshe to a very nice recording studio parked somewhere out in the English countryside. Once inside he finds some of his mates waiting for him:<br />- Nathan East, bass player (you might have seen him on Eric Clapton: Unplugged or with Phil Collins on LIVE and Loose in Paris)<br />- Billy Preston on Hammond B3 (the only other guy to play with the Beatles - that's him up on the roof of Apple Records with the Fab 4 doing Get Back among others, the Concert for George - tribute to George Harrison)<br />- Doyle Bramhall III on second/rhythm guitar (did the first half hour of an Austin City Limits where Robert Cray did the 2nd half, wrote TIGHTROPE and THE HOUSE IS ROCKIN' for Stevie Ray Vaughan, guitar on In the Flesh LIVE with Roger Waters)<br />- Steve Gadd on drums (veteran player with Clapton on tour, Simon and Garfunkel's Concert in Central Park, Elvis Costello, Paul Simon, and Chuck Mangione)<br />- Chris Stainton on piano (Joe Cocker on Mad Dogs & Englishmen and with the Who on Tommy - organ & acoustic guitar)<br /><br />You get the idea: basically a band constructed of lightweights and ne'er do wells...<br /><br />The DVD is nicely formatted with a segment of 'electric Blues' studio playing then some interview material with Clapton, a 2nd 'electric' studio segment played in Dallas, more interview material, a 3rd musical segment that's just Clapton and Bramhall on acoustics and the prettiest National Steel resonator guitar I've ever seen in my life playing in the building in Dallas where Johnson was recorded, a little more interview stuff and then Clapton in a hotel room by himself.<br /><br />The few songs that you get to see and hear Clapton and Bramhall play acoustically without any production frills are worth the entire cost of this set. There is a warmth, a respect, and an honesty there that just blaze off of their fingertips and ring in Clapton's voice.<br /><br />As for the CD, it is comprised of studio versions of 10 of the songs you see on the DVD and one not found there - Stop Breakin' Down Blues.<br /><br />In conclusion, Robert Johnson is the guy who basically created Eric Clapton. Without Clapton's early exposure to his music courtesy of John Mayall and then his lifelong study of the quintessential Blues man of All Time, we would not have the Eric Clapton we see and hear today. This item is as nice a tribute by one musician to the music of another musician that I know about.<br /><br />Mr. Clapton done Mr. Johnson proud on this little devil.ion frills are worth the entire cost of this set.

B001T30232|5.0|On the recommendation of a friend, I ordered \\"The Art Of Racing In The Rain\\" and finished it in one day.    It is definitely one of the best books I've read. This book really touched me emotionally and I will never think of a dog the same way again.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I'm a very tough critic. Most of the movies I've seen lately are just plain stupid. Watchmen was without doubt the coolest most unique movie I've seen in years. The formula for this movie is a first. It's unlike any other comic book style movie you've seen, but in a good way. There are so many nuances and wow factors that it would take a book to describe them here.    Beware, in the directors cut, there is some frontal male nudity, albeit  from a blue being. There are a few extremely violent scenes as well. It's long too. Just over 3 hours. The only thing that I think didn't fit in some scenes was the music. Too Vietnam-ish.     Overall, this movie gets 5 stars from me. It was just that cool.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Regarding Season Five, it rates as one of the best.  From the beginning with 'Search and Rescue', 'Broken Ties', 'The Daedalus Variations','The Shrine'...which was exceptional, 'Vegas'...an incredibly well done episode that I think is among the best ever, this season only proved the potential of many more stories to come.  Every single actor got a chance to shine during this season with performances that should garner at the least exceptional recognition...ex: David Hewlett in 'The Shrine', Rachel Luttrell in 'Prodigal', Jason Momoa in 'Broken Ties', and Joe Flanigan in 'Vegas'.      And then they cancel it.  I will never understand why they did so.  The show won the People's Choice Award, for crying out loud!  The ratings were still up there and getting better, the stories were just really beginning to delve into the characters...finally...and then to cancel it because of money or because they were hot to start yet another spinoff?  Those are the worst reasons to cancel a successful series.  So the economy is bad but it's getting better.  If they can afford to invest in another series, even with paying lower salaries for unknown actors in the balance, then they could have afforded to keep Stargate Atlantis going another year at least as the economy gets better.  There was no reason this series could not have gone ten years like SG-1. There was just so much potential for so many more stories.  This was one of the few action packed series left running on TV.  It was a huge mistake to cancel it.    And I agree with the post about why watch the new series Stargate Universe?  If the possibility exists that the bean counters will just choose to cancel it at the height of its success, why waste the time?  Bad precedent, bean counters...bad.    Get Season Five of Stargate Atlantis.  The audio commentaries are fabulous and shed insight and understanding in how a series is produced, the deleted scenes...they could have added more, it is well worth the investment and the timeto watch.
B001VOD59M|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SHM-CD 2009 REMASTER ***<br /><br />Released in July 1980 on Warner Brothers K 56823 in the UK and HS 3453 in the USA, George Benson's \\"Give Me The Night\\" was a huge record at the time (it peaked at No. 3 in both countries).<br /><br />And like Michael Jackson's \\"Off The Wall\\" from 1978 before it - its fusion of soul, funk and jazz was popular everywhere - crossing over every rock barrier like never before (it was Grammy nominated and won too).<br /><br />Yet except for a few remastered tracks on the excellent 2CD \\"Anthology\\" set from 2000 on Rhino, the entire album has been languishing around for over two decades now on one of those awful Eighties CDs with dullard murky sound. Until now...<br /><br />Released 24 June 2009 in Japan-only on Warner Bros WPCR-13453 - this 24-bit remastered version is an audiophile CD on their SUPER HIGH MATERIALS format (playable on all players - 42:51 minutes).<br /><br />And coming from an era that is probably the most derided in history by music lovers - especially when it comes to bombastic sound and ham-fisted production excesses - this SHM version is a BEAUTIFULLY REALIZED CD REMASTER - it really is.<br /><br />It doesn't say who 24-bit remastered this album, but whoever did it, has produced the most awesome result because the sound quality is just GLORIOUS - I mean BEAUTIFUL. Of course the album always had the immaculate production values of QUINCY JONES and the stunning array of top session men to thank for its polish anyway - but this newly upgraded version is just wonderful. It's neither falsely loud nor brash - there's no audible hiss, but it's also not clinically clean - there's air around the instruments - it's just warm and THERE.<br /><br />You hear all the instrumentation - especially the bass and rhythm sections.  The wildly underrated funky-as-James-Brown's-DNA instrumental \\"Off Broadway\\" is just stunning now - as is David Wolinski's brilliantly soulful and sleek \\"Midnight Love Affair\\" - WOWSER!<br />(There's an argument raging around the net at the moment about sly remastering techniques, pumping up the loudness of reissues for the so-called `iPod' generation - which essentially produces downloads that sound better but lack any real dynamic range. I mention this because to my ears there's none of that on here.)<br /><br />The jewel case is standard and there's the black and gold obi strip inside; the SHM CD itself feels slightly heavier to ordinary CDs - more substantial - it seems to hold better as it plays in the tray somehow - steady. The 8-page booklet is disappointingly the same as US/Euro issues (has session details though) and the extra foldout page of info about the album that you get in these Japanese issues is - well in Japanese - so its kinda useless.<br /><br />Gripes - no Euro/USA issue so it costs as an import - and it wouldn't have taken much to include the edited single mixes of \\"Give Me The Night\\" and \\"Love X Love\\" as bonus tracks, but somehow this CD isn't about ramming the disc chocker full of extras - it's about the best sound - and on that front they've achieved their goal with absolute knobs on.<br /><br />With 6 of it's 10 killer songs written by Britain's ROD TEMPERTON and the immaculate production values of veteran sound man QUINCY JONES, \\"Give Me The Night\\" practically set up the template for the album that would literally take over the world three years later - Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" (Quincy produced and Temperton wrote 3 of its 9 songs including the title track).<br /><br />Ok - this version is expensive and it's probably even awkward to obtain, but I've loved rehearing \\"Give Me The Night\\" in this stunning sound quality - beautiful stuff - and recommended big time.<br /><br />PS: It's available mail-order from Amazon sites or two superb Japanese CD sites I use - CD JAPAN at \\"cdjapan.co.jp\\" and MUNDO at \\"mediawars.ne.jp\\".<br /><br />\\"Give Me The Night\\" is also a part of 2009's Japanese-Only \\"Warner Bros Jazz & Fusion SHM-CD Collection\\" series - in alphabetical order the other 19 titles are:<br /><br />1.

B00004RITP|4.0|As soon as I heard the Scherzo of the Ressurrection symphony I thought: \\"this is amazing music\\" and hearing the complete symphony on different recordings you could see that Mahler is a kind of Soundtrack-composer of his time.<br />He composes music for the ones who want the movement to last many minutes, melodies that goes on and on and doesn't seems to end.<br />The 10th symphony has this kind of approach. Different from the 5th and the 6th with it's disturbing and agitated movements, it has long peace mood movements making you fill absorbed by the music sending you to a virtual traveling on a beautiful place, walking on it slowly, appreciating everything around you.<br />As always on the others you'll hear the common melodic scherzos on the second and third movements and sometimes there's a rhapsodic call of other previous symphonies melodies on the movements (see 3rd an 5th movements).<br />The recording is crystal-clear and it's common to hear the breath of the players.<br />It's a great symphony and Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic handle the score in a concise way. Although it has this serene mood the conductor has to be very careful on leading the beat and the dynamics, otherwise the listener will became bored and not increasingly involved and exited with the music.<br />This recording brings a nice view of Mahler's last sketched symphony and if you're a serious Mahlerian and a melodic-long-way-melomanous you'll surely like this nice piece-recording.<br />Finally there's good article on Wikipedia about the context of the symphony composition and it's various finish-composers/recordings on a direct table at the end.<br />A must have if you fill the prerogatives above. Nice listening
0156027321|3.0|I finished this today and am left with mixed feelings.  Overall, I enjoyed my time spent reading the story.  I struggle with the fact that I did not like the character Pi.  At all.  There is the line \\"I have a story that will make you believe in God.\\"  From some reviews and from folks I have spoken with, I was expecting a story emphasizing faith and belief in \\"something\\" - personally, these ideas did not come through as I was reading the book.  Perhaps it is a case of too high or different expectations.  The saving grace for me, was Richard Parker.[[ASIN:0156027321 Life of Pi]]
B00288KNJU|5.0|Never thought I would say this but...    Kinda disappointed in this Blu-Ray.  Well, in the 3D version on the Blu-Ray. Which is dreadful.  Saw it in the theater in 3D and it was incredible. The level of depth and realism imparted by the 3D was breathtaking. Between Coraline and Up, a case can finally be made for 3D being more than a gimmick (cough...Aliens and Monsters...cough) that ads nothing to the movie experience expect obvious 'thrills' (ooh! sharp pointy things coming at me! How novel!) But the 3D version on the blu-ray is unwatchable and I wish it hadn't been added as it is a waste of disc space (and even worse, an insult to the memory of a great movie experience).    While I know it's  not fair to expect the same level of depth and beauty on a TV version, I think it's more than fair to wish for more than what is present on the disc, which recalls the crappy 3D comics in the old Dynamite magazines of the 70s. The green/magenta lenses made the movie unwatchable and even more insulting, nothing ended up looking 3D.    Luckily the 2D version is incredible. But I wish that they hadn't even bothered with the attempt as it really mars the film experience (mars? try obliterates).    Still recommend this film. Just don't recommend watching the 3D version, especially if you haven't seen the movie before.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am a first generation Star Wars fan.  I was 9 years old when A New Hope came out, and like everyone else I was blown away.  It was a thrill ride that kept on going through six years and three wonderful films.<br /><br />So like most I was excited to hear that, finally, Lucas was going back and bringing us more Star Wars.  It was too good to be true!  Here I am at 30 years old and Episode 1 is coming out!<br /><br />I think that with most fans here in lies the problem...<br /><br />Now we are older.  None of the original fans are kids anymore.  And I firmly believe this is why all the negative crap about Episode 1.<br /><br />No, it's not the same.  It CAN'T be.  We're not children...we have had twenty years of sophisticated sci-fi movies under our belts.  What dazzeled us as kids simply won't work anymore.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Ask any kid who saw Episode 1 when they were 8 to maybe 13 years old.  The majority LOVED it.  Why?  The same reasons we loved the original back in 1977.  The didn't have the baggage of 'Lucas changed our favorite film series'.  All we had as kids were things like the Star Trek and Lost In Space TV series and films like 2001 and Planet Of The Apes.  Star Wars WAS new and different...and very special.  As adults, it just isn't anymore, considering how much SPFX have progressed (and, of course we do have the original trilogy to thank for most of those leaps and bounds).<br /><br />Next time you see Episode 1...try to watch it with a kid.  Maybe you might just see it reflected back at you the way our parents saw it in our eyes back in 1977.
B0029NY9Y4|2.0|I was told this movie stayed true to the graphic novel. Maybe it did but I wouldn't know. I didn't read the novel.  I was just interested in visual effects and the fact that it was a super hero movie. So I figured what the heck. My first clue should have been the fact that it was Rated R. Maybe I am a bit over sensitive but I was turned off by two things:<br /><br />1. Lack of a background about the super heroes. I would have liked to know more. It seemed compressed to me.<br /><br />2. Male frontal nudity in several scenes. I'd like someone to explain to me how that helped the plot/storyline.<br /><br />I saw this movie with a few friends who are less critical than I am and one of them asked afterwards if this movie warranted a \\"What The ----?\\". Which spoke volumes to me. All in all I guess the action and fight scenes were what made this arguably tolerable but everything else was a major disappointment. I did not enjoy this movie at all!!!

1400063515|1.0|I first heard Mr. Taleb on a radio interview on NPR, and was fascinated by the discussion.  I made it half-way through his book - it has the hallmark effect on me of all good books, in that I found myself wondering often of the ideas he writes about and their effects on me in my daily life.      ... Except I could only make it half-way through because of his insufferable snobbery.  329 pages is too small a soapbox for such a bloated ego.  From time to time I encounter such books that make reading a chore, and I begin to question my own abilities to concentrate and absorb the written word.  Periods like these usually end when I find books I can read effortlessly - I've just picked up \\"Outliers\\" by Malcolm Gladwell and read 100 pages in a morning.  It took me at least 3 weeks to get that far in Black Swan.     Gladwell understands that he is not nearly as interesting as his subject, and dutifully lets his topic speak for itself without snide, arrogant commentary on \\"experts\\" and businessmen.     Half way through Black Swan and I'm breaking up with it.  Life is too short.  And no, Taleb, it's not me; it's you.
0307387178|5.0|It has been awhile since I read the book (and saw the movie, which I thought was decent, but the book, naturally, was better). I picked the book up again the other day and reread some of the more poignant passages. Into the Wild is still a book that brings out conflicting thoughts and emotions in this reader. I don't know that the \\"true\\" nature of most anyone's character can be known, especially as complex a person as Chris McCandless, though Krakauer does a commendable job of reconstructing just what drove this young man to undertake his misguided adventure by piecing together his past history, etc.     Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think Krakauer seeing some of himself in McCandless detracted from this book; quite the opposite, it gave him potential insights into McCandless that other authors lacking Krakauer's wilderness experiences and personal demons would not have had. McCandless was more fully realized as a result. Might another author have a different take? Sure, but this is testament to McCandless' complexity of character.     Whether you see McCandless as supreme fool, hopelessly misguided romantic, courageous nonconformist, or parts in between, in the end it must be keep in mind that McCandless was a very young and conflicted individual. Had he not died in the wild and been given to such extremes of self-searching (if you want to see this theme in the book), who knows what McCandless would have made of himself. Would he have reconciled with his family? Embraced more tradtional values? Rejected those he deemed more superficial, embraced others? Continued his quests? Written a book about his journeys? The haunting part of the book is truly the unrealized potential of his life, and that lonely broken down bus he died in.    Definitely think Krakauer gives the reader enough wiggle room to come to his/her own conclusions.

0385342020|5.0|I've enjoyed all of Sophie Kinsella's books but the author really outdid herself with Twenties Girl. It succeeds on every count -it is great chick-lit but SO much more. The plot and characters were terrific and the story wraps up several loose ends in a very satisfying manner. The book was funny, suspenseful, interesting, and really touching - I was surprised to find myself choking up more than once.  Fantastic book!!!!!  Definitely movie material.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|An absorbing, ingenious film that has many multiple watching hours within it. A not too distant future that is sci fi - yet touching on our real paranoid global warming issues and planetary observations. Sunshine is masterfully directed and scripted, deserving a place in the sci fi pantheon with 2001, planet of the apes, alien and Outland.  i have watched it 20+ times and still 'warm' to it everytime!

B001FB4W0W|4.0|Prepare to be shocked and surprised by this series in every way. Alan Ball fans, forget his prior writing or you will be dismayed. True Blood is a perverse,tongue-in-cheek portrayal of, not only southern culture, but of vampire movies and literature.  Picture David Lynch's unsophisticated and melodramatic characters from \\"Wild at Heart\\" to get the flavor of the southern culture in this picture.<br /><br />Blood, sex and perverse aggression characterizes this series. In the first episode we learnt that vampires have only recently been openly recognized due to the manufacture of a synthetic blood drink,True Blood, that releases vampires from the necessity to prey upon humans to survive. The main character, strangely named \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" (\\"Sookie\\" with a southern accent sounds almost like \\"suckie\\")works at a bar set in a dark southern forest. Sookie is able to read people's minds, which causes her to interact strangely as she strives to interact while listening to what people are thinking all around her. One of her customers thinks that the rumors that Sookie is \\"retarded\\" must be true because of her vague and distracted manner.<br /><br />Then a vampire, Bill, enters the bar. Most of the clientele of the bar is hostile towards him but Sookie is strangely excited and welcoming though she must admit to him they do not carry True Blood. After the bar closes, the vampire is mugged by one of the bar's redneck clientele, Rattray, played by James Parks who previosly portrayed a vampire in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In this series he plays a human vampire who is addicted to the high from drinking vampire blood.<br /><br />When Sookie leaves the bar she senses something is wrong and grabs a large chain coiled up in the back of a pick-up truck. She comes upon Rattray draining her new vampire friend Bill of his blood. Bill has been made helpless by being draped with silver chains by Rattray's female friend. Sookie beats up Rattray with the chain,nearly strangling him with it (the vampire he portrayed in Buffy was strangled) and releases vampire Bill. Sookie is immediately infatuated with Bill and fascinated that he cannot read her mind.<br /><br />The vampires in True Blood are violent, selfishly perverse and scornful of humans. Despite the fact that they are lobbying for equal rights with humans, their behavior is distinctly inhuman--thought the humans are no better. Sookie's brother is a young man who is constantly in trouble due to his poor judgement and excessive libido. There are frequent shots of him having sex and he rides his partners like he is astride a mechanical bronco.  A series of murders plagues the town and Sookie's brother and Bill the vampire are both prime suspects.<br /><br />This series centers around the romance between Sookie and Bill the vampire, the resulting unwanted attention she receives from both her human community and the vampire community as a result, the mystery of the serial murders, and the personal affairs of Sookie's brother and best friend.<br /><br />Both Anna Paquin, as Sookie, and Stephen Moyer, as Bill are a bit stilted in their roles. Paquin's interpretation of Sookie is as a shallow and brittle ingenue without much intelligence but fairly gutsy--she prances around in pigtails but then blithely nearly beats someone to death with a chain. Vampire Bill is only intermittently attractive and often seems ponderous and wooden-shades of Barnabas Collin's? It is hard to tell if these portrayals are purposeful or just representative of the best these actors have to offer. The supporting cast is much more vital and interesting, particularly Rutina Wesley, as best friend Tara, Nelson Ellis as a cross-dressing entrepreneur, and Michael Raymond-James as the token Cajun. William Sanderson is strangely lack-luster in his role as the sheriff--for such a seasoned and fluid actor this must have been a choice. The question is why? To further the strange atmosphere of this story?<br /><br />Despite the perplexingand cock-eyed strangeness of the characterizations and story, this eccentric and peculiar series grew on me. I was interested to find out the ending and will definitely watch season two. I needed to get over the seemingly unsophisticated script that seemed way out of character for Alan Ball in order to enjoy the torrid and sordid world of True Blood.

0312383436|5.0|The Wedding Girl is a Sophie Kinsella novel, with Kinsella writing as, Madeline Wickham.  The story starts off with Milly on her wedding day marrying in Oxford.  Flash forward to ten years later and all things have changed!    I won't reveal more than that, other than this kept me on the edge of my seat.  I could not figure out how Milly would resolve her dilemmas and how the other characters would resolve their issues.    I loved all the characters, especially Milly's relationship with her sister, Isobel.  The only thing that I would like to know more about was, Esme, Milly's godmother.  But that would probably be another story. Suffice it to say the Esme has issues!  This is a really great and fun read which takes a look at many different relationships.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Good writing and excellent casting create a refreshing series full of entertainment. The show potrays the transformation of a terminal cancer diagnosis on nice-guy high school chemistry teacher Walt. Walt is a family man who puts all his energy into supporting his pregnant wife and teenage son. As the series progresses we learn that this mild-mannered diffident man has hidden brilliance and that he contributed to Nobel award winning research when he was a post-graduate student.<br /><br />Walt's approach to his life transforms with the sudden diagnosis of terminal cancer. His priority becomes making enough money to keep his family comfortable when he is gone. He gets the idea to make methamphetamine when he sees the fat stacks of cash on a televised raid on a local lab. Serendipitously Walt learns that a former student, Jesse-- now known in the drug underworld as \\"Captain Cook\\", is involved in the manufacture and sale of meth. Walt coerces Jesse, a hapless and rather pathetic wanna-be gansta, into becoming his partner in crime. Drug manufacturing brings out Walt's genius at chemistry and he creates an exceptionally fine high-demand product. But the violent and predatory nature of the local drug distributors require a matching violent and dominant aspect of Walt's personality to emerge. The corrupt and unsavory nature of the drug underworld forces Walt to kill or be killed.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston makes the show with his talent for comedy, both subtle and slapstick, and his sensitive  portrayal of tragedy. Impending death creates a complex set of demands and transformations for Walt that Cranston manages with apparent ease. The excellent supporting cast fulfill the promise of a well-written script and good direction. The twelve episodes of this series leaves you wanting more. Highly recommended!
B0010X73ZG|3.0|When I first heard of THE MIST, I was thinking it was a remake of the 1980 flick, The Fog, with Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh. Oops. No such luck. Instead I found myself in a Stephen King movie, which was quite fine by me. I've enjoyed several of Stephen Kings other books and films including The Stand, Stand By Me, The Tommyknockers, and even the Langoliers, but I had never read this one. It begins with an inside joke where an artist is painting a movie poster for a Stephen King novel and has other famous movie posters displayed as if he had painted them. We meet the family, the neighbor, and soon, half the town. And then THE MIST rolls in.<br /><br />Most of THE MIST takes place in a supermarket and most of the movie is typical Stephen King. We get to know a group of ordinary people who start to show their true colors as the pressure mounts. And the pressure mounts, you betcha! We have all sorts of creatures coming out of the mist to eat our frugal shoppers. But we also have our very own annoying humans inside the store, including an \\"unstable\\" Christian woman who constantly preaches her own version of the Bible and the end-of-days. As the movie progresses, we lose more shoppers until... I can't give away the ending, but I do have to talk about the ending. It's a very bad ending. And, apparently, it wasn't Stephen King's original ending. It's an ending that belongs in a different kind of movie, not a jump-out-of-the-mist-and-go-boo! movie. I mean, THE MIST is a modern B-Movie, and we all have certain expectations that go along with those. For instance, when the boy and girl make out, we know they're the next to die. Check. When anyone smiles or think they've made it, they're about to die in a particularly gruesome way. Check. And when our heroes risk everything to put an end to what's been dogging them, we expect ... well, we know what we expect and that box was definitely left unchecked.<br /><br />If it weren't for the ending, I'd have gladly given THE MIST higher marks for knowing that it was a Saturday matinee monster movie. Unfortunately, at the very last minute, it tried to be something more important, which is exactly what I did not want.<br /><br />Stephen King himself is quoted as saying, \\"The ending is such a jolt--wham! It's frightening.

B001C08RHA|4.0|In the normal course of my work in this space I don't generally review current commercial films, except when they provide some kind of political or social comment that is in line with those aims. Or when I am feeling a little whimsical or wicked after watching a \\"light\\" film that is just pure entertainment. That turns out to be the case here.     Let's face it, how can one seriously knock a film that is based on a comic book character?  Reading about or viewing such characters was virtually a rite of passage for any child, right? Here whiz kid (or elder kid) and mega-rich defense contractor Tony Stark, played very nicely by Robert Downey, Jr., just happens to have had a \\"conversion\\" experience in of all places, modern day Afghanistan (if one can accept that as a correct term in that benighted country) as a result of a very close call with the results of his own weaponry at the hands of a Taliban-like organization.      As a result, Brother Stark will not, however,  `go gentle into that good night' and begin to preach some form of pacifism but will turn the nature of modern nasty and brutish  combat on its head and return, via high technology, to the good old medieval days of individual knightly combat. One on one, up close and personal.  Needless to say, that knight will be none other than the whiz kid Stark. Throw in a little off-hand old-fashioned chaste romance with his fair damsel, oops, Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and you have the makings of a very good...comic book story. Kudos for that part.    No kudos, however, for the little premise that was always behind these super-hero adventure stories. Wait on an individual `savior\\" to come by and save us from ourselves. If we wait for the \\"white knight\\" to come and save us from this wicked old world we are in serious trouble. Although this film was fun to watch and a nice spoof I'll stick with the mass plebeian struggle to turn those swords into ploughshares. And by the way, individual knight or massed troops isn't it about time to get out, way out, of Afghanistan now. The comic books, and their very appealing characters, are of no use for use on that proposition though.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Before I watched MAD MEN,  I thought it was a pretty crazy idea to set the series back in the 1960s.  I grew up in that era and didn't particularly want to experience a tv show set in it.  Then I saw it and kept seeing it and changed my mind. MAD MEN is about the advertising industry beginning in USA 1960 but it is so much more than that.  It brings back the way we lived then, forcing us to look back and then compare it with the way we live now.  In so many ways that is a shocking experience on a continual basis.  When I first saw pregnant women smoking and drinking on the show, I was aghast, considerably more aghast than when I saw it in real life back in that time era.  This is because NO ONE is seen (in public at least) smoking and drinking while pregnant, especially if one is upwardly mobile.  Another shock was to see racism and sexism flaunted on a daily basis in both the work place and socially as something that was totally ok and legal. MAD MEN works on so many levels and is so well layered in meaning largely because it is so well written.  That writer is former SOPRANOS' writer, Matthew Weiner.  He depicts the Sterling Cooper advertising agency on the surface of the show but the lies and deceit, which are the daily business of the agency, are also the stuff of the characters' personal lives as well. Weiner hand picked the lead for his show, Jon Hamm, playing Don Draper, the creative director and junior partner of Sterling Cooper.  Draper leads a wholly manufactured life as he took over another man's identity during the war.  He is not the real Don Draper, the real one having died by his side in the war.  The best moment of the show is when his boss (Bertram Cooper played by Robert Morse) is told of this deception by an underling and his response is that it doesn't matter.  He sees that the artifice and facade of Draper works for his agency and he could care less about Draper's \\"truth\\" just like he could care less about the truth of the products he advertises. Jon Hamm is outstanding as Draper.  He is absolutely the lead of the show and his continual crisis of identity and living a life of complete falsehood continues to unravel in him in Season Two.  A business trip out to California is the springboard and his time spent there is fascinating.<br /><br />The other characters continue to develop too.  Betty Draper, Don's wife, is continually fascinating as the beautiful, perfect trophy wife with a completely placid surface and an underneath of tsunami level suppressed rage.  I remember this era best by all the women whom Betty Draper represents. Don and Betty are my favorite characters but the other characters intrigue me as well.  Pete Campbell and Peggy Olsen come together yet again this season, rediscovering one another after their disastrous coming together in season one.  Pete remains the biggest thorn in Don's side while Peggy represents his best help in all crises.  Joan Holloway as the buxom, red headed chief secretary seems to be putting a perfect life together for herself with a doctor fiance yet she conceals his sexual brutality towards her from everyone.  On the surface she uses her sexuality to advance herself but at every other level it undermines her. I could go on and on about the other characters and plotlines on the show but this is fascinating stuff that you need to discover fresh for yourselves. I would watch the series in order, first season one and then season two.

0312330537|5.0|And so it is ending. After waking up seven as usual, I have been out in the sunrise in my little paradise island and writing on my book. When I no longer can bear to write more, i treat myself by reading the end of what someone else has written. Ie the furious and completely brilliant book that hit me so right that I have been enjoying it piece by piece, slowly, contemplatingg, month after month.<br /><br />But now I can not hold on much longer, being lead to the books very own special little peroratio. I can not stop reading, so I sit out in the now increasingly hot sun in the middle of the exotic garden with the beach and the sea just two meters in front of me. Reading another chapter. Handles me from food, but the sweat pooring in the increasingly hot sun is worse ;-) Taking a dip in the sea again, continue to read, and then a dip and a swim again...<br /><br />And then book is ended. Completely ended!?!? It's like a whole round the world trip ends. Or close intimate relationship, in the most powerful of relationships? And so it suddenly ends?<br /><br />The Book I am talking about is the nearly thousand-page master piece that my chosen sister and her group of girlfriends said was all about me. And they have no idea how right they were. A book that while I'm reading page after page is giving me so many reminders and resemblances, often funny, sometimes not too flattering. And even if it is neither the right moment nor the place to embroider what, it's so similar that I come to the realization I do not really need to write my own book, cause that has Roberts, Mr. Shantaram, \\"The man of peace\\", already done.<br /><br />After another dip in the beautiful sea, I sit myself on a little colder place under a coconut tree and look out over the glittering sea of the little paradise island I'm to write the book I am doing myself. What is the little adorable miracle pience really about? I mean really, what is it really (!) about?<br /><br />Lifting us a level from all heroic, adventure, love stories and other things, it could on a superficial plane be summed up with a book that is very much about \\"bromance\\", seasoned with a certain amount of love. And  ta a larger point of actually choosing war more often than love.<br /><br />But it is still in a more superficial plane. For the fact is that what this actually is, is a book on strategy. An absolutely brilliant book on strategy offline - a book on strategy I by chance happen to read just while I come to my island to write the last chapters of my own book about strategy (even if a bit more practical in terms of the world's first real book on Online Strategy :-D).<br /><br />More specifically, Shantaram is a book about how you on the short term can make the wrong things for the wrong reson, which for the strategist in the longer term may well prove to be the wrong thing for the right reasons.<br /><br />Simply how the strategists who, like Shantarams self-chosen \\"father\\" Khaderbhai and his gang of Abdullah, Khaled Ansari, Salman, Karla, and other exciting personalities - who chooses war, and for which the goal is everything, and, worse still, the goal always sanctifies everything - it is forever evident how you sometimes have to pretend to be ugly for at a later date to be really beautiful.<br /><br />While all lifeloving humanists, such as Shantarams other, and actually un-chosen, \\"father\\" Quasim Ali Hussien and his fellow companions such as Prabaker, Johnny Cigar, Anand Rao, Joseph, Rukhmabai and other magnificent people - who choose love, and for whose soul it is as obvious that the goal is nothing, while the road is everything - always are beautiful, whether their actions ultimately leads to something beautiful or not.<br /><br />It is simply a fantastic book. A book not to read quickly as a worldly pleasures for the mind, but to enjoy contemplating as a real treat for the soul. A book so good that I begrudge it to everyone and everything.<br /><br />A book so good that I could barely have written it better myself. But I will anyway :-) Not right now, as I sit under my coconut tree with the beach and the sea just a few feet away, while I let absolutely great food and wonderful motion nurturing the body, while beautiful thoughts and wonderful sights gives inspiration to soul. Not now as the head in its term so far is assigned to thoughts with a focus on just strategies.<br /><br />But as soon as my head catches up with both the body as well as the soul, it will come through. The book on The Omnipotent truth - the book that my father and myself, in a rare moment of self-distance and self-mockery, baptized \\"Everything You Want to Know about Anything\\" ;-)<br /><br />But that will be another story. In another time. In another place. Until then, I would like mostly to wish all a lot of love. And the joy to in  all moments, in the large and small, always choose love over war :-)<br /><br />Shantaram<br />Ilha de Boipeba, Bahia, Brazil, July 2009t under my coconut tree with the beach and the sea just a few feet away, while I let absolutely great food and wonderful motion nurturing the body, while beautiful thoughts and wonderful sights gives inspiration to soul.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Michael C. Hall was the underappreciated actor in SIX FEET UNDER as the gay, somewhat plodding funeral director brother.  Most viewers identified the series by Nate, the reluctant funeral director brother who was straight and sexually charismatic.  Right now it is almost hard for me to remember Peter Krause, who played Nate, but Michael C. Hall has another top series, DEXTER.  This time around the viewer cannot fail to notice him as top banana because DEXTER is wholly dominated by Dexter/Hall.  I have read all of the DEXTER books and then later listened to them in audio and, finally, have watched all three seasons of the show.  I obviously love all incarnations of DEXTER.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Dexter is a serial killer but with a difference.  Dexter is a forensic investigator in the Miami police department.  His sister is a cop with the homicide division.  She is Dexter's only surviving family member.  Dexter serial kills the bad guys in Miami.  He doesn't serial kill anyone who is a good guy. He was taught this unique serial killer path by his now dead father, Harry, who was a cop.  Harry was taken with the idea of putting away bad guys who had escaped the legal system and when he discovered his son was a psychopath (in the torturing animals phase of his childhood), Harry found his perfect tool of vigilante justice. There is one big difference between DEXTER the novels and DEXTER the tv series. Although the first tv season of DEXTER stayed somewhat close to the novel version, by seasons two and three, the series took major departures from the novels.  I think the reason this was done is that the novels are considerably darker and more violent than the tv series.  Dexter is also more obviously a psychopath in the novels.  He seems to waffle on being a psychopath in the tv series, that he may indeed have some doubt about the things he does.  He has no doubts in the novels.  So he is more of a good guy in the series than he is in the books.  It doesn't matter.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|Actually, I was thinking about listening to this CD prior to deciding to write on it.  My title is way overgeneralized.  Let's see: Fripp on guitar (I think mostly Les Paul at this stage; don't know what kind of acoustic) and Mellotron (a synth that mimics strings, woodwinds, etc.); John Wetton on Fender P-Bass and vocals; and, of course, the incredible Bill Bruford on drums whose name, if you listen to _The Noise_, a video from 1982, can be heard chanted from the crowd.  But the album in question was 1974; excuse me.  Track One, \\"Red,\\" is Fripp's composition, an instrumental full of strange chords, sort of suggesting diminished fifth \\"devil\\" chords, etc., and also some odd 7/8 time signatures, but a fine performance by the whole band.  In fact, I think nobody goes overboard with self-indulgence here.  Track Two, \\"Fallen Angel,\\" features Wetton's pleasant voice singing about violence in NYC, with the implication that the devil is responsible.  Track Three, \\"One More Red Nightmare,\\" with words by Wetton (I think), is about just that while sleeping on a Greyhound bus.  Compare and contrast Bruford's fills in the instrumental parts to Billy Cobham's on a certain track of _The Inner Mounting Flame_ by Mahavishnu Orchestra (1973).  Track Four: a live improv (\\"Providence\\") which can also be found on _The Great Deceiver_ at greater length.  Includes David Cross on violin, who'd been given the ax, much to Fripp's distress...  Whatever.  Read the notes to _Great Deceiver_.  And Track Five, \\"Starless,\\" which had been in process during the 1973-74 tour.  It appears here without Cross - so if you want to hear the original concept, I advise obtaining a copy of _The Great Deceiver_.<br /><br />Some critics have dubbed KC the first heavy metal band based on this incarnation.  But KC was way more elusive for that kind of nailing.  They just followed their collectively individual instincts - if that makes any sense.  There's no other band like them, and, actually, \\"band\\" should say \\"project.\\"  Fripp _is_ King Crimson.<br /><br />One more word: John Wetton is, alongside Chris Squire, the best prog rock bassist I know from this period.  I'm just a nobody, a musician, in fact a bass player and drummer, but I learned almost all I know from listening to records.  _Red_ is a beauty.  Listen and be inspired!.\\"  Fripp _is_ King Crimson.    One more word: John Wetton is, alongside Chris Squire, the best prog rock bassist I know from this period.

B000002LED|5.0|First, I cannot believe that an editor from Amazon would say the this wasn't even their best work...She must be under 30...age or music IQ.  The reason that the Alternative genere exists is because there hansn't been anything like this before or since.  It's one of those albums like \\"Dark Side...\\" or \\"The Redheaded Stranger\\" that if you don't listen to it in it's entirety, in order, you are doing it an injustice.    \\"Ted Just Admit It\\"...Sex is violence with a guest appearance from Ted Bundy should be enough...but \\"Had a Dad\\" proclaing that god is dead sets the tone.    Maybe the most prothetic line comes in \\"Pigs in Zen\\"  where \\"Some People Should Die, That's Just Unconscious Knowledge\\" says a lot about the time were were living in then, and now.      Death to Oboma...oh wait, can I say that in the new America?  The CIA will be at my door, but at least I know who our enemy actually is.
0307588335|5.0|Dick Fuld, Lehman CEO, is clearly responsible for the death of Lehman Brothers, according to author McDonald. It all began with the company participating in the early 2000s subprime mania like many other firms. Low interest rates and risk-spreads, a bumper-crop of easily-available NINJA, no-down, ARMs, interest-only, and \\"easy-money\\" loans, rapidly rising home values, \\"no-worry\\" securitization eliminating risk for loan originators, high commissions for all involved (eg. mortgage salesmen earning $300,000 was common; S&P, Fitch, and Moody's charged as much as $600,000 to rate a $500 million CDO), and mushrooming HELOCs supercharged the economy. Even experts like Laura Tyson, dean of the London business School and Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers forecasted 2006 as \\"The outlook is basically for another Goldilocks kind of year.\\" Further, the U.S. housing market has never dropped over 5% in any year since the Great Depression.<br /><br />However, the discerning also saw clouds. Consumer debt in early 2006 was at 135% of income and rising, vs. 85% in typical boom times. The proportion of \\"alternate\\" mortgages has risen to 35% in 2005, a large number of new mortgages were scheduled to reset to much higher levels, and the volume of home sales and new mortgages had recently dipped.<br /><br />Astute minds inside Lehman Brothers saw enough in 2005 to raise warning flags, and part of the firm acted - eg. successfully shorting some of the major California lenders and builders. Leadership at the top, however, continued acquiring these subprime loans, and when warned, Fuld dismissed his risk expert. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan's CEO directed the firm to get out of the subprime business.<br /><br />When the mortgage market began unraveling in 2007, Fuld, instead of focusing on unwinding Lehman's positions, made things worse with large stock buybacks ($1.6 billion), and investing in hedge funds and commercial real estate ($120 billion). His board sat by and did nothing - perhaps partly because nine of the ten were retired, and most had little or no experience in current financial affairs. Lehman leverage reaches 32X assets (had been 24X in 2004), before soaring to 44X. Then comes a $2.8 billion loss, and J.P. Morgan requests $5 billion in collateral. Fuld meets Secretary of the Treasury Paulson for lunch, and angers him by disrespectfully refusing his advice to accept an offer from the Korea Development Bank ($23/share, then $18, $6.40).<br /><br />Lehman's last chance comes when George Walker IV, cousin of President Bush, calls the White House. The President, however, refuses to take the call, and bankruptcy ensues.<br /><br />Bottom Line: \\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" is an excellent accounting of the fall of Lehman Brothers.because nine of the ten were retired, and most had little or no experience in current financial affairs.

0763630497|3.0|I picked up this book because I'm trying to learn about good haiku.  This is not it.  If, however, you want a beautifully illustrated book of bird poetry, this would be perfect.  My problem is that the author, Michael J. Rosen, has followed the form erroneously taught in so many elementary schools that a haiku must have three lines of 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5 syllables.  In actuality, the syllable counts are appropriate if one is writing or speaking Japanese.  It does not necessarily work in English.  That said, the book is beautifully illustrated by Stan Fellows.  The artwork is realistic and a consummate portrayal of the poetry words.  The book ends with a notes explaining characteristics about each of the 20 birds which appear in the book.  A beautiful book.
0385340575|5.0|My first Jack Reacher read, and a good one, a very good one.  There will be more, for me, and, I hope, for Lee Child. He's good...and so is Jack Reacher.    Reacher is a Great American, \\"standing up for what's right and hittin' a lick against what's wrong,\\" as John Wayne said in \\"The Alamo.\\" Reacher is a modern day John Wayne character, moral, but not too moral:\\"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...\\"and Reacher, like Wayne, does it well.    Reacher is:    --smarter and personally tougher than John Corey (Nelson DeMille) but Corey is a more loveable, likeable, normal guy.    --is not as cunning,as Mitch Rapp (Vince Flynn), but just as bloody, reckless and effective.  Reacher is to John Wayne what Rapp is to James Bond.    And we need them all, for our reading pleasure and for National Security. (We really don't need to know everything there is to know...)    Perhaps Reacher says it best on page 339 in response to \\"This isn't the Wild West...\\"    \\"You got that right. This is the timid West. We need to roll the clock back...\\"    Off in the distance, do I hear strands of the William Tell Overture or sense John Wayne walking through the door?
0465011020|4.0|I have only read half of the book. I bought it for the long flight from SFO to ICN a few weeks ago. I didn't read much of it during the flight. But while I was abroad, I began it and could scarcely put it down, even though my itinerary left little time for other activities. Now that I am home, I will soon complete the book.    As I said, I could scarcely put the book down; it is an engrossing account of a family's suffering at the hands of the brutal North Korean regime. It is a tale of hopes and expectations, of fears and revelations, of degradation and emancipation. It is an expose of the mind and operations of one third of G. Bush's \\"Axis of Evil,\\" a fitting appellation for a government that keeps its own population deprived, not only of the truth of its own malevalence and the truth of the world at large, but of life's most basic necessities, not to mention the simple human desire for freedom of thought and movement.    I read a review downplaying the author's writing style as \\"wanting.\\" Nevertheless, I found it rather powerful and poignant. It's certainly not Solzhenytsin's \\"Gulag Archipalego,\\" but it is a worthy work in its own right and well worth the read.     I may add to this review once I have finished the book. But suffice it to say that I am glad to have found it; it has earned a permanent place on my shelf.
B000ZEE3I6|3.0|Near the end of the movie, Dumbledore says to Harry Potter, \\"I sometimes forget how much you've grown.\\"  Well, let me tell you, it must be senility, because he's the only one who hasn't noticed.  With Harry's five o'clock shadow and the clear growth shared by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronald (Rupert Grint), I half expected a McLovin fake ID subplot.  Either they've extended eligibility by red-shirting a year, or they failed a grade, but at this point they've been attending school longer than anyone except Radio.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it's stuck in a Twilight impersonation, with the aging trio gaining more experience with teen angst than wizardy.  Unfortunately, the threesome hasn't mastered an anti-aging spell yet, and they wander the halls of Hogwarts looking like the creepy old guy at the club, clearly years older than everyone else, and awkwardly out of place.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the pseudo-albino antagonist, is busy growing up into someone who looks like a Die Hard villain; which is ironic considering Professor Snape is played by Alan Rickman, a man who was the original Die Hard enemy for John McClane.  Add David Thewlis as Professor Lupin and the evil Euro-trifecta is complete.<br /><br />Still battling the legacy of Voldermort is the key issue, with a few of his lackeys - most notably Helena Bonham Carter looking horrible - taking people away, killing others, and causing havoc.  There are also several fanciful potions and concoctions throughout, as Harry, Ron, and Dumbledore end up with reactions similar to the side affects of LSD, Ecstasy, and Meth, respectively.  Both are only minimal side stories, however, because the main point is to introduce drama and relationships into this edition, and inexplicably make a cute blonde like that red-headed train-wreck Ronald, not to mention Hermione's baffling attraction to him.  Too much of the plot was sacrificed, and too many holes are filled in by teen romance.<br /><br />This is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series.  There are some great sci-fi scenes, wonderful special effects, competent acting, and some incredibly dark imagery.  It's a joy to watch most of the time, but some aspects of the plot are ridiculously lacking (e.g. Dumbledore can turn back time, but nobody can stop a fire?).  Additionally the kids, scratch that, adults, shouldn't be in Hogwarts anymore; they're a little long in the tooth.  Harry and his sycophants should be serving as adjunct faculty at this point, not taking \\"Advanced Potions.\\"  Setting up another in the Harry Potter 90210 series - with obvious cameos for Brandon and Brenda Walsh - the movie ends on a down-note, with a huge spoiler (not for anyone who has heard countless rumors on the internet), and the first incomplete, and completely unsatisfying, ending in the Harry Potter series.Harry Potter series.

0307269752|4.0|Yes, it's too long--the coda  goes on for pages after the action should have stopped.  From the first, the protagonist's beliefs about the fate of a young girl are obviously mistaken, and therefore suggest certain things must be the case.  Even with the assistance of the family tree, the Vangers (even their houses--a map of the village would have nice) are too hard to keep straight.  The author is angry at too many  things for one book.<br /><br />BUT it's still a very enjoyable novel--we like and engage with Blomquist and cheer for Lisbeth, and understand her violence.  The picture of the underside of modern Swedish life is indelible.  Lots of local color.<br /><br />Not perhaps as \\"literary\\" as suggested by the reviews, but still an interesting read.
0312370849|2.0|I found this book disappointing.  The writing was uninspired, the characters under developed, and the story - which had great promise - failed to hold my interest - a surprising thing to say about a story set in Paris about the Holocaust, either one of which should have kept me captive!
B000002AGN|5.0|If you only buy one Dave Brubeck or only hear one Dave Brubeck album in your lifetime this is the album you need to hear. Realesed in 1959 a year of great jazz albums including many of the greats, \\"Kind of Blue\\", \\"The Shape Of Jazz To Come\\", \\"Mingus Ah Um\\", and \\"Time Out\\", respectively. By 1959 jazz was stretching out in new forms and ideas and this album on proves this statement even more. Time Out is based upon the use of time signatures that were very unusaul for jazz at the time like, waltz, double waltz time etc. Even though Time Out was intended for an experiement the album has become one of the best selling greatest jazz albums of all time and in 2005 it was one of 50 recordings chosen for preservation in the Library Of Congress, so what are you waiting for? If you still havent heard this album than go out and buy it today.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This CD shows why Amy Winehouse is in so much trouble.  Her talent is evident, but I would have been very disappointed if I would have paid to see her live.  It's so refreshing to go from the DVD to her CD.  The DVD is very revealing and I found it very enjoyable and enlightening.  If you are an Amy Winehouse fan this is a must.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This along with Kind of Blue are the two essentail down to earth Miles Davis albums to own and or listen to once or twice in your life. Of the two listed, \\"Bitches Brew\\", is way more experiemental than Kind of Blue and is also much more electric having electric guitars and electric keyboards throughout the entire album, And on top of ALL of that the songs are way, way, way more longer with the longest song being the title track, clocking in at over 26 minutes long. Bitches Brew has gone on to become one of Davis's best selling albums and masterpieces and for a good reason too.... The songs on here are timeless and are able to be heard over and over and over and over again, Bitches Brew has gone on to become a maijor influence on rock, funk, jazz muscians alike.<br /><br />  Recorded between dates August 19-21st 1969 at 30th Street Studio's in New York in total 6 tracks recorded were brought on to the album that comprises, \\"Bitches Brew\\". Those six songs are, \\"Pharoahs Dance\\", \\"Bitches Brew\\", \\"Spanish Key\\", \\"John Mclaughgain\\", \\"Miles Runs The Voodoo Down\\", \\"Sanctuary\\", respectively. Each track contains improvisational beauty that makes this album hard to beat. So if you call yourself a fan of jazz or Miles Davis pick this album up and trust me you will not be dissapointed.
0307269752|2.0|The authors had a number of interests: research of nazism (in Sweden)  and  abuse of women. He tries to insert these in a crime novel which, as a detective story, is quite weak (one can feel what is coming on page 40 already, no surprises). But the rape scenes serve no purpose; The \\"bad\\" guy as well as his father, as well as the lawyer being into abuse of women becomes a bit unbelieveable; He even alludes to the protagonist a \\"ebing into BDSM\\" - This is getting ridiculous, like if there are no normal people in Sweden or something; The explanations of nazi sympathies of forefathers in the famliy serves no purpose either, other than noting that there are some screwed up guys in this family. If this is the height of Swedish crime novels, please count me out.

1596061669|4.0|This is one of my absolute favorite books (Angel's Game being the other) and was happy to see an autographed edition being released. My friend bought a copy and it's a very nice edition. The cover isn't may favorite but the cover is double sided with the image of an old worn book cover printed on the inside (which I really like), it is printed on very bright white paper that is nice quality and includes some odd images throughout the book. After seeing it in person, I decided to order a copy.<br /><br />Sadly, the packing was horrible. The book is supposed to be shrink wrapped onto a backing board that is larger than the book to prevent movement and keep any of the book's edges from bumping up against the inside of the shipping box. They had the book shrink wrapped to a board that was smaller than the book. That's right, smaller. It made no sense. So all 4 corners of the book were exposed inside the shipping box. The shipping box was a good 2 inches bigger than the book so the book constantly moved around the inside of the shipping box during shipping. Needless to say, I open the box and the top right hand corner is completely dented in. Not just the jacket, but the cover board. I returned for a replacement stating that the return was due to the damage caused by the backing board that's smaller than the book. I received the replacement packed the same exact way with a different corner dented in the same way. So I had to return this second copy for a refund and do without the book. I expected Amazon to put more care into shipping an autographed $50 edition of a book.
B000001FOL|4.0|Nico's 1967 debut displays two distinct sonic styles, the first which may perhaps be termed a blend of folk & chamber music and the second the art-rock number with a VU feel. John Cale, Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison composed or co-wrote many of the songs and play on the album, contributing arresting instrumental textures behind Nico's bleak vocals. An air of melancholy permeates both styles whilst the second type has an added undertone of unease.<br /><br />Tracks like The Fairest of the Seasons with its gentle orchestral backing, Cale & Reed's haunting Little Sister and Reed & Morrison's Chelsea Girls with their delicate arrangements have the folkie feel of some of [[ASIN:B000003BEP Marianne Faithfull's]] 1960s work and also bring to mind the orchestral folk of [[ASIN:B000025H0Q Nick Drake]], no doubt because John Cale worked with both and Drake also used cello and flute. [[ASIN:B00003CWJ0 Tim Hardin's]] moving Eulogy to Lenny Bruce resorts here as well.<br /><br />Cale's Winter Song falls somewhere between the two whilst the complex arrangement of Lou Reed's Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams reflects the song's striking, often disturbing imagery. The most experimental track, It Was A Pleasure Then - co-written by Nico - is perhaps closest to the [[ASIN:B001DZDU0I The Velvet Underground]] sound in its screeching feedback, dissonance and edgy sound effects.<br /><br />The appeal of Chelsea Girls is difficult to define, especially for fans of the VU and the later solo work of Cale & Reed. The material's thematic matrix and the acoustic backing - including piano, strings & guitar - highlight the mournful magic in Nico's German accent and detached delivery. Two very different but interesting albums are [[ASIN:B000001E2U The End]] and [[ASIN:B000001JMR Drama of Exile]]. I highly recommend the biography by James Young, [[ASIN:0747544115 Nico, Songs They Never Play on the Radio]].
1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin writes about people who are displaced, whether from their inner lives, society or by physical distance. In Brooklyn, he captures what must have been the experience for literally millions of Irish-Americans, when he tells the story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl whose family sends her to America because they believe she will have a better life. I read the book in one day, and found it to be achingly poignant. Anyone who is Irish will recognize the stories in this book; anyone whose grandparents or ancestors were immigrants will finally understand exactly what they went through.    I have a couple of criticisms of the book. Any male author who writes about a woman cannot truly capture her innermost thoughts, nor could a female author really know what men believe. In this sense, Brooklyn suffered from a sense of dispassion. Things are happening to Eilis that would be earth shattering for many women, especially after WWII, when it was still very unusual for women to travel so far alone. Likewise, the growth that Eilis experiences after she arrives in America would prompt a woman to react more emotionally than Eilis does in these pages. She struck me as slightly more analytical and unfeeling than woman in her situation might be.    Also, I would have loved the book to have been longer. There's so much to know about Ireland at the time, Brooklyn at the time, America at the time. Toibin puts a lot into the book and leaves it to the reader to do their own exploration. But these shortcomings do not detract from beautiful writing, a lovely story and a character that I could see and touch in my mind's eye. Another well-done book by an author who easily rivals Ian McEwan.
B001VFAYEK|5.0|Nightclubbing of 1981 followed the previous year's experimental Warm Leatherette and was a triumph sales-wise. More accessible than both Warm Leatherette and Living My Life, this second work of the Sly & Robbie trilogy is packed with outstanding songs of lyrical and melodic distinction. They include compositions by Bill Withers, Astor Piazzolla, Sting, David Bowie/Iggy Pop, Barry Reynolds and Grace herself. Nightclubbing is the best entry point for those wishing to investigate Ms Jones immediate post-disco phase. The sound is crystal clear and despite the Jamaican influences the album has an artistic European air about it.<br /><br />Varied yet cohesive, Nightclubbing successfully explores different avenues but gives an overall impression of a concept album. It is polished and sophisticated, displaying none of the raw edges of [[ASIN:B000001FU5 Warm Leatherette]] and offering a broader appeal than [[ASIN:B000001FU8 Living My Life]]. It opens with Walking In The Rain where Grace applies her semi-spoken vocal style over a light pop-reggae beat. Notorious for its risqu&eacute; lyrics, Pull Up To The Bumper with its jerking Jamaican rhythms and car horn samples is a perennial club favorite which has seen a plethora of remixes and covers down the years.<br /><br />The slower numbers are Bowie & [[ASIN:B000000WH7 Iggy's]] Nightclubbing which is sinister rather than celebratory and I've Done it Again which is romantic and soulful as opposed to the title track's undertone of menace. Speaking of which, her interpretation of Sting's Demolition Man takes menace to new dimensions; it's the most explicitly rock-influenced song here and packs a punch. Bill Withers' Use Me & her own composition Feel Up are both buoyant uptempo tracks, the first being a show of defiance with an infectious reggae beat and the second a Caribbean celebration with rattling percussion, choral vocals, what appears to be flutes & whistles and a dialogue in French patois between Grace & a male vocal.<br /><br />The magnificent Art Groupie is the most poetic & literary track with a flowing rhythmic lilt and a synth that resembles the golden age of Human League or [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Eurythmics]]. Reggae meets an accordion on the bouncy Libertango, a catchy bilingual track on which Grace speaks and sings elegantly in French and English. The album concludes with the wistful ballad I've Done It Again where an introspective lyric carried by an understated sound provides a delicate result. In retrospect, Nightclubbing contains several tracks that resemble what ZE Records, the NYC label which was thriving at the same time, was pursuing. Artists like [[ASIN:B0002XB9IM Cristina Monet]] and Kid Creole created the exquisite types of music that this magnificent album has in such abundance.<br /><br />The follow-up Living My Life concluded the Sly & Robbie trilogy and therewith the reggae & dub phase of her career. On her 1986 and 1989 albums -- [[ASIN:B00000718N Inside Story]] & Bulletproof Heart -- Ms Jones focused on soulful pop music.  Then followed 19 years of silence. It was only in 2008 that Grace worked with Sly & Robbie again, on the challenging and ultimately rewarding [[ASIN:B001GAD7NA Hurricane]] where Brian Eno and Tricky count amongst the other contributors. In my opinion, Nightclubbing remains Grace's masterpiece, a work that best demonstrates her distinctive styles as vocalist, interpreter and composer via an exceptional set of songs.pie is the most poetic & literary track with a flowing rhythmic lilt and a synth that resembles the golden age of Human League or [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Eurythmics]].

B0007PAMR4|4.0|I recently picked up the extended edition version of \\"Dune\\". The \\"new\\" version of the movie now has about 40 minutes of additional content and has been reedited to include it. The movie is now different than what was originally shown in theaters.  After my initial viewing of this new version, I'm a bit divided as to whether it is better or worse than the original. Part of the problem is that I've watched the original film so many times that it's like an old friend.<br /><br />There are some things that I don't like about the new extended version. Number one is that they have replaced the voice-over narration. In the original the narration was done by Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen). Now in this new version the narration is done by a male voice - which wouldn't really be a problem but he sounds to me like Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) from the 1960's television show \\"Petticoat Junction\\". The voice narrates at times over the length of the movie - smoothing the transitions of the new scenes as well as explaining situations for people who might not have read the book. Maybe it just me, but I found it annoying. Could be too that I just like the voice of Virginia Madsen. Number two, was that the great Toto soundtrack seemed very muted and at times missing altogether.<br /><br />Some additional notes. The DVD comes in one of those metal DVD cases and the DVD itself is a dual-sided disc. One side has the original version and the bonus material and on the other side is the extended version.<br /><br />Bonus materials includes features on, Deleted Dune - deleted scenes, Designing Dune - development of the visual design, Dune FX - special-effects, Dune Models - models and motion control, Dune Wardrobe - costume design, and a photo gallery of behind-the-scenes photos and artwork.<br /><br />I'm giving this review four-stars mainly because of the bonus materials and the original version, if this disc was just the extended version I would probably only give it two-stars.
140003180X|5.0|Not much else can be said that hasn't been covered in the reviews.  Precious is a wonderful, relaxed, sensible investgator and is surrounded by interesting characters such as assistant Makutsi and fiance' Matekoni.  Another interesting book and a  proud tour of Botswana. The rival detective agency opening up in town won't stand a chance. Mr.Smith writes an amusing and touching novel about the Africa that he knows so well.  Buy it!  It's worth the few bucks and you won't be able to put it down.
0060012358|5.0|Although it doesn't involve any of the recurring characters (except of course, Death) this book takes place on the Discworld. If you're not familiar with Terry Pratchett's writing, the Discworld is a British humor parody of the fantasy genre as a whole . . . well, it started out just as that; I don't think that summary does it justice any longer . . . anywho.    This is the story of a cat and a group of rats who through a magical accident became intelligent. Along with the help of a young boy who likes to play music, they work together to run a \\"rat piper\\" scam in various towns they travel through. At least, that's how things stand until they reach Bad Blintz. Here they find something truly terrible that transforms all of them. (They also meet a girl named Malicia Grim, a grand-daughter of the Grim sisters, writers of some disturbingly gory fairy tales (much like most fairy tales were before Disney got ahold of them) but I don't know if I want to describe characters in depth right now.))    If read attentively, this is a surprisingly deep book. It's an adventure story with talking animals, yes; but it's also a story about how community and morality are formed, what it means to be a leader, and why widdling on someone's grave isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a book about the power of stories, the ones we tell ourselves about ourselves and the ones we tell each other about how the world works. Don't get me wrong, the story never gets bogged down in abstract speculation or bland moralizing. Instead it's like a Sunday school teacher in a dunking booth, educational and yet hilarious at the same time.    While I certainly think this book is worthy of awards, I'm amazed that it got a Carnegie Medal for children's books. Pratchett is almost always funny, but this is also a dark and occasionally disturbing book. . . . All that to say, highly recommended.
0061438294|1.0|\\"Stressed face is tense and slightly contorted, eyebrows are knitted, and the forehead is furrowed.\\"    \\"People lean away from each other subconsciously when they disagree or feel uncomfortable around each other.\\"    DUH! WHO DOESN'T KNOW THIS?  There are some (definitely not enough) pictures in the book, and all the explanations are like this. Most pictures resemble the face expressions of emotion on the wall in any kindergarten.  The book is SO BASIC. I got to the midway hoping it would get better after reading all these rivews. Well, it never did.  The author just rambles on about how his awesome skills at reading people did him so much good.    Buy this book only if you are some kind of extreme sociopath who can never tell why or when people are mad/sad/uncomfortable, etc. If you are a normal person with average social skills, you already know everything in this book.  It pretty much says stuff like \\"People smile when they feel comfortable.\\"  No kidding! This is the worst book I ever read after The Secret.
B00028HBKC|3.0|This film definitely surprised me.  I expected a theological lecture, but in fact Mad Mel has simply taken some Bible bits and turned them into a slasher flick with a twist. In a typical slasher, there's one bad guy chopping up a lot of people.  In this one, there's loads of bad guys slicing up one person.      Of course, on a more serious level, the film is an excellent illustration of the insanity of religion.  But that's a topic for another forum.
0385342020|2.0|Remember Me and The Undomestic Goddess are two of my favorite books of all time.  Twenties Girl is nowhere near as well written as those two, or even as well written as the Shopaholic series.  The idea is charming and the ending is delightful but I found myself skimming the pages as the dialogue or action just dragged.  I nearly abandoned the book and actually found it sad that made it to the end and enjoyed the ending so much as it spoke to what a wonderful book this could have been.
B00196XXPI|5.0|Don't let the fact that the book is tiny, that it was written by a very young unaccomplished writer in 1955, or the fact that it is French dissuade you.  This book is wonderful.<br /><br />We spend the summer holiday with Cecile, a teenage girl on the cusp of womanhood who is caught between the desires of her younger self and those of the woman she is destined to become.  Through her eyes we see a glimpse of the beauty of the French seaside and the complexities of her society.  Cecile moves toward her abrupt coming of age with resolve and trepidation... she yearns for the simplicity of an imagined perfect family life while at the same time manipulating the adults around her in order to maintain some sense of control.<br /><br />Cecile's love hate relationship with first her father's latest mistress Edna and then later with his fianc&eacute; Ann, is really a response to her unorthodox relationship with her father himself.  Her fumbling in the matters of love with the older boy Cyril and her loss of her innocence, by her own hand, hallmark the classic heart trauma of a girl becoming a woman.<br /><br />Cecile is a wonderfully written character.  She isn't always understandable or likable, but she is always engaging.  Her metamorphosis is heart breaking and yet wholly unsurprising.  Sagan writes with a style that is clear, concise, and reminiscent of Fitzgerald.  In fact, had Cecile suddenly taken a trip to West Egg, it would not have seemed out of character.<br /><br />With its gripping storytelling, it is no wonder that this book became a classic.  I highly recommend it.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The creativity is beyond.... and no George Martin.  And, most of it doesn't hurt my ears...  The less I say the better, just buy it.
B00288KNLS|2.0|The movie is just about perfect(4 and half stars). Picture and sound are both great. BUT!!! Both the single disc version and the double disc version are flipped disc(Dual sided). I find this unacceptable.
B0000TB014|4.0|Overall I was overjoyed with this dvd & the magic of MJ. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that Smooth Criminal was messed up. It was not in real time but looked like it was sped up and was a promotional piece for the real thing. Too much special effects that didn't allow to see the magnificent dancing in detail. Youtube calls this the radio version. Had I known I was not getting the right version I would not have bought it.  Glad it was the only disappointment, besides Remember The Time not included on this video and the grainy quality of The Way You Make Me Feel.
B001U0O8H0|5.0|I love the sound of this vinyl record. The only downside is that mine came with a defect, so it skips about a second on one of the tracks. I am in the process of replacing/getting refund. But listen to what I have to say about the sound difference between the vinyl version and the CD. The mastering of the CD is terrible. Dynamic compression totally killed the album, some sounds don't even exist on the CD. But the vinyl sounds incredible. I keep playing it over and over and I can't get enough. Sound is alive, smooth, warm, and it is a pleasure to listen to it. I wonder how great this record would sound on a good player. Mine is just a cheap Audio Technica AT-PL50, but it's still quite good. So this is a typical loudness war example. Get the vinyl and a record player if you don't have one yet. Vinyl is here to stay.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|Well, this is where Chicago's style really began to enter into an obvious commercial direction, which is unfortunate because previously the band had something *awesome* going as far as brassy instrumental music combined with rock music goes.  Now it's just... nice music.  Well to be fair, it's actually excellent (hence my 4 out of 5 star rating) but... I dunno, this just marks a different direction for the band and leaves a sour taste in my mouth as a result.  Alright, Chicago VII isn't without its faults obviously, but there's some other things that kind of bother me.  While the opening song resembles Santana, hearing Chicago attempt the same kind of music Santana popularized is just weird.  It's actually a pretty decent song and I'm not really complaining about it; I just don't think it was totally appropriate for Chicago to attempt something like this.  At least it's brief.  After the opening track, the album shifts into a bunch of instrumental brass jams, some of which I could have sworn came from Chicago's fifth album.  I will give the band credit here though- each instrumental jam sounds different from the other one, and sets an entirely different mood.  This is a pretty welcoming kind of experimentation as far as I'm concerned.  The only complaint is how most of these jams lack any kind of serious punch to really make them stand alongside the instrumental jams from the previous Chicago albums.  In other words, Chicago knew they'd never be able to progress their brassy sound past whta was presented on the previous four albums, so they settled into a groove.  But as far as jamming goes, yeah, these are some pretty good jams.  \\"Aire\\" stands out as an instant highlight to me because of its lengthy jazz guitar jam.  I LOVE this song quite a bit too.  The brass work is melodic, and the jazzy guitar solo is downrigh spectacular and highly memorable.  The \\"Devil's Sweet\\" is surprisingly melodic and easy to absorb from a jazz standpoint.  It starts off with these easylistening horns before morphing into an ambient freak-out show of sorts for a couple minutes, then the horns become more aggressive, then a fast-paced and simplistic keyboard or synth solo enters the fold before soon returning to the horns that started the whole thing.  It's not difficult or challenging like \\"Aire\\" which is a slight disappointment to me.  At 10 minutes, I was certainly expecting it to be.  \\"Happy Man\\" sounds WAY too commercial and perfectly indicates the direction Chicago was going for.  I think I've heard this song a long time ago... in a supermarket.  I never heard any Chicago song from the previous albums in a grocery store.  Oh and how weird is it that for a song title with the word \\"happy\\" in it, there's actually a deep heavy sound to the background arrangements on a few occasions?  \\"Call On Me\\" is another highlight as far as Peter Cetera's vocal melodies are concerned.  I remember this used to be a radio favorite years ago.    \\"I've Been Searchin' So Long\\" may have been the big hit, but it's so sappy and such a tender ballad that, well, it reminds me of bankteller music, haha.  It's not a BAD song by any means, it's just... a Bee Gees copycat at best.  The same can be said for \\"Wishing You Were Here\\", but at least this song has a really good verse melody.  Actually you know what?  No matter will I believe these two songs sound the same.  Now that I know the Beach Boys of all bands made an appearance on \\"Wishing You Were Here\\", I'll always think of it as having a poppy vocal melody.  I love the dramatic intro, too.  I like how the final two tracks take Chicago to a VERY different level.  These are funky/soulful type tracks.  I mean ENTIRELY in that genre- not just a quick sprinkle of it!  \\"Women Don't Want to Love Me\\" contains a wonderful verse melody, and \\"Skinny Boy\\" has a female gospel chorus that's pretty strange at first, but the vocal melody actually improves with repeated listens.  I love both of these songs believe it or not.  My favorite song is clearly \\"Song of the Evergreens\\".  I TOTALLY haven't heard this song in a good 20 years.  It's been *that* long!  Talk about lyrics that perfectly match the feeling of witnessing snow fall on a forest in the middle of winter (despite how heavy the guitar solo is, and the fact the chorus speeds up and practically launches into its own groove for the final two minutes- HIGHLY memorable too).  \\"Byblos\\" is awesome for featuring vocals courtesy of Terry Kath.  No ordinary vocal melody or arrangements either- this may be a light ballad, but it's written in a folk-ish, fairly complex way and should not be underrated.       Despite Chicago charging into a subtle creative groove temporarily, Chicago VII is most definitely not in the same category as the previous albums.  Some of these experiments are commendable, and if only this had been their last album it would have ended on a pretty good note.
B000002I55|4.0|I held off getting \\"Free Jazz\\" for a long time because of its daunting reputation.  A double quartet playing one 37-minute long song?  But, it's not far out there at all.  It's just a long jam, and it's pretty good.  This album, of course, helped unleash some crazy free jazz, but it's fairly tame.  The CD has the alternate version.  It's pretty good too, and only 15 minutes long.  It has a similar format to the longer version, so I don't listen to the two versions back-to-back.  The song drags towards the end when the bassists solo, but aside from that, it's highly recommended.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I was just looking for a comedy that didnt have a fat ugly guy with a hot wife. And thank god a good one liner slap stick has come along. This is one of the best comedies since they took Friends off the air! Love this and cant wait to watch the 2nd season!
B0017ANAZO|1.0|I seriously don't get movies like these.    It's a storyline that's *completely* pointless.  The constant talking going on between the women playing the lead characters doesn't MEAN anything.  The focal point of the storyline is something so ordinary and bland that it doesn't mean anything.    It doesn't matter if it's men or women- when the lead characters constantly talk about subjects that mean absolutely nothing to anyone except themselves, the film can't be saved, and there's honestly nothing even remotely interesting about ordinary every day city problems involving people in relationships and other minor things.    Imagine this- you go to the mall, hear a couple of men or women having conversations about their family and friends, and then follow them around the mall as they continue talking about their minor problems.  That's basically what happens throughout The Women.  The only difference is that, instead of a mall, it's all over a city.     Who in the world thought this was a good idea for a storyline?  And good enough to make a MOVIE out of it?  Don't make me laugh!    This movie really is worthless.  I want to see a storyline that actually goes somewhere, and a story where I can REALLY feel myself wanting to know what happens next.  That's what movie watching is all about.
0743455967|5.0|I have had King's \\"On Writing\\" for a number of years and I have read most of it quite a few times.  Sometimes for a chuckle and sometimes if I get the dreaded writers block disease.  This book is great for the writer, aspiring writer and for SK fans.  Seldom does a writer of SK's stature spend the time discussing his writing, his life and his various methods and outlook and personal writing history.  Especially funny is when his agent calls to tell SK he has just sold the paperback rights for \\"Carrie\\" and at first King just can't get his head to understand the $ involved.  Any aspiring writer will find his viewpoints refreshing and an inspiration.  Writing is hard--but it is not that hard.  Just a few prerequisites will help get you going.  All you need is a small toolbox with the necessary tools and a good attitude.    Like: Create with the door closed, rewrite with the door open.  Pretty simple stuff.  Get rid of your stupid adverbs.  No, he doesn't give you a magic formula or Dumbo's magic feather, instead he just talks to you about what is important and what isn't.  It is more of a personal conversation than some \\"Learn To Write\\" manual.  There are all kinds of people selling their writing methods and courses and most of these people peddling their wares can't write a bestseller to save their lives.  King, on the other hand can write and has had a slew of bestsellers and I am sure is one of the best selling writers of the last couple decades.  I find the best thing SK provides the new (or old) writer in this book is a good attitude without the BS.  I think it was very generous of SK to share so much of his life and experience as a writer.  He tells you what works for him although that may not exactly work for you.  Get the book.    Another good book on writing by another bestselling writer is \\"Lessons From A Lifetime of Writing\\" by David Morrell.    Thanks Stephen for taking the time to write \\"On Writing\\".  I usually keep my well-worn copy right next to my dictionary.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Actually, I enjoy this series very much.   Shown here in the UK on Five, it doesn't get great ratings (probably because it's then repeated about 6 times in the following week on various sister channels) but it is a nice respite from the violence and reality rubbish which seems to dominate UK television.      An ensemble cast make this a must watch, but Simon Baker is the stand out.   This part could do for his career what ER did for George Clooney.      Well written, well acted and all in all great telly.   I enjoy it very much.   Hope that Five continue to show it even though ratings are not fantastic.
0385342020|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and her latest book did not disappoint.      I don't know if it was intentional but this book reminds me a bit of the movie \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" with Jimmy Stewart.  Only the main character in TWENTIES GIRL is Lara Lington, and the ghost in her life is her recently deceased great aunt Sadie.  The characters are endearing and the situations they get themselves into are comical.    Yes there is a romance to the story but the main relationship, for me, is the one between Lara and Sadie.  The characters grow as the relationship deepens.  The book is light and fun and even a bit emotional.  It's by far my favorite Kinsella book to date - and quite possibly my favorite book of all time.    I highly recommend it!
B000CNESU8|5.0|The Bottom Line:    He may have won the Oscar and been the rallying cry of the film, but I actually think that Peter Finch's character is the least believable and least compelling aspect of Network; that said, his inconsistent character is the only drawback to this wicked satire of television that consistently strikes the right notes while never being anything less than compelling.    3.5/4
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|A fun show on stage, this became ridiculous transferred to the screen because of the casting.  The actresses playing Donna and her cronies were all pushing 60 when they filmed this.  It should have been played by actors about forty give or take a couple of years.  Why did they do this?
0307408833|3.0|Like others, I found that there seemed to be something missing in some of the recipes.  The chocolate sauce/frosting recipe, for instance, definitely worked as a sauce, but not as the creamy frosting depicted on the cover (even after refrigerated for 6 hours, as directed).    For the cost and effort, the results were unimpressive.  Even when followed to the T, recipes yielded decent (but by no means impressive) baked goods.  I had read that these cupcakes were rated \\"best cupcake\\" this past year in NYC.  I find this very hard to believe, as there are soooo many amazing cupcake places in NYC.  Perhaps the cupcakes at the shop are infinitely better than the ones you make at home from the recipes provided.    If you are vegan, the baked goods are decent - but they still don't compare to the real thing.  Ingredients are exorbitantly expensive, and recipes are finicky - don't substitute anything!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|After reading some of the reviews here I was expecting that this film would be all action and no story.  To the contrary, I think this is one of the best Bond's ever and part of that is because of the emotion Daniel Craig brings to Bond.  You can sense his barely controlled rage carrying him from scene to seen.  He is on the edge and this film takes on the journey to see if he will make it back or not.  The film is beautifully shot and you can tell how much hard work and effort went into it.  As with the Bond films of old, the locations are characters unto themselves and Bond is constantly moving from one locale to another.  One review mentioned the film was hard to watch because the camera cut from scene to scene so rapidly.  I think that is true in only one sequence.  The car chase in the beginning is definitely guilty of that and I was worried the whole film would be like that.  Fortunately, that is the only scene guilty of that.  I think they were trying to show a sense of chaos in the car chase but it was just too much.  But, once you get past that scene it is classic Bond.<br /><br />I think this film was better than Casino Royale.  The one thing I didn't like about Casino Royale was that I couldn't see why Bond liked Vespa.  Sure, she was an orphan like him but beyond that I didn't feel the connection.  In Quantum of Solace, I felt that Bond and Camille were a great match for each other.  I can only assume that Bond cared about her enough that he didn't want to involve her in his life and see her die because of it.  I hope she reappears at some point in the franchise.<br /><br />Kudos to all involved in the film. They did a masterful job brining it all together.  This is one of those films that makes me wish I had become a filmmaker.
B00006WUWQ|5.0|Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery- I think this is a very funny movie. Mike Myers does an awesome job. Austin Powers is a 'sex symbol' of the 1960's and has himself frozen for 30 years, until his enemy Dr. Evil returns. He teams up with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of his 1960s sidekick Mrs. Kensington. Can Austin defeat Dr. Evil again? I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me- This is an extremely funny sequel with plenty of gags and hilarious toilet humor! This time, Dr. Evil travels back in time when Austin was frozen, and steals his Mojo. Austin also travels back to 1969 to stop Dr. Evil from destroying the world, along the way he meets an incredibly beautiful spy named Felicity Shagwell, stops a miniature clone of Dr. Evil named Mini Me and much more. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME!!!<br /><br />Austin Powers in Goldmember- This is a very funny sequel that brings closure to the trilogy! It has hilarious gags, and more awesome toilet humor! Austin's father, Nigel has been kidnapped, and Austin needs Dr. Evil's help to find him. He is told that a man named Goldmember has Nigel in the year 1975. When everthing goes smooth in the 70's, Goldmember comes back to our time and teams up with Dr. Evil to destroy the world. I highly recommend AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER!!!

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, Half-Blood Prince is my favorite. Why? Well, for one, it is a brilliantly well done film that once again allows the amazing acting to really shine through, and it also throws in subtle references to the previous films in the series as well as different pieces of plot from the books. Half-Blood Prince has it all: humor, style, flawless special effects, great acting, and a plot that is more powerful than any plot told in the films to date.    The villains are especially impressive, and they give performances that are absolutely memorable and chilling all at once. The teenage angst presented by our lovable protagonists is relatable and just as interesting to watch as the cool fight scenes are. Yes, this Potter film does it all in a way that will dazzle, amaze, and astound you.    This film takes place directly after Order of the Phoenix left off, with good 'ole Harry still recovering from his battle with Lord Voldemort. However, he is called back by Albus Dumbledore to aid in a mission to find out more about Voldemort's dark past and to try to stop the evil from becoming as powerful as it had been years ago. Trust me, by the end of the movie, your heart will be wrenched with emotions and your jaw will be slammed through the floorboards. It's really that good.    Everything from the editing to the special effects were done well, and done in a way so that they make you feel exactly what the director had intended you to feel. There are even some pretty jarring thrills sprinkled in with the happy-go-lucky moments and sweet smiles that the film will give you, plus it's laugh out loud funny and jump out of your seat terrifying all at once. This truly is a film for the ages.    The special effects, an area that has really bothered me in previous Potter films, have really been improved with this installment. The use of CGI is even less so than it was in the films prior to Half-Blood Prince, which is a god-send, and the CGI that is useddoesn't look as ugly and is rarely the main focus of the screen. The characters become more fleshed out and the stage is set for the grand finale that we will experience within the next couple of years.    Without a doubt, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film EVERYONE has to see. It has everything you'd want and expect from a Potter film plus it's simply a classic film all together. Potter fans will love it and movie buffs in general will be in awe by the time the ending credits roll. Trust me, you won't regret seeing this one.
1594488916|5.0|I once bought and sold books on eBay. I still try to go to book sales as I enjoy the treasure hunt of finding a valuable book. My personal library numbers more than a thousand books--and not one was stolen.    I enjoyed this book tremendously. The author, who comes across as charming and humorous, did a great job of covering the history of book collecting, the sellers, buyers, and the criminals.    She was concerned (others were as well) about glorifying career criminal John Gilkey. She profiles his background, crimes, and personal philosophy about stealing. But in no way is he glorified. She reveals him to be a sociopath who never grew up. He rationalizes, lies, and doesn't apparently realize he comes off as a huge jackass. No, the heroes in this book are the hardworking, dedicated booksellers and self-appointed book detective Ken Sanders. Gilkey is a memorable loser who would have made a great character in a Donald Westlake or Lawrence Block novel.    I highly recommend this book. I couldn't put it down.
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbath's first two albums, BLACK SABBATH and PARANOID introduced the world to heavy metal, and it seemed like a tall order to try and actually top those trailblazing masterpieces.  Well, Black Sabbath managed to pull it off with their third release, MASTER OF REALITY.  In my opinion, MASTER OF REALITY is THE definitive heavy metal album of the 1970's, just as POWERSLAVE by Iron Maiden is THE definitive heavy metal album of the 1980's.  There's just something about the incredible rawness to the sound of the songs that give it its metal texture and mood.  Songs like Lord of this World, Children of the Grave, Into the Void and the cold and eerie Solitude exemplify this. This album is very dark and very heavy.  I prefer this album over PARANOID and the first album because it is what heavy metal should be all about---darkness, heaviness and rawness.  Black Sabbath is the greatest heavy metal band of all time, and I recommend this album for a starting point in your Sabbath collection.  All of the songs get 10/10.
0385340575|2.0|Lee Child is a journeyman author of airport books. He usually writes entertaining stuff, but he is becoming the victim of his own success. This book was cranked out on a tight schedule from the publisher. If Child had had more time, he would have written a shorter book. This one desperately needs a good edit. Reacher should be allowed to age gracefully. He is a protagonist in his late 40's who never works out, sleeps 1-3 hours every other night, drinks gallons of coffee, eats mostly fast-food, doesn't own a gun or practice with one, and yet remains in perfect physical condition and able to shoot any firearm with extreme accuracy on demand. I know this is fiction, but Child should leaven his imagination with a little reality.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Even if you have never been able to sit through a complete ballet, this production of Bourne's version of Swam Lake will hold you to the end.  The cast is superb.  Especially of note is Adam Cooper whose raw masculinity creates a truly memorable swan.  Bourne adds enough humor to let us know he is laughing with us all at life's imperfections and at those who cannot help seeing a gay in every closet. His interpretation of the movements of water birds is genius; his story moving. And the music is Tchaikovsky; what else could you possibly want.
0671646788|4.0|After reading Tim Ferris 4-Hour Work Week, I was moved to action by Tim's comment that Prof Schwartz's Magic of Thinking Big is one of the best books he has ever read. That sealed my decision to buy this book. The book has its heart in the right place but falls short in the practice of the techniques Key takeaways,<br /><br />1. Think +ve outcome, Think I am better than I think and Think big goals - These mechanisms allow you to develop the power of belief.<br />2. Never underestimate your intelligence and overestimate the intelligence of others. Attitudes are more important than intelligence. Focus on those qualities that make you a winner.<br />3. Build Confidence: Action cures fear, pin down your fear and then take action. Practice depositing successful thoughts in your memory not negative ones. Recall +ve experiences during eating/before bed time. Count number of reasons to be happy. Also learn to smile till your teeth show, Speak up and Walk 25% faster.<br />4. Join and meet regularly one Professional Group. Think how an important person would think about the same issue you are thinking about. Model after them.<br />5. Go first class in everything you do.<br />6. Praise is power. Invest the praise you receive from your superior. Pass praise down to boost team's performance. Think what can I do to make my wife and family happy every day. Random special acts go very well. Call people by name.<br />7. Create a list as to why you should like them. Practice liking people until you learn to do so genuinely. Don't expect everyone to score 100% , that leads to disappointments. Don't tell people they are wrong. No person is all good and no person is all bad. The perfect just doesn't exist.<br />8. Tune to Channel P (Positive) and not to your Channel N (negative). Let the other person talk.<br />9. If you don't produce , you don't get where you want to go. One fine way to prevent a war of words is to take a long pause before answering.<br />10. Think of goals across work, home, and social categories. Think of 10 years planning guide. All successful people I personally know seem to do a variation of this one. They have a written version of this and not a hazy picture. Track a 30 day improvement guide for all the improvements you want to make. The Seinfeld technique would be ideal.<br />11. Think like a leader: Trade minds with people you want to influence. Think like a human. Think progress. Take time out to confer with yourself and develop your supreme thinking power.<br /><br />Overall good ideas for its time and enables a solid framework. I would have preferred more ideas around how to implement these things in a more practical manner.<br /><br />Your enraptured in the power of thinking big reader,<br />Fred
B00004I9VE|3.0|Thriller is one of the greatest albums of all time, so rather than review it, I'm going to review this edition... because if you're looking to buy the Super Audio CD, you've already decided that you like the album enough to hunt down the best possible presentation of it.<br /><br />Of all the editions of Thriller, the Super Audio CD is the only one presented in a high-def audio format. It has the benefit of significantly expanded disc space and is sampled at a frequency of 2,822.4 kHz (over 50x that of a regular CD). Unfortunately, as it was mastered in 1999, it's also one of the oldest.<br /><br />Since the Super Audio CD release 10 years ago, many advances have been made in audio mastering and compression. The Super Audio CD is very likely the closest thing we have to the original master tapes at the moment, but it's no longer a night and day jump in quality over the current editions.<br /><br />In comparisons with the original 1990 Red Book CD, the 2001 Special Edition CD, the 2008 25th Anniversary Edition CD and the 2009 Blu-spec CD, the Super Audio CD sounded much clearer and cleaner than all but the 2008 25th Anniversary Edition. All editions shared a night and day jump in quality over the 1990 Red Book CD; and the 25th Anniversary Edition and the Super Audio CD shared a noticeable, but nonetheless subtle improvement over the 2001 Special Edition and the 2009 Blu-spec (which are identical); which leaves the 25th Anniversary Edition and the Super Audio CD as the two to compare.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary Edition appears to have been mastered in such a way that in a blind test between the two, I was unable to determine which was the Super Audio CD and which was the 25th Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />The Super Audio CD is not a surround sound disc. It is stereo-only, and not a hybrid, and while it sounds great, it appears as though in the last ten years, technology has improved to a point where the standard CD 25th Anniversary release was able to catch up. If the Super Audio CD's advanced resolution improves the sound quality of this disc over the current 25th Anniversary Edition, it's subtle to a point of indiscernibility. It should also be noted that because the Super Audio CD is currently out of print, it is difficult to find it at a price comparable to the rest of the editions.<br /><br />Hopefully, Sony will re-master a new Super Audio CD release, or release the album on Blu-ray Audio (which would allow for a complete lossless presentation from the original master tapes). Until then, the best value for both casual and hardcore fans alike is the 25th Anniversary Edition.If the Super Audio CD's advanced resolution improves the sound quality of this disc over the current 25th Anniversary Edition, it's subtle to a point of indiscernibility.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|There are many things to like about Gran Torino. The thing I appreciate most is its authenticity. There is nothing in \\"Gran Torino\\" that makes you stop and say \\"Now wait a minute - it wouldn't happen that way\\". The story takes place in-or-near Detroit - and it is very obvious that it was filmed in the Detroit area.... again everything has a real authentic feal.<br /><br />  The story is a coming-to-age story of a man in his \\"senior\\" years (I know that is a weird way to start an \\"coming-to-age\\" movie). Eastwood's character is recently widowed retired autoworker who is perpetually unhappy in his bigoted ways. Through a series of events he discovers that he has more respect for his new immigrant neighbors than he does for his own kids. I won't go into too many of the details - but nothing feels contrived or forced in terms of the plot development.<br /><br />  \\"Gran Torino\\" is a multi-layered story tale on respect and redemption. The story is very tight and well-written with artistic qualities that are often seen in novels, but rarely in big-budget Hollywood films. While the story is not for everyone (definitely NOT for kids) I think that all of Eastwood's fans will be more than a little satisfied.<br /><br />Final Verdict - \\"Gran Torino\\" is a great movie, and in many ways it the equal of \\"Millionaire Baby\\". While there are a couple of acting weak points (in my opinion the priest was the weakest) the whole story is excellent and highly recommended.<br />5 stars
B001QL35D6|3.0|Thriller is one of the greatest albums of all time, so rather than review it, I'm going to review this edition... because if you're looking to buy the Blu-spec CD, you've already decided that you like the album enough to hunt down the best possible presentation of it.<br /><br />According to Sony the Blu-spec CD format is encoded with a blue laser (used in the making of Blu-ray discs), but can be read by a normal CD player. They claim the blue laser creates more precise pits, causing less distortion in the optical read-out process. However, a direct comparison with this Blu-spec disc and the 2001 Special Edition CD finds the two to be identical in every way.<br /><br />From sound quality to track listing, this disc is no different than if Sony simply took a 2001 Special Edition disc and put it in the Blu-spec case. But then, what were we really expecting? They claim that the process eliminates errors by more precisely encoding the disc, but encoding errors have never really been a problem in professionally produced CDs.<br /><br />If there really is a benefit in the encoding process using blue lasers, then all CDs should be produced in this way, but they should not be sold as a better-sounding alternative to standard CDs.<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that both the 2001 Special Edition CD and the 2009 Blu-Spec CD sound inferior to the 2008 25th Anniversary Edition CD and the 1999 Super Audio CD (which themselves sound comparable).<br /><br />Those looking to the Blu-spec format for the best-sounding edition of Thriller will be disappointed, as it is identical to the 2001 Special Edition disc (which itself is now outdated thanks to the better-sounding release of the 2008 25th Anniversary Edition). Since this is both an import and a limited edition, adding this useless disc to your collection will likely come at a premium that simply isn't worth it.

How much time do we girls sit around and waste waiting for these jerks to call us back or whatever? Too much time, that's what! I guess I am a bit passionate about this because men sometimes can be very trying on a girls' nerves and I thank God that someone wrote a book like this and just told us like it is. It's good stuff to know! Seriously! And for that, I highly recommend it. Also recommend [[ASIN:0767921968 It's Called a Breakup Because It's Broken: The Smart Girl's Break-Up Buddy]].

B001FB55H6|4.0|Let's begin by offering a nutshell summary for those not familiar with this material. This film is an adaptation of the legendary graphic novel \\"Watchmen\\". It was a watershed for the comics industry. It brought existentialism, societal pertinence and a healthy dose of science fiction to a medium that was becoming dull and predictable. This is a \\"what if\\" story that generates an alternate 1980's America in which costumed vigilantes have altered the course of history. What is interesting about this? It's not always for the better.<br /><br />I'll leave the details alone for you to uncover. They're simply too compelling to explain to you in a review, you deserve more. Now on to this film. This movie is both the first and last of its kind. It is the single most loyal adaptation of any comic book/graphic novel that has ever been done (I'm including '300' and 'Sin City' in this). Almost all of the images presented here appear to have been lifted out of the book's original panels. Any additions or changes are so respectful that they might as well have appeared in the book. Fans of the graphic novel will have a field day picking out the dozens of visual easter eggs that allude to memorable details from the graphic novel. This simply hasn't been accomplished on this level in any other comic based film we've ever seen.<br /><br />The action sequences in the film are not quite as loyal. To light some fire under the story, Zak Snyder chose to unleash his unique brand of visceral stop-go violence on the film and it fits here just fine. It does the most justice to the opening scene that depicts the assasination of the 'Comedian'. It is operatically set to Nat King Cole's 'Unforgettable' as if to say; \\"we love you Watchmen\\". A warning though, some of the violence is excessive at points and may disturb the weak of stomach. So heads up.<br /><br />For those who saw this in the theater, the director's cut adds 24 minutes to your original experience. Mostly, it's a little more here, little more there. But there is the wonderful addition of Hollis Mason's death. That addition alone is worth picking up the extended cut. In the book, it's made out to be a tragic ending for a sweet old man. Here though, Hollis is given a wonderful chance to re-live the golden days and bust the heads of all the bad guys he's fought in his career one last time. It's visually intriguing and, even though it ends badly, it will put a smile on your face for the lovable ex-hero.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray itself contains 3 additonal videos that praise the original book, look back on the history of vigilantes in the U.S. and examine the science-fiction presented in the story. They're fun supplemental add-ons to the film that enrich the experience. Then there's the \\"Mega Movie Mode\\" where Zak Snyder explains the movie to you as it plays. I haven't personally checked that out, but it sounds like a cool way to get insight on the film's creation. Overall, strong set of bonus features here.<br /><br />This has gone on longer than I intended, so let's rap this up. This is a unique film that provides a gorgeous interpretation of what Time Magazine called one of the 100 best novels of all time. It's loyal, intense, violent and surprisingly thought provoking (another element preserved from the graphic novel). So why did I call it the first and last of its kind? Sadly, the film did not achieve great mainstream success, grossing just barely over $100 million. Maybe it's the deconstructivist themes, the violence or its lack of commonly recognized characters (i.e. batman), but one thing's for certain, it never will. Films like this one don't ring out as popular masterpieces. They find an audience that loves them and they stay near and dear to the heart. If you're a fan of the book or someone who's willing to experience something radically different from your typical cinema experience give it a shot. Otherwise, this wasn't meant for you.ere is the wonderful addition of Hollis Mason's death. That addition alone is worth picking up the extended cut.

B001FB55H6|5.0|Having never heard of the Watchmen before I must say I was skeptical. After a long run of Marvel Comic based movies and the resurection of Batman via D.C. Comics I was confused by all of the hype revolving around this movie while never reconizing any of it's characters.     Wanting to find out for myself I bought the Blu-ray version and gave it a shot. All I can say is WOW.    The Blue-ray looks stunning. Remarkable scenes and pure eye candy as are with most comic book movies released on blue-ray. But the story and it's hcaracters were fresh, original, and not at all for children. The story in a way is a basic superhero type storyline. A band groups together to stop what seems like a sinister plot. But this is not your typical superhero movie. The charaters are terribly flawed which is brought out wonderfuly by developing each character and it's dark past. When I say dark I mean murdering, rapeing, and even darker secrets that are revealed slowly though the movie. They are haunting yet at the same time show that even surehero's are not perfect (some far from it). Only one character even has superpowers. The rest are all just people. People who try to do right even if sometimes what seems right is actually wrong. There is a moral battle throughout the movie that constatly keeps you on the edge.    Even the ending is not what you would expect. I wont give it away, but the typical superhero 'evil is punished in the end' storybook ending does not exist here. Be prepared to be thrown off.    As for the Blu-ray quality all I can say is that the visuals look amazing. If your someone who has a Blu-ray player bit is leery about which movies to buy because of the price, all i can say is that this is one that yuo wont regret buying. A cool extra is included as well which mixes directors commentary along with actauly showing as the movie plays how some of the scenes were shot, along with comic book and stryboeard comparisons, and a timeline showing how the world of the Watchmendiffers with the history of our world.    A must for Blu-ray enthusiast.
0307588335|3.0|The author was a low to mid level employee at Lehman, working on a debt trading desk, trading in convertibles and distressed debt. He worked there for about 4 years, from 2004 - 08, being the protege of a very successful debt trader there  - how they meet each other on Cape Cod was a funny story.    The debt traders have a good feel for credit quality issues, that being the main focus of their job, and they realize in 2005 that the housing market is \\"all 'roided up\\" in a memorable phrase.  They realize that companies focused on that market are likely to lose value and they quickly realize that they are employed by one very large such company.  That would be the dramatic tension, but since we know the ending, it is just pathetic.  The debt traders try to convince the top management,but top management is focused only on quarterly profits and demands growth and nothing but growth.  The traders valiantly try to make enough money shorting housing related securities to make up for the overexposure to real estate elsewhere in the company, but their efforts are for naught. Lehman's debt grows to be 44 times its equity, even while it is reporting profits.  Many of the traders and analysts realize that disaster is inevitable and leave, or are canned.  The author is canned a few months before the collapse.  Nonetheless, he reports on the events over those months, seeming to have a source from outside of the debt trading group, who was deeply involved in the goings-on.  However, the book does not give any sources.      That is one of the book's sloppinesses.  There are a lot of mistakes in here - bondholders don't have the power to hire and fire officers or directors of companies, and most leveraged buyouts are not hostile takeovers, to give you a sense of the mistakes he makes.     The author vigorously castigates the top executives throughout the book. I am sure his views reflect the views of many other Lehman employees.  They lost a lot of money in the collapse - as the author points out, half of everybody's annual bonus (which is 80% plus of their compensation) was required to be invested in company stock, which has to be held for 5 years and of course   became worthless. Those golden handcuffs may explain why not everyone left, I don't know.    The language of the book is as \\"all 'roided up\\" as the housing market.  The coauthor assisted on \\"Lone Survivor,\\" so I guess he specializes in helping young men write about big catastrophes.  The tone of both books is the same, lots of very strong and extreme statements, often of a right wing nature.  I wondered to what extent some of the events might have been embellished for marketing purposes.  I particularly felt this when the narrator goes to visit the New Century financial offices in California and during the departure of the author's mentor - the stories just seem over the top.    Although it is not the main focus of the book, the book does provide a good depiction of life in a big Wall Street trading environment and for anyone who wants to get a feel for it, this book does the job. There are some great depictions of the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat from making a big bet, on strong analysis, and seeing what market currents do with your big bet.  One of the things I learned, which was news to me, was that, to get a $1 million bonus, you have to make at least $20 million for the firm. That 5% ratio strikes me as very fair and offsets a lot of the media hype about Wall Street bonuses that I have been hearing the past year or two.    At the start of the book, the author identifies two causes of the financial crisis that took place during the Clinton administration.  He never explains the connections that might support his opinions.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about getting these triggers.  Would they be bulky?  Would they pop on and off with ease?  Would they even help?  After a week or so of use, I can say that I am worry-free.    First off, when you clip them on they are on tight.  There is no wiggling or looseness to be felt.  The triggers have a very snug fit, and will stay on with the hardest of presses.  However, that's not to say that you can't get them off of the controller.  In fact, removal is very simple.  I haven't had any problems taking them off and putting them back on.  Very simple.    The best thing about these triggers (in my opinion) is the fact that it reduces the amount of force needed to press in the triggers.  You'll find that with the RealTriggers attached it takes a quick pull and the trigger is pushed all the way in.  It was never \\"hard\\" to use the triggers before, but the added speed that you gain is a nice plus.    One last thing I will mention is that they do not prevent the triggers from being pushed all the way down.  There is no impeding plastic that disrupts the use of the controller's triggers.    I got a pair of these at my local Best Buy for $5, so if you don't plan on spending $25 here anytime soon (for the free shipping) then I'd suggest giving that a shot.  I would imagine that these add-ons are not for everyone, but I think they're worth a shot.  It takes a while to adjust to them, but in the end they work great.

B001FBIPF0|5.0|I'm confused at the other reviews stating that there's nothing new on this album.  It's much different than other Fall Out Boy music. After making the same album (TTTYG) two more times (FUTCT, IOH), Fall Out Boy finally makes something different. Folie A Deux explores different ranges of emotion, is immensely personal, and a lot more fun. Folie A Deux basically means \\"shared delusion,\\" which is alludes to Pete and Patrick: Pete writes the lyrics and Patrick writes the music and sings, and he sings passionately words that aren't about him.  I'm happy Fall Out Boy did not try to write Take This To Your Grave again and instead came out with something much different, and much better.
0307588335|2.0|This book was quite the disappointment. It is less about the fall of Lehman than it is about the author's personal life.  The author himself, as others have noted, was not at Lehman at the time of the bankruptcy, having been dismissed in an earlier round of layoffs a few months prior.  The author himself did not have access to Dick Fuld, his inner circle or even a particularly broad range of senior managers.  As such I am not sure it really says anything that hasn't been written in the major newspapers.    To those who have read books on the collapse of Bear Stearns, such as the academically researched book, House of Cards or the journalistic approach of Street Fighters this books will seem like a thin and poorly written memoir.

0375758992|5.0|For the average American, nothing could be more alien than the idea of growing up as a young girl in colonial and post-colonial Africa. But Alexandra Fuller does a wonderful job making us right at home as we follow her family's peregrinations in southern Africa as they seem to be constantly on the move. The beauty of her prose and evident affection for Africa illuminate every page. And of course the tragic events of her childhood are sensitively rendered even if she has a subversive humorous streak that pops up in surprising places - quite cheeky, this one!
159562015X|1.0|The Success of the Movement to preserve our environment has been a very long hard series of small decisions that we all make as consumers one purchase at a time. This is an easy-win, to say \\"no\\" to this book. The book can not be recycled. It is a ONE TIME USE ONLY. It is a very expensive one time use as far as books go. I contacted the customer service at the web site for this book. They WILL NOT Issue a new ID number for any subsequent users of this book. They could if they wanted to. But they do not. I even recommend an environmental tax on books like this to discourage publication of others like it. Books should have acid free paper and a shelf life of 250 years, and be in quality bindings, and be functionally usable by many readers for many generations. Otherwise they should just be E-Books that are Kindle only. Public policies like that will shake out the book market in a hurry.<br />Until then, Be a Green consumer and boycott junk books like this.
B001FB55H6|2.0|I had really big expectations for this movie. I'm a huge sci-fi / fantasy buff, serenity, buckaroo banzai, sin city, lotr, you name it. Love em. Some camp or poor effects but a great story? I can easily handle that, but this movie...was awful. It's far to long, the back stories are painfully boring for the most part, the thrown in for no reason sex scenes were gratuitous the action scenes were bland. It was just bad. The really sad part is the actual underlying story if done well has huge potential, but someone obviously worked very very hard to make this movie awful. It would be a toss up between having a tooth pulled or being forced to watch this again.

While there, she meets and befriended Selena Dawes.<br /><br />Selena Dawes is a medium, incarcerated for murder. All the rage during Victorian England was holding seances. During one of said seances, Selena's sponsor (they say patron) dies. She was ... scared to death. Selena denies any wrong-doings and attributed the death to a very naughty spirit, Peter Quick.<br /><br />Margaret was at first skeptical. Strange things started to happen. Items would mysteriously dissappear while other items appear to and from Margaret's residence and the prison. During the many visits and hearing Selena's tale, Margaret came to trust, believe, and falls in love with Selena. Selena claims to reciprocate the feeling.<br /><br />We discover from Margaret's journal that the feelings she has, the way she thinks, and how she wants to live her life, that she is a lesbian. Of course Margaret didn't know what it was called or who she really was because of the stigma of one with \\"unnatural fansies\\" during 17th century England. Margaret had a really close friend, Helen. It was only suggested that they were really close and that there really weren't any physical romances between them, however, the emotional love was there. Helen couldn't bear the idea of being different, hence, she married. She married Margaret's brother.<br /><br />So, finding and meeting Selena, Margaret felt alive again and fell heads-over-heels.

B000ZEE3I6|5.0|You get your money's worth with the new Harry Potter.  We went to the 7:15 show and didn't get out till 10:05.  Well, we sat through 11 previews for films the theater owners must think will appeal to the Harry Potter crowd, but all of them look pretty crummy.  How bad does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs look!  And what about that movie where the kid goes into the elevator of the Empire State Building at night and the whole elevator cab trembles with white light all the way up?  It looks like Harry Potter USA!  So naturally when the real thing came on it looked even better than it is, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />In short it was great.  I have a few nit picks because, well, I didn't reed the books and couldn't figure out half the stuff that was going on.  Luckily we went with a friend and could text back and forth saying, \\"Mark, who is that woman with the crazy black hair?\\" (Helena Bonham Carter) and \\"How about the woman with the white hair?\\" (Narcissa, her sister.)  That didn't take us much further.  I have seen the previous 5 movies but I sort of forgot, and when David Thewlis made his appearance at the Burrow I had completely lost trach of who Remus was.  Why didn't they leave him out, he certainly didn't add much to this one, and as for his wife, the poor actress who played her must have eagerly grabbed the script then screamed in despair when she found out she was only going to say one thing and wear one ugly outfit!  As for the family that adopted Harry, they probably were screaming even louder when they realized they had been cut out of the entire movie!<br /><br />I liked Daniel Radcliffe, who has really grown as an actor, Rupert Grint not so much, but he was OK, but if possible Emma Watson has regressed!  Gone backwards!  Scene after scene left her defenseless, unable to organize even the semblance of a performance.  She's not even as pretty as she used to be.  Oh well, she's still great, but Luna and Lavender trample all over her acting wise.  The adults are just going through their paces.  A few times it looked like Dumbledore was catching forty winks, while talking.  Best performance, the zombie skeleton creatures who swim up out of a lagoon and snatch humans.  Afterwards we agreed it was some sort of allegory about people who are too needy.going through their paces.  A few times it looked like Dumbledore was catching forty winks, while talking.

B0026UV77C|3.0|When Placebo originally came out, they were a pretty straightforward glam rock with some punk influences that knew how to slow things down.  I loved their diverse tracks- at once pretty pop-punk (38 Degrees and Special K) then flat-out grit your teeth rockers (Without You I'm Nothing).  Sleeping With Ghosts seemed to signal them wanting to be treated more seriously, and they put out a solid album.  Unfortunately since then, they've gotten more serious and become more interested in putting out rock epics and less in their roots.  Meds has its moments, but Battle for the Sun doesn't seem to get there.  I've listened to this quite a bit, and the songs don't seem to differentiate themselves from each other.  I'm trying to think of tracks that really stand out, but I can't.  In the past they were able to change tempos and quiet things down, but this album doesn't do that at all, and it comes out as them trying to sound like Muse.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|I already owned the Super bit version of the film. I watched the Blu disc version a day after looking at the Super Bit disc. There is a definite improvement in picture quality, as you would expect from the BD. However, I wasn't impressed with the sound; I had to crank up the volume really high to hear the audio. Other than that, the BD version is the best, to date. I would recommend the Blu-Ray disc.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I found the book very difficult to put down and inspirational.  It is a very light read with spots obviously dramatized for effect.  It provides a very interesting alternate view of running, but lacks some depth.  At times it can be superficial and the people involved are one-dimensional.  In terms of inspiration, I didn't find it quite as awe-inspiring as Dean Karnazes' Ultramarathon Man, but it did have one effect on me that his book did not....it has inspired me to try running again after frustrations being injured led me to cycling.  Only this time, I will try it barefoot!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Didn't hear much buzz about this while it was in theaters and had no interest in seeing it because I misread it as a touchy-feely racial harmony film. I was completely wrong. This is a great movie, a classic, in so many ways. It was 100% the opposite of what I expected. I wouldn't have minded if it were 5 hours long thats how much I enjoyed it.

B0024F08RO|2.0|I can't figure out why some reviewers can't make a difference between season 4 and the 3 previous ones... Frankly, all i found here was a poor scenario with predictable hooks and mellow love scenes. As a previous reviewer stated, stop at season 3 and u'll be fine!
0061231401|3.0|Ok so I normally love James Rollins Book alot ( even though they do carry a theme : world disaster and then really smart mensa type persons swoop in to save the day) and i enjoyed reading Doomsday Key as i did all the recent ones i read: Amazonia, map of Bones & the Last Oracle. However what i did not appreciate about this book is the Harlequinn romance angle, if i want to read that type of thing , i know where to look , i just dont appreciate it in a James Rollins book , i am not saying there can be nothing romantic ... like Monk and Kat , or Painter and Lisa , i just thought it went to far with Gray,Rachel and Siechan and therefore took up necessary ink space.<br />I do admit once i started to read this book , i literally couldn't let go but then again thats how its is with all the James Rollins i have read recently.

0140449337|5.0|What makes Meditations an important book is that it provides the opportunity to discuss what it is to be human, to have a soul, to live a good life with one of the most remarkable men in history.  Before I get to that I want to second a suggestion made by several reviewers. Use two or more translations when you read the Meditations. I like this Penguin Classics edition. The introduction by Diskin Clay is useful, the translation by Martin Hammond is mostly accurate and his explanatory notes are very useful. There are some solid suggestions for further reading and several useful indices (of Names, of Quotations, and a General Index).  My one qualm about the translation is that Hammond sometimes makes the book sound a little Christian. Hammond will use \\"sin\\" where other translators (like Farquharson or Frances Hutchinson) would use \\"impiety\\" or \\"harm\\". This is decidedly not a Christian text. There is nothing in Marcus Aurelius (MA) of final judgment. There is no reward or punishment for our actions in this life. MA suspends judgments on all sorts of issues. It is clear that he believes in gods and occasionally talks about God (see 12.2). But he also mentions many times the alternative belief that all is chance and that death will be followed by oblivion. It is essential to his ethics however that death is not followed by any sort of hell.  Also worth thinking about is whether MA is a man whose philosophy is to be rejected (or, at least, radically modified) because it ultimately makes one less human. With MA, everything is to be thought through with the corrosive that is  reason. We must not let our attachments cause us to lose sight of the truth.  We may kiss our children good night but we must remind ourselves as we are doing so that they could be dead tomorrow (11.34 in Meditations- this bit of choice advice came from Epictetus)!  One point about this is that there is a real conflict in MA with his idea that we should accept everything that the gods see fit to visitupon us (an idea expressed too many times to quote a single source) and his desire to not be effected by any of it. I would argue that true acceptance does not seek invulnerability. True confront embraces vulnerability and fully accepts the whole of our humanity. We have a choice about how we respond to our suffering. MA, at his best, is saying that and pointing out that we can not let our suffering control our actions. At his worst, he sometimes seems to be saying that we can chose not to feel our suffering. He is such a compelling writer that I think it is all too easy to read MA in a way that avoids how radical are some of his ideas.  The desire of MA for some sort of emotional invulnerability is part and parcel of his rejection of quotidian experience. He does not seem to have liked or admired many of his contemporaries and he does not seem fond of the simple pleasures of life. His descriptions of sexuality are always mingled with tones of disgust.  Where the Meditations may be most useful is when we are dealing with some sort of very extreme situation. There are two Naval Academy essays by John Stockdale about how he survived his imprisonment during the Vietnam War using the philosophy of Epictetus that delve into the full complexity of that philosophy. (These essays are referenced in the intro to the Penguin edition  of Epictetus' writings. You can use the Amazon preview of that book to see the reference.)  Does all this mean that I think you should not immediately run out and buy a copy of this book? NO, NO, a thousand times, NO. The Meditations is one of those few books that everyone should read for help in working out their own philosophy. We all have to come to grips with how we want to live our own lives, what values we want to honor and MA is one of the writers who will help you work that out. He belongs in the company of St. Augustine, of Montaigne, of Machiavelli, of Plato, and of the Buddha (among many others- this list is mine own).   So, yes, read MA in the Hammond translation by all means. Remember that he wrote this book so that he would have constant and personal reminders to live up to his own philosophy. By reading this book, you may come to some understanding of what it would be like to live up to your own philosophy.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this book.  It is one of those books that leaves you thinking about it and the characters long after you finish reading.  All of the characters are so well-developed and alive that you can easily empathize with them.  It was a touching and wonderful read.  I highly recommend it.
B001CQ67Z8|5.0|I love this album! I've heard Immediate Music's stuff for awhile now and have always been so hugely disappointed that I could not purchase the music. So as a quick shout out to Immediate Music: Thank you so much for releasing this!!    If you have ever been completely blown away by a movie trailer, not necessarily because you want to see the movie but because of the epic music you heard that played on your emotions, then I highly recommend you purchase this album. The music is so amazingly beautiful. My favorite song has to be \\"Serenata Immortale.\\" It is simply so gorgeous. There are just no words to describe the incredible power of this music. If you love epic scores from movies, then you are going to love this album.    I'm crossing my fingers for a Trailerhead 2, but it was great of Immediate Music to share this with the public just once. Now if X-Ray Dog could be persuaded to do the same...well then I would be in seventh heaven!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|My family and I enjoy this sitcom every week. If your not careful you might learn some science and physics facts on each episode.  I've enjoyed watching the characters as they have developed and grown over the last two years, can't wait for the next season. Will be ordering the 2nd season-the humor does not grow old.  Each character is unique-just can't fiqure out how they can do the technical dialog and keep strait faces-when we watch it out laughter does not stop.  Writers keep up the excellent quality.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I just love this album.  It's beautiful and amazing and just so colorful.    I can't get enough of this artist and this music.  Florence and the Machine are just phenomenal!
0061537969|3.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" was a very interesting read.  I wouldn't go as far as saying it was \\"entertaining\\", though I did find myself laughing outloud sometimes, but I would feel comfortable saying it was interesting.<br /><br />It is told from the eyes of a dog.  He is a very well-loved dog, and recalls things from his childhood, as well as things that he witnesses while growing older amongst a very tight-knit family of humans.  The dog believes that he is going to die and come back as a human some day, and therefore must read into the human mind and actions as much as he can, so as to come back and be able to find his owners again- to be amongst them as a fellow human being.<br /><br />There were parts that I hated- like the zebra thing.  It was so contrived and seemed to be grasping (it was explained later on in the story and that made it \\"okay\\", but when I first read that part, I almost put the book down to give up)  For those of you who have not read \\"...Racing in the Rain\\", I'd suggest you hold onto the book even after that \\"zebra\\" part-  when you start reading, you'll understand what I'm talking about.  The book gets better.<br /><br />If you liked stories like \\"Marley and Me\\", then you'll probably like this one too.  You have to be a lover of dogs- and possibly consider your pet a \\"member of your family\\"- like I do.  haha.<br /><br />This book also has many many references and descriptions about race car driving.  Though I don't know much about racing cars, I was able to follow the story and \\"get\\" the mirroring world that Stein was trying to show.<br /><br />It's a good read.
0679411585|4.0|This is a difficult book to rate and I'd prefer not to assign a star rating for that reason.  It's a good, although confusing, recitation of individual recollections of the minute by minute events of intense fighting,  As a book on \\"what is an intense firefight like?\\" it rates five stars.  If the reader has ever boxed, he knows how long a three minute round really is - it can be three days.  These men fought one of the most intensive battles in the history of the army for four straight days without break,  The horrendous casualties resulted from the same problem faced with a suicide bomber - when 400 men with automatic rifles who are more than willing to die charge you by surprise, you're not going to be able to kill them all before some get to you.  And then, 400 or 500 more show up as an additional surprise.  The first problem was, it was all a surprise and shouldn't have been. So - a question - it's implied at the very end of the book with a quote from Clausewitz - why was this ill fated assault made and what was it's intended result?  Why were so many of our yong men put into such a killing zone intentionally without having any idea of what to expect?  The only real answer is that the commanders were frustrated with finding no game in other areas and hoped to find some enemy in this one to kill.      But.  But after reading a couple of chapters, read the end.  Read about the effect of the deaths on the loved ones - the young mothers, the parents - they are cast in the book as the brave, loyal survivors of their killed husbands and sons and the victims of a heartless or incompetent army notification system.  Now return to read the rest of the battle.  And read carefully the beginning of the march to LZ Albany.  Read that part twice.  And then read to the end so you know what happened and you know how many men were killed in the first hour.  So you know what chance they had to even return fire.  So you see not just the normal chaos of a firefight but the absoluteloss of any meaningful initial response - total tactical surprise by the NVA.    Ask yourself - and it is NOT simple 20-20 hindsight - what you would have done as the battalion commander BEFORE turning left toward Albany.  When you saw the high elephant grass and knew without any reasonable doubt there are NVA in the area.  What would you do when you saw your men were about to enter an area where, if they were attacked, they would not be able to see much farther than an outstretched arm.  Napoleon said, \\"a commander, three times a day should look around him and ask these questions, 'if I am attacked from the front, what will I do?  from the flank?  From the rear?\\"  This battalion commander asked none of those questions - it was, he concluded, a \\"walk in the sun\\"  What could he have done?  He could have called the air force and burned the place flat with napalm or, at least burned enough to have clear fields of fire if he were to be attacked.  He could have called the A-1s with their \\"daisy cutters\\" huge bombs used to create instant landing zones in jungles of trees - a coule of them likely would have cleared a very large area of grass.  Or \\"carpet bomb\\" with smaller bombs to clear a route,  He could have used artillery to fire into the high grass and flush or kill whatever might have been in there.  He could have set up heavy machine guns to place grazing fire along the flanks and outward to protect the flanks as he moved.  He could have done many things if he had been thinking of the tactical situation rather than simply concluding it was a \\"walk in the sun.\\"  Then the question becomes, what makes you think any of that would have worked?  But that's not the important question,  The important question is, \\"if you thought of those things and concluded they wouldn't work, why did you decide to go anyway - without even trying them?  Why did you expose your men to the huge risk of the unknown?\\"  It's not like they shouldn't have expected surprise - they'd been greatly surprised by being attacked by a force many times their size from an area they apparently didn't suspect just two days earlier.  You would think, if for no other reason than fear that their might be more of the bastards waiting out there, they'd have been at least a little cautious.    Better of course would have been to wonder why they should be walking after fighting so long.  They were helicopter troops - where were the helicopters to fly the back to Pleiku?  The answer would be, no time - the B52s are coming.  To which the battalion commander should have said, tell them to turn around and go have some more coffee.  We are not going to march out of here - we're going to fly out of here so get the choppers going.  Disobedience?  Maybe.  But I did it once and had it done to me once.  Both times it prompted a discussion and a change of mind and plan.  Commanders get tired too and don't always come up with perfect answers to problems that pop up quickly,  In this case, the problem wasn't properly identified and the order should have been challenged.    And that is why those young men died.  Not because of failed political decisions or a president and secretary of defense who were lying to the public while taking us down a trail to nowhere other than 58,000 good young men being killed.  And tens of thousands badly wounded.  The young men of the Ia Drang Battle died and were wounded because their leaders at the highest local level failed to recognize the tactical situation for what it was and failed to take the appropriate steps to minimize the danger and the ultimate result.  It it's a river crossing, they'd look for a ford instead of telling the troops to simply jump in and hope it's not too deep,  If it's a bridge crossing, they'll look for mines.  How in the world could it not have been thought that there would be NVA hiding in the high grass?  How could the battalion commander remove leadership at the company level by calling all the company commanders away from their companies to a meeting in that situation?  How could he possibly think it was a \\"walk in the sun.\\"      I understand why the book was written as it was - it's not in the current vogue to say anything derogatory about the soldier.  Especially not when the author is the chief soldier involved.  And I intend no slight of the individual soldiers in this fight.  They are justly described as heroes to be admired greatly by any fighting man.  But it outrages me that we STILL haven't learned the lessons of Vietnam - that tactical commanders are just as responsible for their men as the commander in chief or the secretary of defense.  A competent commander does not put men in harms way without careful thought and planning.  A competent commander does not go hunting in a place like xray hoping serendipity will favor him with a large body count without considering there might be more there than he reckoned on,  And a competent commander certainly does not cross a tactical terrain feature as was done on the way to Albany that spells certain death if the enemy is concealed in it in force.   What does that mean today?  What this book - and, certainly, the after action report - should have made clear - commanders should not load troops into humvees and trucks and parade or patrol on streets in Iraq for no purpose other than a show of force.  Period.  That commanders should not send a helicopter to land on a building in Somalia supposing the idea to enter a building full of hostiles to capture a few of those hostiles and take them to the roof to take them away in a helicopter is going to be a \\"flight in the sun.\\" It shouldn't even be considered without a plan for what to do if a helicopter is shot down or without a way to get reinforcements in by ground very quickly or without a way to evacuate wounded very quickly.  Competent commanders should not plan to invade Iraq from the south with 72 ton tanks without knowing the ground on either side of the road won't support the tanks so they are constrained to the road.  Commanders should not assume that where the soldiers are going in force will meet people who love them and won't shoot at them from buildings.  Presidents make those assumptions but commanders are in charge of the young men charged with carrying the \\"plans\\" out,  And those commanders MUST challenge orders they see clearly are invitations to disaster.  If they don't they are as guilty as the civilians they now accuse of tying their hands behind their backs and not letting them fight the war as it should have been fought.  In brief, competent commanders should learn from the enemy that arrogance born of having high tech weapons of war and well trained soldiers does not convert a high risk situation into a sure win.  And, if the commander concludes it's not a \\"sure win\\" then he'd better plan for everything conceivable that could cause a disaster.  He should never plan based on the guess nothing will be there to ruin his men's \\"walk in the sun.\\"
B000002513|5.0|I've always loved this album but hadn't listened to it for some time. My son is getting interested in Bruce (thankfully) and I put it on for him. It is awe-inspiring stuff! This album is not talked about like Born To Run, Darkness, The River, Born In The USA etc but it is undoubtably a masterpiece and one of his very best. The quality of the songs musically and lyrically) and the arrangements (listen to the intricate rhythms and time changes that form Kitty's Back). He was criticised at the time for being over-romantic with his street imagery but when you listen now it's just brilliant stuff. Some people really need to get out more. The passion is so powerful you can touch it! Buy this put 'Rosalita' on and turn up the volume! You'll never be the same again.
B00000018N|5.0|It's a pity the gold DCC CD isn't in print any longer because it is the definitive presentation of the \\"Aqualung\\" on CD. This review is for that version. Steve Hoffman went back to the original master tape for this edition. Unlike the version remastered by Peter Mew the year before, this edition doesn't have any noise reduction applied or any odd EQ choices. \\"Aqualung\\" sounds better here than in any other format I've heard the album.<br /><br />Yes,this is the version that Hoffman sliced the mastertape for but there was a reason for this. Evidently someone damaged the mastertape during play back (perhaps it happened during the transfer for Mew's sessions no one knows)which required Hoffman to slide a section out, take a copy of the flat transfer CD, copy it and and then splice it in for the damaged section. He made his transfer then edited the damaged section back in so it could be returned to England. Amazingly Hoffman did such a great job on putting this together that no one could honestly tell.<br /><br />The only drawback is the cost for the CD itself but if you're a fan of Jethro Tull and this album in particular, this is the version you need to buy. If it isn't available I would opt for the second U.S. pressing or UK versions of the album simply because they are flat transfers and use a better source tape than the first regular CD pressing.<br /><br />The album and songs speak for themselves. Ian Anderson has gone on record as stating that he doesn't feel this is the band's seminal album and he could be right but the album connected with so many fans and radio in a way that previous Tull albums had not.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0061231401|2.0|[This review is for the audible.com edition]<br />Sigh.<br /><br />Well, the plot sounded interesting. The description online at audible.com sounded good. But, alas, was it good? Not so much.<br /><br />In reality, the plot is convoluted, the narration dry and boring. I find myself day dreaming during the reading, then snap back to the book and found I must have missed something, because 30 minutes have gone by and I have no idea what just happened.<br /><br />Ultimately, not worth the time to finish. I'm halfway thru and probably will not finish it, which is sad. I hate leaving books in the middle, and I almost never do.

Sure, somebody would buy it for me but I'd flinch knowing they'd spent way too much money.  I'll wait and see if the price drops - maybe by Christmas.  I'll still own the set someday but right now I just don't see enough 'value-add' in the set to justify the price.

B00001OH7G|5.0|Some people might think that Rory's best live album is Live In Europe...at least, as far as I know, it was a bigger seller back in the day than Irish Tour. But even though Live in Europe is indeed a great album, Irish Tour has it beat, hands down!! Every song is a winner, and the band is just INTENSE throughout! It doesn't hurt that some of the tracks are played to a live music-starved Belfast crowd, whose incredible enthusiasm and response undoubtedly inspired the band even more! \\"Going To My Hometown\\" is a rather simple, countryish tune, but the infectious \\"(Clap)...(clap)...(clap)-(clap)-(clap)!\\" contributed by the delighted crowd makes it one of the most enjoyable tracks on the album! Lou Martin's ripping keyboard riffs fill up the sound more than the 3-piece band on the Europe album.    Not only was Rory a great guitar player, but an awesome songwriter as well! Cradle Rock, A Million Miles Away, Walk on Hot Coals....smokin' songs!! His guitar playing isn't very flashy, but every note is played with power, conviction and true blues feeling. A master slide player, by the way. Not the greatest singer ever, but a unique, recognizable voice delivered with feeling and sincerity.    In his book \\"Riding Shotgun,\\" Gallagher bassist Gerry McAvoy opined that Wilgar Campbell (the drummer on Live in Europe) was a better drummer than Rod D'ath. Gerry, loved your book, but sir, I respectfully disagree on that point, at least based on what I've heard (you've obviously heard more). Rod's playing on the Irish Tour album is incredible! Highly underrated drummer who was apparently lost in the shadows of the limelight of Keith Moon and John Bonham back then.    In addition to this indispensable CD, I also highly recommend the DVD of this concert. On the DVD, the sound is inconsistent in quality from track to track, and the editing is sloppy, but to see footage of Rory and this great band in top form back in their heyday by far overcompensates for any technical shortcomings of the DVD. The interviews and backstage footage are also a fascinating glimpse of the history of this great band! Even the commentary by Gerry McAvoy and Donal Gallagher is interesting! I own about 400 DVD's, so Gerry McAvoy should be proud to know that his and Donal's commentary is the only commentary that I have ever listened through on a DVD! :-)

B001K3JF7K|2.0|This is a disappointing effort from Diana Krall. The selection of songs is good, but something's amiss with her voice. It's hard to believe that she would have recorded a CD with a cold or laryngitis, but that's how it sounds. Her voice is strained, listless, and at times off key. Hopefully this is a temporary condition.

But how to explain this global success after having finished what I found to be a fascinating novel when I am not at heart a great lover of \\"whodunnit\\" fiction?<br /><br />Well firstly the book has a great plot - a murder that may or may not have been committed 40 years ago - that is literally peeled away over its 500 plus pages in bridging the long intervening history and addressing that question.<br /><br />Secondly, by being based in modern Swedish society whose politics, social morals, religion, family attitudes and business culture pervade the novel, removes it stylistically from an environment that many other European and American readers would more readily relate to.<br /><br />Thirdly (and probably most critical when mixed with the second) the author's own experience as a journalist Swedish style (as reflected in the key character Blomkvist in the book) plus his expert knowledge of right wing movements make this a very unique angled story, especially its coverage of financial investigative reporting.<br /><br />Finally, add in a counter heroine (Salander) who in almost adult comic book style from an unhappy childhood with an autistic mind and punk rock type attitudes applies her innate skills at IT (in many sections the book comes across as a homage to Apple laptops!) and computer hacking, and so ends up acting as a dysfunctional \\"Robin\\" to the hero's moralistic Batman.<br /><br />Sweden the land of free thinking, freedom of information and enlightened sexual mores in conflict with its religious history and business economy built on several dominant successful family dynasties is what overall gives this well told story its real edge and could probably only be told best in such a Scandinavian setting.<br /><br />While the last 100 pages of this volume have a feel of trying to tie up every loose end created earlier in the story and suffer in part from moving some of the action outside Sweden, this book will I feel stand alone well whatever the quality of the next two books.<br /><br />It will however be interesting to see if the two lead characters teamed initially in this first story (Blomkvist and Salander) can sustain the chemistry and impetus of their relationship for the next two volumes in the trilogy produced by the author before his death.ave a feel of trying to tie up every loose end created earlier in the story and suffer in part from moving some of the action outside Sweden, this book will I feel stand alone well whatever the quality of the next two books.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|For me this is one of the most clever and funny films I'v seen in many years. For all it's cartoonist qualities there are still many touching scenes with emotional depth. I'v shown this film to many friends, and during viewing once they \\"get it\\" where this film is coming from it's fun to watch them giggle, guffaw and bust out in laughter. It's very \\"Chinese\\" and universal at the same time. Watch it!
B000ZEE3I6|2.0|My son and I went to see this movie yesterday.  I was so looking forward to it and after watching it I was very disappointed.  They took one of the smaller aspects of the book and focused on it.  The first three chapters of the book were not even in the movie!  I don't know what they were thinking!  The Harry Potter movies started going downhill with the Order of the Phoenix, although that one still wasn't too bad!  HP and the Half Blood Prince was just plain boring.  The movie is 1 hr. 53 minutes long and felt like 4 hours!  What happened to the action? And by the way what happend to the great musical score they had through the first four movies?  Why would they change or eliminate the theme song? The only redeeming factor was the acting was still very good which is why I gave it 2 stars.  They sure missed the mark with this movie.     Makes me wonder what the final two movies will be like.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|Fans of Justin Timberlake won't be disappointed with this superb performance live from Madison Square Garden in New York. A brief interview with Justin and his band starts the show, transitioning into the title track (Futuresex/Love sound.) Mr Timberlake, dressed in his signature suit, a funky hat and white running shoes looks fantastic and this is a fun, very sexy show in which all of his major hits are covered. Sporting a cheeky grin throughout, JT flirts with the camera, grooving and moving around a huge stage. Taking full advantage of his hot and occasionally half dressed backup dancers, talented singers and musicians. There's no lip syncing here.<br /><br />My favourite track would have to be the 10 minute long (What goes around...) Opening with Justin on piano, this transforms into a climax of electric guitars, drums and lights. We are also treated to groovy ballads (Summer Love) and the gospel-like (Losing my way.) After an intermission things slow down for 3 different N-Sync medleys (Gone, Take it from here and Last night) before cranking up again on (Cry me a river) and the funky (Lovestoned.) Timbaland, the well known producer, songwriter joins Justin on stage for (Chop me up) and a great version of (Sexyback.)Although remaining true to the originals many of these songs have been re-mixed for the show and I liked these new versions.<br /><br />Technically speaking this is a great release. The sound is perfect and the picture quality flawless. The stage has been set up in-the-round which gives Mr Timberlake plenty of room to move, showcasing his band and sexy back-up dancers. A bonus 90 minute second disk has been included which features; The making of Futuresex/Loveshow, additional backstage footage, a bonus video track (Lovestoned) and an extended interview with Justin and his crew in which he explains his song choices and their track order.<br /><br />Songs included; Futuresex/Lovesound, Like I love you, My love, Senorita, Sexy Ladies, Until the end of time, What goes around...comes around, Chop me up, Rock your body, Gone, Take it from here, Last night, Damn girl, Summer love, Losing my way, Cry me a river, Lovestoned, Sexyback and a solo piano performance of All over again.<br /><br />This is a great show that I can highly recommend...comes around, Chop me up, Rock your body, Gone, Take it from here, Last night, Damn girl, Summer love, Losing my way, Cry me a river, Lovestoned, Sexyback and a solo piano performance of All over again.

B00275EGWO|5.0|If THE HURT LOCKER wanted to be a movie with a political agenda or message, it failed for me.  And that's a very, VERY good thing!  While I have not seen every single \\"Iraq-themed\\" movie made, I've seen enough and read enough to know that the writers and directors just couldn't stop themselves from getting preachy, wedging overtly anti-Bush statements where they didn't fit or, worst of all, implying that all our troops are just crazy maniacs.  In HURT LOCKER, director Kathryn Bigelow knows that she can let a realistic story speak for itself.      And what does it say for itself?  \\"War is hell.\\"  \\"War is bad.\\"  \\"War makes good people do stupid things and things they'll regret forever.\\"  And most interestingly, \\"War is a drug.\\"  If you want to generalize these statements to just the Iraq War, you can.  But it isn't too hard to understand the very specific, Iraq-based events of HURT LOCKER could be extrapolated to any war.  The technology has changed incredibly...but not the basic emotions.      I though THE HURT LOCKER was simply a great war movie.  And I'm grateful for it.  It shows the ugly side of Iraq.  But it also shows some of the reasons we're there.  It shows troops doing horrible things...but also heroic, selfless things.  It shows how troops can fall apart and hurt innocents...but also how they can pull together at great risk to take out the bad guys and save the \\"good\\" guys.  But more than that, it is a fascinating ride along with 3 very special members of a bomb disposal unit.    Is there anything more tense than the scene where the bomb expert is trying to disarm the bomb before it kills him?  How many movies have we seen that in?  And it almost always works to get the blood racing and to move rear-ends to the edges of seats.  Imagine that scene, done REALLY well, about 6 or 8 times in one movie!  There are almost no moments in this film in which the tension lets up.    Staff Sgt James (Jeremy Renner) comes to Bravo unit's bomb disposal group after theirprevious expert met an untimely end.  He is the veteran of over 800 disposals, and when it comes to disarming bombs...he does what he feels he must.  Protocol be damned, and often, his own safety.  He's reckless, yet experience has given him an instinct for the work.  He drives his teammates crazy with fear or angry for his disobedience...but again and again, he proves he knows what he's doing.  He is addicted to the rush of thrusting himself into danger that most normal men would simply wet themselves over.  He can't help it.      Working with him is Sgt. Sandborn (Anthony Mackie).  He's the guy who clears the scene, and leads the efforts to watch for terrorists while the bombs are being disarmed.  Because these devices are NOT just ticking timebombs.  In many cases, the terrorist with the trigger is nearby, waiting to set it off with a flip of a switch or the dialing of a cell phone.  Sandborn and his closest assistant, Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are accustomed to running the show, looking out for the bombers, and shooting them when needed.  James has no patience for their carefulness...he seems to assume everyone is working on the same accelerated schedule he is.    Naturally, this causes tension in the men...which only adds to the natural tension of the disarmings.  Almost every moment these men share together is fraught with tension...and it's all very believable.  Bigelow has some great technical know-how, but she demonstrates it in her camera-work, editing and pacing in such a way to ADD to the story, not distract from it.  Every trick she breaks out is in service to the story.  Her job is to leave you wrung out at the end of the film.  And to leave you reluctantly admiring the cocky, perhaps borderline insane James, along with his more \\"normal\\" but also very brave cohorts.    The \\"war is hell\\" message is never overt...it's just there in all the things these soldiers must endure.  About midway through the film is a lengthy sequence during which the3 Americans and a small group of Brits take fire from the enemy and are forced to hunker down in a very insecure hillside.  The scene is tense, riveting and yet also shows the incredible stretches of just simply WAITING for something to happen.  Imagine the boredom you would feel if you had so sit outside and wait all day for your mailman to arrive.  Now imagine that it's incredibly hot, you are not allowed to move a muscle and instead of the mailman, it's a sharpshooter who wants to kill you.  How can the nerves stand hour after hour of fear?    The three leads in the film are outstanding.  I suspect there's a good chance Jeremy Renner will get an Oscar nomination.  His character is full of quirks and ticks and flashy behavior, but Renner never pushes his performance on bit beyond what the demands of his character are.  It's also a very charismatic performance, and should help turn this solid character actor (28 WEEKS LATER, ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES, NORTH COUNTRY) into a star.  Geraghty is very sympathetic as the conflicted Eldridge and Mackie is a great mixture of hardass and human.      Bigelow (the wonderful STRANGE DAYS) does almost everything right in this film.  I only balked at the distracting \\"cameos.\\"  It felt a bit jarring to suddenly encounter actors like Ralph Fiennes or David Morse, although both are very good.  Worst of all was the sudden, jarring arrival of Evangeline Lilly (\\"Lost\\").  I was just so surprised to see a familiar TV face in this film that I was completely pulled out of the film for a moment.  These are minor speedbumps, though, along a very solid (if dusty and brown) road.    THE HURT LOCKER is the kind of film the all-too-common tag \\"must see\\" should be applied to.  I was riveted and stirred by almost every minute.
0452286751|5.0|An exciting, fun read - with unique, exciting, unforgettable characters.  Dramatizing the role and importance of integrity and independence of thought in one's life.<br /><br />The key to Dominique's confusing character is that she believes one's values cannot survive the rough and tumble of real life.  Since she cannot ignore the value in which she holds Roark, she fights to shield him from that rough and tumble, in spite of his eagerness to embrace it.  She cannot embrace a relationship with Roark because she cannot face its eventual destruction.  Roark must demonstrate that values can be achieved, that life can be enjoyed, and wait for her to learn this.<br /><br />(Contrary to popular misreadings, there is no true rape scene, but a test, initiated by Dominique, of Roark's will and loyalty to values.  It's complicated.)<br /><br />I've read this novel twice so far and found it exciting and thought provoking, with new insights each time.  Howard Roark is the character that even Gary Cooper could not do justice to in the movie.
B0021L8UPI|3.0|There's something wrong with Esther!    In the great tradition of movies from THE BAD SEED to THE RING, ORPHAN gives us a terrifyingly dangerous child named Esther...an orphan from Russia adopted by a loving American family...who soon have deep cause to regret their decision.    It's an old, old cinematic story.  A child who is incredibly intelligent and somehow twisted into a cold-blooded killer.  A brilliant manipulator of adults.  A feared peer.  And for the audience, sometimes a source of discomfort.    It is the level of discomfort that such a film child creates that mostly determines whether this sort of movie works or not.  And I will say, Esther is one of the better child prodigy serial killers I've seen in awhile.  Creepy doesn't quite begin to describe it.    Isabelle Fuhrmann plays this little Russian 9-year-old with an efficiency of movement and a coldness of purpose that is chilling.  When she is first spotted at the Catholic Orphanage by her prospective parents (Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard), she appears to be a shy but very intelligent girl with a charming Russian accent.  But almost immediately upon her arrival at home, she begins to manipulate the family and remove those who stand in her way...for reasons we don't learn until near the end of the film.      Turns out, this seemingly happy family has a few unhappy moments.  Farmiga is a recovering alcoholic, who still feels the urge.  She's wracked with guilt for nearly costing the life of her young daughter Max, an adorable (and crucially, deaf) young girl...because of her drunken inattentiveness.  Sarsgaard has a lapse of faithfulness in his past.  And the whole family mourns the death of sister Jessica, who died in the womb and whose lost has deeply scarred Farmiga.  Only the older brother seems \\"normal\\" and of course he spots the weirdness in Esther right away.    The psychology of the family is critical to Esther's schemes...but they are fairly incidental in a film of this kind.  It's the creepiness and preternatural \\"talents\\" of the young girl in manipulating, hurting and dispatching her rivals that draws us in.  There are no moments of supernatural occurrences in the film...but it plays like an old-school horror film.  For its two hour running time, you'll be well entertained.    Having \\"classy\\" actors like Farmiga and Sarsgaard on  hand gives ORPHAN a sheen of respectability, as does the always welcome presence of CCH Pounder as the head of the orphanage.  But as is so often the case, any post-viewing scrutiny of such a film leaves us finding \\"hard to believe\\" moments.  In ORPHAN, we're expected to believe that Sarsgaard is UTTERLY blind to what his new daughter is really like.  We're expected to accept that young Max (aged 5...beautifully played by newcomer Aryana Engineer...best name EVER!) is so thoroughly and completely under Esther's thrall that she would help commit some horrific crimes.  And the final few minutes of the film feature some very clichéd moments, including key characters deciding to run into a dark, snow covered forest for no good reason except to set up a climactic confrontation.    But again, to its credit, ORPHAN is adeptly handled to the degree where we don't think about a lot of these things until AFTER the movie.  It has built up enough goodwill (by creeping us out) that moments that might make us groan in disbelief in a lesser film will skate by here.     To its detriment, the film opens with a dream sequence...just to give us a jolt to start things off.  Jolts from dream sequences are not earned fairly, in my opinion...especially if you start a film with one.  And the sequence itself is a bit unpleasant to watch...there's nothing really nice about childbirth's gone bloodily wrong.    Vera Farmiga is an arresting film presence, and gives a decent performance here.  Sarsgaard, a real favorite of mine, is not quite so convincing here...I think it's the worst I've seen  him.  The oldest brother is played by young Jimmy Bennett (recently the young James T. Kirk in STAR TREK)...and he is quite good.  He's a typical obnoxious 12 year old boy...but when its up to him to help members of his family, he steps up even when he's utterly terrified.  But the film belongs (as it must) to young Fuhrmann...and even if the content & structure of the film fades into the memory with great speed...Esther will stick with you just a little bit longer.     3.5 stars for this solid, scary genre piece.  Rounded down to 3 due to the sordid opening sequence and uninspired final sequence.
0765322889|5.0|This is the first book in a long series, and it is excellent. And the following books are even better. It is really long, and can get very complex and hard to keep track of who is who, but I think it's worth it. One of the best fantasy settings ever published.
0790729369|5.0|Deeply romantic and alive, and touching on a subject manner of two souls misplaced, contented in daily life, but open to a deeper mystery and moment of profound sharing and release.  Madison County, Iowa is a beautiful and relaxing place to spend a long summer day, visiting the bridges and other elements from the movie, although sadly the home was damaged and no longer accessible.  Streep and Eastwood are nothing short of magic in the dialogue and dancing that they share.  The scenes of her two children's reaction are at times campy, yet effective in framing the moment in the larger picture of Francesca's life, and also the important ramification any affair has on family (usually disastrous, but the touching manner of the characters and specific context of how things unfold in Madison County make it work).  Timeless classic, most of the movie is set in 1965.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We're moving from the rainforest bassinet (with Mobile) to a big crib.  I really wanted to move to this mobile because it has the same \\"characters\\" to it.  It is a bit quiet and on the bassinet mobile, I was able to start louder to get her attention and drown out other sounds, then turn down the sound once she was focused in and ready to be soothed -- this was very effective and I don't have that choice with this mobile.  Another thing the bassinet had was a flashing light feature that helped to draw her in and become ready to be soothed - also absent on this mobile.  The music on this mobile is better quality than on the bassinet mobile. This mobile is a very nice one and I am pleased with it, although I'd like it even better if the features from the bassinet mobile were incorporated into it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This film is simply amazing.  I was completely engrossed throughout the entire movie. All the scenes with Oskar and Eli together are absolutely sublime.  There is no way Hollywood could or will come close in replicating the overall mood or emotion this film conveys to the viewer or imparts on the viewer.    For me, it is incredibly rare to WANT to watch a movie more than once.  Not in this case.  At the present, I'm so enamored with this film, I'm ready to call it one of my top 10 favorite films of all time.      I've seen the dubbed version, 'dumbed' down subtitle version and the theatrical subtitled version of this film.  You simply must see a subtitled version of the film.  To miss out on the performance of the 2, young, lead actors is to miss one of the main reasons this film is exceptional.
B001FB55H6|5.0|This movie was much better then I was expecting it to be. It really makes you think about the nature of mankind.     As for the blu-ray quality, this is up there with the top quality blu-ray movies on the market. The picture is great and the sound is even better. There are plenty of extra features for those who care for them (I'm not one for the dvd extras) and with the movie running at 3 hours long, you get your moneys worth.
0380730405|3.0|I found \\"Rebecca\\" in fragile yellowed condition at a book fair in Ithaca.  I had to get it because I remember it from my mother's library in Nigeria, and its famous opening line: \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\\"  And it was 25 cents.<br /><br />I found the book to be gorgeously painstakingly detailed, sort of like Tejpal's \\"Alchemy of Desire\\" and his damned pipal trees.  The rhododendron and azaleas of Manderley function in the same way.  Not just the foliage, but everything (the sea, the furniture, the house, the very driveway) is imbued with (sinister) human character, a fanatic anthropomorphism.  The language is beautifully done, and the story is gripping, despite an enraging lack of communication between the hapless Max de Winter and his (never named!) new bride.  As usual, I wish it were about 100 or more pages shorter than its 419.  A little less description would have done it, but I definitely have the landscape of Manderley and the sea and the woods in my head now.<br /><br />The characters too were compelling, if a bit caricatured: the snobby companion, the beautiful first wife, the skull faced evil housekeeper, the kindly best friend, the aloof husband, the shy second wife, the idiot caretaker, etc.  Disappointingly PG (I guess that's what you get for a love story first published in 1938), but a good read.
B00288KNL8|4.0|What a wonderful surprise Coraline turned out to be. I was a little apprehensive to view another Tim Burton movie due to the creepiness of Willie Wonka but I was happy to see that Coraline is nothing like that film. Full of charm and heart, Neil Gaiman's Coraline is the story of a girl who gets drawn into a seemingly wonderful fantasy world when she rebels against her every-day life pre-occupied parents.     The stop-motion animation is put to full use in this film and adds to quirky fantasy. There are some scary moments in this film that may be too much for small kids but overall this is a very child-centric movie.    One of the best animated films to come out in a while, Coraline is well worth your time and $$.
B002DYKP88|5.0|In recent years, Zhang Yimou has been creating some truly epic movies -- expansive, lushly opulent action films with a heavy dose of tragedy and romance. And before he even created \\"House of Flying Daggers,\\" Yimou created \\"Hero\\" -- visually rich, stunningly action-packed, and beautifully made, \\"Hero\\" is a unique film that takes the soul and senses on a rollercoaster ride.<br /><br />Ancient China (third century B.C.) was divided into seven kingdoms, and the most powerful lord was the King of Qin (Chen Dao Ming). He wants to unite China under his own rule. But he lives in fear of his life, most particularly from a trio of deadly assassins: \\"Broken Sword\\", \\"Flying Snow\\" and \\"Long Sky\\" (Tony Leung, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen respectively). And lest they get close to him, everyone is kept at a far distance and the King is surrounded by armed guards.<br /><br />Then a man called Nameless (Jet Li) arrives, announcing that he has somehow killed them, and is actually permitted to sit within a certain distance of the King. How could he have killed three incredibly powerful warriors? Not just by his impressive martial arts skills, but through his cunning as well. He uses sexual divisions and jealousy, calligraphy (yes, calligraphy), and his wits to defeat all three assassins in turn.<br /><br />But the king is not convinced that Nameless is telling the whole truth, and concocts a version of his own that also explains Nameless' actions and choices. A game of wits starts to form between the mysterious warrior and the wily king. What is the truth behind the hero's story?<br /><br />Despite having been released much later, \\"Hero\\" was apparently the first of Yimou's wuxia action movies -- and while it doesn't cover much new ground in the fantasy martial arts area, it's a magnificent and awe-inspiring film. And perhaps most uniquely, it draws heavily on Akira Kurosawa's classic \\"Rashomon,\\" by having the King and Nameless provide wildly different versions of the same story. What is the truth? It turns out to be far more complex than even those involved would have thought.<br /><br />And Yimou's wire-fu creates a film where style and fantasy overcomes the realistic, full of lush color and swirling action scenes. People slash off hundreds of oncoming arrows and leap through walls of droplets -- just try doing that in the real world. And the fight scenes are, simply put, balletic -- they fight while suspended over a lake as their swords dip through the water, fight to music, battle in a swirl of fallen autumn leaves.<br /><br />As exquisite as the action seems, it would be empty without a suitable plot to go with it -- and while deceptively simple, Yimou's storyline is actually rather complex emotionally. There's a passionate romance that is splintering apart, personal rivalry, and the whole question of what the titular character's plans are, and what he ultimately chooses to do. The one flaw is that I'm not sure why he makes the decision he does -- it seems rather out of left field.<br /><br />Jet Li and Chen Dao Ming give the best performances of this film -- they both portray intelligent, suspicious men who are playing a strange game of truth and deception. Their back-and-forth conversations are entrancing. The three assassin actors -- as well as the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, as the mistress of one of the men -- are given secondary roles, but do an excellent job of imbuing them with little hints of humanity, tragic romance and briliant skills.far more complex than even those involved would have thought.

0517548232|5.0|This book is exceptionally easy to read. It outlines the basic case for free markets in a way that makes sense to anyone. You don't need to possess a PhD in mathematics to follow Hazlitt's explanations. He explains things using such simple logic that it's almost impossible to disagree with him.    Furthermore, once you've read this book, you'll start seeing the flaws with the conventional wisdom of modern political economic discourse. This book exposes the logical fallacies and misconceptions that form the basis for all the mistakes being made by central economic planners. Even though Hazlitt originally wrote this book in 1946, he might as well have been describing the market today.     The world would be a better place if everyone read this book.
6300216802|4.0|Star Trek the Motion Picture!<br /><br />I did a rewatching of this film recently and even though I have the original VHS tape, the \\"special longer version\\" is much cleaned up from the theatrical release.<br /><br />Robert Wise directs this Alan Dean Foster story (similar but only on a general way to The Original Series (\\"TOS\\") The Changeling.<br /><br />In \\"The Changeling\\" the Enterprise was nearly hit by a high energy beam from a small probe that turned out to be a mix between Voyager and an alien probe.  It was attempting to find its Creator, a Mr. Roykirk, which it mistook for James Kirk.  Its mission was to sterilize imperfection -- when Kirk pointed out that it too was imperfect, it sterilized itself!<br /><br />We start out with Jerry Goldsmith's excellent score, which was later used extensively and every TV program of Star Trek: The Next Generation, a fact I completely forgot about until hearing it.  And, the Klingons were changed to having ridges on their foreheads and looking more alien, another aspect continued through the next twenty plus years of Trek.  This was a big deal to the original fans, though TNG guys now take this in stride.<br /><br />The movie is about tension in many ways:<br /><br />Spock is conflicted between his Vulcan heritage and his desire for the stars, which we see on the barren, red hot orange planet Vulcan as he fails the Kolinar.<br /><br />Tension between Kirk and Decker who was going to command the Enterprise until Kirk came aboard.<br /><br />And the new crew member Lt.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|By far this is one of the best shows in the past couple of years. Give it some time; at first the premise may seem odd, but after the first week you will LOVE it. Both my husband and I did....both season 1 and 2 are great, can't wait for the next season!
0385340575|5.0|Although this is the 13th installment in Lee Child's series featuring Jack Reacher, I am a relative newcomer, having only read four from the series.  With that said, Child has quickly worked his way onto my \\"must read\\" list.  The three prior books from Child were absolute page turners and Gone Tomorrow brought more of the same.  Child grabs the reader in the first few pages and does not let go.  Reacher is a great character.....physically and mentally tough.  His tenacity, perseverance, ruthlessness and survival instincts are on display throughout the book, leading to a very compelling story full of twists and turns.  Simply put, start to finish, this is a great novel that I found to be impossible to put down.  I will definitely be going back to fill in with the other books in the series that I have not yet read.
0321525655|5.0|Presentation Zen does an excellent job of not only explaining why most conventional presentations are tedious, but how they actually contribute to your audience not getting your message at all. Fortunately, it does provide a plethora of remediation strategies in the messaging, design, attitude and physical presence aspects of presenting. This book can't guarantee that you won't have to sit through another painful and time-wasting presentation, but after reading it, you'll have no excuses for giving one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD early this year since I was getting bored of going to the gym everyday and needed something fast and effective at home.  I am an intermediate to advanced exerciser and am thin, but wanted to get stronger (I usually focus on cardio).  I was expecting it to be too easy like most of the exercise dvd's i've bought before, but it definitely wasn't!  Level 1 was hard the first time I tried it, and it took me a couple of days on each level to move up to the next.  Recently, the workouts are becoming a bit easier for me, so I've started stringing workout 1 and 3 together for a 40 minute killer session.  My body looks great as a result of this workout!  My legs, arms, shoulders, and abs all got much more defined and muscular and I feel great as a result of the increased strength and stamina.  This is a totally rewarding workout, even for those of you who are at a more advanced level.  You can modify it by stringing the workouts together like I did if you need more of a challenge.  You could also up the weight of your hand weights or something like that.  I am so happy I bought this dvd!
B0028SVXR6|5.0|First of all, let me clarify where I am coming from. I like the Mars Volta. They're not one of my absolutely favorite bands, but I care about them enough to have this album, Bedlam, Frances and De-loused. I obviously liked them enough to keep buying their music, but I always felt that something was missing to put them at the very top on my personal charts.    And then came Octahedron, and I realized that nothing was missing. On the contrary, there was simply too much going on for my taste in their previous albums. Octahedron is very melodic and it is much more reliant on atmosphere than on a combination of many instruments, which to me, although really difficult to execute, may not sound all that great all the time (prior to now, I could take about 30 minutes of TMV in one sitting).     I really like the whole package - melody, atmosphere, production, balance. This almost seems to be the type of an album with which they may be crossing into a different category and attracting many new fans (and inevitably, disappointing some of the other fans that preferred their old style).
B002C2XXJY|5.0|When I first listened to \\"Here We Go Again\\", the first single off her second album of the same title, I pretty much felt that we have seen this Disney-driven actress/singer blossom to a talented musical artist.<br /><br />It's one thing to see Demi Lovato shine on \\"Camp Rock\\" and her debut album \\"Don't Forget\\" but the singer has said that this album is \\"more me\\" and that includes a sound that incorporates a Jonas Brothers and John Mayer sound.<br /><br />Inspired by John Mayer, The Jonas Brothers and Jon McLaughlin, Lovato has collaborated with these talents and the end result is a fantastic sophomore album that easily eclipses her debut album in musical production but also vocally.<br /><br />It's one thing to have a solid track \\"Here We Go Again\\" but she continues that rock/pop excitement with tracks such as \\"Solo\\", \\"Got Dynamite\\" and \\"Everything You're Not\\".<br /><br />But she shines in tracks such as her acoustic guitar track \\"Catch Me\\" which she solely wrote, shines in the John Mayer collaboration with \\"World of Chances\\", the upbeat \\"Stop the World\\" track which she wrote with Jonas Brothers Nick Jonas and \\"Falling Over Me\\" which she collaborated with Jon McLaughlin.<br /><br />Overall, Lovato has distanced herself from other Disney talent turned music artists with her latest album \\"Here We Go Again\\".  She can act but she can also sing and she has positioned herself to become one of the prominent young singers in the musical scene today.<br /><br />This album is definitely recommended!
0307588335|1.0|This book is nothing like what the product description promises. It is an autobiographical account of the author and his trading career up to the point he was fired (well before the demise of Lehman Bros.).  I bought this book looking for a real actual account of the last days of Lehman Bros. and it is really anything but that.  The author describes his trading as a convertible bond trader at Lehman and the key characters in his department.  It is well written but not what I was looking for.  He apparently knows some of the middle level management and hence has a second hand notion of some of the events e.g. the palace coup removing Gregory.    He has absolutely no knowledge of Fuld, Gregory or how Lehman's balance sheet exploded to 44 to one leverage in the last year.  He is understandably acrimonious with the key figures on the 31st floor but they are not people he knows and he provides us with no insight into how they came to make the catastrophic decisions they did.      His view and understanding of the demise of Lehman garnered from his trading desk on the third floor is only slightly more detailed than what I was gleaning at the time from the financial press. I was looking for something more like \\"The House of Cards\\" which examined the key characters in great detail and actually had descriptions of the key events and transactions that brought a once glorious firm to its knees.
B000UZNRS2|1.0|OK, I read a lot of mysteries and Baldacci kept popping up as an Amazon recommendation.  I chose this one because it was the highest rated.  If this is the best this writer can do he needs to consider a new career.    It's filled with descriptions such as \\"he attached a special device.\\"  I enjoy Lawrence Block, Stewart Woods, Elmore Leonard, Vince Flynn and more, but this guy is awful.    I foolishly bought the Kindle edition without first downloading a sample.  With a sample I would have quit.  As it was, I wasted a lot of time on the road reading this whole book, waiting for it to get better.  Never happened.
159102594X|5.0|I've completed Book 1 and most of Book 2 of this series.  Why joe abercrombie isn't getting more hype is beyond me.  He's quickly moving into the top 5 of all fantasy authors that I have ever read, and I've read most of them at this point.  Unless army tanks show up in Book 3 and ruin the entire saga, I just don't see how this series can go wrong.  Great characters.  Excellent dialogue.  Thrilling plot line.  You can't go wrong.  And unlike some other series (cough, GRRM, cough) - there's a decent chance that the books will keep coming out and the series will be completed sometime this century.  Pick it up, and give it a read.  If you like Gemmell, Vance, GRRM, J Carey, Robin Hobb, etc - you'll find this a riveting series (at least through book 2).
0810995212|5.0|My copy was just delivered, and, upon first perusal, I couldn't be more pleased with this book.     As far as the historical inaccuracies, I leave that for my fellow reviewers to disseminate. I purchased this book for the sole purpose of using it as reference for my own artwork, and, for that reason alone, I happily give the book 5 stars.    Leyendecker's angular, decisive brush strokes, when mixed with his perfect perspectives and refined compositions, blur the often-argued grey region between Illustration and Fine Art. It's simply beautiful work.
0385737424|5.0|BOOK REVIEW: WHEN YOU REACH ME<br /><br />I'll never forget the day I learned the wonders of the Mobi&uuml;s strip...mathematics wasn't my thing - I am a word nerd. So I was caught off guard when I was handed a thin blue strip of paper. \\"Now put a small twist in it like this,\\" he explained. \\"Next, bring the ends together and tape them, like so.\\" Then, I took my pencil, as instructed, and drew a thin carbon line, starting on the outside. I was stunned when I eventually connected it back and had one continuous strand, looping around on itself. I hung up that paper in my room and would stare at it, trying to figure out how it all worked. Not really understanding the physics behind it all, but loving the impossible rightness of it all.<br /><br />That's the way I felt about WHEN YOU REACH ME by Rebecca Stead. It is just SO perfect, so impossible, so right...so perfectly impossibly right. I was stunned when I finished it, too. I propped it on the arm of the chair and just stared at the cover. \\"What in the world are you doing?\\" my husband asked. I was taking it in...turning the story over in my mind...reflecting on the perfect circle I had traveled. I could only say, \\"Wow.\\" This book is an original, showing me logical ideas that seemed almost enchanted. Oh. My.<br /><br />Here's the official summary: \\"As her mother prepares to be a contestant on the 1970's television game show, \\"The $20,000 Pyramid,\\" a twelve-year-old New York City girl tries to make sense of mysterious notes received from an anonymous source that seems to defy the laws of time and space.\\"<br /><br />What the official summary for WHEN YOU REACH ME does not tell you is that this mid-grade novel will make you laugh...and then cry. It doesn't say this book is like a birthday present scavenger hunt, where you relish the chase of the clues to discover your gift. It doesn't warn you that you may never look at others the same again. Or explain that maybe what passes for commonsense is just you not opening your mind. That anything is possible.<br /><br />Stead brings us back to the 1970's with ease - the fads, fashions, and life's everyday imagery is woven in seamlessly. I recognized it all, but never felt she was waving nostalgia in my face, shouting, \\"Look here, I did my research!\\" It was comfortable and right, just like it was penned in the year of the setting.<br /><br />Her characters are just the right amount of flawed, not too perfect and not too odd - normal sixth graders, who are beginning to experience that innocent teenage angst. And then there is that mystery! We see it in the first chapter and spend the rest of the novel puzzling over it. I am not going to give you any hints or spoilers, because that would ruin the fun of discovery. Let's just say the students in my classroom are going to love the premise of those freaky letters mentioned in the official summary and they are going to sit with their mouths hanging open when they figure out who wrote them. Oh. My.<br /><br />WHEN YOU REACH ME, Stead's second novel (after FIRST LIGHT) is amazing. I'm actually going to read it again right now. I want to watch closely how she did it...the way I want to catch the magician conjuring a rabbit...the way I used to trace that thin line around the Mobi&uuml;s strip. It seems like it just isn't possible, but she did it: The circle that flips and turns in on itself, forever spiraling.<br /><br />WHEN YOU REACH ME by Rebecca Stead was released July 2009 by Wendy Lamb Books/Random House and is perfect for mid-grade readers, girls or boys (and the adults in the house, too).tead brings us back to the 1970's with ease - the fads, fashions, and life's everyday imagery is woven in seamlessly.

0684135051|5.0|I am a serious knitter, but I am not an advanced knitter. Besides my lack of skill and experience, I am extremely ADD.  So, this book is better than I expected, it is insightful and funny.  It shows diagrams and written instructions for most practical stitches such as the different kinds of cast on stitches.  So, if you are like me and can just knit and purl and have at least average intelligence or less-like me, this book is the answer to all the problems that arise in knitting.  Some have said she lectures about gauge, but do you really want to knit a sweater and find it too big or worse, too small?  I cannot wait to purchase all her other books, I feel that I will enjoy them as much and look forward to designing my own sweaters, with EZ's guidance.  This is the best knitting book that I have seen, and I whole heartedly recommend it.  I want to say this to all the people who gave this book less than five stars-patience-it is a virtue and necessary for knitting more than a scarf!
B000Y9Q59W|1.0|It's a terrible shame when you buy one of your favorite movies on Blu Ray hoping to get the best image quality and finding out that the image is actually the same as the DVD one. I have a high definition Sony TV and top of the line Blu Ray player and really I can't see any difference between the DVD version upscaled with my Blu Ray player and this Blu Ray version. I am utterly disappointed.
0385341008|5.0|This was a nice light read, perfect for a rainy summer day - I'm amazed how I feel like I know and care about these characters that we only met through letters. Wonderful.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|I thought the acting by Clint Eastwood was a bit contrived and over the top. There were too many racial slurs and slangs which made me feel uncomfortable at times.  Just too much name calling!  The filming was a bit dreary, it was depressing to watch.  The climatic end was touching but it left me feeling empty.  There hasn't been a really good movie released in over a year, what's up???
B0026WHWEW|5.0|This is ONE album that lives up to all the hype.  \\"Stand By Me\\" still makes my toes curl up each time I listen to it--at home, in the car, etc.  If you like to be lifted higher, and higher, and higer, get the album.
0061854549|5.0|Ever wonder why so many people spend so much for a simple cup of coffee at Starbucks? Did you know that a FREE! offer can cause you to make a bad buying decision? Or that firm deadlines are the key to reducing procrastination?<br /><br />This book blows apart the long-held assumptions of the rational economic model that say humans are capable of making the right decisions for ourselves. We are extraordinarily influenced by the topics outlined in the chapters such as relativity, fallacy of supply and demand, the cost of zero cost, and several others.<br /><br />In this time of less spending and the search for more value, this book wil help the reader watch for the other, less visible influences on buying decisions besides price and features.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost has recently ended its fifth season and fans are eagerly awaiting its sixth (and final) season. It's not too late to pick up on the shows wonderfully detailed immersible world. Many who don't know, this has yet to be released to DVD/BluRay and we the reviewers are basing it upon the season thus far minus the bonus feature that will be included on the sets.<br /><br />Season five was (in my opinion) the best of the recent seasons matching it with season ones heartfelt emotion and wonders of the beyond. I don't wish to spoil anything for viewers of the show, or people ready to make the jump into the show and become a losty. Though I will say their are multiple time frames, dozens of iconic (for Lost that is) flashbacks, and a cast who can act beyond what I've seen on television as of late.<br /><br />This season has so many moments that leave you mesmerized, shocked, and dumbfounded you crave to watch them all in chronological order. Sometimes you just don't have time to catch them all in order on tv and the continuity becomes even more screwy with the ever deepening plot line. Thankfully the Lost Season 5 boxset will accompany you on the startling, adventures of the lost crew and hopefully give you an indepth look on things we may have overlooked.<br /><br />This season has a couple extra long two hour episodes, and an amazing finale to recap everything, though it yearns to be completed upon the ending of the epic finale. In one year we will have everything (hopefully) answered. It's one of those shows you want to read up on spoilers, but you wish not to spoil it for yourself and begin the wait.<br /><br />Those not familiar with Lost, do yourself a favor if you're interested in it... pick up the first season. The show only becomes more confusing, knowing the characters before they become more fleshed out will help you in the long run. All the previous season up to 4 are readily available and rather cheap to buy, also you can find lost on a few stations.<br /><br />If you don't know what Lost exactly is, well to put it simple we're not too sure either, but we can assure you it's a rewarding show. A downed jet leaves survivors stranded on what appears to be an uncharted island. Together they must coordinate efforts, or die alone. As time progresses you will often see characters unfold themselves and with the use of heavy flashbacks characters are exposed to the viewer and not the survivors. The show has its run of what seem to be stalk characters at first, but they really grow to become some of the best television can present. The island seems to have a few secrets leading some of the survivors either haywire, strongly curious, or in a state of panic.<br /><br />The show isn't for everyone, it is somewhat witty, requires a high attention span, and what some may call pointless others will note for progress. Ones open to something really different, and genuinely intriguing will no doubt find this at least full of quality.is, well to put it simple we're not too sure either, but we can assure you it's a rewarding show.

0385737424|5.0|If you're anything like me, you've already heard about a million great recommendations for Rebecca Stead's WHEN YOU REACH ME, and that can be a bit of a double-edged sword.  The great reviews made me really, REALLY want to read the book, but they also set up what I worried might be unrealistic expectations.  Could it really be THAT amazing?    It could.  And it is.    These young characters, growing up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, are reminiscent of Judy Blume's families in TALES OF FOURTH GRADE NOTHING and the FUDGE series. They're authentic, multi-faceted, funny, and real.  Their story of friendship and first crushes and first jobs would have been enough to win me over. But then the letter comes. When main character Miranda reads it, she she learns that a mysterious someone says he or she is coming to save her friend's life, and the story evolves from a coming of age tale into a mystery/science fiction, genre-bending marvel. At the heart of WHEN YOU REACH ME is a thread about time travel -- the possibilities, the what-if and the how-might-we, and the sheer wonder of believing.  When I finished, I wanted to pick it up immediately and start reading all over again.    This is going to be the first book that I share with my middle school students as a read-aloud in the fall. I absolutely, positively can't wait.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|Only recently had a chance to watch this movie on cable. Very heartwarming and touching, and in a most believably sincere way. I think it's a movie which many of us can relate to. Frankie Muniz gave a great performance which truly tugged at the heart. Loved it!
0802798225|5.0|I frequently read young adult romance novels, but this one is by far the best! I stayed up almost all night reading it and had to be forced to put it down. The interesting dialogue, a mix between spanish and english, and sincerity between the two characters keep the reader anticipating what will come next. I highly recommend this book to any teenage hopeless romantics.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I have recommended this to at least a dozen people and also been in a large book group that has discussed it. Everyone who has read it thinks it is utterly delightful and inventive.
B000003FMY|4.0|Many have commented on the Mussorgsky performaces, and those are both very well performed, especially in Night on Bald Mountain and the end of Pictures at an Exhibition (Which was orchestrated by Ravel and Rimsky-Korsakov).       Prince Igor march and Colas Breugnon overture (Which I have not heard of outside of this this CD, but is a very nice overture nonetheless)are also excellent and provide great insight into some less well known Russian composers that deserve our attention. The miniature Tchaikovsky piece is also outstanding, especially when you consider what the composer, and this orchestra, had to pack into about two minutes      Just all this would probably warrant the price for me, but the best is yet to come.       The Slavonic March is simply brilliant, on both performance and composition levels. It is amazing how so much is packed into a mere ten minutes, all stemming from a simple opening line. There seems to be so much emotion in this piece, that it is hard to imagine that this was written to be more of a patriotic march than anything else. All I can think is that Tchaikovsky really must have loved his homeland.       The CD ends off with the famous Ruslan and Ludmilla overture, which I believe is the definitive overture, and especially for Russia. Even Tchaikovsky drew from Glinka, and the only thing I can say for composers of other nationalities that didn't (or don't if they are still alive) is that they should have. In this overture, Glinka expresses musical mastery few have ever come close to, regardless of whether his writings are a pivotal point for Russian music or not.  This is where I feel the performance lags in my opinion, as I feel that the orchestra or the conductor slows down as soon as most of the orchestra drops out in the middle, and picks up again when they reach the opening restatement. Maybe its just that I feel that they lose energy, but regardless of whether I am right or not, it just felt lagging in the middle. Suffice to say that I wish they could have done a more gripping rendition of one of the most important musical works.
B0029NY9YO|2.0|I'm very much in the minority in my opinions of The Watchmen, both the movie and graphic novel. I was unable to finish the graphic novel.  It never seemed to get to the point and just plodded along. Well after watching the movie this weekend, the movie makers have remained true to the novel's lack of excitement. My wife and I kept thinking, when will this story get going, get on with it already.  While I enjoyed the films beautiful effects and scene compositions, the story never gets pumping.  I never had any empathy for any of the characters in this movie. In fact after the movie was over the only character I found even remotely redeeming was Rorschach, and he was a sociopathic killer. I'm very sorry I bought this DVD knowing that I didn't like the book. I should have known better. A total waste of money.
B00008G7UF|4.0|This is a great movie!  Meg Ryan is so talented in this film and in all her work. Great storyline too.
0312383436|4.0|I would like to say first off that I have not been a fan of Madeleine Wickhams other books, Sleeping Arrangements, Cocktails for Three so I was very hesitant to read this.  I was very surprised to find how much I actually enjoyed this book, even with it's somewhat more serious undertone.  The best way to read Wickhams books is to picture this as a completely different author, not the same as the Shopaholic series, because you will be disappointed.  Wickham writes books with more serious storylines and characters, these do not have the same amount of whimsy and happily-after-ever as her Kinsella books.    The Wedding Girl kept me intrigured until the very end, there is a slight twist that I did not see happening and it left me feeling very fulfilled.  The storyline overall was well done, although somewhat unbelievable, that is what 'fiction' is, right?  Milly was very likeable, as well with most of the characters.
B002AR9YPI|5.0|I absolutely love this record.  I first heard of Grizzly Bear from Cartoon Network's \\"Adult Swim\\", they were using songs from \\"Yellow House\\" as music in bumps between shows.  It never registered to me at that time.  Then I heard \\"Two Weeks\\" shortly before the release of this album.  I was confused at first by what I was hearing.  I bought the record and listened... and listened... and listened... and I'm still listening to it.  My favorite song on the record as it stands right now is probably \\"Southern Point\\" or \\"Fine For Now\\".<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Animal Collective's record this year as well but this one just has more emotional resonance with me.  It really is unique and I hope many people hear it and let it sink in a bit, you might just love this band.  I also went back and bought \\"Yellow House\\" and I am really enjoying it, too.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Gaaaaah!       I loved this CD. For me it is even better than the Reiner Pictures at an Exhibition recording, which says quite a bit. Scheherezade is masterfully written, and is by far my favorite piece by Rimsky-Korsakov, especially the middle two movements. Every single one of the four movements are far beyond the standard musical performance however, and I highly recommend listening to all four over and over again.        My crackpot theory I developed from the Wikipedia article about the composer is that Rimsky-Korsakov had help from his wife when writing this piece, as it is an excellent synthesis of a variety of musical styles, not just the conservative Russian style found in many of Rimsky-Korsakov's other works, and the end product in this CD is life-changing, at least for me it was.           The Stravinsky piece is also nice, although this piece is in the opposite situation as Scherezade, as I find that some other pieces by Stravinsky are a bit easier to understand for those who mostly listen to older musical styles. Contemporary music is undeniably important however, and I highly recommend this recording as it is well performed and is not as well known as some of Stravinsky's other works.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I can't possibly think of much more that can be added that hasn't been said but I will try. Some reviews are almost completely technical-oriented-ignoring what the everyday casual fan/viewer might think. Other reviews are based on what viewers 'think' movies on blu should look like (that they should be completely grain-free) and neglect the techincal aspects...I will try to bridge both together for this review/opinion.     First off, I think the quality of the packaging is very nice. Some people complain about the uniformality of the discs and while the on-screen menus on the discs are all similar they do show the individual title of each film on each disc. However, this is a boxed set so I like how the disc cases and the on-screen menus are uniform (and they don't look cheesy at all IMHO). There is a preview for the new 2009 'Star Trek' and for the TOS coming out on blu on each of the discs but I was able to bypass these right away with my menu buttons on my blu ray remote and go right to the menu.    As for the films themselves...    I am one of those people who grew up watching TOS re-runs on T.V. as a kid and fell in love. When the movies came out on VHS I bought them all, watched them constantly and memorized all the lines. When they came out on DVD I was there buying them all and then again when they had the Special Editions and Director's Cuts. Just as the DVD releases had their own problems, the positives far outweighed the negatives and this is exactly how I end up feeling toward this blu ray release of the first six Trek films.    Before getting too specific I will say that I have been through all six films and I found each to look much, much better than any previous version I have seen to this point. I'm not going to deny there may have been things done to the films to make them more enjoyable to the blu ray viewer who may be more interested in a clear, sleek looking picture, but when I put these discs in I was truly wowed...especially after what I have read in some of the reviews.    The first clarification I will make is that all of these films are shown in HD. Perhaps Paramount should have worded the packaging differently but by now most people understand that all of the films (except TWOK) have been transfered and remastered in HD. TWOK alone was restored and remastered (meaning they went back to do an entirely new transfer from a negative instead of using one that already existed). I could really delve into tech speak at this point in the whole process, but it's already been done so let's talk about how the movies look and sound.    TMP looks (and sounds) just incredible. The difference from the SE DVD to blu is drastic and looks far better than the SE DVD shown in upconverted format. I will admit it almost looks too clear and smooth for the purist (and I understand their complaint) but it's far better than any previous version I have ever seen; it's kind of an 8 steps forward 2 steps back kind of thing but overall I was amazed. As for the complaints about DNR on these films I am not saying it was not used, but as someone who has seen each of these films hundreds of times I found myself seeing far more detail and noticing far more new things and not once noticed anything that was lost as far as detail (and this goes for the entire six films in this set).     Because of the clarity and detail you do notice a lot more 'issues' in TMP that look bad or out of focus but this is the direction and photographic effects of the filming and not the transfer. In addition, some composite shots with special effects in them still look grainy due to the way these were filmed in those days but there isn't much that can be done without damaging the detail of the shot (which tells me they were thoughtful not to over use filters, DNR in the processing of the film for blu). One example in TMP is the scene in which the 'probe' from V'ger comes onto the Enterprise and ends up taking Lt. Ilia. The quality of this scene looks no betterthan what was on DVD but once the shot is over the amazing blu ray picture comes back once the effects shots are done. This is more distracting than before but all the other parts are so good I am not swayed otherwise.    The only real problem I have seen in TMP are tracking shots of the Enterprise leaving spacedock and a few other exterior shots of the ship-there are these odd, stationary black spots in the picture that look like they must be on the print as they are in the same place on the various 5 or 6 tracking shots of the ship in different places throughout the film.    Yes I understand why people might be mad the Director's Cut is not included, but personally I like the Theatrical version better-heck, I wish the extended cut was included on blu but we do at least get the deleted scenes from that cut on this disc. And, there is the issue of the resolution of the new effects that were added to the DC version not being suitable for blu.    I do wonder why the same people who refuse to purchase this set because they are irritated by the films not being an accurate, true representation as far as being accurate transfers go are not upset about the fact that both visual and audio special effects were cut and added to TMP when they released the Director's Cut. I find this contradictory to be so concerned about preserving the original film so perfectly but feeling it ok to add in special effects, cut scenes and change sound effects years later. All IMHO of course.    TWOK: The beginning of this film does look bad as some have said-it looks no better than an upconverted DVD for the first part of the film.  After the first few minutes though the image becomes much better. There is grain throughout but it seems like a very 'natural' grain. I think this film best represents what the critics on both sides are complaining about: On one hand for the purist this is probably the best, truest transfer of the set with the least amount of DNR/filtering. However, to those who want the clear, grain-free picture this film probably looks the worst of the set (but still much better than any DVD versions). Detail and color are still far superior in every way. So the purists will wish all of the films looked like this one and all of those wanting grain-free images will want it the way TMP looks.    A quick mention about the hue/color timing of TWOK. This is a much 'cooler' look than previous DVDs but after watching TWOK and TSFS back-to-back I find the color hue and timing of TWOK to be much, much more consistant with that of TSFS so I was very pleased. I always thought the early DVD versions of TWOK were much warmer than I remembered the film being.    As for the remaining films I found them similar in quality...kind of between TMP and TWOK. They were not quite as clear as TMP but did not contain as much grain as TWOK. Again, composite shots with effects in them still have some grain and stand out, but every movie in the set is far superior visually to anything I have yet seen. I didn't notice enough difference between III, IV, V and VI other than that III seemed perhaps just a bit sharper than the rest and it was a pleasure to see planet Genesis come alive in sound, color and detail. Some have said that the shots of San Francisco in TVH didn't come alive as much as they had hoped but it was still far, far better than the most recent DVD and I would say was an easily discernable improvement.    The only other main issue I have read and seen is regarding some of the capture photos many have posted up on the web showing what looks to be waxy faces, heavy DNR and filters applied to shots. I have seen these shots and was actually worried and was second guessing buying this set. However, while watching the films I never noticed any scene looking as bad as any of the screen captures show. I'm not saying they are not real captures, but I was simply unable to pick this out or notice this during my viewing the film and I was looking for it in the spots/scenes I have seen these screen captures from. Perhaps on a very large screen it is noticible but on my 32\\" LCD I did not notice this (I am only about 5 feet away from the screen so I am still relatively close).     So, from someone who was very hesitant, without reservation I recommend this set. With the quality that I see in these films I was very happy (even excited) seeing and hearing each film. It's a pretty comprehensive set so I would not expect Paramount revisiting these on blu anytime soon. I do understand the complaints from the purists and I began watching these as a skeptic but I was unable to really pick out any noticable issues that have been brought up. Again, 8 steps forward for the detail and picture, 2 steps back for no Director's Cuts (when possible) and for the issues like the purists mention. Compared to the DVDs, this is still a 5-star product.    Hope this helps those sitting on the fence leaning one way or the other.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|My daughter loves this show and the songs are great too.  I wasn't expecting the alien invasion when I first watched it, but its still a fun show. Well built characters.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I thought Season 8 was the best so far. Clark is no longer the geeky farmboy rather he starts to accept his new role as the \\"Red Blue Blur\\" hero and giving Metropolis citizens a new hope. Lois and Clark are spendign more time together working for the Daily Planet and you can see sparks between them. I really like Davis as Doomsday and you'll learn something very important about Jimmy. The Justice League are back in this season and you'll see some from the future. Above all, I thought this was a very good season with action.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|If you enjoy the series, you will continue to enjoy fast and furious!  It pretty much feels like a real sequel of the original with the cast back!  Alot of action, cars, american muscle, you name it!  Decent storyline, but it's all about action and fast cars!  The video quality is great as well and sound on a nice system!
141690977X|4.0|I got this book free with a magazine, and imagine my surprise that it was a guidebook,not a story. (How they could make a movie out of it is a riddle to me)It was a very easy read, if you can get past the fact that it was written for and by New Yorkers - not all assumptions and situations in this book will apply everywhere. But two things make me love this simplistic book:<br />1. It starts off with a guy breaking into the all-female world: too often women are only getting romantic (or any other kind of) advice from women; unless it's a situation that involves only women, get a man's input! I'm not saying he'll be right, but he will offer a different insight. Think of it this way: When you're developing a product or a solution for children, should your project team be only childless orphans, with no consumer tests?<br />2. It tells women they're too good for cruel game playing and should raise their expectations. How many of us have fabulous friends who have been dragged through hell because they must not have thought they deserved better? This is a lesson I want all little girls to learn: you ARE good enough and you never have to seek your value in a man.<br />Yes, there is the flip-side, that the authors seem to assume that all women are lost noble creatures - there's never any mention of \\"and you have to have a clean character as well if you're expecting it in a mate\\". Greg's advice may turn some women into divas and harridans, but he does try to address that with Nikki's last letter. However, this book is a light read, not a psychology tome. It needs to be taken with a grain of salt, but the underlying message of having self-respect is too valuable to dismiss the book. It made me laugh, made me sigh, and made me want to buy a whole bunch of copies for my fabulous but heartbroken friends.
B000C20VPA|5.0|I have seen this movie multiple times, and it is a brilliant movie. This is one of those situations where the movie is better than the book. The elements that make this movie so good is the acting, music, and perspective the viewer is given as the story is being told. This is the type of movie where you can skip to the middle of the movie and you can pick up on the story, like the movie transcends basic story telling linearity. The music blends into the story in such a way that it sets the tone of each scene. Pesci is the true genius of this movie, his character is ultimate vilan. I highly recommend this movie.
B000M341QE|4.0|This movie is all about guys.  And violence.  And double lives.  The writing and directing may not be stellar, but it works.  DiCaprio, though, is very, very good.  I had written him off in most of his movies, but here he has depth and versatility.  In one particularly good scene, in which he is questioned by the only female character (a rather undefined police psychologist) as to his vulnerability, DiCaprio works wonders without many words.  The film's basis in meta-levels (the watching of the watched, the 'criticism' of characters by each other) is more intriguing because of DiCaprio's performance.  Damon plays his typical role.  Like Vince Vaughn, he seems to be an actor driven by rage, as if that's the one emotion he can truly portray.  That being said, Damon's last line is brilliantly acted.  \\"OK.\\"  One little word.  And yet it delivers his performance from mediocrity and justifies his being on the same screen as Nicholson and DiCaprio--at least for that one moment.  Good movie.  Bears watching more than once.
B001LF347E|4.0|That's not saying much, considering that Reality TV seems to be taking over everywhere, and there is NOTHING else on this summer.    It may not be THE-ABSOLUTE-BEST-THING-EVER-ON-TV-EVER!!, but this UK import is pretty darn good.  Solid 4 stars.  I started watching the first couple on Hulu, and now I'm sort of hooked.  I'm usually a wait-to-see-it-on-Hulu person, but I've been flipping on my TV Sunday nights to help get the Nielsen ratings up.  I hope this show isn't cancelled, at least they finished out season 1 in the UK!  Looking forward to season 2 (i hope!!) and to seeing what these promising actors will do after this!    So, 4 stars for giving me hope in scripted, serialized TV.  Thank you, BBC.    EDIT: I forgot to mention what a great family show this is.  A few scenes/themes might be a bit scary for smaller children, but there's no language, and I can't remember the last time I saw a show featuring a bunch of 20-somethings who WEREN'T sleeping with each other.  Refreshing!!
068484267X|2.0|I read the book. It is moving and sad, but I don't understand how the author won a Pulitzer Prize for it. It was difficult to wade through the first four chapters. It got easier, but only because I made up what I thought the dialog meant. You can't look in the dictionary for the meaning of many words used in the text. If I were Irish, born in the 1930's, I could probably appreciate the book much more. It is a rambling account of a poor Irish family... very sad... but??
B0002ZMITY|4.0|\\"Ali G In Da House\\" is a very funny movie that has some very silly comedy in it. I was able to watch the movie in Britain when it was in the theaters there and at the time I thought it was not done very well, and that it was some sort of poorly done gangsta rap take off (A-la: Don't Be a Menace to South Central while Sipping your Juice in the Hood). However, as with Monty Python and Benny Hill it is just typical British humor.     It may be a little difficult for some viewers on our side of the \\"pond\\" to understand what the characters are speaking about as they use lots of British slang, and phrases that we never hear or use here. But I definitely recommend it to anyone who may be aware of hip hop culture from the late '90's and even early '80's. It will crack you up, as it is an accurate depiction of what the \\"jungle\\" or \\"garage\\" (pronounced the English way - these are the names associated with hip-hop in Britain) culture is like in Britain, and just how different it is from our hip hop culture here. Tip for those who might have a hard time understanding British English: Put on the subtitles to really understand what they are saying. Enjoy, and remember to laugh. SPOILER ALERT: The main character of his next movie, Borat, makes a cameo in the movie.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|I can not believe that one of the must awesome voices in grunge history would do such a thing, this album is not only awefull it is an insult to grunge fans, come on man you can do way better than this, you were in one of the most powerfull bands (soundgarden) in the world and in one of the most amazing projects (temple of the dog) please man, reunited soundgarden and don't do this anymore, even audioslave would be great, that band (audioslave) was very good, but not this, i wouln't recomend this album to anyone, don't waste your time and money listening to this.
B0021L8UPI|5.0|I LOVED it! It's such a skillfully done thriller and one of the best in the evil kid sub-genre period. I loved the set-up. It doesn't take long and you find yourself really caring about this family. There's a wonderful scene early on when Farmiga's character is tucking her daughter into bed.     Not only is this entirely successful as a creepy suspense film and even a drama, but it's also downright hilarious. And yes, it's intentional. I loved its sense of humor. The things Esther would say and the way she would say them had me cracking up. She's delightfully evil. Even the murder scenes had me laughing. Just seeing this little girl being so cold and vicious provided a great thrill. And not in a sick way. It was just funny.    The performances are great. I found both Vera Farmiga and newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman as Esther to be fantastic.     I'd heard so much about the twist before seeing this movie without actually finding out what it was. Despite everyone saying how laughable it was I didn't want to find out until I saw the movie myself. I'm really glad I didn't. I don't think it would have been as enjoyable had I known the whole time. I never saw it coming either. That could be because it's so out there that it's nearly impossible to see it coming. Yet at the same time it wasn't nearly as outrageous as I was fearing judging by the way it was talked about. Thankfully I didn't find it hard to swallow and was able to go along with it. Is it realistic? Not exactly, but it worked fine. It only helps that everything before it was so great. The whole time I was scared that this supposedly horrible twist was going to ruin the movie for me. I'm so glad that wasn't the case.    This is a really wicked good time. At a hair over 2 hours it never felt too long. I was having too much fun with this gleefully twisted thrill-ride.     The snowy setting was a nice bonus.    9/10 (A)
B001UDYI9K|5.0|I have been a fan of APP since Tales came out over 30 years ago. TAPPTNW is so close to a very good album that I went ahead and gave it five stars, although it makes me wish it had been produced 20 years ago as a real APP album, with full instrumentals and, I am sad to say, Eric when he could still handle all the vocals. On many of the songs the vocals are very good, but on some the range and timbre are just not there.    Still, when TAPPTNW II comes out next year (Eric started recording it last week according to his Facebook page) I will gladly buy that too.
B0000039Q9|2.0|I love this album and didnt even care that the cover was all tore up. What really upset me is that the album was not only scratched but dirty and greasy!
B00009V7OL|1.0|So SAD, yet another BLUNDER by the folks who released this version. Like many folks today I now own a Widescreen TV, I have 3 actually. I think all movies released today should be WS Anamorphic and NOT 1.85 or 2.35 LETTERBOX !!!!!    Please stop producing LETTERBOX formats, unless the original film was produced in 1.33:1, period !!!
B001FB55H6|2.0|I, my wife and my 16-year-old daughter watched this Blu-ray together.  We are all sci-fi fans, but we found it very hard to sit through this movie.  My daughter in fact went back to her own room mid-way.  The special effects and cinematography are top-notch no doubt, but the movie just starts and stops, starts and stops too often.  If you are a teenager, you would feel like you are starting to play a video game for 2 minutes, and then your mother comes in and tells you to do your homework for 30 minutes, and you have to obey.  And the cycle keeps repeating.  The dialogues are long and hard to fathom.  Sorry, but the protagonist (Dan) has more the look and presence of a second supporting actor.  Overall, what a waste of all that production.
B001FB55H6|5.0|First off, this is not a superhero movie. This is a movie about superheroes. This is a beautiful film and makes all those Marvel movies seem like child's play.  The irony of the story and the build-up is bigger than any movie I have ever seen. Character definition is perfect, with each one being not explained, but developed. This movie is probably misunderstood by many (probably because they were expecting another Fantastic Four) and in this form, will never reach its deserved \\"attention\\" so to speak.   If you are wanting to spend a Friday night with \\"entertainment\\", this film is not for you. It is meant to be watched with a clear mind.
0307588335|5.0|One of my most vivid memories at Lehman Brothers was during the announcement of the third-quarter losses.  In our London offices, a fellow new hire turned to me and whispered, \\"Everything is going to be ok, right?  I don't have a backup plan... I gave up everything for this job.\\"  I gave her a pat on the back and reassured her that everything was going to be fine.  After all, we were newly hired by an internationally well-respected bank that was over 150 years old and that had survived the Great Depression.  If anything was seriously wrong, they would have surely briefed their employees before anything was announced to the media.  Unfortunately for both me and my colleague, I was wrong.    Like most of the world and many of Lehman's employees in Europe, I was shocked and blind-sided by the bank's collapse.  My own experience with the company was overwhelmingly positive and the only criticism was the lack of a good internal communication structure.  The book describes the chaos in the New York headquarters in the months and even years before Lehman ultimately fell, but from my own experiences in London, I saw none of this.  Reading 'A Colossal Failure of Common Sense' was a very eye-opening and cathartic experience for me.  I'm sure the book had such a profound effect upon me because I was a Lehman employee, but it explains everything that was happening in the New York offices that was hidden from the rest of the world, and even from fellow Lehman employees.  We were reassured again and again that everything was going to be fine and this dip was just the natural movement of the market.  Even on September 15, 2008, the day that Lehman officially went bust, we were handed a memo upon arriving to our offices that simply announced they had filed for Chapter 11 and to continue with our day.  Less than an hour later, we were handed a box, told to pack up our belongings, and sent outside into the throng of reporters that had camped out in front of the offices.  Lawrence McDonald does an excellent job of delving deep into minds of his managers and of the leaders of the firm, and exactly how one stubborn CEO with a deep grudge could watch his empire crumble around him.  I also found that the author's anecdotes really enhanced the book and as the story moves towards the unraveling of firm, you can really feel the sense of urgency that McDonald and his managers felt as they tried to plead with Dick Fuld.    Everyone knows about the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the nation's general consensus appears to be that greed and mismanagement alone caused the firm to fail. However, the unique perspective from an insider's view shows just how catastrophic and painful this collapse was, affecting everyone.  With this book, I found the answers that I was looking for and felt relieved that there are others who feel so torn about what happened to this once great firm.  The financial products and terms described in the text are very well explained and can easily be understood by someone who has no prior knowledge of banking.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to know more about the inner workings of the once-great company and the defining financial crisis of our time.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|One of the best debut albums in a long time. Yes, there is a bit of prog in here, which works well and is effective-the songs remain concise and not labored over. Anyone who loves 70's era Black Sabbath, \\"Power-Trio\\" era Grand Funk Railroad, early Blue Cheer, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Uriah Heep, Queen, Deep Purple, Jethro Tull, Blue Oyster Cult, Thin Lizzy, and Rush should check this out. A treasure chest of great songs, colorful and trippy lyrics with moderate, not overlong prog-rock arrangements, good melodies, and catchy riffs that really stick. For this to be their first album, it's an accomplishment.  This is an infectious, vintage sounding hard rock record. Call it metal, call it prog-rock, labels and sub-genres aside, this is flat-out awesome. Only very minor complaint would be the last 2 songs, are only so-so. Other than that, \\"Wolfmother\\" rocks up a storm and this is highly recommended.
B00007GZQZ|4.0|If you are familiar with any Sid reviews then you know about our love of b films. You make think The Money Pit was a huge film and in no way is b, which the point is valid. However almost every 80's comedy at this point can be found in the same category as b which leaves them all open to a nice Sid review. They all have really corny humor which walks the line of being b anyway, so why not treat them as such. It's a funny rainy afternoon flick and shows Tom Hanks in the light of still being likeable. Long before his days of boring drawn out big budget trash, the guy actually has something to offer.<br /><br />Hanks plays a guy named Walter who decides to purchase a house with his girlfriend after they get booted from their apartment. They find a huge place for a cheap price only to have it fall apart piece by piece. It's really one of those essential 80's comedies filled with brainless laughs. This is something Sid loves. We plan on doing a lot of 80's comedies in the near future and can tell you this is one we would have enjoyed back in the day. Almost as much a Peter Griffin does.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I wasn't into Bad when it first came out.  I think many of us had MJ overload and plus the songs were on the radio constantly, and the videos everywhere you looked - so no need to buy the album.  However, now that I own it and have listened to it again, I see that it is better in many ways than Thriller.  Michael's voice is more developed, the lyrics are deeper and more meaningful, and it's overall more complex. Michael put his heart into this one and it shows. I've been enjoying it, along with Invincible - which is my new fave. Highly recommend both.
0786838655|4.0|Before considering The lightning Thief, I read all the reviews of \\"If you loved HP...!\\"  I had been burned a few times by those naughty reviews, so I held off for a few years, but decided to give Percy a shot having seen his books stacked up in a bookstore.  I'm a girl who can't resist a series!<br /><br />I have to say, I am still on the fence.  There are SO many likenesses to Rowling's work.. I began to wonder what the Potter franchise thinks about this series.  The main character, Percy, is even referred to as \\"the chosen one\\", the focus of a prophecy concerning the rebirth of a dark titan lord.  He goes to a special school, makes a core group of friends that help him along the way.  Connects with long lost parent, has special relationship with headmaster, excels in sports, meets up with a bully/nemesis who ends up helping said dark titan lord etc, etc. It makes the plots seem a little rehashed.  The characters are great and modern, but juxtaposed with the Olympian grandiose we barely glimpse and the general absence of the Gods as characters rather than plot devices, the book seems a bit disjointed.  I DO love the explanation the author gives for a connection between dyslexia and Ancient Greek.  Being dyslexic myself, I was pretty amused with that little byline.<br /><br />I like the urban setting of the books thus far and the nods to Greek myths and monsters from stories I read in school are amusing.  I really enjoyed the family relationships, both human and Olympian.  There are however, two areas in which I think this books falls short for me.  One, the world building is a little slap-dash.  The modern setting lets the author get away with taking for granted some chances for description that I would have love to seen expanded on.  He spends just as much time describing an apartment bedroom in Brooklyn as he does the entire story of Medusa.  I couldn't help thinking that I would have enjoyed the story more if the monsters had a little more than a paragraph or so before being dispatched.  Second, the plots seem simple and a bit easy to navigate before the exposition actually takes place.  I think that most YA novels underestimate the young readers in that sense and this book is no exception.<br /><br />I've read the first two so far and neither really stands out in my mind as cross-over adult lit, but I definitely passed my copies on to the intended audience (my 9 year old nephew) who I act as screening-party for.  He is not particularly into Mythology and didn't get the many references at the beginning, but got more into it as he followed the action.  The author does a good job of giving just enough back-story on the Gods, monsters, and missions that a 9-yr old can gloss right over without much confusion and skip to the sword fights.  The action sequences and the characters made the book for him and it seemed to spur his interest in both Greek Gods and summer camps.  (he was on the internet looking up summer camps all weekend)  I'm not sure he'll jump straight into the Iliad, but I think it's a great introduction to important literature.  Where JKR's books were more about piecing together the plot and watching the characters interact in the world she built, Percy's story centers around sword fights and monster attacks (which was perfectly fine with my Nephew!)sprinkled around modern America.  Overall, I gave Mr. Riordan 4 stars for his intended audience.  For adults looking for the next HP, not a bad Saturday afternoon, but nothing to keep on your bookshelf.spatched.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|Why not issue the extended edition (177 minutes) in a set with the theatrical release? A rip-off, as is so common.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Just to reinforce what others have already said:<br /><br />Its a fantastic war series, as good if not better than \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  I own and can compare it against the DVD version.<br /><br />The video quality and sound is what other movies need be compared against.  The sound stage and 3d quality of uncompressed audio is far clearly than many BD releases, and DVD cannot compete.  As the movie is so detailed, crisp, clear, one can see so much on repeat viewings than on lesser resolutions, and still be entertained.
B000002IJO|3.0|If you like Ratt, and I do, then this is a pretty good album. I like the song's Dance and Body talk.
1400067936|2.0|The book starts out fine and there are some interesting stories through which one can get an idea of a good investment mindset. Also some interesting interpretation of statistics that I found useful. Then the book turns to an egotistical rant of \\"news pundits\\" and other investors. Some of them are justified but naming names in a sarcastic and biting manner just takes the strength out of what the author is trying to say. By the end of it I was not sure what he was trying to say other than he does not pay attention to Amazon reviews nor does he listen to his critics. Deny their existence and there is not a problem as the problem is not there. I thought the tone became  \\"I am better than you and very sophisticated as well\\" which is a shame as it became noise from which no rationale signal emerged. Reading the glowing reviews of \\"experts\\" printed on the cover leads me to surmise that the current financial crisis was caused by these and similar \\"experts\\" with no grounding in the real world other than to purr and preen each other.

0743297334|5.0|Hemingway is my favorite 20th century author, and this is by far my favorite book of so many great stories written by \\"Papa\\". Essentially an account of the lives of American ex-pats in Europe with no particular aim other than to outline this group of friends' exploits, Hemingway could have ended his writing career with \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and would easily rate among the great American fiction authors of all time.<br /><br />I've read this book multiple times and even in multiple languages, and will undoubtedly do so again.

0307346617|5.0|After reading \\"I am Legend\\" I sniffed around for other Zombie-related apocalyptic fiction, and was so glad to have found this. Comprised of a series of \\"reports\\" written by zombie survivors from around the globe, \\"World War Z\\" is undoubtedly one of the best science fiction books I've ever read. Simply put, you will not be able to put this book down, and I really hope the author puts together a follow-up compendium of \\"survivor accounts\\".
B0027G783W|3.0|the album creates a lovely, consistent mood. granted, yoou have to be in the mood for this mood, but if you are, the melancholy is overwhelming. i confess, sometimes it doesn't take a lot to put me in that mood: a rainy day, a bit of echo chamber laid over synth strings... however, i'm lucid enough to see that this is by no means a great album, nor, in fact, a great effort. moby spoke at length about being \\"confused\\" by the success of \\"play,\\" which left him somewhat unsure of where to go next, and this confusion - in his words - is present to greatest detriment on \\"hotel.\\" what's more, by returning to this collection of songs, he not only reconnected with his sanity and his muse, he was ready to leave any given song off the album at the slightest indication that it might sound like play. if there is a sincere person on this planet it's moby, and i absolutely believe that he means it. i also believe that he is more confused than ever. \\"hotel\\" was somewhat poorly received, but i thought it was a brave and productive step forward; i happen to like that album. \\"wait for me\\" is as desperate an attempt to recreate \\"play\\" as one could imagine, and if moby can't hear himself copying himself, we're in trouble. mind you, the copycat syndrome could be good - who doesn't want another \\"play\\"? this album, however, includes several awkward reminders of what was not brilliant on \\"play,\\" but was, at least, new and therefore opened up our ears. it is now stale and teribly cheesy. that cheap sound moby seems to favor, as heard at the beginning of \\"pale horses\\", i don't know what exactly it is supposed to be, but it could be a $100-casio's version of an oboe doubled for better results, for instance; or the miserable cello heard in the middle of \\"isolate\\" - that sort of thing absolutely grates on my nerves. again, in his own words, moby wanted to create an \\"old\\" sound, but by old he doesn't mean something done in the forties, he just means when crappy synths first became available to all... and, of course, you can view sampled gospel bits and eternal piano arpeggios as either moby's trademark or utter lack of innovative vision: these choices will probably depend on how well the song works, overall. well, several work admirably (after all, three-and-a-half stars is not like i'm panning the album), but the ones that fall flat merely undermine the good ones. finally, i think that what made \\"play\\" so successful was a sense of continuity and perfect sequencing - let's face it, once you got past the first third of that album, things were nowhere near as brilliant as \\"porcelain\\" and \\"why does my heart...\\" (if i said, quick, \\"guitar, flute, and string\\", would you remember the song?) but the whole just fell together well. this is the magic trick that moby was never able to repeat thereafter, but on \\"wait for me\\" it is more of a success than it was on \\"18\\". yep, i can listen to this album and let my mind wonder, and i know i'm in for a fine hour.
0307266303|5.0|Not normally a non-fiction reader, I was inspired to buy this book because of the author's interview on NPR. Talk about amazing. The writing flows and the author weaves the engaging story with facts about human beings as a running species. The characters your read about you want to meet. I've loaned it to five other people who also couldn't put it down and raved about it. I am currently attempting to learn to run using this technique. Of course, I'm only hoping to be able to do a 5k, but it's better than nothing. This is a book to own! READ IT!
B000PWHK7O|5.0|Its very rare these days to be able to find a BCE - Book Club Edition - of a childrens book. Made with the same loving care. That they spent on the standard edition. Most edit content o use lessor quality paper stock. Not so with the 1952 version of Charlottes Web BY E.B White Printed by Harper & Row.<br /><br />Charlotte's Web is a true classic in every sense of the word. Written by a true master, E.B. White, this book tells the tale of a young pig named Wilbur who befriends a spider named Charlotte and their many adventures together. It's a story that children will love due to its timeless, but engaging subject matter.<br /><br />There's a lot of fun to be had in this book. I constantly found myself smiling at the wonderful light-hearted humor throughout the book. The prose is as crisp as any book I've ever read and paints a very vivid image of a rural Mid-western American setting. Although not as epic as The Wizard of Oz, Charlotte's Web is a masterpiece of storytelling in its own right. The ending to this book is downright unforgettable and utterly moving.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any child, if not for its sheer entertainment value, then at least for its strong moral message. Truly, they don't write books like this anymore. It's a good thing we have Charlotte's Web to remind us of the good ol' days
0545128285|4.0|I became interested in these stories first while reading the final Harry Potter novel, and then after Amazon posted some of the stories after purchasing one of the handwritten copies. I have to say that not all of the stories really lived up to my expectations.  However, each of them is thought provoking in its own way, and though I might not read these to my children until they were above the age of 8, they are a delightful addition to the Harry Potter universe and a great way to raise money for a deserving charity.
0743496736|4.0|Amazing book in my opinion. Definitely describes the hopelessness of bullying that occurs throughout school. As Picoult shows, bullying is a closed loop with no way out for the victims, who sometimes are the bullies themselves. The children being bullied really have no way out, since complaining to authorities results in the bullies getting even angrier at them because they are punished. Yet, even the bullies themselves, such as Josie, have trouble breaking away from the wrong crowd if their conscience bothers them, because doing so would cause them to draw attention to themselves by challenging the status quo.

0393312836|5.0|It's funny how people gave this book such a low rating because they couldn't understand it. Yeah, Burgess basically made up a language for it but it's not hard to grasp if you have more than eight brain cells.     A Clockwork Orange is an amazing book. It had me basically on the edge of my seat, just waiting to see what's going to happen next. It's very rare that a book is able to hold my attention and this one dad a great job of it. I did not want to put it down and it left me wishing that there would have been a sequel of sorts.    I would recommend this book if  1. You have a good sense of humor/can easily detect sarcasm.  2. Don't mind violence.  3. Are at least somewhat intelligent and able to think logically.  4. Have a good grasp on the English language (in order to better understand the made up slang)    I would not recommend this book if  1. You are an idiot and can't understand basic English, ala the people that have written bad reviews about it.    Overall, it's a very interesting book and if you've yet to read it, you should definitely consider buying it right now.
0385335997|4.0|\\"Voyager\\" begins as an interesting 2-period time travel story, but develops primarily into a historical adventure novel.  The novel does a good job of taking the reader to Scotland and the Caribbean of the late 1700's and of showcasing the author's knowledge of history and biology.  She develops many great characters and scenes and tells the story with both passion and humor.<br /><br />The time travel aspects which attracted me to the book focus on the possibility of doing historical research before traveling back in time to make sure conditions are right - in this case making sure a particular person survived a battle and lived on.  It also focuses a bit on how/why/where time travel might work, though all this left me somewhat confused because of some associated witchcraft that I didn't care to hear about.<br /><br />Being a middle book of a series, readers who only read this book will be slightly disadvantaged not knowing all that went before and left unsatisfied by what is more a pause than an ending.  After spending over 1,000 pages seeking some resolution of the story, this was frustrating.  Also, like so much modern fiction, it's a good story and a fun read, but lacks any purpose or message.  It does provide many hours of great escape, which is what many readers seek.
B001E3AXGS|5.0|I had been planning for some time to read \\"Team of Rivals,\\" by Cambridge's own Pulitzer Prize winning historian, Doris Kearns Goodwin. This volume was on my ever-growing list of \\"books to read.\\" The book got bumped to the top of the list after I had an opportunity to have a conversation with Ms. Goodwin.<br /><br />Last week, when I reviewed Linda Robinson's \\"Tell Me How This Ends,\\" I mentioned that I had heard General David Petraeus speak at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. During his speech and the subsequent Q&A session with David Gergen, he alluded on several occasions to the writings of Doris Kearns Goodwin, who was sitting in the front row, just in front of me. So, it was natural for me to be able to speak with her during the mingling time that followed Petraeus' presentation. During our brief conversation, I learned that she had just finished the research portion of her next book - a biography of Teddy Roosevelt. I left the Kennedy School that day determined to procur a copy of \\"Team of Rivals.\\"<br /><br />I thought I knew quite a bit about Abraham Lincoln, but Kearns research and writing in this book shed new light on many aspects of his life and presidency that I had been unaware of. For me, there was a special familial treat in reading about Lincoln's bumptious and contentious cabinet. Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury was one Salmon P. Chase. Chase and I are descended from a common ancestor: Aquila Chase, who settled at the mouth of the Merrimac River in the 1640's. Chase later served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I remember as a child being in awe of seeing his face on the $10,000 bill as we toured the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C. (The $10,000 bill was removed from circulation in 1969, so you won't be asked to give change for one anytime soon!) In Goodwin's book, as well as in Gore Vidal's earlier work on Lincoln, Chase emerges as a self-righteous, self-serving curmudgeon who was often at odds with Lincoln and other members of the cabinet.<br /><br />I have written often - in this space and elsewhere - about the power of narrative. So, I was struck by a passage in which Goodwin recounts the early influence on Lincoln of his father's story-telling abilities:<br /><br />\\"Night after night, Thomas Lincoln would swap tales with visitors and neighbors while his young son sat transfixed in the corner. In these sociable settings, Thomas was in his element. A born storyteller, he possessed a quick wit, a talent for mimicry, and an uncanny memory for exceptional stories. These qualities would prove his greatest bequest to his son. Young Abe listened so intently to these stories, crafted from experiences of everyday life, that the words became embedded in his memory. Nothing was more upsetting to him, he recalled decades later, nothing made him angrier, than his inability to comprehend everything he was told.<br /><br />After listening to adults chatter through the evening, he would spend, he said , 'no small part of the night walking up and down, and trying to make out what was the exact meaning of some of their, to me, dark sayings.' Unable to sleep, he would reformulate the conversations until, as he recalled, `I had put it in language plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend.' The following day, having translated the stories into words and ideas that his friends could grasp, he would climb onto the tree stump or log that served as an impromptu stage and mesmerize his own circle of listeners. He had discovered the pride and pleasure an attentive audience could bestow. This great storytelling talent and oratorical skill would eventually constitute his stock-in-trade throughout both his legal and political careers. The passion for rendering life experience into powerful language remained with Lincoln throughout his life.\\" (Page 50)<br /><br />What a marvelous picture of the origin of the headwaters of the river of eloquence that flowed from Lincoln's mind and mouth and branded the 16th President as one of the greatest communicators in history. I once heard a great Black preacher talk about making complex concepts accessible to even the most humble members of the congregation: \\"Sometimes you just need to put the cookies on the lower shelf so all the folks can reach them!\\" Lincoln knew how to put the cookies within reach of everyone.<br /><br />Another significant early influence on the inchoate leader was the power of reading to turn the prairie-bound lad into a vicarious world traveler:<br /><br />\\"'There is no Frigate like a Book,' wrote Emily Dickinson, `to take us Lands away.' Though the young Lincoln never left the frontier, would never leave America, he traveled with Byron's Childe Harold to Spain and Portugal, the Middle East and Italy; accompanied Robert Burns to Edinburgh; and followed the English kings into battle with Shakespeare. As he explored the wonders of literature and the history of the country, the young Lincoln, already conscious of his own power, developed ambitions far beyond the expectations of his family and neighbors. It was through literature that he was able to transcend his surroundings. (Page 51)<br /><br />Lincoln's humanity emerges indelibly as sketched in the inimitable words of the Abolitionist, Frederick Douglass:<br /><br />\\"Finding a large crowd in the hallway, Douglass expected to wait hours before gaining an audience with the president. Minutes after presenting him card, however, he was called into the office. `I was never more quickly or more completely put at ease in the presence of a great man than in that of Abraham Lincoln,' he later recalled. The president was seated in a chair when Douglass entered the room, `surrounded by a multitude of books and papers, his feet and legs were extended in front of his chair. On my approach he slowly drew his feet in from the different parts of the room into which they had strayed, and he began to rise.' As Lincoln extended his hand in greeting, Douglass hesitantly began to introduce himself. `I know who you are, Mr. Douglass,' Lincoln said. `Mr. Seward has told me all about you. Sit down. I am glad to see you.' Lincoln's warmth put Douglass instantly at ease. Douglass later maintained that he had `never seen a more transparent countenance.' He could tell `at a glance the justice of the popular estimate of the President's qualities expressed in the prefix \\"honest\\" to the name of Abraham Lincoln.'\\" (Page 551)<br /><br />The section of Goodwin's book that treats the events of Lincoln's assassination at the hands of John Wilkes Booth left me in tears. As most students of history know all too well, when Lincoln had breathed his last and had finally succumbed to the assassin's bullet, Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, uttered the words: \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\" How grateful I am to Goodwin for making the humanity and greatness of Lincoln accessible to our age - to our generation. For the very character traits and skills that allowed Lincoln to hold together bitter rivals and mold them into a team to heal our nation in a time of war and economic turmoil, are the very same gifts that our leaders today must bring to the table.<br /><br />This is a book for our time. If you have not yet read it, bump it to the top of your list. I am glad I did.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Alone of the greatest communicators in history.

0425218929|4.0|I've been a huge Patricia Cornwell fan and have read all her Kay Scarpetta novels through Book of the Dead, as well as all of the Andy Brazil series. Unnatural exposure is, I regret, one of the last of her well written books. This is also the book which introduces the Chandone family as Scarpetta's ongoing antagonist for several more books.    While very dark and emotionally pulling, Unnatural Exposure is a fast paced and well constructed story. Scarpetta may not be at her best, but she is still real and approachably flawed.    I do recommend that anyone wanting to read Cornwell should not start in the middle of the series, but back at the beginning, as they all build upon previous experiences. Unfortunately, after Black Notice the writing falls apart, so I cannot recommend any of the later books or Cornwell's other series'.    Linda Dark Horse
0765350386|4.0|Like so many others, I picked up this book because Brandon Sanderson will be finishing the Wheel of Time series, and I wanted to sample his work. The results of the inevitable comparison are pretty favorable. There is only one female character here with any character development to speak of, but not only does Sanderson clearly realize that we are members of the human species rather than some sort of incomprehensible, shrewish aliens, he gives her a major role usually played by a teenage boy in fantasy (extra kudos for that). His characters can carry on a conversation in a page or two without five pages of expositional filler in the middle--in other words, the plot moves at a nice clip--and his descriptions are functional but not wordy. As an added bonus, his writing comes across as quite well-educated and thoughtful for the fantasy genre. I wouldn't say the action scenes or the atmosphere are on par with those in Jordan's earlier books, or that Sanderson's writing style is as mature, but this is an early work... and I suppose he'll take on Jordan's persona for the Wheel of Time sequels anyway, spanking fetish and all.<br /><br />As for the book itself, it was enjoyable. The plot starts out similar to many others: small group sets out to defeat evil empire (but with an Ocean's 11 thieving-team feel). Then it takes its own twists and turns and manages to stay unpredictable and fast-paced throughout. I'm surprised so many people found fault with the characters and the dialogue; these are important to me in any book, but I have no complaints. The main characters are well-developed and sympathetic, and the minor ones have the level of characterization that minor characters usually do; I had no trouble telling them apart. As for the dialogue... yes, some of it is expositional and no I didn't read it aloud to test it, but it seemed realistic to me, and in places funny. I enjoyed the fact that a couple characters are into philosophy and raise issues not normally discussed in fantasy. Aside from the pleasant originality of the plot, I suspect this book's success stems primarily from being smarter than most in the genre; economics play the role in the Final Empire that they do in real life (they're important!), and the author is clearly familiar with history, religion and human psychology.<br /><br />The biggest drawback I see with this novel that it has limited appeal. Although this is fantasy, the influence of science fiction, video games, and comic books is apparent, and I'm not a fan of any of the three, which put me off for the first 50 pages or so. As it turns out, this book is much more than that, but the post-apocalyptic world is a typical sci fi rather than fantasy setting; the main characters' magical abilities give them superhero-type powers and fight sequences read accordingly (Kelsier in particular struck me as an embodiment of teenage male wish-fulfillment); and the magic system (maybe the fact that the phrase \\"magic system\\" is appropriate at all is a clue) reads like one from a video game--albeit more original than most--complete with a chart in the back explaining how things work and descriptions of blue lines leading from magic users' chests to nearby metals. These aren't necessarily negatives, and they work out in such a way that someone like me can still enjoy the book: the characters aren't invincible, and there's no sci-fi-style advanced technology. Still, I was left with the feeling that I'd stumbled onto a \\"guy book\\" (Vin does battle in her underwear... hmm...) that I would recommend only to habitual sci fi or fantasy readers. Being a habitual fantasy reader myself, I'm intrigued enough to continue with the sequel.y.

The storyline was awesome. She is a enchanting character with alot of determination and terrific personality. I will note that it does get a little scary with her \\"other mother\\" so I don't recommend this for very young children. The 3D version didnt have alot of 3D animation in my opinion. It was good but I think the 2D is just as satisfying and the cheap 3D glasses it comes with gives one a headache lol.
B001KVZ6FC|2.0|Gran Torino was okay in my opinion.  I felt it was very slowly paced and not that engaging.  And I like Clint Eastwood.  It's a film about some cantankerous, racist white guy who ends up being the white savior at the end or the white martyr.  The part of the film about Thao being vulnerable to a gang and nowhere future was believable but the part of how Walt takes him under his wing and gets him a job and gets him to talk like a man was just baloney.  It's sad that the only way this young boy can be acceptable to society is by talking like some racist white guy and getting a job because obviously there aren't any McDonalds where they live in Michigan.  The story had good intentions in terms of Hollywood fiction but nothing close to gritty reality.<br /><br />I'm sure there are many true life Walts out there but it's a fantasy film to me in my opinion.  I liked the ending but it just perpetuates Asian stereotypes rather than bringing any enlightenment.  Those who hate Asians will keep on hating them.  Asians are either evil or nerdy goody goodies.  It's just sad how Asians/Asian Americans get such short stereotypical shrift in American cinema.  They're either Japs, chinks, gooks, nips, and any other racial epithet one can think of or they're caricatures of who they really are...people on the periphery who are acceptable but never accepted as Americans.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|This is, without-a-doubt, one of the worst movies produced in the last 10 years. Honestly, a 9-year-old could have wrote a better plot and better dialogue. This movie's plot has more holes than a battlefield after a bombing run and the production value is abysmal. The special effects look like they came out of the 80's. As a comic-book film, this movie is awful. As a general film, this movie is STILL awful. Seriously, I have never met a person in the real world who actually liked this piece of trash.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|After reading some of the reviews, I couldn't believe what I was reading! At first thought they must not know what they are talking about, as soon as I listen to this CD (samples), I was surprised! I thought what a bad CD, I thought I'd buy it, but I've changed my mind.  I never thought I'd stop liking Diana Krall, but this CD is very boring, it does not excite me, I felt I was listening to Kenny G,. Diana should've thougnt twice about it before doing it. It lacks a lot, no originallity, nothing great or worth getting, I'd have to skip this one, hopefully she comes up with something better next time.
B001KNVJA6|4.0|There are two distinct styles on Nico's 1967 debut album. The first resembles a form of folkie chamber music and the second an unplugged type of Velvets art-rock. John Cale, Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison play on the album and wrote or co-wrote many of the songs. Their intriguing instrumental textures imbue Nico's morbid vocals with deeper dimensions. An air of melancholy permeates both song styles whilst the second type has an added undertone of unease.<br /><br />Tracks like The Fairest of the Seasons with its gentle orchestral backing, Cale & Reed's haunting Little Sister and Reed & Morrison's Chelsea Girls with their delicate arrangements have the folkie feel of some of [[ASIN:B000003BEP Marianne Faithfull's]] 1960s work and also bring to mind the orchestral folk of [[ASIN:B000025H0Q Nick Drake]], no doubt because John Cale worked with both and Drake also used cello and flute. [[ASIN:B00003CWJ0 Tim Hardin's]] moving Eulogy to Lenny Bruce belongs here as too.<br /><br />John Cale's Winter Song falls somewhere between the two styles whilst the complex arrangement of Lou Reed's Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams reflects the song's striking, often disturbing imagery. The most experimental track, It Was A Pleasure Then - co-written by Nico - is perhaps closest to the early [[ASIN:B001DZDU0I Velvet Underground]] in its feedback squalls, dissonance and edgy sound effects.<br /><br />The appeal of Chelsea Girls is difficult to define, especially for fans of the VU and the later solo work of Cale & Reed. The thematic matrix and the acoustic backing - including piano, strings & guitar - accentuate the mournful magic of Nico's German accent and aloof delivery. Two very different but interesting albums are [[ASIN:B000001E2U The End]] and [[ASIN:B000001JMR Drama of Exile]]. I highly recommend the biography by James Young, [[ASIN:0747544115 Nico, Songs They Never Play on the Radio]].
B001FB55H6|4.0|I really wanted to see this film at the theater, but I just couldn't make it happen. I guess it was for the best because I was able to see the \\"director's cut\\" on DVD with additional scenes. I usually prefer director's cuts anyway.    Anywho, I remember reading the Watchmen comic series when it was originally released back in the mid-80s. Back then, I knew I was reading something special, so I really looked forward to seeing the movie version.    I must say, though, that this movie would have had a much bigger impact if it had been released before the 90s when the cold war was still in full swing. The threat of nuclear war just doesn't have the sting today as it did during those days.    On the good side, I found the film to be very faithful to the graphic novel (I haven't read it in many years, but from what I can remember, the movie follows the comic very well; almost verbatim in some areas). The story is excellently crafted and makes you think. This is not your typical superheroes-save-the-world type of plot. It's dark, it's violent and the \\"heroes\\" have some serious flaws.    The movie is visually stunning. It is simply a pleasure to look at. The effects, costumes, music, sets, etc. are all brilliantly done and come together to craft an excellent film.    The casting was done well, but the standout performance here seems to be Jackie Earle Haley as the \\"anti-hero\\" Rorschach. His performance can be likened to Heath Ledger's Joker from last year's \\"The Dark Knight\\". Haley steals the movie with a truly tremendous performance. He personified the charcter so completely that whenever he is on screen, you can't help but notice his truly magnificent performance.    All in all, Watchmen is a very enjoyable film and is worth repeated viewings. Many people complained about Dr. Manhattan's anatomy being too revealing, but if you think about his detachemnt from humanity, it is very fitting. It wasn't done in a gratuitous way and was not in the slightest bit sexual. Readers of the original graphic novel will remember that there were scenes of his \\"anatomy\\" in the comic as well. Come on, people. It's just a body part. All of us dudes have them. Let's grow up a little. There were also complaints about the film's graphic violence, but I've seen worse (try \\"Kill Bill\\" if you want excessive amounts of blood and gore).    I recommend this film, but it definitely isn't for everyone. You might want to keep the kiddies away from this one. It's for mature audiences only.
B00003CXGG|4.0|I really enjoy watching this movie, it is truly a very good movie.  I must say that the true sadness is that Aaliyah died.  I dont know about anyone else, I think this was one of her better movie roles.  I really did not like her in Queen of the Damned.  Jet Li is one of the true action stars of our time.  I would almost rate him up there with Bruce Lee.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|Recently I checked Amazon's price for this set in Great Britain at Amazon UK and in Germany. In Britain this set now puts you back, when the Pounds are converted to dollars, a hefty 70 plus dollars, considerably more than twice the US price! In Germany at Amazon Germany the set runs @50 Euros, more than 71 dollars! So for about the one gazillionth time - it pays to shop around! Even within Amazon from country to country!<br /><br />These DG performances capture the earlier recordings, before Argerich began shying away from solo appearances or recordings. As such they're a gold mine of great, powerful, personality-laden piano playing.<br /><br />For those collectors who already have most of these this set certainly makes for an astonishing (and not unreasonably priced) gift for a classical music beginner!<br /><br />Take adavantage of this one while Amazon continues to run such a crazy pricing emporioum from country to country.<br /><br />(And for any movie buffs, don't fail to check out the Amazon UK DVD sets of David Lean and Powell/Pressburger, or the bargain prices for excellent transfers of Ophuls!)
B000FVBLEI|4.0|I'm not what the deal is with many of the other reviews written here - it almost like they didn't listen with an open mind.  Many are turned off by the singing as well as the melodic content, other feel like the hooks lessen the value of the music.  Hmmm, not sure what going on here.  So let's get to the music!  The overall vibe from the band is heavy, melodic and technically precise.  Oli's guitar playing is superb, excellent solo's with an excellent and original style that incorporates swept arpeggios, tricky speed alt picked runs, tapped notes as well a pinch harmonics  etc...  The rest of the band play with equal parts precision and passion which helps to make the music breathe.  The vocals are a mix of screaming and singing and both are done exceptionally well by Phil Labonte.  The lyrical content is fine and the overall compositions are strong and compelling.  While KSE represents the state of the art american metal band right now, these guys are not far off, while some think that the music here is none too different from other metal acts out there I find this offering very compelling and hard to stop listening to....
B002CRN7WM|4.0|First of all, lets get the obvious out of the way: Alexander Rybak is an instant-star in Europe, after the biggest victory in history, in the very popular yearly Eurovision Song Contest (recent years have seen figures of viewers quoted from 100 to 600 million).    The title-song is very catchy (some may argue annoyingly so), and with multi-cultural influence appealed to audiences all over Europe.    Mr. Rybak is a very accomplished violinist and showman. The songs on the cd vary, but my main objections are that the lyrics in part are not very strong, and also his English accent comes through a bit strong sometimes.    That said, I think people with an open mind will enjoy this cd - I certainly did. It has a mix of catchy tunes (#1 is very good), as well as some quiet songs as well. (Personally, I like 13 horses which is quite sad, but very beautiful).
0790733226|5.0|Not really, but let us get to the review. Contact is based on one of the best sci-fi novels in history, written by Carl Sagan.  It seems he had some input also, which is great, because I feel it helped keep the story on track.  With such great actors as Jodie Foster, James Wood, John Hurt, and Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughey it is really hard to find a fault with the caste.  Tons of extras and commentary tracks, the only complaint I have is the same one I had when watching it in the movie theater.  And that is it is a tad too long.  Just a tad, maybe ten minutes more than it needed to be.<br />Outside of that it is a great movie and viewers of all ages should be able to enjoy it.  It really has a realistic feel to it and allows us to have a hint of what would happen if we did make First Contact.
B002B7GJOQ|5.0|What a fantastic show. The scripts, the acting and clothes are superb, first rate. I can fully understand how it received 16 emmy nominations. This show is the first show since the Seinfeld (although huge Soprano fan) that I felt I had to be home to watch. his is a show that I wished would never end. My only issue with Season 2 is that it's so short. It's like buying a quart of ice cream, which really isn't a quart anymore but you're paying the same prices. I can remember when a season on tv was 24 episodes. T With that all said, I would probably rent Season 3. Owning the discs with only 12 episodes makes me feel cheated-just like Bets!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|You know the type of movie.  The main character is just moving along in life, happy, drinking beer, playing video games, and not cleaning up his place.  Suddenly BANG, there is an alien invasion, or his aunt dies, or he gets cancer and he has to examine his life.  Is he going anywhere?  Is he doing anything for the next generation?  Will anybody remember him if he falls down the stairs and breaks his neck?<br />That is this movie.  Shaun, a man who does not realize he is a failure is forced to face that fact after his girlfriend dumps him because he is not doing anything with his life.  The zombies are the factor that kicks him in the butt and forces him to become the Hero that nobody wanted him to be.<br />It is a movie about choices.  It is a movie about not listening to your girlfriend.  I mean, really, why does he have to cure cancer or save the planet from zombies?  Can't a person be happy just with three meals a day, a roof over the head, and some extra time and money to spend on themselves?  Why must we all become a Hero?  A General?  A President?  What's wrong with enjoying life?  What's wrong with staying in on the weekend and watching a movie or playing on the game station or having some root beer and pizza instead of going out?  Shaun wasn't a bad guy - he loved his girlfriend, tried to get along with his friends and, to my knowledge, didn't drown kittens.<br />Think about what you ask for, it may come true.  Well, in this case what the girlfriend asks for.  Great movie and teaches us a lesson about enjoying what we have and not trying to wish for change.  Change just hurts you in the end.  Don't trust it.
B0000029LG|4.0|Disc one compiles some of Michael's best songs, while disc two is a brand new album.<br />Although the disc of hits is missing some that are considered some of his best by many fans, this was the first place fans could get some of his hits in one place before Number Ones was put out in 2003. Disc two is the real gold in this package.<br /><br />Scream - A duet with Michael's sister Janet. Possibly the best track on the entire album. Very creative and innovative. 5/5<br /><br />They Don't Care About Us - Despite all the controversy this track caused, it is a very good track with an awesome beat and Michael's voice very angry and bitter, which hadn't been seen in earlier albums as much. 4/5<br /><br />Stranger In Moscow - A lovely slower song that grooves with the chorus \\"How does it feel?\\". 5/5<br /><br />This Time Around - This track has a guest rap from The Notorious B.I.G. and it has a hot, still to this day, beat! Michael once again sounds pretty angry in this one, but it is the R&B beat and the guest rap by Biggie that makes it a really good jam. 5/5<br /><br />Earth Song - It's a little preachy, but it has a lovely piano opening that is very memorable for me. 4/5<br /><br />D.S. - This track is a bit too much for me. I like that Slash is playing the guitar, but this song never sat well with me because of the beat. 3/5<br /><br />Money - At this point, I feel the album is going downhill. The tracks are sounding too similar and this track has Michael Jackson not singing really. More like rapping and whispering in the verses. It's hard to hear him over the heavy beat. 3/5<br /><br />Come Together - This was recorded in the 80's and reworked a little bit to make it to this album. I feel it doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. 2/5<br /><br />You Are Not Alone - The album picks up here with the timeless classic You Are Not Alone, which debuted at #1 on the Hot 100 (which no other artist had done before, and it hasn't been replicated). This is a lovely R&B ballad created by R. Kelly in his hey-day of producing. This ballad moves along at a good pace and the beat is addictive. 5/5<br /><br />Childhood - This ballad is very emotional. Michael asks where we have seen his Childhood. It is a really good track on the album. 4/5<br /><br />Tabloid Junkie - Another really good R&B track about all the tabloid mess. Michael tells his listeners that \\"just because you see it in the magazine...doesn't mean it's factual.\\" Very addictive beat. 5/5<br /><br />2 Bad - It's a nice little jam with a rap by Shaquille O'Neal, which isn't as bad as it sounds. 4/5<br /><br />HIStory - The title track! It has little samples of speeches of important figures in the world from the past. 5/5<br /><br />Little Susie - A track about a little girl who died in vain. It's very orchestral, which hasn't been seen in Michael's past work. This track is definitely unique and likeable. 5/5<br /><br />Smile - Charlie Chaplin cover. A cute little ballad that was supposed to be released as a single. 4/5<br /><br />Overall, the album is very diverse and is a must-have for fans and people interested in Michael's past hits.t a good pace and the beat is addictive. 5/5    Childhood - This ballad is very emotional.

0340818867|5.0|As a citizen of a former British Colony, I found in the book many answers to English behaviour. But you would do well to read the reviews on the UK web site of Amazon.    Another thing to bear in mind is that the author was talking about English behaviour, not British behaviour, which means that it's not how the Scots behave, nor the Welsh, nor, indeed, the Northern Irelanders.    I found the book immensely informative and entertaining. I only wish she had written it 25 years earlier, for I would have gone to bars with my English bosses, even if I don't drink!
B0002YCVXI|2.0|This is an awesome album but un-enjoyable because many of the songs seem to cut off at the end, sometimes in the middle of a note or before the last note fully dies out.     This could just be the MP3 download version so be aware.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I tried this because I liked the fact that it was short-its only 20 mins or so.  This workout is simple and the moves are easy.  No complicated dance moves or routine, just straight forward steps.  However, be advised that this workout is tough and makes you sweat!  If you want something that's uncomplicated and simple, yet effective, then this is the workout for you!
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I got this dvd a while back and i have watched it over and over. I put it in at work and let it play in the background while I am working too. Joe and his band sound great together and I particularly like the opening solo. For those who like blues rock this dvd will not disappoint. I found it interesting also the different sounds he gets from each of his guitars and i loved the volume technique on the third song, 'Blues Deluxe'. get this dvd.
031606792X|2.0|I am a recent convert to the Twilight community and have to say I absolutely loved Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse.  I loved the characters, the forbidden love, the fantasy. I can't say the same about Breaking Dawn. I wanted to see and feel Edward's concern as he \\"turned\\" Bella, I wanted to feel Bella's struggle as a \\"newborn, \\" I wanted to read about an earth shaking wedding night..but alas it was not to be. I keep hoping that the next book will start out with \\"It was all a dream\\" and Breaking Dawn never happened...and we can begin again with the wedding and go from there. It's all a fantasy, so what if Edward could become human for a month or just one day, what would he give up to be human for Bella just once. There's something  I'd love to read about!!
068987474X|1.0|Well I'm glad the author is so into himself.  He seems to have a super-inflated ego AND he believes all other men are exactly like him.    I DO think the overall message is good:  If someone is causing you more stress than happiness, move on.  I just didn't think the message was well delivered.    I also thought it was interesting WHOM Greg chose as his target audience.  If he knows men are confusing women so much (not to mention to heterosexist focus of the book) - why not write a book to them to address the importance of ending a relationship appropriately?  Most women can accept the truth so maybe it's time men learned to say it.  Greg seems to take a \\"Boys will be boys\\" approach and expects women to deal.    The worst section is the one on abusive relationships.  Abusers can be VERY dangerous.  Yet Greg tells you just to leave.  Getting out of an abusive relationship takes time and planning.  It should NEVER be recommended for someone to \\"just leave\\" because the end of an abusive relationship is actually the most dangerous time.  If you are in one, get to know the local dating violence resources available to you.  They can help you to get out, safely.  Try the National Domestic Violence Hotline as a start: 1-800-799-SAFE.    Suffice to say, I hope no one similar to Greg is ever \\"that into me.\\"
0375826726|2.0|I very much enjoyed the talented writing of this phenom yet I believe this to be a good story for three books not four.  The first two books were excellent and much better.  To put it succinctly,  in my opinion it is a filler volume.  I would recommend that if you read the first two books, simply wait for the fourth book and read the third book on wikipedia.  I realize a lot of work was done Mr. Paolini yet so little was developed of the other characters (Galbatorix et al) in the book.
B000000W5B|5.0|The Rolling Stones - Goats Head Soup (1973)<br /><br />The incredible string of albums the Stones pulled off in the late 60's/early 70's (BEGGAR'S BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS, EXILE ON MAINSTREET) is legendary. Many music critics have claimed that GOATS HEAD SOUP isn't worthy of being considered a part of this canon and proclaim that their 70's decline begins here. But in my book, GOATS HEAD SOUP deserves to be considered the final leg of the Stones' greatest ever hot streak of studio albums.<br /><br />While GOATS isn't uniformly excellent, the standouts rank among their very best songs and the rest, while dismissed by some as merely passable filler, is never less than good. I'm perfectly happy putting on this album without feeling the need to skip any songs.<br /><br />Mick, Keith et al. would eventually make an even better record by the end of the decade with SOME GIRLS, but I still wouldn't rate GOATS any less than 5 stars. The Stones are in top form here with arguably their best lineup ever including second guitarist Mick Taylor and a handful of other fantastic musicians along for the ride including Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins and original member Ian Stewart. The musicianship is stellar and there's killer guitar playing all over the album.<br /><br />When GOATS was released, critics tended to over-emphasize its sleazy side (some of the lyrics definitely ARE sleazy) and focused too much attention on Mick Jagger's burgeoning jet-set lifestyle as well as Keith Richards' notorious drug addiction while overlooking the merits of the music itself (a good reason for ignoring critics). Anyone reading the reviews on this forum will note that many people have almost mindlessly jumped on this critical bandwagon. It's true that GOATS suffers from having to follow EXILE, widely considered to be their very best album, although in hindsight GOATS stands as an underrated release. Unfortunately, the 2009 remaster has been censored (?!) and/or botched according to some reports, so this excellent sounding '94 remaster remains the copy to have.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Dancing With Mr. D\\" - The Stones slither into the album with the slinky \\"D\\" (which no doubt stands for \\"devil\\") on a dirty little ditty concerning Mick's favorite alter-ego, admittedly well-worn by this point.  ****<br /><br />\\"100 Years Ago\\" - is one of my absolute favorite Stones songs. Killer jamming on some killer grooves, and it sounds like no other song they've ever done that I can think of. The organ sound (actually a clavinet), also featured on \\"Heartbreaker,\\" is distinctive and powerful. An unusual, sophisticated song that spins off in wildly different directions. *****+<br /><br />\\"Coming Down Again\\" - I'm not a huge ballad fan but I'll listen to any Stones ballad because so many of them are just gorgeous. This melancholy tune isn't one of their absolute best but I still love it. ****<br /><br />\\"DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO (Heartbreaker)\\" - An ominous organ riff soon followed by an explosion of psychedelic guitar freak-out announces one of their most powerful songs, one of their best. Mick wails about despicable tales of debauchery and injustice that wrench the heart. The horns and of course that irresistible choral refrain makes this one essential mixtape fodder. *****+<br /><br />\\"Angie\\" - another heartbreaker and possibly their most beautiful ballad, this one really tugs at the heart. Rightfully considered to be one of their best songs. *****+<br /><br />\\"Silver Train\\" - a good country-flavored rocker about a hot babe that cons Mick out of all his money - and he didn't even know her name. ****<br /><br />\\"Hide Your Love\\" - a groovy, slow-blues shuffle driven by a catchy piano riff courtesy of Mick Jagger. Great beat! ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Winter\\" - a sweet ballad with a good melody and lovely orchestration. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Can You Hear The Music\\" - a virtual flashback to the psychedelia of 1967, you can almost smell the jasmine floating through someremote Buddhist temple. The strange psychedelic guitar tone achieved on this song is otherworldly. *****<br /><br />\\"Star Star\\" -  a.k.a. \\"Star****er,\\" this song rips on Chuck Berry - it's a fun, cheap kick with VERY explicit lyrics, so don't play it around Granny! *********     \\"Star Star\\" -  a.k.a. \\"Star****er,\\" this song rips on Chuck Berry - it's a fun, cheap kick with VERY explicit lyrics, so don't play it around Granny! ****
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Initially, reading the first few rules, I sighed and scratched my head. The words made sense by themselves, but I could not translate it to the board. Once, I figured it out (about a minute later), I was sucked in. Three of us played it and sure enough, after about an hour and half, there was a winner. The route the end of the game was fun-filled and it was one of the few games that involved so much interaction with others.    I read an article about the board's creator in Wired magazine and was immediately hooked. As a nerd, I knew if Wired blessed it, it must be good. And great it was.     I can see this game becoming addictive and replacing my passion of watching movies on a daily basis!
0590129279|5.0|I recently purchased a copy of this beloved little book for a friend but it was not translated by Ms. Woods. The version I bought doesn't say who did the translation. I was printed in India in 2007. It doesn't have the same quality illustrations and the translation lacks some of the emotional power of the Woods interpretation of the book.  I recommend you find the version that has Katharine Woods name on the cover. The new book is cheaper but it is NOT as good as her version. Eventually I paid three times as much for a used copy of her translation but I think it was worth it. Yes it is that much better.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I remember this movie coming out back in the mid 70's. My dad was into pumping iron back then, and I remember him letting me do a little. I was 10 turning 11 during the time this movie was filmed. I laugh when I look at the weight machines/equipment that was in the gyms back then. They seem to primitive and clunky compared to the weights and machines that we use today....I saw Pumping Iron on tv a little while back, and loved it. Seeing Arnold, Mark Katz, Franco Columbo and the other guys in that group working out in their prime was very motivational in my own workouts today. I especially loved seeing big Lou Ferrigno work out, and being coached and pushed by his dad. It was a great time in body building, THE GOLDEN ERA so to speak. Brought back alot of memories of how it used to be. This is defenitly worth having in your collection. Get it, and be motivated....Oh yeah, and wasnt Arnold the COCKY one back then, Ha....
B00288KNJU|5.0|Congrats to Laika on making one of the finest animated films ever.  This is an amazing deal on an amazing movie!  The 3D is nowhere near as amazing as the theater version, but if you watch the blu-ray version with the lights off, there are still some really good looking parts.  You get a 2D and 3D version of the movie, Blu-ray disc, DVD disc, Digital Copy of the movie, four 3D glasses, WOW!  Plus the box and cover art is really nice quality.  Best Blu-ray purchase I've ever made!  This is a must buy!
1595141979|5.0|Don't get me wrong... this is one of the best books I've read in a while... but It left me feeling utterly depressed and a little bitter.  I loved how Rose really evolved and kind of \\"grew up\\" in this book.  I also loved how she and dimitri evolved.  About half way through I had a feeling for what was going to happen, but I read through to the end in hopes that I would be wrong.  I finished the book happy that Rose is finally doing something for herself instead of being constantly in Lissa's shadow... but at the same time depressed and kind of mad about the rest of the things that happened in the end.  Rose deserves to be happy and I really hope Ms. Mead will step up with the next book(s) and throw her a bone,  I am excited to read the next one, I just hope she's able to fix some of the depressing emptiness I'm feeling (Must be a really good book to make you feel so much)
1423101472|5.0|This book was the best of the series. It was a book that I couldn't put down once I started reading (like Christopher Paolini's Brisinger, Drew Karpyshyn's Darth Bane Series, and Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code Series). I highly recommend this book to anyone to read, though I would suggest reading the prior books before this one if you haven't read them. It will probably make more sense.  It was a great book with all the humour of the previous books. It is a modern-day version of the old myths about the Greek gods. The main character is a boy named Percy Jackson, who is the son of Poseidon, and there is a prophecy about him when he turns 16. This book tells about the unfolding of the prophecy. It answers all the questions that were built up in the previous 4 books.   If you have not read this book, do not read this next paragraph!!!! The only bad part about the book was that it left you with at least one new question. At the end, Rachel Elizabeth Dare (who Percy meets at Hoover Dam in book 3) becomes Apollo's new Oracle after Hades lift's the curse he put on the old Oracle then she says a new Great Prophecy:  \\"Seven half-bloods shall answer the call.  To storm or fire, the world must fall.  An oath to keep with a final breath,  And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.\\"  I really, really, really hope he makes another series that will explain this new Great Prophecy.
0385340575|5.0|AS a long time Child/Reacher fan I was extremely disappointed with 'Nothing To Lose'.     How glad I was when I read 'Gone Tomorrow'. Everything you've come to know and love about Lee Child's writing and his most famous character are present here.     I hope one day they make a movie.....actually no I don't as I know that any hollywood studio would completely murder the movie.
0140277447|5.0|The Rape of Nanking is about the horrific events that happened in Nanking. It is another version of the Holocaust in Asia. The Nanking story is a story that is very hidden and this book is one of the few books that brings up the history of Nanking. I didn't have any knowledge at all about Nanking till I read this book. Overall, this is a great read.
0061564893|1.0|Though I had heard this book was \\"controversial\\", I hadn't researched any feedback prior to deciding to buy it 1/2 price at a large bookstore using a coupon. Boy, do I wish I had read the reviews here (or elsewhere) first before wasting my $7. While the author proposes what he thinks might be a new theory of where the Chinese fleets of 1421-1423 could have traveled, and starts out making some partially plausible arguments regarding prevailing ocean currents/winds and how the design of the large Chinese ships of the early 15th century likely forced them to basically follow the prevailing winds/currents, the discourse deteriorates rapidly once the reader reaches the 150 page mark (or thereabouts).     Thereafter, the author, lacking any evidence whatsoever, proposes all sorts of nonsensical \\"revelations\\" and \\"findings\\" regarding where the Chinese \\"must\\" have visited during that 2 year span. At first, he mentions that these visits \\"could have\\" happened, then proceeds to claim that he has \\"proved\\" that the visits occurred, despite lacking ANY evidence whatsoever!! He then goes on write in a manner that implies that the reader should accept that these fantasmical adventures actually occurred, and that he, the supposedly amazingly insightful author, is responsible for exposing these new \\"facts\\".     That these new \\"facts\\" are nothing more than products of the author's imagination gone wild doesn't deter his fabricating one bit. He expects us to unquestioningly believe all of his nonsensical fantasizing: Yes, the Chinese CERTAINLY must have passed through the straights of Magellan during that time... Yes, European explorers DID find wrecks of Chinese junks along the Patagonian coast.... And on and on... no sources for these supposed \\"facts\\" are cited. No physical evidence is presented. In fact, this is far worse than the very common error of researchers (and the public in general) confusing correlation with causation - this is nothing but complete fantasy/delusion.     Thepublishers of this \\"history\\" book should recall every single copy of this rubbish, issue a public apology for categorizing this as a History book, and refund every purchaser's money in full. DO NOT waste your money on this book. It is not history or science or archaeology or anything even remotely resembling fact-based research. It is pure and utter nonsense.

0790729628|1.0|I first saw this movie on VHS in 1982 and was totally blown away with such a daring futuristic movie, for me the voice over of Harrison Ford told the underlining story, it was very important in my opinion. Without his comentary how the heck would you know about (\\"gutter talk a mish mash of english spanish german what have you?\\") Deckard explains this, other wise how could he be a blade runner and not know the city speak? In the directors cut you have no idea what the heck is going on, as friends virgin veiwers I have tested this with close friends, all prefer the original version! Need I say more Ridley? Ok the trees at the very end are a bit lame but without the commentary the film is lost on so many people in my humble opinion.
0385342020|5.0|Lara Lington is a typical Sophie Kinsella heroine. A single Londoner, Lara is always reaching for that pie in the sky regardless of whether or not she likes the flavor. Her boyfriend, Josh, broke up with her two months ago, and since then she has been just a wee bit obsessed with A) finding out why he called things off with her, and B) getting back together. He is less than agreeable to these plans, however, and in addition to changing phone numbers to avoid her three texts a day, he has even managed to make her parents aware of her inability to let him go. She never stops to consider that maybe he just isn't her Mr. Right after all.    Lara has gone into business with her best friend Natalie, a successful headhunter who has opened her own agency. Unfortunately, on vacation in India, she falls in love with a Goan beach bum. Deciding not to return to London, L&N Executive Recruitment is left completely in the hands of Lara, who has absolutely no experience in the field having only jumped on this train because Natalie always made it sound like so much fun.    As the book begins, Lara is accompanying her parents (and sister Tonya, currently a stay-at-home mum who delights in pulling out topics of conversation that highlight Lara's shortcomings) to the funeral of her great aunt Sadie Lancaster, a woman she hasn't seen since she was in nappies and whom her parents had practically forgotten. It seems Aunt Sadie had lived in a nursing home since a debilitating stroke in her early 80s. She was 105 when she died and left behind no children, no heirs, and no family save for the few distant relatives who have gathered begrudgingly to pay their respects.    Joining Lara's family at the service is her father's brother, Uncle Bill, wife Trudy and their 17-year-old daughter, Diamante. Uncle Bill started Lington's Coffee (think Starbucks) some 20-odd years ago with \\"two little coins.\\" In addition to a global coffee shop monopoly, he has created a successful side business of motivational speaking, career workshops and self-help books based on his premise that anyone can become anything with just 20 pence. His family is trailed by a documentary crew, and they make it plain that it is for this reason only that they are attending the funeral.    The service begins and Lara starts hearing voices. Or rather, a single beseeching voice that keeps asking repeatedly for a necklace. Lara looks around and finally sees a girl, not too far from her own age, but dressed in a style more appropriate for the flapper era, complete with pleats, beads and bob. This is Great Aunt Sadie. And yes, she is a ghost. Lara is the only person who can hear her (although if she gets really close to someone's ear and screams her head off, other people do seem to hear a little voice inside their head), and somehow Sadie manages to convince Lara that her funeral must be put off until they can find her necklace. Lara does this in true bobbling Kinsella form, first accusing the nursing home of murder, then a bearded stranger.    With a brief reprieve from the crematory chamber, Sadie becomes Lara's new shadow. It seems Sadie is able to appear wherever she wants just by thinking herself there, a trait that comes in handy as these two hapless detectives search for the beautiful necklace Sadie was given by her parents on her 21st birthday. It sounds divine --- rhinestones, strings of yellow beads and, dangling from it all, a dragonfly pendant. Sadie remembers this time of her life as the happiest --- she was in love with a local artist, and he with her, she was young and beautiful, and it was the height of the Jazz Age. As Lara spends more time with her, the rest of her life story comes out, and it soon becomes clear why she recalls those days with such fondness.    As they search, Sadie uses her parlor trick talents to convince Josh to give Lara another go. She also assists Lara in putting her business back on its feet, and when she finds a man she thinks is absolutely divine in aRudolph Valentino kind of way, she gets Lara set up with Ed, a handsome visiting American, so that she herself can have \\"one last fling.\\"    To say any more about what happens from here on out would completely spoil the smoothly laid surprise Kinsella has in store for the reader. Suffice it to say that I am very rarely taken unawares, but I did NOT see what was coming. It was not only delightfully unexpected, but also credible and most well conceived. Every single storyline follows out to wonderful conclusions, and more than a few people get their deserved comeuppance. And Lara? Well, let's just say she looks smashing in Vintage and finally figures out which pie in the sky is her favorite. TWENTIES GIRL will not disappoint Becky Bloomwood fans, is the perfect book for a lazy beach weekend, and just might end up being responsible for a run on vintage twenties clothes.          --- Reviewed by Jamie Layton
B0028K3192|5.0|I love what this guy is doing on this long awaited CD!  One of the main things a lot of these so-called musical artists   today forget is that you should always challenge your listeners   by introducing them to new material that will open them up in ways   that they didn't even expect to be opened up in!   The general reaction, if you did it right, is that they might   not like it at first or just think it's okay, but as they listen   to it more and more, it begins to sink in that you have in fact   came with the bomb, and they'll love it even more!   That is what Maxwell's new CD is like...as you listen to it   more and more, you realize that he is indeed an artist of   great depth and not your run-of-the-mill Joe Schmoe!   It doesn't sound like anything else out here today!--Yeaahh!!    Think back to the first time you heard \\"Embrya\\",   right after all the hype & fire of \\"Urban Hang Suite\\"   and \\"Unplugged\\" had died down...  Most people were like \\"Yuck!--WTF??\\"    But after a few listens, you realized that Maxwell was   trying to take us somewhere we didn't even know we wanted to go!   That's why I said it back then, and I say it now!  Maxwell is a true artist and someone who, if he plays his   cards right and can avoid all the political hocus-pokus   that goes on behind the scenes with record labels,   he will wind up being one of the modern day greats!  I remember back when Prince, Earth, Wind & Fire,   Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, P-Funk, Rufus & Chaka,   and The Isley Brothers were all dropping their landmark   works in the 70's and 80's, and each time, they always   stretched the consciousness of their audience and made them   come up a notch to where they were dwelling artistically.   Maxwell is doing this in a tired music game that has played   things so safe for so long now that it has basically   dwindled down to nothing!---Everything sounds alike   today and the copy kats are copying the copiers!   The so-called talent of today (with the exception of a few)   aren't really nothing anyway but image and hype!   While the real brilliance can't even get arrested!  I'm so glad that Maxwell has fought his way back!--Represent Man!  This is a great set of songs that leaves you wanting more!  Which, with 2 more installments in the can, is just what   he wants us to do! (-:
0385342020|5.0|At the beginning of Twenties Girl, I thought I'd finally figured out the secret to Sophie Kinsella's much-deserved success. She takes things that we are all familiar withæin this case, being dragged to a family event, a funeral, and not wanting to share certain details of your life with your parentsæand turns them into stellar fiction.<br /><br />But this book, in my opinion, is far and away Kinsella's best. Lara Lington is struggling at her new career as a headhunter, especially after her best friend Natalie, whose idea it was to start the company, vanishes and leaves Lara to pick up the pieces. At the funeral for her 105-year-old great-aunt Sophie, which she begrudgingly attends, Lara finds herself practically attacked by Sadie, who demands she call a halt to the funeral. Lara manages to, but then has Sadie following her around, demanding she help retrieve a lost necklace.<br /><br />What follows is the most moving plotline of any of Kinsella's books I've read. Lara shares some typical Kinsella character traits - her love life's a mess (she's still hung up on her ex), she's a bit wacky, her work life's also in disarray, but here we have a budding relationship with Sadie, in contrast with her wary relationship with the rest of her family. Sadie, who is ostensibly Lara's guardian angel, also winds up learning from her as they trade clothing tips and love (and sex) advice.<br /><br />Sadie isn't a typical old lady, and in fact finds Lara a bit stodgy. Kinsella has Lara doing things that are totally outrageous and, yes, unrealistic, but that, like in the Shopaholic series is what makes them so memorable. Lara barges into a strange office and asks a man to go on a date with her, at Sadie's behest.<br /><br />Sadie also proves quite the sleuth, her ghostliness allowing her to suss out wrongdoers, including Lara's Uncle Bill, a self-proclaimed self-made millionaire who deserves the skewering he gets. This is a tearjerker, as the relationship between Lara and Sadie must come to an end. It also follows Sadie's lost love story, which is bittersweet and poignant, as Lara uncovers what Sadie would never have known without her.<br /><br />Twenties Girl is more than just a fun summer read (though it is that), and goes beyond the usual chick lit plotlines. Sadie is just as memorable a heroine as Lara, perhaps moreso, even though she's not perfect either. Kinsella doesn't encourage the reader to like Sadie just because she's old, or dead, or even because of her tragic life or the story of her fame that unfolds. I liked Sadie because she spoke her mind, because she was fun and sassy and didn't simply do what everyone asked her to. She risked all for love and then forces her great-niece to pretty much do the same. There's definitely the usual Kinsella humor here, and while Lara's ex, Josh, left a lot to be desired as a boyfriend, he, along Lara's family, are good comic foils to the drama unfolding between Lara and Sadie. One might even say this book has three love stories in one: Lara's, Sadie's, and that of Lara and Sadie, whose bond is so strong that it's never truly broken.ome to an end.

1594488916|4.0|The Man Who Loved Books Too Much:  The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession by Allison Hoover Bartlett is a wonderful introduction into a world not guessed at by the general public.  As a public library director, I can testify to the lust that some readers have to possess the books they hold.  Throughout the library world, losses to thieves can really only be guessed at, but they are significant.  Many of the stolen library books end up being sold via the Internet.  Though Bartlett introduces us to the world of rare books and the operations of John Charles Gilkey, books do not have to be rare to become the target of a thief.  The book only has to appeal to someone who wants to possess it; to see it on their shelf; to know that they \\"own\\" it.  Is there a therapeutic value in owning a book?  Read the Book Thief by Markus Zusak (Young Adult Fiction).<br /><br />Bartlett reveals to us that The Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America classifies five types of rare book thieves.  They are:  the kleptomaniac; the profit seeking thief; the angry thief; the casual thief; and the thief who steals for their own personal use.  What is really amazing is Bartlett's discovery that some rare book deals freely admit that they themselves have been tempted to steal a book but all that make that admission also admit that they overcame the temptation.  Pretty astounding!  Equally surprising (and alarming) is the laid back attitude of police when a book theft is reported, and their disbelief of a book's reported value.<br /><br />The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is an engrossing, well researched, and well written thriller that could easily have become a first rate fictional thriller.  Can a movie on this topic be in the offing?<br /><br />I highly recommend The Man Who Loved Books Too Much.
0743298039|4.0|If you love the old gothic novels, then this is for you! It's definitely a book for people who obsess over reading.
0439023491|5.0|Riveting, absolutely riveting!  This was one of the most highly anticipated books on my \\"Must-Read\\" list for the year, and it didn't disappoint.<br /><br />Just as in The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins returns readers to a futuristic world that is vibrant, jarring, and scary--very scary.  Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Gale, and many others are all back in this second installment.  Not only is Katniss going to have to deal with the consequences of her actions from The Hunger Games, President Snow has some other surprises in store for her (and us).  In fact, Catching Fire has so many twists and turns that you won't be able to anticipate what's going to be on the next page, let alone the outcome of the book.<br />What I can share with you, however, is that President Snow is understandably displeased with Katniss, blaming her for the unprecedented outcome of having two winners for the 74th Hunger Games.  As for Katnisss, two boys (or rather, two men) and too much time are just the beginning of her troubles as she starts off on a Victory Tour where she'll be put on display for all twelve districts--including the homes of the tributes she and Peeta killed.  Back under the careful eye of the Capitol, it's only a matter of time before Katniss finds herself, and those she loves, in danger again.<br /><br />My one complaint?  I'm going to have to wait at least a year before I can read the next book.
0312360266|2.0|Unimpressive. I'm actually pretty sick of the \\"teenager with a Destiny and parents who Just Don't Get It gets handed loads of power on a silver platter then gets stuffed into a Bad Situation\\" genre. This addition to the lot is just like every other one, only with vampires. Wait, don't quite a few of these have vampires these days? Whatever. It was written ok, I suppose. Someone said the books get better as you get further into the series. I'm pretty sure I'm not going to find out for myself.
1604590483|5.0|This book covers many topics - in addition to prosperity and wealth - though the core of it seems to deal with how to prosper in life (using Biblical teachings as examples).<br /><br />Summaries break down into steps - which make it helpful for the reader to absorb concepts.<br /><br />High recommended read - in companionship with \\"Think and Grow Rich\\".
B00005JN0T|2.0|The producers give a vague wave to Asimov's book, but that's about it. Now, I'm not one of those sticklers who thinks every line in the movie should be exactly the same as in the book, but this was just silly. Why bother with the name at all? Aside from wanting to cash in on Asimov's reputation, of course.<br /><br />So Wil Smith is excellent as always, and the character of Doctor Kelvin is pretty cool (can't remember who plays her, but at least they don't alter her basic nature too much.) The plot could have been really good - part of the tragedy of this movie is how much potential it had - but the production went for big kabooms instead of any sense of realistic action. The quest for a bigger, badder action scene absolutely ruined this movie. They might have followed the three laws and used plot elements form Asimov's book, but they threw the basic laws of physics out the window and made the whole set-up \\"too stupid to live\\" for the sake of shiny effects instead of playing it straight.<br /><br />All in all, I kind of thought it was going to suck, and I wasn't wrong.
1577314808|5.0|This is a unique book from my perspective. Each paragraph is compelling. The truth is attainable and allows us to live in peace with ourselves and significant others. I have read dozens of self improvement books.  This is a book that delivers what is promised. We can find peace and harmony with others if we live in the present and not the past. The past is where we learnt excessive fear, anger and many other emotions that can destroy us and others. We need to read this book with an open mind. I wonder if the critics(there will always be critics) allowed themselves the opportunity to accept the words in this book.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|So at first, after I watched the first few episodes, I thought it was a bit like watching a train wreck with lots of sex. The characters are often insanely dumb, to the point where you slap your forehead and think \\"You idiot!\\". The thing is, it's realistic. People do act this way. People do stupid stuff all the time. They lie, they do drugs despite knowing it's dumb, they hook up with the wrong person and go along with someone else's lead and get into trouble and yes, it's moronic, but it happens every single day. This time it;s just happening on TV with hot people and vampires. These folks aren't acting out some Dracula wannabe plot - it's every possible bad choice and malicious intent and poor desperate act you've ever heard of, on screen, with good skin and a perky figure. It's a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />By the time I'd finished the series, I'd come to the realization that the writers are pure genius. It takes some serious skills to present this level of idiocy accurately and in a fashion that people will want to watch. It's a perfect black comedy, helped by that fact that most of the actors are playing it like it's a drama, and the vampire characters are playing it like it's a horror. It's not doing anything to help combat the stereotype that \\"southerners are morons\\", but it's certainly entertaining.<br /><br />Yes, I'll watch the second season. You don't see this quality writing every day on TV, that's for certain.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was not what I expected - I expected a step by step how to on ultrarunning - but instead got a great story with great tips effortlessly mixed in!
1416955070|3.0|The story itself was an okay read, but I thought the book was very \\"wordy\\"; it seemed like the author was trying to use every vocab word she knew throughout the entire book. There were so many times I kept wishing she would just tell the story instead of constantly having to describe every little thing. And it often got repetetive because of the constant need to throw in tons of descriptions.     Also, I saw in some other reviews that others mentioned she took some things from other authors, which I too noticed. Kind of annoying when I found those little bits in the book, especially a few that I had not ever seen except by certain other authors, so it made it a bit obvious that she was borrowing ideas for her book.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|There's nothing bad I could say about this film.  The world Ridley Scott created immersed me and should immerse anyone that watches it.  It asks big questions, and has underlying themes, much like a good book.  The best part?  It doesn't spoon feed them to you.    The blu-ray version of this film's picture quality is incredibly sharp, with vivid colours and natural skin tones.  It is, I imagine, as good as you can get for a movie that's 27 years old.  The audio is uncompressed, giving you the absolute best sounding audio possible.    The product.  You get 5 versions of the film.  US theatrical release, international theatrical release, director's cut, the final cut and the workprint version.  You get a documentary that is longer than the film.  You get multiple audio tracks over the final cut, and at least one over all of the other cuts.  On one disc you get deleted footage, more features (such as interviews and information about the book it's based on), trailers and more.    I got it for $17.99, which is a steal.  Even at $23.49, this collection is a must buy.  If you're a die hard fan, pick it up.  If you've never heard of the film until now, pick it up anyway.  Every film goer should have this movie in their collection, and this collector's set leaves you no excuse to not get it.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|I just finished watching the theatrical version of the Watchmen and it is obvious that they took a great deal of time getting every visual detail correct.  Some of the images are pitch perfect to the source material.  That said, the movie had no flow, no passion.      As a fan of the graphic novel, I could fill in the missing pieces - items thrown away in the movie like Dan's last name, the tell all book, why Dr. Manhattan chose to mark his forehead that way, or why he was naked in the first place...  So much of the back story was excised that the important elements - elements that gave the graphic novel so much depth and turned a comic book mini-series into legitimate literature - were made to be unimportant.  You got flashes of the back stories, but ultimately since they don't contribute to the overarching story of nuclear annihilation, they didn't get the screen time they deserve. It is here where the film makers missed the point.  The Watchmen is only about the back stories.      With the back stories, you have a rich meditation on heroism, how great men and women sacrifice who they are to serve the common good, and to what lengths heroes will go to complete their callings.  Without them, you are left with a thin murder mystery involving capes you've never met before, a story that moves so quickly that doesn't give you time to care about the characters, and beautifully filmed violence. That's not good enough.    I'm going to give The Watchmen: Director's Cut a viewing.  If I feel the same way about the movie after I see the extended scenes, then I'm done with it.  In the meantime, I will always have the graphic novel to completely experience the universe that Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons envisioned. And that's the version I whole heartedly recommend with five stars.      As for the movie? Three stars for brilliant, yet vacant, imagery.
6305910340|5.0|I don't know from chess and chess masters, so this supposed biography of chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin may be full of it. But as a solid and delightful film, it stands on its own. Young Josh happens on a group of lowdown characters in the park who play chess for drug money. Something sparks in his mind and he becomes obsessed with the game, and soon moves into the world of competitive chess. You don't have know a thing about chess to love this film. The story is less about the game than about a boy mastering his own fear of failure and his parents grappling with seeing their boy as who he is rather than as an extension of themselves. Sensitively played by Max Pomeranc (Josh), Joe Mantegna (his dad), Laurence Fishburne (chess player in the park) and Ben Kingsley (Josh's chess tutor). Great insight into competitive chess, paralleling Bobby Fisher's strange life.
B0028K31CE|5.0|I like many other Maxwell fans waited sometimes impatiently for the release of a new CD. Black Summer Nights does not disappoint. My husband and I both love the CD.

006135323X|5.0|What is it about an offer of free anything that makes us spend more money than we expected to spend? Do we really have free will when even a casual order of wine with dinner is affected by what those ahead of use have ordered? Why is it that once a price or an item has been establish, all subsequent offers use that price as an anchor?<br /><br />Social scientist Dan Ariely explores those and many more unreasoning human choices with simple, elegant experiments. His experiments are particularly challenging to a purist market understanding of human behavior. If economics assumes that human beings will always pay the right price for a commodity, why are we so vulnerable to being thrown off by marketing and class considerations? Why did black pearls, once thought worthless, suddenly gain \\"value\\" when smartly marketed by a jeweler who associated them with high class? What is about premium products -- like those of a certain ubiquitous coffee house -- that will alter our buying habits, and cause us to maintain those decisions with rationalizations? How is the human inability to determine the relative value of two  unlike items altered when a third item -- more like one of the originals than the other -- is introduced? Are our minds really our own?<br /><br />Ariely's fascinating book explores these mysteries and proposes ways to avoid the traps. Like many social science books (\\"The Tipping Point,\\" for example) it sometimes verges on the simplistic to make a point. Still, great reading!

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have a Maclaren Triumph stroller. This has made me love my stroller. I purchased this based on the reviews on here. I was a little hesitant due to so many people saying that you need to take it on and off when closing the stroller. You do not need to take on and off. I did at first but then I had time to experiment a little and found that the attachment does not need to be snug tight in order to work. I have loosened the velcro attachment so that it is a larger loop. This allows you to close and open the stroller without the hassle of taking it on and off. Thank god! Cause it was a hassle to reattach it everytime. Now the attachment itself is so sturdy and allows drinks to ride securely with the wire frame and elastic. I trusted my hot coffee in it too as the cup holders are deep. I then toss my keys and cell phone and wallet in the mid section. I am so happy with the holder and its a great price compared to others.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am not a long time fan of the original series. In fact, I have never seen any of the original episodes, but I have seen the movies and knew the storyline. To me, this film is a complete restart/reboot/updated version of the classic series, and I loved it! Everybody did an awesome job kick-starting the Star Trek franchise! It has great action sequences, awesome special effects, comedy, sexual tension between Spock and Uhura, and much more! I agree with the commercial, 'This is not your father's Star Trek' We see the birth of James Kirk, building the new U.S.S. Enterprise, Leonard Nimoy returns as the older Spock. The crew meet at Starfleet Academy and train for three years. An evil time-traveling Romulan named Captain Nero alters the past to mess up the future. When Captain Pike is kidnapped by Nero, a new Captain must rise to stop the bad guy! If you are a Trekkie, I highly recommend STAR TREK!!!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|100% these are the best thing you could be for your PS3 controller, everything about them is great. I have used them for months and I have had no major problems.    on a side note, the R2 clip did come off twice, but that was only when I was really pressing hard on it (harder then I needed to), I think I will super glue them on, The controller should have been made this way in the frist place.     ***************************************  Update 02/08/10  6 Months in using these all the time, no problems, they only came off the 2 times I had said, I guess it was just me getting used to them, they stick on nice, I never ended up using spuer glue on them, there great, I can't play without them.  ***************************************
B0001HLVS2|4.0|It's great characterization that make great stories and this film is a great story well told. The major character - His Majesty's Ship - is a creature who we meet at night as Russell Boyd's brilliant camera glides over and through her. We immediately are conscious of claustrophobic innards, her movement, and the complexity of her makeup manifest by the hundreds of ropes, knots, stays, that encase her, thread through her. We get a fish eye view as she weighs anchor. We listen to her groans, creaks,sighs - literally a breathing thing.<br />Much of the joy of the novels is the attention to detail which give the works an authenticity - Peter Weir has achieved a similar success in his attention  to detail. A brilliant journey. Oh yes, the actors are fine. The story exciting. The \\"special effects\\" believable.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|A great movie about the quality of your character. The focus is on who you are, not what you have. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I particularly enjoyed the relationship development of Eastwood and the Hmong neighbors paralleled against the relationship deterioration between Eastwood and his \\"family\\". The connection vs. disconnection element was surprisingly moving. A great movie. Thanks Clint!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a great show that just keeps getting better and better.  The writing is very clever and characters are a riot.

If you haven't seen the show watch a few episodes.  I think you'll  like it.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|WOW! A lot of the reviews posted here are just plain stupid! Allow me to explain if your attention span will permit. After seeing (NO, SUFFERING THROUGH) the overlong, humorless, and just plain EVIL movie entitled THE DARK KNIGHT, I was ready to believe that all anyone ever wants nowadays are dry, dull and just plain serious (\\"realistic\\") movies. Anyone with an ounce of perspicacity can deduce that NONE of the Indiana Jones films are \\"serious\\" or \\"realistic\\" in any way. You folks have been fooled. Did anyone see \\"Temple of Doom\\"? That was the only 'classic' Indy film to get the comic book/adventure formula correct, and most people whined and complained about it. How sad. As dark as that great film was, it was nothing if not absolute fantasy. All of the Indy films are fantasies. There is no difference from ghosts emerging from the mythical Ark of the Covenant than there is in aliens flying away in a space ship. These movies are not jejune in nature; they merely ask you to believe like a child again (something most of you have forgotten how to do). A huge part of the Indy history is that the films themselves are based on movie serials and comics from the 30s and 40s. Not everything has to be heart attack serious folks. While this movie is not great, I really do enjoy the fact that it is cartoonish and fun, as opposed to the awful and serious DARK KNIGHT movie. That piece of crap was NOT for kids, and both young and old should reject it vehemently. However, Indy 4 is just meant to be a fun movie, and nowadays no one can handle that. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was too good for its own good (as the filmmakers forgot that it was merely a tribute/semi-parody and did a very nice job in \\"perfecting\\" it in other ways) and people thought that Indy was supposed to be taken \\"seriously.\\" This is why Indy 2 was such a shock; really, that film should have been Indy 1, and then those of us who are truly fans of this character would have been on the right track from the start. How can you not enjoy seeing Harrison in his trademark outfit again? Calling the man \\"too old\\" (my favorite ignorant quibble amongst movie zombies) is just plain ridiculous. The man knows how to crack a whip, and crack the whip he does. It's just too bad that he didn't use that baby on the intolerable Shia LeBouf before leaving the set of this noble (but deeply flawed) attempt at recapturing lightning in a bottle. (By the way, the Jones films are not Bible stories. Professor Jones is an expert on the occult and mystical things, not Biblical history. Apparently, Lucas and Spielberg do not pay attention to the dialogue in their own scripts. \\"Temple of Doom\\" was the only movie to put the intrepid adventurer's esoteric knowledge to any reasonable use, and more of his adventures should reflect his true occupational interests. However, read the paperback spin-off novels to follow up on my little tidbit.)
B00009ATIX|1.0|I saw about an hour of it I think...then I just had to turn it off.  No pay-off can be worth sitting through more of this.  It's just all so lifeless.  If I paid to see this in a theatre I would very pissed off!  There's just no energy at all.  The subject matter seems like it COULD be interesting, but the director apparently fought hard to make it all as boring and dull as can be imagined.
0374531943|5.0|I got my paperback copy of Carrying The Fire back in the 1970s, and I've been recommending it, re-reading it, quoting from it and giving away copies ever since. And if writing the best book about being an astronaut to date (no ghost writer) AND flying the Command Module for Apollo 11 AND being a Gemini astronaut were not enough, Collins is who we should thank for the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum escaping from that old beige Quonset hut it occupied in the 1960s...<br /><br />When my son wanted to know what it was like to be an astronaut, this was the book we read at bedtime.<br /><br />When I need to demonstrate the need for precise but concise language in technical subjects, I quote Collins' example of the \\"capture latch release handle lock\\" that led him to believe more English majors were needed in the space program.<br /><br />In explaining how to recognize and reward hard work, his story of the \\"Collins Looks Good\\" button that his trainers installed on the Command Module simulator in Houston is the best example.<br /><br />I have never met Michael Collins, but I take inspiration from his words and his deeds. This book changed my life for the better. I'm delighted to hear that it is included in a library of \\"Best Adventure Stories\\". That's perfect. As other reviews have noted, he's refreshingly humble and has a wry and appropriate sense of humor. The writing is rigorously first-person- its the story of what he saw, knew, felt, hoped for, etc. No pretending to know things he didn't witness and no made up words that people were likely to have said.<br /><br />His description also makes it clear (without narcissism) how he, Aldrin and Armstrong came to be the crew of the first Apollo mission to attempt to actually land on the Moon. Even before the crisis brought by the fire in Apollo 1, these three were up to their ears in personally making the program work. Reviewing plans, visiting suppliers, leading from the front, which, as the passengers and crew, they needed to be.<br /><br />Aldrin created the equations to calculate orbital rendezvous for a post-graduate degree. If all the electronics failed, he could work the numbers to get them home with a pencil and paper. Armstrong was not the greatest talker, but he had both the civil profile (a NASA test pilot, not a military test pilot) and the leadership qualities to command a mission which might or might not work, very, very, publicly. Collins was an easygoing, top notch pilot, who made the right decisions with little data or time, steady in a crisis, someone the other two could absolutely count on. Its our luck that he was also a well rounded human with a gift for writing who can bring us along. If you wanted to land someone on the moon and get them back alive, in 1969, in the United States, these over-achieving children of over-achieving parents were the first choices.<br /><br />There are a lot of good books from the 1960s space program, this is simply the best. Pair it with Michael Light's \\"Full Moon\\", a stunning book of NASA photographs, or Jim Lovell's \\"Lost Moon\\" (with Jeffrey Kluger) or Henry F. S. Cooper's \\"A House In Space\\" (about Skylab). Or \\"The Right Stuff\\", which it is the equal to in terms of literary quality, humor and reporting.<br /><br />I can't praise it highly enough.eated the equations to calculate orbital rendezvous for a post-graduate degree.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This was the very first Miyazaki film I ever saw. It was on either HBO or SHOWTIME in the early 1980s when VCRs were still rare things in the average home. I fell in love with every aspect of the film - the artwork, the story, the music. I made a copy which I watched until it fell apart. And then it was gone. Lost. I thought I would never see the movie I knew as \\"Warriors of the Wind\\" ever again.   It was not until comparatively recently that I learned about the man behind the film. It was in a review of \\"Princess Mononoke\\" that I learned the origin of this wonderful epic.   I was shocked to learn that the version of the film I had seen had been butchered to make it \\"more palatable to American audiences\\". All the names had been changed. Nausicaa had been changed to Zandra. The Omu were called Gorgons. And key scenes had been chopped out. This DVD restores the film to what it's original form. For this we have John Lasseter of PIXAR animation to thank. Without his friendship and respect  for Mr. Miyazaki, this film, as well as his other masterpieces, might never have been seen in this country in their proper form.   If you love this film as much as I do, you should check out the original manga series on which it is based (drawn and written by Hayao Miyazaki of course). The manga is even richer and there are many more factions vieing for power in the post-apocalyptic world of the Toxic Jungle. The events from the film are in the manga, but they are only the merest tip of a huge and very rich iceberg. [[ASIN:1591164087 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 1]][[ASIN:1591163501 Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Vol. 2]]  As a final note, I have personally put together a kind of trilogy of Miyazaki films [[ASIN:B000065K6N Princess Mononoke]] as the past, [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]] as the present, and Nausicaa as the future. I think we can also work [[ASIN:B00005JKYG Castle in the Sky]] and [[ASIN:B000CDGVOE Howl's Moving Castle]] into this series as well.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|At least 2/3 of the songs are excellent, the others are ok but not horrible, not total filler or anything.  The excellent songs, like \\"Northern Skies,\\" \\"Grafton Street,\\" and \\"Burning Love\\" are immensely atmospheric and can be listened to over and over without tiring of them.  I am simply in love with the sound of Dido's voice.  Lyrics are evocative and poetic, yet unpretentious, not too artsy-fartsy or anything.  The trip-hop beats are simple yet powerful.  In many ways I actually prefer this her latest album to the previous two, which were perhaps a bit more pop-like and radio-friendly.<br /><br />Overall, Dido's music at its best has a sublime balance of soft and strong that is extremely addictive.
0784011680|4.0|A lot can be said as to how authentic the passages in the movie were but it takes nothing away from the excellent acting and the important recollection of early movie history. For many later generations (my own included) Chaplin has stood as a mere comedian, Buster Keatons 'successor' who bridged the gap into the talking movies etc. There was so much more to the man not the least his increasing political statements that in the end led to him being expelled from the US during the Communist witch hunt haydays......<br /><br />I certainly learned a lot from this movie and while being mesmorized by particularly Robert Downey Jr's performance I gained an appetite for learning more about this remarkable little English man, all the while I was thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />To me a big 4 stars (which you will realise from the body of my reviews is very very rare)
B0002WS3S2|5.0|Highly eccentric, good jams, spacey flowerchild, pothead pixie.  Gong defies description.  \\"You\\" is the last in the Radio Gnome Invisible trilogy, but I daresay that it is a good place to start for trying this unusual band.  Not for the feint hearted, or those unwilling to have their notions of music challenged.  It took a few spins, but I'm digging it.  Why don't you try?  Bye-Bye!
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|What follows read like CliffsNotes from Michael Mann's filmography: with the hero caught in a love triangle the mob hires a dangerous psychopath to bump off public officials and turn it's DA into an instrument of revenge. As a whole it's convoluted, pedantic and uncharacteristic of ever having been Batman. Christian Bale's reprisal of the character is unsympathetically wooden, a hero ready to throw in the towel at the first hint of unpopularity (as opposed to an unrelenting crusader). Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent is dumbed down to a plot point leaving the notion that anybody set on fire with murdered loved ones will become a raving lunatic (as opposed to deep-seeded demons being the cause). And while Ledger's Joker is indeed brilliant it's no help to Christopher Nolan who does his best to turn him into a run-of-the-mill psychopath.    Nolan has never cared for pathos. In fact any there is he attempts to beat you over the head with as a tired cops & robbers epic. Arkham Asylum is never mentioned in the sequel because Nolan & Co. don't like a villain that when accused of being crazy simply boasts, \\"Gloriously so!\\" They'd rather not explore the underbelly of madness that Gotham attracts nor have The World's Greatest Detective do any detecting. Nolan's at a loss: as long as ethnic mafiosa stereotypes are sneering at the camera he's happy. The Gotham City here is the most gullible metropolis in America, jumping at the idlest of threats and driven to murder with a mere phone call.    What story conveyed weaves along from impossible circumstance to impossible circumstance bordering on character omnipotence. Sad too that Ledger's Joker drives that plot to nowhere and, with what little screentime he's given, is still the only likable character in the movie. His is a villain so cunning and grounded you realize not only could this Batman never beat him but he's the only character that knows what's going on.
B0025T65GC|2.0|This music is from the same guy who did \\"Terria\\"?  It's not possible. No way. I think that Terria is one of the best discs in my collection, and I've been patient with follow-on efforts like Accelerated Evolution which was powerful but predictable. How can Ki be from the same guy? It's got to be some kind of joke. The CD that I purchased, which is called KI, by Devin Townsend, is awful.     Look, I'm not saying that I expect another Terria. But this sounds like two kids playing around with a drum machine and tape recorder in their basement. Sorry to be so harsh, but how can anyone in their right mind give this 5 stars? I get the feeling that Devin could put out a CD of fart jokes and it would get 5 stars. Seriously folks...it's just entertainment.
0743298039|2.0|I tried very hard to reach the final pages of this boring novel. The very good reviews published by other readers and the beautiful cover made me buy it and read it to to the end. But this was one of a slow and boring book. Better skip it and try another one.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|Wow, is this an involving story. It hooks you in fast and really grabs hold. It's very good in that aspect because it really makes you care about what happens. The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.    Angelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman (\\"Christine Collins\\") in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later, the \\"proud\\" police department brings her kid back, making it a good PR session. Unfortunately, it's not her kid and stupidly, although she's naturally upset about, she poses with the kid and takes him home. (Would that really happen?). Then she begins her quest of finding her real \\"Walter.\\"    Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride - you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time - but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hour-plus of entertainment. By the end, you'll be emotional exhausted.    Kudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece. Where else can you feel you're back 75-80 years in time with the boxy cars and flapper hats than in movies?    (Note: the Blu-Ray is not that much sharper than the regular DVD, but at $19.99 it's still a good deal.)
B0026RHR6K|3.0|Just got my boxset in the mail, paid $137.00 for it. Great packaging and overall sturdiness of the main box. However the individual boxes for each season hold the discs in an awkward fashion. The front cover is a flap that is closed via a little Velcro tab, inside the box the discs are held in slots cut out from a cardboard insert. This insert moves up and down within the box making it annoying to try and pull a disc out let alone put the disc back into its cutout slot. To put the disc back in you have to spread the slot apart with one hand and slide the disc back in with the other otherwise it is quite a pain to stick the disc in. Also when putting the discs back I cant help but feel like i am going to scratch the disc since they are sliding against cardboard.     The Cylon figure is nice, nothing too special. You can pose it, however the plastic feels cheap like it could break. The figure is housed in a plastic sleeve on the top of the main box in a cutout hole. Once you take it out there is a big ugly hole on the top of your box which looks really bad when its empty. The plastic sleeve can be put back into the hole on the top of the box but it still looks hideous. I'll just be leaving the Cylon figure inside the box.    Overall its a nice boxset, but for the price that its advertised for, it should have been better.
B00260HH3K|1.0|This film was appalling to all fans of the dragonball manga, the dragonball anime and the cinema itself! With some appalling acting from Justin Chatwin (Goku) and Jamie Chung (chi-chi) it was impossible to know if you had paid to get into the cinema or were watching a school play. Akira Toriyame's story was destroyed when it was decided that this film would be a poor blend of the beginning and end of the anime, they might as well have thrown the Mona Lisa in a fire place!   However some interesting stunts were performed and some extraordinary special effects were used, FOX should have put the money elsewhere as a promising film was given to butchers and torn to pieces.   This film should never have seen the light of day, it was worse than home alone 4!
B002GYI9C4|4.0|This is definitely a great story, but what really caught me was the magic system involved.  The ingesting of metals to bring about temporary magical abilities is a strange and wonderful idea.  I found the story overall very satisfying and related well with the characters.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. And its so special because Get Lifted is easily one of the best \\"Soul\\" albums to come out in the last 20 years. John Legend is a very soulful dude, and he makes that very obvious on his debut album. Coming into Get Lifted, not to many people knew a whole lot about Mr. Legend except that he was an associate of the great Kanye West, and was featured on a lot of Kanyes earlier music. But soon  after this album was released, John Legend turned into one of the most talented musicians of our time. Not only does he have one of the most unique and soulful voices ever, but he also  plays the piano better than most music teachers and he produces a lot of his own stuff. But im warning you now, if you are expecting Get Lifted to be a typical 2000 and something R&B album, your mistaken, because this album is nothing like 90% of the other R&B albums getting released these days. I definitely wouldnt say John is a contemporary  R&B artist or a Neo-soul, even though he dabbles in both sub genres occasionally. The best way to describe his music is soulful. But when i say \\"Soulful\\", i dont mean in a old and boring way. John Legend brings a new and fresh swagger to the Soul genre. Because while his music is extremely soulful, like on the touching retro soul track \\"Stay With You\\", he still is able to successfully incorporate hip hop into his music to give it that extra spice and keep his tracks from getting boring, like on the Kanye West produced cheaters anthem \\"Number One\\". And throughout the whole album, not once does he come off as a fake. No one else in the music industry could have pulled off the breath taking ballad \\"Ordinary People\\", and no one could have sang it as wonderful as he did either. And he has a couple of Grammys now to show off after this stunning modern day classic, and he owes alot of that to \\"Ordinary People\\", because that was the song that launched his career in the direction its heading now. No one in this world knew just how big that single was, until it was all over the radio gaining John Legend alot of much deserved publicity and recognition. This album is a front to back banger, its one of those extremely rare albums that you can put in and listen to without skipping a single track. From the banging mid tempo \\"Used to Love U\\", to the mellow \\"She Don't Have to Know\\", this album is a classic. The sugary sweet ballad about falling deeply in love \\"Refuge\\" is another phenomenal track that shows his true soulfulness. And on \\"It Don't Have to Change\\", i can already picture this song being sung at family bar b ques and reunions all over the nation with its rumbling church soul vibe lol. Get Lifted already truly made John Legend a superstar, and a sure fire R&B hall of famer in the future... i already can't wait for the next album!          Grade:  A
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. was very interesting, exposing the industrial food complex hidden-but-normal practices and their crafty PR / lobbying / branding machine.<br /><br />It was unique in it's presentation - as it was shown at a mainstream cinema - and it may influence minds, but for me, and I am sure for others, it was preaching to the choir.<br /><br />It was OK for a documentary. It featured Michael Pollan, one of my favorite modern investigative writers in the general health field. You might have heard of some of his books... The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. He seems pretty objective and level-headed.<br /><br />Food, Inc. wasn't really a vegetarian or vegan windfall, because it didn't come down especially hard on the eating of meat. It was hard on GMO products / labeling / patenting / subsidizing and the problems associated with large-scale meat production with the attendant medications and the revolting living conditions.<br /><br />Many points were made, such as that cows aren't supposed to eat corn, and studies show a massive increase of E.Coli in their systems when they are fed it. Corn is the basic feed of cattle. When returned to a natural grass diet, the E. Coli levels dropped back to normal low levels.<br /><br />Food Inc, could have been more entertaining / engaging, but its message was timely and needed.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Basically, anyone who uses R2 or L2 as their trigger button, should get these. They snap on easily, with a solid fit! It actually feels like its part of the button its self. The price is a little off hand, but at least they work.
0143038419|5.0|Thank you Liz!!! I love this book. It's a blast! I'm a third of the way through...will post another review when finished. God Bless! Awesome, lovely, honest. I'm learning so much and appreciate Ms. Gilbert's insight and her intellect. Italy is definitely at the top of my list of places to explore.
143911000X|4.0|Listening to the audiobook is definitely the best way to read this.  Barney Stinson himself narrates.  It was a good way to pass the time, and the accompanying pdf file is pretty funny, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read this unless you're a huge huge fan of How I Met Your Mother and Neil Patrick Harris.
1400079276|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. Reading it may make you feel very random at parts and it may make no sense to some readers but Murakami's ability to keep you interested and turning to the next page is truly remarkable. I do highly recommend this book and some of his other works as well.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|One of the few albums I listen to all the way through. Most of my friends didn't get it the first time they heard it but I kept playing it when they were around and now they love it. Definately an album that needs several spins before \\"it\\" hits you.
B0026ZNL7Q|4.0|For me, what makes Riverside stand out is the vocal talent of Mariusz. He has an emotional tone that fits this style of music to a tea. Even his screams/growls are done tastefully. This release has more of an upbeat aggressive classic rock vibe, a different direction for the group, and I like it. There are some mellow passages but no ballads. Good job on the production. All instruments blend well, the keyboards are more pronounced in the mix, there seems to be more vocal overdubs than usual (makes a really thick sound), and the bass is punchy and audible. Also, I really like the jazzy brass section on \\"Egoist Hedonist\\". Nice change of pace, I wish it lasted longer.     I'll probably never have the opportunity to see Riverside live so this 40-minute DVD is the next best thing. The video quality is average and the audio mix is stereo only. The set list and the performance are good but the other band mates need to step up and do more backing vocals. Also, they seem to be timid, lacking in confidence onstage.     Overall, I like the new direction Riverside has taken. This is a killer disc that gets better with every listen and will be one of my contenders for album of the year.
0385341008|4.0|I had heard this book was fabulous. I was hesitant to read it, knowing it was a series of letters back and forth. It was a lovely surprise. Great character development. A swiftly moving plot. The characters came to life and felt genuine. It may not have a lot to discuss for a book group, but it was a charming little book.
B0026RHR6K|4.0|The complete series box set is a *big* box, not something that will fit easily on a shelf.  The box is quite sturdy, with each season's discs packaged in their own sleeve (four in all).  These sleeves are cardboard with flip up covers; inside, the discs are nested in a folded cardboard separator.      Some have claimed that this set would include the movie \\"Caprica\\", but it is *not* included.  The 25 DVDs in this set are the same DVDs available in the 6 season sets (1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5).    The series was produced in HD, which means a wide-screen presentation; however, it was deliberately shot with a grainy look to give it a 'gritty' film quality.    Why get this collection instead of the six season sets?  You get a neat Cylon Centurion figurine (and it's good sized!), but no booklet, a huge box, and inferior internal packaging.  I bought the series this way mainly because it was (slightly) cheaper than purchasing the six season sets individually; nevertheless, I'm experiencing a bit of buyer's remorse.
0307588335|5.0|This is not your average \\"business book\\" but rather, something more. The author is a great story teller while describing what it was like to be a crew member on the deck of the titanic. Funny, riveting and factual account of the fall of the 4th largest investment firm creating the largest  bankruptcy in U.S. history and how it almost toppled the worlds economies. Bring it to the beach or settle into the hammock this summer and feel what it's like to be in the belly of a beast named Lehman. This is a great page turner.
B001FB55H6|4.0|First Thing....<br />i never read the comic, but was interested in the following that this franchise brings. quite the hype, i must say.<br />I'm actually very torn about this movie, i like it in general but there's alot i dont understand and will have to rewatch it to get everything.<br />It was too long, I bought the blu ray directors cut, because i always feel like i'm getting ripped off if i buy the theatrical version. I wanna see the film the way the director intended not what they edited out for theatrical viewing. Regardless it was too long and alot could have been taken out and the impact would have been the same. at least for me.<br />Alot of people are not happy about the amount of violence in this movie. I didnt find the violence as graphic as people are making it out to be. I'm sure everyone has seen a horror movie before so i dont know what the big deal is here. The rating is \\"R\\" for \\"graphic violence, Sexuality, nudity, and language.\\" Bottom line: Read the Warning/Rating before watching the movie.<br />Second thing people are not happy about is the Full Frontal Nudity of John Manhattan. Big deal, really. We've been looking at women naked for years. Aside from that, the nudity was done very very tastefully. Never once was the nudity used in a sexual situation. It brought beauty to the male form that no film has ever was able to do. I applaud the director for bringing that into the film in such a graceful natural way.<br />Really everyone, if you don't want to see this stuff, watch the theatrical version. thats why its available.<br />I guess i rate it 4 stars as i'm so intrigued by the characters and the storyline and watching this film in blu way was wonderful. A great example of what Blu Ray should be.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|I was never a comic book person, so I didn't know about Watchmen until I saw the trailer for the movie. Love at first sight! I bought the Smashing Pumpkins song used in the trailer from Amazon MP3 Downloads. I bought the graphic novel and bit my nails for 2 days waiting for it to come. Almost blew an artery when I read that the release date might be held up because of movie studio b.s.! Never in my life have I felt this way about a piece of media. And so now it bugs me to no end to read the reviews of people who didn't read the book (!!!!) and are apparently total action junkies like my 11 year old (!!!) and dare to say things like \\"it was boring\\" or \\"the story never got pumping\\". Its not an action movie. Nobody ever said it was an action movie. Its a character study (have never used those words before in my entire life) about ordinary people who dared to live un-ordinary lives. Why would someone do that? What are the consequences of such a decision? And what does a person who literally can do anything he wants, actually do? Is he human? Does he have human feelings? And if he isn't human, what about the humans that he is surrounded by? Are they worse or better than him? These things are explored in Watchmen. Personality and nature vs. nuture. You want action and not to have to think while watching a movie? This is not the movie for that.     And as for the person who said that people were tricked into taking their kids? No way. This movie was clearly rated R. And NOBODY said it was for kids! I told my kid that he has to be 13 before I even let him read the book! Maybe I'll let him see the movie when he's 17. Any parent who took a kid to this movie (and there was such a moron at the showing I went to) needs to go to parenting classes or have their kid taken away, cause they clearly don't know how to be a good parent. Read the ratings people! Same thing happened with Sin City and 300. Just cause it looks like a cartoon, doesn't mean children should be there.    Final:this is a good movie. Its a great movie. Its a visually stunning drama and it absolutely deserves all the praise it gets. Perhaps the author will get over himself and embrace this lovely tribute to his vision. Fingers crossed.
B000002J1I|2.0|After having discovered Fragile a few years earlier, by the time Tormato came out I was already known around campus as a certified \\"Yes Freak\\". So when it hit the shelves, and I couldn't wait to hear what my musical heroes had in store for me.  It was impossible to imagine how they would top their previous effort, \\"Going For the One\\".  Upon seeing the record, my first reaction was to the Hipgnosis cover art. I was oddly amused at the audacity of the tomato splattered against the surreal monochromatic photo of a stilted marching drummer in a suit and how non-Roger Deanish it was.  Nevertheless, I played this record to death, just like all the others, but that should have been my first clue that something about this Yes album would be very different than its predecessors.    Fast forward 30 years.  I was just listening to Tormato again (for the zillionth time) on a road trip.  My five year old daughter loves it - which is cool - but I found myself being really critical.  Let's face it, this is a great band and these are well written songs, but they don't really measure up to Yes's usual standards.      It starts off well enough with \\"Future Times/Rejoice\\", but the first thing you notice is that the recording quality is just awful.  Rick Wakeman's keyboards have this cheap Casio tone that gives the music kind of a cheesy sound.  Listen further and, while Steve Howe's playing is masterful as always, his electric guitar is downright tinny.  Chris Squire's bass is full of pedal effects and mixed to sound almost unrecognizable as a bass - let alone his mighty Rickenbacker.  Alan White's drums are kind of dull and muted.  Only Anderson's vocals are spared abuse.    Next we are treated to one of the only times (thankfully) when Yes has ventured into socially and politically conscious waters with \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\".  Again, it's not that it's a bad song; it's just a bad Yes song.  The video, if you've ever had the pleasure of watching it, is like something created in a first year video production course and only makes the song sound that much worse.    \\"Madrigal\\" is a beautiful tune but with Wakeman's harpsichord taking center stage it just sounds like more cheese - he should have gone with the grand piano and given it some of the soaring chamber music quality of \\"Turn of the Century\\".  Anderson's vocals and Howes' brilliant classical guitar chops almost make up for it.  But listen to the lyrics.  It's like Baroque meets Close Encounter of the Third Kind.  Okee dokee.     The next track, \\"Release Release\\", comes on and it starts to sound like they bought all their instruments from Toys R Us.  Not only that but the song is just embarrassingly lame, with some gimmicky devices like 'faux concert sounds' and 'faux rock drum solo'.  There may be a healthy dose of irony at work here, but it's hard to tell.  It may have been meant as some commentary on the anarchist punk movement that was becoming popular at the time.  Still, as a 'rock' song, it falls way short of tunes like \\"Parallels\\", \\"Roundabout\\" or \\"All Good People\\".      Now enter \\"Arriving UFO\\".  Don't look for any eloquent metaphors or allegory wrapped in poetry here - this is a song about a real alien spaceship!  There's even a musical break that dramatizes \\"the landing\\" (which sort of recalls the battle sequence in \\"Gates of Delirium\\").  Wakeman's keyboard is in full Casio mode here and we are now deep inside the Tormato experience.  It suddenly hits you that this is not going well.  There may be zero chance of having a \\"Fragile\\" or \\"Close to the Edge\\"-like experience. But what the hell, it's Yes, so let's keep listening.    And then,...dear god, no.  Not a song about a circus!  WTF?  \\"Circus of Heaven\\" is the one that you will probably skip over the most.  If I had ever played a song like that at one of our high school keggers, I might have gotten my ass kicked.  It should only have appeared on a Jon Anderson solo album.  Any song that has a kid talking about \\"candy floss and toffee apples\\" shouldn't even be categorized as rock.  Sorry guys.    \\"Onward\\" is another gorgeous song but totally out of place on a Yes record.  This would have made a really nice Paul McCartney ballad and if Sir Paul had recorded this song it probably would have been a huge hit.  Unfortunately, Yes's handling of it just sounds sappy, especially with the horrifying French horn solo.      Finally - thankfully - there is ONE classic Yes treasure on Tormato; \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\".  To this day the opening riff is still a crowd favorite during Chris Squire's bass solos (think \\"Tempus Fugit\\" or \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\"). This song is a 'must have' in any Yes fan's collection, and as the closing tune on the record it almost redeems the entire album - but not quite.    The main problem with Tormato is that the production just sounds like drek, and most of the songs are not going to be well remembered.  All band-member's playing is at top level, and some of the arrangements are well conceived, but overall the final product suffers from bad instrument, mixing or song choices.  I only give this album two stars because I know how much better my favorite group can really be.
0312370849|4.0|This book, alternating viewpoints between a young girl in Paris in 1941 and a woman in Paris in 2002, kept me wanting to read more.   The subject matter, while heavy, is fascinating to experience, especially in the early chapters when we are with the young girl.  The author cleverly weaves a plot line that ties the two women together and the reader learns of a remarkable, yet brutal time in European history.    When the viewpoint of the young girl disappears (half way through), I was disappointed, yet the writing is so good that we care enough about the woman to finish the rest of the novel.  We root  for her as her revelations bring about a metamorphosis.  It shows that knowledge of events learned about the past can have a profound impact on the present.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|I just want to start off to say that this is a review of the film, not a technical review of the DVD itself.    We have entered the age of prequels and reboots. It seems like every franchise or recognizable name has been rebooted. James Bond, Batman, Hulk, heck, even Jason Voorhees has been rebooted. Some reboots are necessary while others just seem like they wanted to cash in on a recognizable name.    When I heard they were going to reboot James Bond, I was cautiously optimistic. Cautious because they could reboot it and make it worse, optimistic because the franchise really was in need of it. James Bond has always been kind of campy and goofy, but when they started to have invisible cars and media tycoons as the main villain, you know the line has to be drawn somewhere. In my opinion, prior to [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]], [[ASIN:B000LY4KWO GoldenEye]] was the last good James Bond movie.    Fortunately for us, [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]] turned out to be fantastic. Martin Campbell directed an action movie that was full of plot but was not boring, and full of action but was not ridiculous. When James Bond fought someone in the movie, it wasn't a karate chop to the chest and down goes the bad guy, you have him clobbering someone with a closed fist, throwing him through walls, slamming is face into the wall, getting his face slammed into a wall, and this goes on with such brutality that you swear the scene was not planned but was a real fight between Daniel Craig and whatever poor soul pissed him off. Then you have extremely smart dialog that you would expect from some Oscar bait movie, including the obligatory scene where M verbally neuters Bond (my favorite). You have characters that you either find intriguing or you find yourself attached to. Lastly, James Bond solves the mystery and defeats the villain through his own wits and perseverance, not through gadgets that were conveniently given to Bond right before a situation arises where he would need it.All of this together made for probably the best Bond movie I have seen.    So after [[ASIN:B001DSNF8C Casino Royale]], I couldn't wait for the next James Bond under this new universe. Yes, more crazy chases, more Bond brutally beating people into a pulp, more intense character interactions... Unfortunately, what we get instead, is Quantum of Solace...    Sure we get chases, but that's about all we get. It starts off with probably the best scene in the entire movie, and it's a chase scene with him and his Aston Martin. But the movie is literally one chase that leads to another chase, that leads to another chase, that eventually leads into a chase that leads to the final villain... You think I'm joking? The \\"plot\\" is composed of random scenes of people giving flat performances and very dull dialog that ultimately links one chase scene to the other. What about the fight scenes? Don't get me started on the \\"fight\\" scenes. The fight scenes are filmed in that quick-cutting ultra zoomed in fashion and the fights themselves are those fast watch the main character move some limbs and magically the enemy is down and out on the floor style fights made so popular by the Bourne movies. So what you get is some really quick cutting shaky cam of some limbs moving (you can't even tell whose limbs they are to be honest) and what started with two people coming at each other ends with Bond standing and the other guy on the ground. But really, you have no clue what just happened... In short, the \\"fights\\" sucked.    I think part of the reason for this is the director. They picked Marc Forster, and if you look at his resume, he doesn't have any action movies under his belt. Prior to the film coming out, I expressed this as a concern, and people flamed me to no end because of that. They said I was shallow, that if I wanted to see nothing but action I should watch Commando, etc. etc. etc. But they don't understand the point of my concern. My concern was that a GOOD action movie director knows how to balance action with a deep plot. While a lot of non-action movie directors do one of two things. They either deliver great character development and plot but sub-par action, or they overcompensate for their lack of action experience with lots and lots of action to the point where it is ridiculous and the plot and characters get left behind. Of course there are many exceptions, such as Jon Favreau and [[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man]], but in this case with Marc Forster, we got stuck with the latter scenario: Way too much ridiculous action and not enough plot.    Unfortunately for the next one, they can't have Martin Campbell back on board because he'll be busy with The Green Lantern. I just hope that they get someone who's experienced in making movies with deep plots and healthy doses of action.    I'm sure a lot of people thought this movie was great and enjoyed all of the action, but for me it just doesn't compare to Casino Royale. Not by a long shot.
0553212419|5.0|I recommend this collection for everyone. It is a literary classic that can capture any reader. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle most definitely outdid himself with his character Sherlock Holmes, giving him an addictive nature that causes the reader to want more cleverness, more deduction, more smart comments, making the reader delve further and further into the book to satiate his or her obsession. This will forever be one of my favorite books.
1573228737|5.0|I notice one of the reviewers here said this is not an erotic novel.  In fact, it's more erotic than a novel that actually involves graphic sexual actions or thoughts.  What a fabulous storyteller is Sarah Waters.  I've read every one I can get my hands on, and can't wait to read her latest.  She's right up there in my pantheon of Great Women Writers/Literary Goddesses - Joyce Carol Oates, Toni Morrison...wow.  I get lost in her wor(l)ds.
6305609705|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola using Vietnam as the setting for a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's modernist literary masterpiece \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was brilliant. I love this film. It rocks my world to this day. I love some foreign films, but for me America has produced most of the greatest films. Why I dare say that is because of films like this (and those other two masterpieces by Coppola The Godfather 1 and 2).<br /><br />The film isn't meant to be an accurate historical drama in the sense of depicting actual events that took place such as a rogue U.S. commando forming his own private gorilla army in Cambodia to fight the Vietcong while being worshiped as a deity (See the reviews below for how *not* to view this film.). Don't be so literal folks. But, it is true enough that \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a unfavorable depiction of war and being that it is set in Vietnam, of that war in particular. There are political dimensions to this film, no doubt. Regardless of how ya feel about that, however, everything from the making of the film and about the film itself is interesting (See the excellent doc \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\\" for the ultimate \\"making-of\\", \\"behind the scenes\\" film).<br /><br />*The acting is fantastic.<br />*The cinematography - excellent, gorgeous.<br />*The directing -top notch-.<br />*The script is compelling and suspenseful and contains some of the most memorable lines in recent film history.<br />*The setting is perfect and the story is based on a classic of literature.<br />*Great music in this picture too! The use of The Door's \\"The End\\" at the beginning is incredible. And Wagner...<br />We movie lovers live for those moments don't we?<br /><br />But hey, if you do want a most interesting, illuminating, and highly critical review then you must see--<br />Richard T. Jameson's review for \\"Apocalypse Now\\".<br /><br />Google that. Check it out. (I still love the film after having read Jameson's review, but he scores some points.)

This is not only Russian culture transplanted to England but mob culture, which is a subculture of a subculture. I think it's my existentialist underpinnings that draw me to that, the idea that we create our own reality through our culture and our art. We create a reality that seems as real as anything else, but in fact, it's quite transitory and is really a projection of our own creative will. And so, too, it is with this crime family and that we discover in EASTERN PROMISES.\\" -David Cronenberg.<br /><br />Fascinating, yes? Well summing up in in couple of sentences the story, a nurse (Watts) stumbles into the world of the Russian mafia in England after taking an interest in a patient that died in her hospital and the patients newly born baby.

He actually traveled deep into Russia \\"a couple of time zones east of Moscow, Saint Petersberg, and the Urals\\" to a place called Yekaterinburg, located far from Western Europe and that \\"feels quite different\\".

I'd have to say \\"Eastern Promises\\" is in the top 6-7 films \\"gangster/mob films\\" ever made -which is saying a lot.

B001FB55H6|2.0|First of all, I want to say that I looooove the graphic novel and I would recommend the book to anyone.  The movie on the other hand was a bit on the boring side.  I don't know quite how to explain my disappointment, but I will say this.  I love Batman and I love Ironman, I know their stories from the comic books and I love the way they were portrayed on film in the last couple of years.  Watchmen let me down because it was EXACTLY like the novel and there was really no reason why  I should have watched it; thus, making the movie really boring because there was nothing new for me to enjoy.     The Blu ray is jam packed with features that are really enjoyable and I could only recommend watching it if someone already owns this or if you're a die hard fan.      I can recommend the graphic novel, but I wouldn't recommend this movie.
B001JKGF9A|3.0|This book (audiobook) was a disappointment.  I must say that Dawkins and his wife do a reasonable job with narration and this can keep the reader engaged for the most part.  However, the arguments and logical games are more like 'Introduction to Atheism 101' as opposed to anything truly exciting or interesting.  In the past, I had already pondered most of the ideas that Dawkins discusses (though not with the necessary vocabulary to express it), and I expect someone with more historical or philosophical background in this area would find the book downright boring.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the ego boost associated with Dawkins preaching (since I'm converted), and was able to gain at least a few new perspectives about theisms.  I would definitely recommend this book to younger people and/or those who have not really thought about atheism much, but have suddenly become interested in it.  Also, it's important to note that Dawkins is unable to address many issues like his soft spot for eastern religions, the anthropological and social benefits of religion, the potential for conflict even in the absence of religion and the practical challenges of getting rid of religion.  Now it would be unfair to expect him to deal with all this in just one book (and he's probably addressed some of them in other places), but those are the areas that I would have been more interested in.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|If you check my review history, I was really critical of the shows third season and was ready to give up on this show.  Luckily for me, I stuck around.  Season 4 (shortened for the strike) was significantly better, faster paced than Season 3 and Season 5 has brought this show back from the dead.    You can't beat this show right now.  It moved like a freight train for me and didn't lag on plot lines.    Season finale was perfect.    This is one of the few television shows that has come back from being nearly unwatchable.
B001UREJWM|4.0|Everybody loves Sabbath and this album doesn't disappoint. These guys have influenced almost every metal musician. If you like this album, you really should listen to Dio's \\"Strange Highways\\". Tony Iommi's playing on this album sounds eerily like Tracy G.'s style. Looks like Tracy G.( a monster guitar player who is under-appreciated) has influenced one of the greats. Buy both albums.
0061231401|4.0|I have read all of Rollins' books and if you like his other Sigma Force novels you will like \\"The Doomsday Key.\\" If you have read this far you know the plot. As always with Rollins' books, \\"Doomsday\\" was very well written. It grabbed me from the start and never let up. Rollins seems to find a way to perfectly balance history in each novel with action and adventure. Also, I was glad to see Painter Crowe back in the field and out of the office. I would rate \\"Doomsday\\" as very good, but not as good as \\"Map of Bones\\" or \\"Black Order.\\"  But if you like Rollins other books, you'll like \\"The Doomsday Key.\\"
0743270754|5.0|I just finished Team of Rivals and I loved it. The story of Abraham Lincoln is a familiar one to be sure, but Goodwin takes a familiar subject and expands the context. The read is engaging and although a \\"Lincoln book\\", the story delves deeply into the other figures surrounding Lincoln. In bringing to light the other men, the book sheds further light on Lincoln. It gives a great insight into Lincoln's personality and his ability to bring together so many divergent interest into a cohesive whole. I would whole heartedly recommend this book, and will most likely read it again (a true rarity).

B00005JLCI|5.0|I love Kenneth Branagh Shakespeare- and this is no exception. Beautifully acted and produced, this is faithful to the play, whilst still allowing some modern interpretation. Unlike many other Shakespeare productions, you can understand what the characters are feeling and saying, even if you don't fully understand the literal meaning of every word, because the emotion and personality are brought forward through excellent acting. So often with Shakespeare you get the impression that the actors are just saying the words- that even they don't understand what they are saying. Not so here.  A fantastic watch- break it up into acts, four hours is long- and let the language just wash over you.
1400063736|5.0|The inspiration for Colum McCann's tale of `70's New York City is Philippe Petit's tightrope walk, strung between the now gone Twin Towers.  People too young to have lived at that time will be jolted at the thought of such a walk...those of us who were kicking around the universe at that time will unravel a small germ of a memory and try to remember where we were when we heard the news of Petit's quirky, death-defying journey that summer day, now 35 years ago.<br /><br />McCann takes this centerpiece of his tale to weave short vignettes of observers lives, observers in that NYC melee that day, kaleidoscopically trailing lives through shadows of other lives.  Populated with priests, prostitutes, grieving mothers, socialites, judges, immigrants and artists, McCann brings them all to life.  Do they connect at random, or are they meant to find each others' paths that strange day?  Each of them views the incredible act of the quixotic Petit as a symbol.  Each, in turn, becomes part of McCann's tapestry of redemption.  We go on, we do, in spite of all odds - the human condition is never more strikingly illustrated than in this novel.<br /><br />His prose wondrous, his vision clear, McCann starts slowly, but leaves his readers breathless.  I can't tell you how much I loved this book; it has stayed with me and and resurrected itself again and again in the month since I finished.  As Gloria, one of the book's most sympathetic character says...  \\"Sometimes you've got to go up to a very high floor to see what the past has done to the present\\"...<br /><br />Take that journey to that high floor - don't delay.  This novel gets my highest recommendation; read it as soon as you can and celebrate McCann's work.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Persuasion is my favourite Austen, so I may be a little biased, but I've yet to see an adaption of this which fully does the book justice. The Amanda Root version comes pretty close and is faithful to the book, but it fails to really capture the repressed passion of Anne (and the actress was far too old- she's meant to be 27!)  That said this newer version really massacres Anne's character. She's meant to be intellegent, quiet, yet confident and aware of her own worth, despite her family. In this version she is a mousy, retiring, boring victim. There is little chemistry between the two leads and the male lead shows little emotion (or acting skill). They were both pretty nauseating actually.  And OH MY GOD- the ending. I know others have mentioned it, but I have to say- what the ???  Fifteen minutes of her running here and there with her skirts hiked up to her knees.   And then the kiss. What to say about that. Here was one last chance to show a little romance, a little chemistry, to make the audience believe that they were in love.   It was the worst kiss in a movie that I have ever seen. I am NOT exagerating. The movie is worth watching just for this bit, because it is so bad that it's funny. You don't see his face or expression at all and Anne's doing this verrry slow inching her face towards him while opening and closing her mouth like a fish- and he just stands there. Makes me think that he's actually looking at something else, because he doesn't get involved at all.  Overall it's not awful, worth a watch if you have to see every Austen adaptation ever made (which I do), but the last ten minutes bring it down from average to bad.  If only producers would run their Austen adaptations by me first. Sigh.
B001TKK39S|4.0|A few years ago DG-Universal reissued all of Bernstein's Haydn recordings for that label as part of their Bernstein Edition.  Those were digital recordings from the 1980's edited together from live concerts (Bernstein's preferred  modus operandi at that point in his career) and from an interpretive point of view they were inconsistent at best--sometimes insightful, but more often heavy and listless.  Bernstein aged badly as a conductor and, regrettably, his decline extended to a composer with whom he always had a strong affinity.  His earlier Haydn recordings for CBS/Sony, however, were renowned in their day for their vigor, rough humor, and boundless enthusiasm.<br /><br />Sony has done Haydn and Bernstein aficionados a tremendous favor by reissuing these now-classic recordings of the *Paris* and *London* Symphonies (plus no. 88), *Creation* and four out of the six late Masses, housed in a fairly sturdy space-saving box. Sony's asking price  is relatively high for such boxes these days (compare with recent offerings from EMI, such as their \\"Complete Oistrakh Edition\\"), especially since the skimpy booklet contains no annotations beyond the usual work-and-track listing. Moreover, within the box the CDs are gathered into laminated and hinged cardboard pockets that make the task of retrieving one more trouble than it should be.  The recordings have apparently not been remastered; that fact may account for the mediocre sonics throughout this collection.  The *London* Symphonies, in particular, suffer from thin, acidic-sounding strings, unduly recessed woodwinds, blaring brass (not Bernstein's fault), and a fair amount of distortion in the louder tutti passages. Moreover, the latest recording included here (a London-based *Theresienmesse* from 1979), though smoother-sounding, lacks bite and focus, largely due to a distant, mushy-sounding chorus.<br /><br />With those caveats out of the way (and they are sufficiently serious to cost my evaluation one star), I must affirm the legendary status of these recordings.  Bernstein brings enormous gusto to Haydn, and the result is an altogether winsome marriage of intellectual and physical vigor.  This is Haydn without the wig.  In the Symphonies, Bernstein favors bold, incisive sonata allegros; deeply meditative and just as often bewitchingly mischievous slow movements; steady and stately minuets, with some delightfully humorous touches; and dashing finales.  Bernstein's earlier, and finer, account of *Creation* is truly a celebration of Nature in all its rough-and-tumble splendor; and the Masses are just as notable for their operatic as for their religious fervor.  The playing of the NYPO in the Symphonies, as well as the singing in the choral works, is quite variable--greater polish would have been welcome.  But Lenny's elemental vigor and warm-hearted embrace of Haydn's always-stunning originality  carry the day.<br /><br />Despite qualifications, strongly recommended, particularly to listeners increasingly dissatisfied with current performance-practice orthodoxies. Those who require more up-to-date sonics and more polished orchestral playing (with no diminution of \\"elemental vigor\\") should check out Solti's set of the *London* Symphonies (a steal at budget price) and Dorati's equally fine set of the *Paris* Symphonies (in an inexpensive \\"twofer\\" from Decca).

B00064WSN2|4.0|The only real problem with this their second effort for the band would have to lie with the inclusion of 'The Devils' Triangle' which we all now know to be from Holsts' 'The Planets' and a pretty misguided rendering it is.<br /><br />Within the context of \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" all of the songs work extremely well and have a basic coherency and flow but the inclusion of material from outside of the band and a fairly weak arrangment of Mars (even as stated by R.Fripp) is even more puzzling when you hear what the band was playing during their first tour as evidenced by the DGM records release \\"Epitaph\\" in 1997.<br /><br />The album starts with the truly tranquil 'Peace-A beginning' with just the beautiful voice of G. Lake and then plunges head first into the incredible 'A man, A city/retitled Pictures of a City' for the album. Apparently written while on tour in the USA back in '69. Even with the loss of I. McDonald this version of the song is served well by the remainder of the band for the studio/album adaptation, and with Mel Collins handling the reed instrumentation there is no real gap to fill.<br /><br />'Cadence and Cascade' may well be one of the lovliest songs ever recorded by the beast King Crimson, rating on a par with 'One Time' or 'Starless' or even 'I talk to the wind'.<br /><br />The title track to this album IMHO is one of the great lost King Crimson classics with P. Sinfield writing lyrics that are delivered with heart from G. Lake as in the classic sense of their first albums 'Epitaph' or even some of Gregs later material on the first ELP album like 'Knife-edge';<br /><br />The album continues along the lines of its theme with 'Peace-A theme' this time with just acoustic guitar before the opening of that ominous bass line intro to 'Cat Food' undoubtably one of the greatest/meanest/cleverest songs pertaining to the state of societal affairs of the times(our time?).<br /><br />With these songs and the underlying theme, the inclusion of 'Mars' or the 'Devil's Triangle' seems like it should fit the master plan but in fact takes away from what otherwise would have been an immediate hit maker. Had the powers that were included other selections from the above mentioned tour from which this album is a product like 'Mantra' or 'Trees' or maybe a contemporary songwriter like 'Get thy Bearings' by Donovan (with whom there was a friendship), which was actually on the song list as evidenced by the box set 'Epitaph', I believe the end product would have suprised even the band.<br /><br />The album then ends with the final vocal/acoustic guitar reading of 'Peace-An end' by G.Lake/R.Fripp to leave the listener only yearning for more. At only 41 minutes this in an incredble chapter in the King Crimson catalog not to be missed by slight oversight or biased review.

The 24-bit remastering only enhances what was/is an incredible work by two people trying to hold together a band that was disintergrating right before their eyes.

0374531943|5.0|Being careful not to trip and fall<br />while carrying the fire. By Michael Collins<br /><br />Passionate people have a way of attracting other passionate people into their realm of life goals, and Michael Collins is one such person. Being a man of high intelligence and high ambition, he set his sights on becoming one of the best test pilots of new and emerging aviation technology, and quite by fate and happenstance; he found his life trajectory changing when rocket science was in its infancy.  By becoming a rocket man - an American Astronaut, Collins fulfilled his duties to the fullest and is therefore to this day, one of the most famous and admired men the world over. Rocketry and space travel is a highly technical and evolving science, and it found a perfect match with the intellect, the mind and the personality of one Michael Collins. Even though he isn't an artist, nor is he a poet or a painter, through is ability to solve complex scientific problems and having an analytical mind, Collins participated in man's greatest technological experience while bringing his special flavoring to the mix.<br /><br />Collins didn't sit down to write his autobiography until 13 or 14 years after he splashed down in the South Pacific with his amicable friends, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Rather, he lived his life to the fullest and every day there were people keeping his mind occupied and challenged.  Collins readily admits that after his Apollo 11 Moon Mission, nothing in his life could compete with all the training, debriefing and rehearsing that he was required to do for the Mission. Nothing could be in the vicinity of the level of excitement he experienced during his moon mission. He had the presence of mind even on the first days post Mission, when he was confined to a medical quarantine, that he would never step foot in space ever again. He was wise to mentally separate his life away from the US Space Program, and so he could withdraw with some measure of dignity and respect; to pursue new channels. Unfortunately, the other two astronauts were not as fortunate.<br /><br />Collins has an incredible memory as is evidenced by reading all 478 pages of his story.<br />I remember the lift-off as if it were yesterday, but if you weren't yet born, you can see the whole thing on YouTube these days; which I highly encourage everyone to do!<br /><br />I read this wonderful book over the course of 4 days; the amount of time that it took for the Apollo 11 crew to reach the lunar surface. Collins gave much detail of the huge amount of work that it took for the Apollo 11 Mission to get off the ground; he reminds us that close to 400,000 people played a part in it and every part was essential. On page 284, he gives a detailed description of what the Saturn V lift-off looked like, what it felt like - and it made me feel as if I were one of the privileged few who were there in Florida to witness it. But he then backtracked and fully explained a lot of the dry, technical procedures that made lift-off possible on that fateful day, July 16th, 1969.<br /><br />I remember where I was during those times. My family and I had just moved into the town of Downey, which was a hot NASA town that summer. I was 10 years old and was to begin the 5th grade in the fall. Our new house was about 5 miles away from North American; this huge engineering marvel of a warehouse where the entire think-tanking of the moon missions was done, and a lot of the complex construction of the mammoth Saturn V Rocket took place....it was conducted on a frantic but controlled pace! City Leaders talked of nothing else!  North American was a huge place; it was something like 2700 acres located smack dab in the middle of Downey; a mostly working-class predominantly Caucasian inhabited town. The front of it was located on Lakewood Blvd, and the back of the plant ran all the way to Bellflower Blvd. It was flanked to the south with Imperial Highway and to the north ran Stewart & Gray Road.I remember passing by the plant numerous times during that summer; the parking lot was packed to the brim with all sorts of cars - all the people (mostly men in short sleeved dress-shirts and a tie) scurried in at all odd hours, day and night. It was a 24/7/365 operation! They never gave tours to anybody, claiming that their progress was already behind where they wanted to be and it was a matter of national pride and national security that all outsiders be kept out of the building and out of the way! As a fifth grader, I could understand their rationale, but it still hurt because people were very curious about the Moon Mission. This attitude of NASA came back later to haunt the entire Apollo Program; because we taxpayers looked at the Apollo engineers and administrators and even the lovable astronauts as being somewhat arrogant. They made us proud, but they also made us feel left out. OUCH!<br /><br />I remember being glued to our black & white TV that fateful day of July 16th, 1969. This was the day the huge Saturn Rocket blasted off of Cape Kennedy in Florida, and I remember Walter Cronkite telling us all the details and he looked so proud! The moon landing happened at 9:26 EDT 4 days later: and we watched it run and re-run on the tube all day and all evening long! How I wished we had some fireworks to light and explode that night! It was so exciting!!! When human technology planted those Apollo Astronauts  on the surface of the moon, it was a matter of national pride. We were so scared that the Eagle would find itself parked in a sea of quicksand, and that something otherworldly would make an appearance to our new National Heroes while they were freshly landed on the moon, but nothing weird happened, which was a relief! This is when Neil Armstrong swung open the door of the Eagle and took his sweet time descending down the stairs of the Eagle and stepped foot on the dusty moon surface. We heard him say through static transmission, \\"This is one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\\" and my entire family whooped and went crazy with screaming and yelling; a delirious expression of all the joy and relief we as a family and we as a nation felt.  I kept a scrapbook of the entire mission as it unfolded, having had the fiercest crush on the fly-over man, Mike Collins! I just thought he was the best of the best; doing the toughest job of the entire mission - keeping the orbiting spacecraft running and ready for the other two spacemen playing on the moon. I only could imagine what Collins was going through being all alone for a day and half out there, especially was he flew over the spooky and mysterious dark side of the moon.  I was convinced there was no braver man in the universe that could do what he was doing in space.<br /><br />In the end of his amazing journal, Collins squares off with the one thing that tortures him and his fellow Apollo 11 Moon Crew to this day. He is absolutely sick to hell of answering this one question, so if you were ever to have the honor to meet Mr. Collins in the flesh, please DO NOT ASK HIM THIS: \\"What did it feel like to land on the moon?\\" or \\"What did it feel like to orbit around the moon but not land on it?\\"<br />Also be warned to NOT SEEK AN AUTOGRAPH from him because he has signed millions of autographs in his lifetime and he thinks that there must be a specially assigned desk in Hell for all autograph seekers, (except for children that is, because they don't know any better.)<br /><br />In the last few pages, (there are no designated chapters in Collins' book) Collins attempts to explain the psychology of himself and the other two partners he flew with all those years ago on the most awesome journey a man could ever take. Collins is dry; he thrives on being mechanically explicit or he loves to talk mission talk, but even when he tries to explain his emotional address, we are left still wondering why he hides behind so many walls. After reading his summization of himself, I can see that he is in earnest trying his level best to describe his inner psyche to the readers of this fine book, but he is unable to let loose with his best intentions. He demonstrates a lot of arrogance and likes to cuss and swear to the nth degree throughout this book, but when left to describe his friends Aldrin and Armstrong, he is gentle and shows great compassion for them. I am glad to know that he places his utmost priority towards his family and he keeps the flames of his love going strong. I admire a man who loves his family and puts them first on his list.<br /><br />In the end, we will ask our silly Earthbound questions and may never truly understand what it is like to circle so closely to the moon and see the Earth hanging in the blackness of a vast and enormous universe, but I believe I have come closer to understanding the mind of Mr. Michael Collins and realizing that he is just another mortal, blessed with extraordinary luck most of all. I am glad to have read his book and will likely re-read it sometime soon; he writes so well and is so stable and grounded in his thinking. I recommend this book to everyone who was alive during those fateful years that APOLLO flew from the Earth to the Moon and back again.<br /><br />It was an epic journey!<br /><br />The old North American Rockwell Plant still stands where it stood in 1969 in Downey. It was bought out by Boeing in 1999, where the Space Shuttle Program took over our national space adventures. Half of the plant is now occupied by a movie production company, who calls itself Downey Studios. The huge million gallon pool where Apollo conducted its zero gravity experiments was used to film the movie blockbuster, The Titanic. The other half of the old Apollo Plant is vacant and has been left to ruin. What is left is the cobwebs and echoes of an epic adventure.  But there is still much activity going on in the abandoned warehouse.... to this day. I pass by the place every weekend when I go check up on my old Pop, who still lives in the house that I grew up in Downey. He's doing okay, but the plant is in a state of decay, broken windows and peeling paint. What once was such a humming busy place, full of natural city and national pride is now just a ramshackle remnant of its former glory days. There are trucks parked behind those huge blue painted plant doors and there are men who are moving things out of the big rooms there. They've been steadily removing items for many years now; I've kept a close eye on it during my runs out to Downey to check up on my old Pop. I have no idea what they're moving or where they're going with it. City leaders have been promising a museum to rise from these ruins, but 40 years later, we are still waiting to see it. The old Administration Office still stands and on the floor is the emblem of past successful projects that took place in that old warehouse, the Vultee Emblem still proudly adorns the tiny floor of that old office. I remember the day that President Nixon came to Downey, with his big car and all the Secret Service. The driveway was a tiny circle driveway and it still stands there today; things were much simpler and to the point back then.<br /><br />I hope that you read this book especially if you live in Southern California and can remember those early days of space exploration - this book is a lively and descriptive story of that era. You are GO for a visit to the bookstore!<br /><br />Please also visit [...] to see the tiny space museum that is there today. They make it sound so big - Oooh, the Columbia Space Science Museum and one would be so impressed until you laid your eyes upon it...it's just a tiny trailer on the site of the old Rockwell Plant. Tiny, insignificant and blah....It doesn't do the program one ounce of justice, but it's all we have as of this date.

B00005QGAX|5.0|The Bad Album is one of Michael Jackson's star making album. Especially if you grew up listening to MJ Music. Michael is a Brilliant Artist and anything that he does is just Magnificent. The album holds up well. I recommend this album because if you are a true fan of Michael Jackson you will definitely enjoy it.  I'm one of those persons who likes Michael no matter what. I am still in disbelieve over his death. Michael is the man... I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER, MICHAEL!!!

0066620996|4.0|Looking at organizational life, one notices that there are times when a company breaks through. An organization moves from being simply good to being great. Why do some companies make the change while others flounder? This question is at the heart of Jim Collins' book, \\"Good to Great.\\"    In the process of their research, Jim Collins and his team sifts through over a thousand companies to discover eleven good to great companies. From these, the same lessons rise to the top again and again. Leaders of good to great companies are not egotistical jerks. Great companies focus on having the right people in place. They are honest about the hard realities, yet they do not lose hope. Great companies are focused. They believe in discipline.    Frankly, these are not profound insights. An organization might get lucky ever so often. However, sustained results are the result of competence. A company needs to do the right things over and over again. Throughout the book I kept thinking of the fable of the tortoise and the hare. Slow and steady wins the race.    As obvious as the conclusions were, I was not bored with the book. In fact, the research and the writing were sobering. It was like finally shaking off all those \\"latest-and-greatest\\" fads from a plethora of management books.    The only difficulty that I had with the book involved some of the company choices. As time goes on, some of the \\"great\\" companies are no longer great. The most eye-rolling example for me was Fannie Mae. Nonetheless, Collins addresses even that concern in the book. Companies need to remain diligent. It's easy to fall by the wayside. Usually a fall from grace is precipitated on failing one or more of the lessons outlined in the book.    \\"Good to Great\\" tries to live by its own principles. The book does not try to be showy or cute. It is methodical, building it's case simply and persuasively. The book delivers on what it promises.
0061139378|5.0|A personal quote from Neil Gaiman concerning \\"Coraline\\"; \\"It was a story, I learned when people began to read it, that children experienced as an adventure, but which gave adults nightmares. It's the strangest book I've written, it took the longest time to write, and it's the book I'm proudest of.\\"<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's \\"Coraline\\" is a fantastic young adult's novel which follows the seemingly uneventful, and dare say boring, life of one supplanted Coraline Jones. Freshly moved into a new flat, Coraline spends her days exploring the grounds and her quirky neighbors while largely ignored by her stay-at-home, workaholic parents. It's only until she discovers a little door leading to another world that her adventures really begin. Beyond the door, Coraline finds a world like her own, but far more interesting. Her toys fly, cats talk, neighbors perform acrobatic feats and recite prose, everything that could possibly delight Coraline exists on this side of the door. But so does her other mother and other father, with their black button eyes. They love Coraline, and would do anything for her, just so long as she lets them sew buttons into her eyes. One big, happy family indeed. It is up to Coraline to rescue herself, and others, from the phantom world created by her other mother. It will take all her good fortune, wisdom, and courage to defeat this terror; good thing she has them in abundance.<br /><br />Despite its intent as a young adult's novel, \\"Coraline\\" effortlessly appeals to both children and adults alike, creating a fantastically twisted world that is sophisticated and approachable without being overly condescending to the intelligence of its younger readers. So if you tire of hackneyed, sickeningly cheery stories thinly constructed as a vehicle for the teachings of moral lessons, then \\"Coraline\\" is certainly for you.
B000NQDC1A|5.0|Great to see this available again. David Munrow fans might want to check out an amazing performance as sideman to The Young Tradition - [[ASIN:B000S4TM2A The Agincourt Carol]] - with David Munrow playing shawm non-stop and almost collapsing with exhaustion afterwards. The sleeve notes explained King Henry was so appalled by the slaughter on the battlefield that he threatened severe punishment for anyone who celebrated the victory in song. It seems the Agincourt Carol was good enough to escape the ban!
B001IA46D8|5.0|A brilliant follow up to 2006's Beautiful World - The Circus is definitely Take That's best album as a collective work. The Circus thankfully takes more risks and therefore showcases more of the band's personality. While it doesn't have as many stand out brilliant singles like Patience, Shine, and the stunning Rule the World it is the better album as a whole.     BW while a great comeback played it safe by being a bit samey after awhile in the production apart from tracks Shine, I'd Wait for Life, and Wooden Boat. The lead single off the Circus called Greatest Day however is one of their best songs ever w/ signature soaring harmonies w/ another fantastic chorus. A TT anthem (which they do so well) like the classic Never Forget off their third album.    It's a refreshing theme for TT mach 2.0 to continue featuring different lead vocals, especially for the fans who really appreciate it.  Gary has a fantastic voice full stop. One of my all time favorites. The guy is just so versatile as proven by how many times TT have changed their style over the years.  As a huge fan of Mark's solo work, and his rocking, soulful voice it's always wonderful to hear as many tracks as possible from him. Howard has a beautiful voice as well which effortlessly conveys so much emotion. Lastly Jason, has gained so much confidence as a lead it's inspiring how far he has come. He truly has a lovely voice.    The Garden has a great message w/ all the guys sharing lead vocals. Hello, and Up All Night are in the same fun style as Shine, w/ Mark on lead. Julie could have been a Mark solo track for sure. What is Love and Here showcase Howard on lead. How Did It Come To This shows Jason finding a signature singing style. I wish You was switched as a b-side with Sleepwalking off the Greatest Day single. That is an amazing track and is too good to be a b-side. The Circus (just Gary and a piano) is a pretty little tune to anchor the album's theme nicely. The stand out track has got to be Said It All.Just an immense song, when Gary hits that note towards the end, and then Mark takes over - simply fantastic. Also Hold Up A Light is a great tune but really comes alive in concert as they have shown on their recent tour.     All in all, a great record from start to finish that doesn't diminish on repeat listens. It gets better. A+
0312360266|2.0|this book is nowhere near as good as stephenie meyer's twilight! the book is boring, unexciting and lame. there is nothing new or fresh or interesting. the main character is immature for her age, and is pretty stupid. the sequels to 'marked' has gotten way better reviews than marked, which is probably a good reason to read this. but, this one, is just plain boring. no wonder its rated so low. and it has no professional reviews from booklist and stuff or any praise. i wouldnt recommend it. any twilight fan will be truly disappointed after reading this. the only reason i picked it up in the first place is because its about vampires, which i have a huge passion for after i read the twilight saga. i bought a few other vampire books that are rated much higher for a good reason. they dont have boring plots, annoying main characters, and are not praise-less and review-less. i would not recommend this book to anyone. i would recommend the twilight saga (best series EVER!!) and the immortals series for fans of vampires.
0553384775|1.0|I wouldn't spend a dime to put in Belfort's pocket, but since I found this book tossed on the floor of the airport I started to read it.  I couldn't get through more than one third of the book.  It is poorly written and edited.  Belabored and obviously over the top.  No mention of how really rotten Jordan Belfort is.  The lives he damaged.  Obviously Jordan is not a literary genius.    Perhaps only in his mind.  It's childish in it's prose, but what could you expect from a street trash uneducated convicted felon.  No more No less.  Belfort's bragging, and endless stories of his \\"hey days\\" are moronic and so typical of the mindset of a criminal.  It seems more like boasting about his bad behavior.  His children must feel such shame when they realize they carry his genes and name.  I feel pity for them.  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.  In fact if you want my copy go to LAX and look in the garbage can.  The fact he is out there pushing this trash only reinforces to me he is not remorseful.  He says writing a book is \\"hard work\\".  Tell that to the coal miner, or school teacher, or truck driver.  Give me a break.  He is no Wolf of Wall Street, more like a total nothing of no where.    Perhaps more jail time in a jail that was actually a JAIL would make him remorseful.  I know this jail, it is for sissys.  It is not a bad place to while away the time, pretending to be remorseful.  This book is trash and not worthy of your time or money. Don't put any more money in shortys pockets.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Having never read the graphic novel I have the benefit of not having any pre-conceptions. Listened to, and read many negative reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Thought provoking, stunning visually and I have a feeling that repeat viewings will be rewarding.    Recommended. Also, for those in the UK it works a treat. Nice to know I've seen the full directors cut and the price worked out very competitively against the shorter UK version.  Remember not to order more than one Blu-Ray in one go and no issue with customers. Arrived much faster than I expected.

1573300403|5.0|I have always been a fan of Michael Jackson, but it didn't dawn on me to purchase one of his DVDs until his recent death. I grew up with MJ and if I wanted my daughters to appreciate his talent, I had to own the videos to prove it. I went with Volume 2 of HIStory instead of Volume 1 because Volume 2 included Thriller, Smooth Criminal, and the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards performance, an excellent performance from an awesome entertainer. MJ may have had his share of problems in life, but no one can deny how much he changed music, dance, live performances, music videos and superstardom. Michael Jackson will forever stand alone as a superstar.
0385247125|5.0|I haven't read it yet, but I just can't wait. It is in the works to be published again, so I will wait and not spend over $100 for it (sorry, I'm broke). waiting.... waiting..... man, I want to read this book.
B001993Y2C|4.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU-RAY BOXED SET.<br /><br />Seasons 1-4 deserve anywhere from 5 to 4 stars depending on the season. The extras deserve 4 stars while the packaging deserves 2 for the bigger box 1 for the cardboard sleeves.<br /><br />Edit: FYI, this includes the mini-series in addition to ALL the seasons of \\"BG\\", \\"Razor\\" is included but \\"Caprica\\" and \\"Face of the Enemy\\" webisodes are not.<br /><br />During its four season run \\"Battlestar Galatica\\" produced some of the best episodes for ANY television series whether it be a mainstream drama or science fiction. While some fans of the series were disappointed with the conclusion quite a bit was hinted at in previous episodes and it doesn't detract from the quality of the previous ones. The image quality varies from exceptionally good to fair but the show retains the \\"look\\" the producers wanted; some shots are meant to be not only extremely grainy but also a bit soft so you'll forgive the studio and makers for going with their artistic vision. Either way the image looks terrific but don't expect this to look like a smooth high def show designed to look slick. Detail is sharper regardless of the \\"look\\" of the show.<br /><br />Audio sounds terrific throughout with an active 5.1 lossless soundtrack that highlights the level of detail that went into preparing the show.<br /><br />The extras for seasons one through three are more or less the same as on the original DVDs the only new extra (aside from the new extras for season four which I'll address in a minute)to this set is the BD-Live \\"Battlestar Galatica Card Game\\". So far there isn't anything else on BD-Live (as of the release date) available but I'd also note that the season one Blu-ray and DVD as part of this boxed set includes the deleted scenes from the first season something missing if I recall correctly from the DVD (I sold mine to upgrade to the Blu-ray so can't look at it).<br /><br />It appears as if most of the extras are exactly like like the previous sets with one exception the deleted scenes for the first season. I'm going to focus on the extras for the fourth season because most of the special features are ported over from the previous DVD boxed sets. We get extended episodes for \\"A Disquiet Follows My Soul\\", \\"Islands in a Stream of Stars\\" and \\"Daybreak\\" as well as 13 commentary tracks, David Eick's Video Diaries and deleted scenes for the fourth season set.There's also pip's that allow you to watch behind-the-scenes stuff while watching the show as well as an explanation of some of the jargon used by the characters on the show.<br /><br />The packaging is a bit more problematic. While the big box is sturdy enough and looks extremely nice, the smaller boxes that hold each season set holds the discs in cardboard sleeves. It will increase the chance that these could get scratched and I am disappointed that Universal didn't design this set for a more traditional DVD or Blu-ray holder. The good news is that each season comes in its own compact box and they will stand up with other Blu-ray and DVDs on the shelf. I personally think it is nicer in concept than execution and wish it was designed similar to the UK boxed set coming in September but that's me.<br /><br />Let's not forget the toy Cylon that's on the top of the cardboard boxed set it looks kind of cool but I haven't opened it to examine yet.<br /><br />In conclusion there's good and bad with this set with the good outweighing the bad. \\"BG\\" receives a handsome looking Blu-ray transfer with great sound and some terrific extras. A terrific series where Gaius Balter redeems himself and Cavil proves to be everything we believed him to be from the first introduction of his character.<br /> Recommendedor the first season.

B000FA57US|4.0|I know many people think that Halloween 5 is one of the worst entries in the Halloween franchise but I have to disagree.  I would have to say that this film is actually one of my favorite Halloweens.  Sure it has its problems (the random and pointless change in the Myers house, the overly goofy policemen, and the introduction of the man in black) but it also has plenty of good things (great acting from Danielle Harris and Donald Pleasence, the awesome character of Tina - played by Wendy Kaplan, and some truly frightening sequences).  I would suggest watching the previous Halloween films beforehand or else you'll be totally lost.  If you don't know what happens in Halloween 6, you may feel a little lost and confused by the ending (like I said, this film ain't perfect).  But if you're a horror/slasher fan, keep an open mind and just enjoy Halloween 5.

I'm sharing my doodles and it is kinda cool.  I expect that if I continue - it will simplify a lot of my communications. I could have drawn THIS review and you'd have gotten the message so much more completely and quickly.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|Horrible movie. Boring, and certainly was a waste of my money. It was very hard to sit through. The commercials threw me off, of course I should have realized that part of marketing strategy is to fool consumers and show the best parts of the movies. There was no action like I expected, way too much talking, and the plot sucked. And for the kids? Yeah right, there was a soft porn scene in it, with kids in the theatre. But then again, the film was rated R. But if thats the case then the Spice channel which shows soft porn should be available for everyone to watch, it was literally the same thing. That probably was the highlight for many people in the cinema, but it did not help the movie. Sometimes I wonder why producers and directors go on with movies if its clearly a horrible project. Horrible movie.

0767827791|4.0|I really like this movie and have always looked forward to it being shown on t.v. around Labor Day weekend.  Yes, it's melodramatic in parts, and \\"yes\\" Holden is too old for the role. However, the foundation---the play itself---is so good that it more than makes up for those Hollywood glitches.      Rosalind Russell's character is my favorite. She is one of the most complex characters in the play. The best scene for me is when she's begging Howard, \\"Please marry me, Howard.\\" That scene is so real and so heart-wrenching it almost makes the whole movie worth watching.
0060282983|5.0|Writers are implored to show... don't tell.  As co-author (with William Strunk, Jr.) of the best known grammar text in English, The Elements of Style, Elwyn Brooks White knew a thing or two about writing.  With apologies to Stuart Little and Strunk & White, Charlotte's Web is not only E.B. White's masterpiece, it is one of the World's Great Works.  Winner of the Laura Ingolls Wilder Medal and a Newbery Honor Book, it deserves a place on the shelf beside Tom Sawyer and Treasure Island and Little Women.  Eudora Welty wrote \\"As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.\\"<br /><br />White, indeed, shows us.  He shows us Fern, a pre-adolescent girl living on a farm, full of youthful idealism, intervening just before her father sends a newborn pig to the great beyond because he is a runt.  He shows us that Wilbur the Pig was worth saving, because he is a kind-hearted soul, a friend to all.  He shows us selfishness in the rat Templeton. Best of all, he shows us Charlotte, one of the most noble characters ever written, who decides to dedicate her life to the saving of Wilbur, because after the runt pig is spared from his near execution, he goes to Uncle Homer Zuckerman's farm and learns the *reason* pigs are kept. The method Charlotte uses to spare Wilbur from slaughter is wondrous.<br /><br />Zuckerman's farm is populated with other memorable characters - cows and horses and gabbing geese and the rat, Templeton.<br /><br />The story is full of wonder and several times we feel real peril.  The ending is both a triumph and bittersweet at a level that feels intense.  Let's just say my first real lesson about loss came from Charlotte's Web, and the paragraph where that happens never fails to bring real tears to my eyes.<br /><br />My wife and I are both readers and whilst still in the full bloom of love agreed that one of our activities would be reading books to one another.  \\"What book should we start with?\\" we pondered aloud, then simultaneously we both blurted out \\"Charlotte's Web!\\"<br /><br />This isn't just a good book.  It is a cherished treasure.out \\"Charlotte's Web!\\"    This isn't just a good book.  It is a cherished treasure.
0061537969|5.0|At first I was apprehensive about reading this book.  I had heard that it was not about cars or racing.  Boy was that wrong.  It chronicles what the ups and downs of trying to survive a racing career as well as the ups and downs of the whole family.  I loved this book and can't wait to read it again.  I am tempted to say that I would love to see this book made into a movie but the movie always ruins it.  Great read for the racing fan or the non racing fan.  BTW...I want a dog now...and it should be named Enzo!
B0013FYTA8|5.0|Scars & Souvenirs is a very rockin' and enjoyable album. The singers got a great voice and the songs are all pretty catchy. If you like bands like Nickelback or 3 Doors Down then you will love TOAD.    So Happy-A very hard rockin'song  By the Way- A darker but just as rockin' song. very good.  Got it Made-An upbeat rocker. Very enjoyable  Not Meant To Be- A highly catchy power ballad  Crutch- Very heavy and aggresive. Quite cool.  All or Nothing-Another power ballad. Pretty catchy.  Heaven (little by Little)-A ballad. quite beautiful actually.  Bad Girlfriend-A dirty rocker, most people have probably already heard this.  Hate My Life-A very humourous number, somewhat like Nickelback's Rockstar.  Little Smirk- A very fast and aggresive rocker. Very interesting.  End of The Summer-A very catchy popish type of song.  Wait For Me-Another ballad. Slow but nice.  Sacrifice-A fairly hard rock song. Short sweet and to the point.    So as a whole, this is a very good album and i'd reccomend it.

I am still doubting the fact righting a review.I wanted to keep a competitive advantage, this much I love it).  But, here you have it in simple words...And, it was nice to hear from the author himself emailing me back!...Thanks!
0385338910|2.0|With charming writing like this, (the author describing pity) \\"is like a fart. You can tolerate your own, but you simply can't stand anyone else's\\", you might want to think twice about reading. Sorry - but it was a bore.
0307276902|3.0|If you can get past the fact that most of this book probably isn't true, the lack of punctuation to let you know when someone is speaking, random capitalization, and the frequent sentence fragments, this book can be a good read.

I read about one to two thriller/mysteries per week, (plus a business type book!) and this one just got more and more boring.  Rollins attempts to build suspense was pathetically weak.  Dan he a'int so he should not try!  At least I will get a couple of bucks back at the used book store!
B0014WAC3I|5.0|Fun robot movie, first of two in the series. Some PG suggested for a few words and hand gestures. A lot of laughs for adults as well as children.    Very overlook movie, it deserved more of an audience.
B001FB55H6|3.0|OK, let me start by saying that this movie was well written (really interesting story), very good acting, and a fair amount of cool action/fighting scenes, with a good amount of blood.    Great movie, but, I just can't sit through almost 4 hours of ANY movie, no matter how good it is. They could have removed an entire hour (OR MORE), and still had a decent movie.
0385737424|4.0|This is a quick and entertaining read for kids from fifth to seventh grade. As a parent it isn't quite the writing quality I prefer but concede that children's standards are often different from mine. There is an element of mystery that will get most kids through the book and that will be a plus for kids struggling to enjoy reading.<br /><br />Parents giving their children a character based upbringing may want to know that in the story the mother steals office supplies, one of the protagonist's friends steals bread as a lark from his employer, and the mom ends up sleeping with her boyfriend as a culmination of a secondary romantic aspect that threads its way through the book. These events are portrayed as morally neutral.
B000CBSHK2|3.0|I really like Beth Orton, even if she's not doing anything different than before.  I find it hard to listen to this album due to the muddy sound.  It sounds like one big demo and I find it to be really annoying.  I want to fiddle with the volume on my computer even though I know it's not my speakers, but the album itself.  I;d love to hear a remastered/cleaned up version.
B000007MVD|5.0|This is the early-day Beatles, a time in their career when they weree singing a lot of cover songs and rocking hard.  Songs like \\"Some Other Guy\\" and \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\" that had been played at the Cavern Club and Hamburg, were also staples of these early radio shows.  The Beatles are heard here covering songs by Chuck Berry, Little Richard and the like.  It's great that they add their own style to songs that were originally performed by their influences.  They were just a great little rock band, in the days before experimentation and LSD.  This is the best.    Of course The Beatles play many of their own hits as well.  \\"All My Loving,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"Ticket to Ride\\" and many more can all be heard.  And the spoken words in between songs add a special flavor to the CD, almost like an actual radio broadcast.  This collection is thrilling, and highly recommended.
B0018AVNKC|3.0|Not having read the book and having only watched the various trailers before seeing it, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect of the film.  Of course, the promo-posters and banners were touting the film as \\"from the director of the Nightmare Before Christmas!!\\".  In light of this, and as a huge fan of Burton-esque films, especially his stop-motion animations, I was intrigued...    From a creative artistical standpoint, the film did not dissapoint.  As with most of the Burton films (though I know this is NOT one of his films, it was still being promoted as having close ties for that sort of audience), I expected to be laughing as much as I was creeped out -- however, it did not have any of the macabre sense of humor that I love most about his films, and I suppose I naively assumed that it would.  In fact, I don't remember any of the audience -- my wife and I included -- really laughing that much.  (Stop-motion pictures, for example, such as \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\", and \\"Vincent\\" sport a Halloweenish element of ghoulish fun and make me laugh year after year.)  In short, I didn't have any of the \\"warm fuzzies\\"...(you know, that good post-Disney-flick feeling you get) at anytime during the film, and especially at the end where that counts most.    The music was interesting.  It has a \\"young-girl-catching-butterflies-with-a-butterfly-net-in-flowery-springtime-meadows\\" sort of vibe to it.    The movie was obviously meant to be creepy and dark, and that in and of itself is indeed fun, but yet there were really no uplifting moments to balance it.  Nothing that cute really.  Nothing terribly endearing or memorable.  The only thing that sort of came close to those kinds of moments were when Coraline was visiting her bizarre neighbors -- a pair of fat, aged, retired-thespian floozies that lived together and who stuffed their many deceased Scottish Terriers; and a retired circus performer who wears a wife-beater that doesn't cover his pot-belly and has old-man hair coming from many weird places.      But even then, during one of these \\"fun\\" moments, and during one of her visits to see the ex-thespians perform in their dungeon-level personal stage, the two women are singing a duet about being sirens -- one of them sings that it's more tempting for men who like women with a voluptuous bottom, and the other woman sings a competing verse about how it's better to be big-bossomed while she's wearing only sparkly \\"pasties\\" covering the nipples of her gigantor-sized breasts that bounce as she dances on the stage.  Oh yeah, she's also wearing a barely-visible thong.  I have to admit I was somewhat uncomfortable at seeing this in a so-called PG adapted-from-kids-story film.  Yes, there are plenty of PG films that show more suggestive material, but for this genre, I was still a bit shocked.  And instead of leaving a smile on your face, as humorous relief is supposed to do, it just left a sort-of wierd taste in your mouth.  Also, if you are religious (or not), you might object to Coraline and other characters saying \\"Oh my God\\" over and over.  Some of the newer PG kids animation flicks do this a lot (\\"The Incredibles\\" comes to mind, yet I still LOVE that film), but most have not done so to this extent, I find.    As a side, a relative of mine took her kids to see the film and both of them had nightmares about it.  Maybe your kids won't, but hers certainly did.  As an adult, it was creepy enough for me.    Bottom line -- the film is okay...not great...not a classic in my opinion, but if you're hankering after some cool stop-motion animation with a creepy, dark feel then you might get what you're after. But, don't expect to walk away from it feeling like you've been thoroughly entertained and uplifted.
B002EDH0FE|5.0|Watchmen is a story of the 1980's gone awry, looking at how the world would be different if superheroes existed.  It's bloody, it's funny, it's really touching and it's horribly heartbreaking.  Definitely not appropriate for younger, less mature viewers, it brings up questions about the nature of goodness, and the moral ambiguity of some necessary choices.  The characters are rapists and murderers, psychotics and sociopaths and you just can't bring yourself to hate any one of them.    A word of warning, this is a REALLY LONG MOVIE.  So be prepared for the long haul.
0312383320|4.0|I give this 4 stars because it has Diesel in it. In past Plum books, all the later ones which I've enjoyed in audio, have caused me to sometimes laugh so hard I've had tears in my eyes. This one was mostly just chuckles. As others have pointed out, Stephanie has not grown in maturity and the books are becoming somewhat stale.  None of the other characters have changed either, though Joe and Ranger don't really need to. It's just a wonder to me what this girl can have that is so special that these 2 guys put up with so much from her.    On the other hand, I would like to see Diesel maybe get his own book, though I can't imagine what it would be. That's probably why I'm not an author.    I would not have bought this in hardback. If I did not have an Audible membership, I would have checked it out of the library.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Hey kids, did you know that there is a live action Dragonball movie? Don't be so shocked - very few people know about this out of context mess of a film. I rented this film, hoping that is was funny bad, ha-ha. Ouch, Dragonball Evolution is too much of a mess to be campy fun.    Evolution will be totally weird and confusing to non Dragonball-philes, since nothing in the movie will explain much of anything. In fact, for those who are familiar with Dragonball the movie tells the story from the beginning, using characters and the ending from the middle.     To make matters worse, the film is riddled with cliches. Goku, the main character, walks around mumbling \\"I must not fight\\" in the beginning of the film. So guess what happens? And what is Chow Yun Fat doing in this?    Don't bother.
B00004SU5J|5.0|One of the best all-time studio produced albums and in my top 25 all-time albums list right up there with \\"A Space in Time\\", \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" & \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and I have had people walk up to me in my car while playing this album and asking where they can get this and who it was more than any other album in recent memory. The quality, beat, hypnotic rhythms and passion draws people wherever it is played.
B000JJRIP2|5.0|KISS have always been known for having high-budgeted live shows, and playing their music loud.  They have released multiple albums showing off their live shows.  This boxed set has all of the albums that show them live the way they were, instead of doing anything special (such as going unplugged or with an orchestra).  The first disc is the original KISS Alive! album, the album that defines KISS.  I feel that they do a great job with all of the songs, doing them louder and sometimes longer than the original studio versions.  Although the sound isn't as direct into the speakers, like in the studio, that doesn't matter; it still blasts the speakers.  The second disc is Alive II, which is similar to Alive! except with different songs, and there's a third side of studio music.  The third disc is Alive III, done many years later, when KISS had a new line-up and a new awareness of their legacy.  The final disc is a way of going full circle and showing KISS just after they had reunited.<br /><br />In conclusion, this perfectly represents KISS live, more from more than just one era.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|One of the main reasons I prefer playing my 360 instead of my PS3 is due to the superior design of the 360 controller (just my opinion, I know a lot of people love the PS3 controller more and that's cool). But this product does a tremendous job in making the PS3 controller even better. It always bothered me the way the triggers felt. With the realtriggers you can easily make your controller feel like you're firing a gun. Plus, your fingers will no longer slip off during battle. Great product!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Michael Jackson had done a lot of work with the Jackson 5, later to become the Jacksons, along with doing solo work with Motown records, and then he released Off the Wall, his first album produced by Quincy Jones.  WIth Off the Wall behind him, the two of them tried something even bigger.  They started out by adding Eddie Van Halen, Vincent Price, and Paul McCartney as a performer (he wrote \\"Girlfriend\\" from Off the Wall).  The album has more variety than it's predecessor, but is it better?  I can't really answer that question because it's a different album.  Off the Wall was much more disco influenced throughout the whole album, but Thriller includes more drum machines and synthesizers, as well as bigger hits.<br /><br />On the bad side, this album doesn't have a soft song as good as \\"She's Out of My Life,\\" but that's why we can't just stick to one album, and Stevie Wonder didn't do any participating in this album after writing \\"I Can't Help It\\" from Off the Wall although on the next album, Bad, he sang a duet with Michael called \\"Just Good Friends.\\"  Along with Off the Wall, this album shows the height of Michael Jackson, when he not only was still black and had a nose (although he had a small operation on it before doing this album), but he also would smile a lot more.  This is a great album.
B001FB55H6|4.0|\\"Watchmen: Director's Cut\\" is a brilliant film ... or very nearly brilliant anyway. It's got everything a film like this really needs: surrealistic superhero action, fairly sharp social commentary, discomforting but thought-provoking moral and ethical ambiguity, awesome ninja moves, some disturbing gore, and a smattering of gratuitous sex. Unfortunately the acting is spotty, some of the dialogue is puzzling and a few characters seem a bit wooden. And yes it suffers from cliches and some of the score selections are questionable. (Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" in the Nite Owl II/Silk Spectre II sex scene? What an oddball, distracting song choice.) But taken as a whole, it's a real epic and great fun to watch. In Amazon style ... if you liked \\"The Dark Knight,\\" \\"V for Vendetta,\\" \\"Robocop\\" and \\"The Incredibles,\\" then you'll love \\"Watchmen\\".
B00005QGAT|5.0|First, I don't have this specific edition of the album with the bonus tracks, so this review is on specifically just the album.  It's pretty much a disco album, but there's nothing wrong with that.  It's mainly a pop album.  The big hits from the album, \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\\" \\"Rock With You,\\" and \\"She's Out of My Life\\" are all great tracks, but tracks like \\"Working Day and Night,\\" \\"Girlfriend,\\" and \\"It's the Falling in Love\\" are also great, along with the other tracks from the album.  Although his later albums had more variety in genres with tracks, this album is a good pop album, and the songs here are great pop songs.<br /><br />Michael Jackson never did anything super-epic musically (he did a lot of that with the music videos, but not with the music).  There isn't any twenty-minute suite, and there aren't any instrumental compositions that change time signatures.  This is pop, which is basically short, catchy, polished, accessible songs.
B002HWUTTQ|5.0|Just before doing \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" director Peter Jackson (who can be seen in a cameo as \\"Man with Piercings\\") made an off-kilter horror/comedy movie called \\"The Frighteners,\\" the tale of the undead and the guy who makes a living off of them. Though \\"The Frighteners\\" was barely in theaters at all, this cult flick is funny, creepy, well-acted and wonderfully directed -- and it has a bizarre, delightfully freaky sense of the macabre.<br /><br />Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) has seen spirits and apparitions ever since the car crash that killed his wife. Now he operates an amateur \\"ghostbusting\\" operation that is supposed to exorcise ghosts from people's houses -- the problem is that the ghosts who haunt those houses are in league with him (Chi McBride as the opinioated afro-ed Cyrus, Jim Fyfe as the nerdy Stuart, and most of John Astin as what is left of The Judge).<br /><br />Frank's business certainly isn't hurt by the fact that for years after a serial killer's murderous spree, people have died mysteriously of heart attacks. Then Frank starts seeing fiery numbers emblazoned on the foreheads of people who will die, including the husband of doctor Lucy Lynskey (Trini Alvarado). As if trying to stop a specter of death weren't hard enough, crazed FBI agent Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs) believes that Frank is the one murdering people. But the evil specter is still killing -- and Lucy is the next victim.<br /><br />Peter Jackson once said that he has a \\"moronic\\" sense of humor, and it shows up in all its glory here -- from bug spray dissolving a ghost's face to a piece of talking oily sludge to a drill sargeant ghost with submachine guns. This entire movie is the perfect blend of comedy and horror (in what other movie can you see a sex scene between a ghost and a mummy?), and Jackson blurs the lines to the point where you can barely tell them apart.<br /><br />But he's also good during the more serious moments, such as Bannister's flashbacks to his wife's tragic death, or the eerie sight of homicidal young lovers dancing with a gun after a killing spree. And he splatters the whole movie with spectacularly creepy moments (the jerky Ringwraithish killer fluttering across the sky), and his trademark swooping cinematography, with an opening shot that zooms through a window, past fluttering curtains, and though a hole in the attic floor to a screaming woman below.<br /><br />Jackson also takes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun at more conventional ghost movies: the big Gothic house, crazy old lady, ghost in '70s clothes, and Fox's hilarious turn as a ghostbuster. Nothing horrific is sacred. \\"There ain't nothing worse than a bunch of p*ssed-off brothers... that's ALREADY DEAD!\\" Cyrus yells at one point.<br /><br />Does it have a flaw? Yes -- the opening scene doesn't seem to make much sense later on in the movie. But Jackson makes up for that with a surprisingly tight, coherent plot, and a satisfying finale that makes more sense than most other horror movies do.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant, whether it's the twitchy, wild-eyed FBI agent played by a brilliant Jeffrey Combs (\\"You are violating my territorial bubble!\\"), or the three weird ghosts (one a nerd, one a very annoyed seventies dude, and one a decaying sheriff). Michael J. Fox does an excellent job as Frank, with the right combination of cockiness and pathos, while Alvarado is solid as the idealistic young doctor. But the scenes are reallystolen by Dee Wallace-Stone and freaky-eyed Jake Busey, as homicidal young lovers.<br /><br />\\"Frighteners\\" might not make you believe in ghosts, but it will make you laugh, shiver, and maybe even shed a tear or two. Wildly funny, weird, gross, and sometimes really peculiar, this is Jackson's splatter-gore at its best.micidal young lovers dancing with a gun after a killing spree.

B001993Y2C|1.0|I purchased the complete blu ray box set for battlestar galactica and all I have to say is \\"WOW! This is the worst packaging I have ever experienced or seen.\\" I feel as though I have been tricked and robbed. There is no instruction to open up the box. If it wasn't for a small picture showing the box set opened I would have broken it trying to get to the dvds. Once I opened the box and took out one of the seasons I was troubled to notice no booklet or back with a directory on it for detailing and locating the episodes. The box (season box within the box set) was cheap and when i opened it up the dvds were crammed into the box with card stock weaving between them. There is no way to even get at the dvd without the other dvds falling out as well. The packaging will not protect the dvds either which will cause damage to the dvds over time. I don't want to watch it because of the packaging and I love battlestar. For example there is no way to find the episode \\"Litmus\\" on Season one without sticking every disc into the player and checking. To bad there wasn't a \\"Litmus test\\" taken by the genius who put this product into the market for sale. Save yourself the the trouble and just buy the seasons on blu ray one at a time. Plus the little cylon model was poorly assembled and likely to break if handled too long.
B0029NY9YO|4.0|I did not read the graphic novel, so apparently I represent the group of people not familiar with anything about the story who nevertheless thought the film version was terrific! (And frankly I'm getting weary of reading reviews by snobby critics who claim that the film could only possibly appeal to those already familiar with the novel.)<br /><br />What I saw was an intelligent, engaging, completely original film with compelling characters and--yes--a strong narrative. Again, I'm mystified by those critics who say there's no story.  Have they seen the same film I did? I'll admit, the plot is a lot more complex--i.e. non-formulaic--than recent superhero films (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, etc.), but since when did it become valid criticism to knock a film's story, simply because it happens to be a little more demanding than the usual fare?<br /><br />Simply put, this is the film for those of us who like \\"Citizen Kane\\" but disdain the big studio, special-effects, franchise clones the studios crank out year after year.<br /><br />Confusing? Not to me. In fact, I thought everything was set up in an easy-to-follow manner. Granted, it doesn't follow a straight linear path, but that's one of the unusual things about the film that makes it work so well.<br /><br />Everything about this film is top-notch.  If I have any criticism, it's with the Comedian character.  As others have pointed out, his actions in the film are so vile, it's hard to understand how he ended up in the \\"hero\\" camp. I understand the attempt to humanize superheros and give them real problems, but I think a line is crossed when the Comedian guns down his pregnant girlfriend (not to mention attempts to rape one of his partners). No matter how jaded his partners are, it's a little hard to swallow that they don't turn against him at some point.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|If you like westerns?  This is the ultimate.  With awesome cinematography.  YOU HAVE TO SEE AND GET IN WIDESCREEN!!  A story about friendship, revenge, and family.  It is my all time favorite western..with Tombstone, Unforgiven and, Shane close behind!  Pay atention to the last words of the movie..spoken by Kevin Costner.... \\"We'll be back!\\"  Ive been waiting for a sequal ever since!!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!
B000OLGCI4|1.0|I was ten years old when this first came out and though I was always a big fan of Disney films this one always left me cold. It was released in 1967-- the summer of love, the Beatles were still hot, the Stones were smokin' and this film comes out with all the \\"cool\\" characters liking...jazz?? I certainly wasn't the most \\"hip\\" kid in my class but I didn't know anybody who walked around saying \\"Man, dig that crazy beat.\\" I kept picturing in my head that this film was written by a bunch of geezers who kept telling themselves: \\"You know what the kids like these days? Jazz! Let's make everyone crazy about jazz and the kids will think they're cool!\\" I mean really: even the one time Mowgli dances (with a monkey) he's doing a jitterbug! The only pop star involved in this was Chad Everett of Chad and Jeremy fame and he plays a slacker vulture who sings barbershop! I have always credited this movie as the beginning of the slow decline of Disney films, a downward trend that finally (and thankfully!) ended with the excellent \\"Little Mermaid.\\"
B000A2RRF4|4.0|Picked this up today as a new MJ fan curious about his live performances, and in this respect, the DVD doesn't disappoint. The performances are of course energetic and a hell of a lot of fun. Good picture quality for a 1992 source, as well. There are a few downsides, however. At times the editing is so manic that it becomes hard to appreciate what is actually happening onstage. It's at its worst near the beginning of the concert, but I became less aware of choppiness later on. Additionally, the repeated cutaways to swooning members of the audience being hauled off by security is borderline ridiculous. I got a kick out of it the first few times, but I saw it again, and again, and again... Throughout the entire concert. Distracting and annoying.    The \\"stunt\\" at the end of the concert was jaw-droppingly stupid. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but I guess that's the early nineties for you!     The weaknesses overall don't take away from really positive presentation of MJ in his prime. The power of performance this man had is unmatched. While there is some lip-syncing, Michael lends his own voice on several songs. Recommended.
B002HWUTV4|5.0|Zombies are one of those horror staples that have gotten putrid, after one too many idiotic blood'n'gore-fests with a revolting script. Like poor Dracula, they run out of things to do.<br /><br />But zombie films are revitalized by the wickedly funny \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" a tale of music, love, pubs, and the slobbering undead. In the vein of Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive,\\" it's full of twisted humour, funny dialogue and plenty of gore.<br /><br />Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) are the poster boys for adolescentus slackeritis, living in a London flat with their peeved roommate Pete, who has actually grown up and gotten a real job. Ed plays video games all day, and Shaun's immaturity has just gotten him dumped by his long-suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield).<br /><br />Wrapped up in his love life woes, Shaun fails to notice a little news item: Human beings all over London are transforming into zombies. At first, Shaun obliviously drowns his sorrows, and has a nasty encounter when he goes to pick up a soda. Now he must mend his relationship with Liz and defend himself and his family from the hordes of ravenous zombies... by barricading them in a pub.<br /><br />\\"Shaun\\" makes the whole genre seem fresh just because it doesn't take itself seriously. The heroes don't even have guns (since the UK public don't get them), and so our heroes fend off the zombies with vinyl records, shovels and cricket bats. That gives an idea of how serious this movie is.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" isn't so much a zombie movie as a love story with zombies -- a very funny one, with lots of gore. We're treated to slackers in love, Shaun drifting obliviously around London withoutn noticing the undead, and some very entertaining dialogue (\\"Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet...\\")<br /><br />Later on, he's forced to shake off his obliviousness in order to save his loved ones, with a bat as his only weapon. And maybe some commandos in a tank. It's gory, and the ending gets a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments. Not sex-organ/bathroom humor, but definitely not highbrow.<br /><br />Everybody knows guys like Shaun and Ed. Pegg perfectly plays a slacker with a heart of gold, who would like to be more than he is, but doesn't have the slightest clue how to go about it. Frost is a good annoying sidekick for Shaun, and Ashfield does a good job as the long-suffering girlfriend.<br /><br />As a bonus, music geeks will laugh themselves silly over such important decisions as: which albums should our reluctant heroes throw at the zombies? \\"Stone Roses?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"...Second Coming?\\" \\"I liked it.\\" \\"Dire Straits?\\" \\"Chuck it!\\" Good choice, Shaun m'boy.<br /><br />While it's a hilarious movie, it's not a spoof -- rather it's a zombie movie with wit, love and comedy. By not taking itself too seriously, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" ends up revitalizing a genre that seemed like it was... well, almost dead.a bit cliched and overserious, but the ride up until then is wonderfully scripted and full of hilarious crude comic moments.

B00288KNJU|5.0|I was let down when I saw the paper glasses that it comes with. I was expecting clear, transparent 3D glasses but the glasses that it comes with have Pinkish and Greenish lenses.   But after watching the movie with glasses I found that they worked pretty good. I haven't seen Coraline 3D in theatres, but I was blown away with some of the 3D scenes.  The glasses do take away the bright vibrant colors (not too much though, Coraline's bright orange coat and Blue hair were still vibrant) but add a completely new feel and mood to the movie that's very appropriate for it.     Some people have said that only a few selected scenes are in 3d. I didn't feel this at all. The entire movie was in 3D. Maybe a couple close up scenes where there wouldn't be too much depth to begin with may be 2D, ( I don't know) But the rest was completely 3D.    I watched the movie on Blu-ray and on an HD TV. That's the only way to get the best picture possible.   There are almost 2 different version of Coraline. The 3D and the regular versions. They both create two completely different experiences. When watching in 3D, you feel like you've been transported into  a different world that's gloomy and dark. In 2D Blu ray, you get to observe the same world with rich details that aren't visible in the 3D.   So this is defiantly worth buying. The 3D is not as good as the theatres but still works splendidly.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|This is a genuine review of the Blu-Ray. This is a cult classic so I had to see it in HI-Def. Very good conversion, not the best but good. The extras are a little limited but overall this is a buy.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Only one thing to notice: the second part of the song \\"Sunday Girl\\" is in French and I would have preferred the pure English version in Parallel Lines, which sounds more beautiful to me.
1405089555|5.0|I first read Agatha Christie's The Body In the Library several years ago, and to be honest, I really didn't like it very much (a rarity for a Christie book, as I am a huge fan of hers). On a whim, I decided to check out the audio edition (read by Stephanie Cole) at the library. I *loved* it! Cole does an absolutely marvelous job with all the characters, giving each a different inflection and filling each word with the appropriate emotion and feeling. Her Miss Marple is gentle yet spunky, and you can almost see the twinkle in her eyes. I became so engrossed in this audio book that I found myself sitting in my car several times, not wanting to get out because I wanted to continue to listen! I really, really recommend this audio book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery. Kudos to Stephanie Cole for such a fantastic reading!
0316017922|4.0|Individual success depends not only on the individual, but on a host of other factors.   Gladwell has written an entire book devoted to this proposition, although he stretches the point to include many aspects of nurture which make the individual what he/she is; e.g.  cultural and family background.  In any event, this is another very interesting book from Gladwell, although not as eye opening as Blink.  I thought the chapter on Korean air pilots was particularly interesting, as well as the contrast between traits induced by rice farming in comparison to wheat farming.  My one reservation about the book is that Gladwell can be a bit wordy and repetitive to my taste - this isn't rocket science.
B00005LC1G|5.0|Nothing really needs to be said about the classic British sitcom \\"Fawlty Towers,\\" except that the third and final collection of episodes contains some of the series' most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments. \\"Fawlty Towers - Waldorf Salad/The Kipper and the Corpse/The Anniversary/Basil the Rat\\" sends abusive hotelier Basil Fawlty through his last round of demented crises, and it's more fun than ever.<br /><br />Basil's insensitivity and overambition finally get the best of him when he tries to cater to a wealthy, equally obnoxious American tourist who wants a Waldorf salad. The result: a crazy scheme in which Basil tries to pretend that the cook hasn't left for the day, and cobble together a foodstuff that he doesn't know the first thing about. And it turns out that the American isn't the only unsatisfied customer.<br /><br />Then when an overnight guest expires in bed, Basil is thrown into a frenzy -- first he thinks it's because of some expired kippers he served the dead man (when he was already dead), and then he's determined to keep the death secret from all the other guests. Unfortunately, there aren't many places in a hotel that you can hide a dead body where someone won't stumble across it -- and Basil spreads the usual chaos as he and the staff stuff it in wardrobes, bedrooms and the office.<br /><br />When Basil and Sybil's twentieth anniversary rolls around, Basil secretly plans a party with some old friends of theirs. Unfortunately Sybil thinks he really HAS forgotten their anniversary, and storms off just as the friends arrive -- and a frantic Basil tries to convince the other couples that Sybil's got a weird mystery illness and has NOT left him. Unfortunately, they're too determined to see her, resulting in a very weird masquerade for Polly.<br /><br />And the series finale deals with what restaurants dread most: a health inspector, who deems the kitchen unsafe and unfit. While everyone tries to get the hotel shipshape, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (\\"Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!\\") in his room and orders it to be somehow removed from the premises. Unfortunately little Basil The Rat finds his way back into the hotel... at the same time that the health inspector returns to Fawlty Towers.<br /><br />\\"Fawlty Towers\\" is one of those shows that shone brightly and briefly, like a fireworks display -- the last four episodes of the series show little signs of slowing comic genius, and it leaves you wistfully wishing that John Cleese and Co. had managed to turn out one more season. As it is, the series ended on a high note without the jokes getting tired or old.<br /><br />\\"Waldorf Salad\\" is perhaps the weakest of these episodes, since it stretches the Basil-tries-to-pretend-the-cook-is-still-there joke to the max. But the other three are absolutely hilarious mixes of gags (the rat-in-the-purse scene), misunderstandings (\\"There's a kipper sticking out of your vest\\"), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything \\"normal.\\" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.<br /><br />And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (\\"Look, I'm just delivering a tray, right. If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'\\") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (\\"Don't talk to anyone, but he's dead.\\" \\"Ah. Shot, was he?\\" \\"No, no. He died in his sleep.\\" \\"In his sleep? Well, you're off your guard, you see\\").<br /><br />Cleese continued to play Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who finally gets told off en masse in \\"Waldorf Salad,\\" and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly finally gets sick of Basil's weird ideas in \\"Anniversary\\" and has to be bribed into impersonating Sybil, while Andrew Sachs has a rathercute scene in the final episode where he threatens to leave if they get rid of his pet rat.<br /><br />Wave a tearful farewell to \\"Fawlty Towers\\" in its third collection of episodes... then go eat a Waldorf salad and some overripe kippers on your anniversary, and shoot at some rats.hey get rid of his pet rat.     Wave a tearful farewell to \\"Fawlty Towers\\" in its third collection of episodes... then go eat a Waldorf salad and some overripe kippers on your anniversary, and shoot at some rats.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This is one of the best bands of all time at its peak.  Every song is amazing.    The musicianship is excellent here as is the songwriting.  What makes it even more amazing to me, is that this album was not done in a major studio...at least the is what the rumor is.  What I've heard is that the label gave Boston money to record, they did this record at home, saved a bunch of money (which they kept), and turned it in, since nobody would believe something this good could come from a home studio.    That's the rumor anyway!! :)    Regardless, this album is all meat and no filler.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Being another Rush fan going back to the \\"Fly By Night\\" days I am disappointed by this latest effort. The melodies themselves are fine, but I liked Vapor Trails more, even if it was ruined by digital distortion. The lyrics are the problem. Peart's lyrics while certainly not fine poetry would occasionally rise to nice prose in some of the earlier albums. Here he seems to have lost all subtly and is heavy and obvious. I had hoped that some of the melancholy expressed in Vapor Trails in songs like \\"The Stars Look Down\\" due to the loss of his family would have been replaced by a little optimism. Unfortunately this is not the case as he goes from being a hopefully optimistic pagan in the past to attacking religion and embracing nihilism. His reference to the \\"Dark Ages\\" demonstrates an intellectual shortcoming since modern scholarship has long given up that term. Regardless, Rush still can lay down some wonderful jams like in the positive named instrumental song, \\"Hope\\".     I hope the ghosts that still plague Peart can be banished before the next Rush release and we can listen to great music and some thought provoking lyrics.
1423101472|5.0|The last book of the Percy Jackson series was so good!!!!! I have read each of these books and pretty much devoured them. This one is just as well written as the others, and it was a great last novel!!! I really like the ending, too!!! :) These books are funny, but at the same time able to put in good action sequences. I hope Riordan does make another!!!
B001R4MEYS|4.0|The only reason I bought this album was because I heard them play a song from this album on The Late Show With David Letterman. I was impressed with the multi-vocals in the song, so I took a chance on buying this album. Can't say that I had any expectations of this album, apart from the fact that I was hoping that that they did more of the kind of multi-vocals which I heard in that song on Letterman. It wasn't Beach Boys style harmonies...it was vaguely Moldy Peaches multi vocals, as in \\"Goodbye song\\"...except that the Moldy Peaches were on a much higher level and more challenging in that song. So, from that perspective, I have t say that I was disappointed that Mastodon didn't go down that multi-vocal route on this album...that would have been really cool, I think.        I did like this album to a certain extent, but I wasn't really planning on reviewing it here, as I didn't think I had anything to say about it, until I thought I'd approach it from the perspective of how it didn't quite do what I was hoping it would do. So, to keep it simple, here's how I would describe the album:       The sound is highly polished in this album and goes from melodic (both musically and vocally) to more harder edged sounds, both musically and vocally. However, being so highly polished, even when the tracks veer towards more extreme sounds, it still sounds sort of mellow and easy listening, so to speak. You don't get the bone jarring shift in ambience as you do for Metallica's classic \\"Fade to black\\" where a beautiful accoustic guitar melody makes way for a crunching electric guitar riff. The change in ambience is like going from a hot sauna into a freezing cold pool for that song. It also has to be said that there are no transcendentally beautiful tracks like \\"Fade to black\\" in this album. There are some pretty enough melodies on this album, but nothing which really stands out.        Haven't really looked into fan and critical reception to this album, but what comments I have seen seem to mark this album out as a 'concept' album or as being 'progressive' musically. Can't really say that this kind of music is something that I have heavily explored or have a lot of reference points to relate it to. Can say that one concept album sounding song, by Sonata Arctica, namely \\"Caleb\\" is terrific, but nothing on Crack The Skye approaches that. However, the album that Sonata Arctica song came from, Unia, seemed weaker overall than this Mastodon album.        The main singer on this album, I think, sort of sounds like an American Joe Cocker. He doesn't really go for the more extreme metal singing sounds you hear nowadays...he is quite understandable, but occasionally he does go mildly extreme, vocally. As this album is described as a 'concept' album, I can't say that I was able to follow it really. With a vocalist like Ronnie James Dio, he eee-nun-cee-ates every word and is very easy to follow. Mastodon's lead singer has a style which washes over you and you lose track. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as some Bob Dylan songs are really nothing more than shaggy dog stories, but you really can't let his singing wash over you, as his voice demands attention, even when what he is saying isn't that interesting.       Back to the idea that this is a sort of concept album...I have to say that I wish the band was more ambitious with this...i.e. if this album was a lot weirder, but in an interesting way, I would have enjoyed it more. Not Trout Mask Replica weird, but maybe more \\"Wheels of fire\\" or \\"Horses\\" weird, I would have gotten more out of it. Even if an attempt to be more ambitious had failed, I would have given them more credit for trying. However, to give credit where it is due, Mastodon do mix things within and between songs, but, like I said, the highly polished nature of the recording just seems to even out the listening experience a lot.        Back to Letterman...listening to the cd, I can't say that I could pick which song the band sung.So, I'm guessing, there was something different in their approach on Letterman which stuck out to me. And that, unfortunately, is not captured on this album. Maybe on Letterman they weren't as highly polished, and maybe the multi vocals were more marked on that live performance too.        Before I go into the songs, I should mention that around the time of this review of mine, in the heavy metal magazine Revolver, there is an interview with the band where it's mentioned that the lead singer almost died after being king hit by a fellow musician...not sure, but the other guy may have been from System Of A Down. So, it's good to see the lead singer back, alive, and still creative. Often times one single punch can kill a guy. Literally.        Anyway, if you like smooth, melodic, lead guitar note picking and riffing rock, you may want to check this album out. It's very even, overall, but suffers from not really having any stand out song like a \\"Fade to black\\" or \\"Caleb\\". Here's my notes on this album, which has 50 minute running time:    Oblivion - has a gothic type intro...vaguely Enter Sandman with that; polished gothic, mid tempo metal. Multi vocals. I like the vocal melody of one of the singers. No silly voices and the lyrics are understandable.    Divinations - has a banjo type intro. There is an interesting tonal quality to the guitar sometimes. The singing is more intense here as is the guitar, which sound like they are revving at times. Guitar solos feature.    Quintessence - has grungy sounding guitars at the intro. Parts of this track are dreamy and I like the melodic notes on the lead guitar. The song is a little bit rock at times, too...sort of thrashy.    The Czar -(a song in four parts. I'll have a crack defining when each part begins):       I-Usurper- Piericing pipe organ notes. Melodic guitar playing Spartan notes. Eerie chorus, melodic verses.     II-Escape (from 3:44?)- Sort of thrashy intro, with lead guitar and riffing and dual vocals.     III-Martyr (from 6:54?)- Eerie synth, strings, then rock music. Melodic singing and a lot of bluesy guitar solos.     IV-Spiral (from 9:14?)- Returns to the catchy chorus of Usurper. Weird synth outro, and organ.    Ghost of Karelia - Vaguely Led Zeppelin \\"Rock and roll\\" drum intro as played by cymbals in this track. Thrashy at times, has a buzzing lead guitar at times and also melodic notes.    Crack the skye - the intro to this song is vaguely like Bon Jovi's \\"Wanted dead or alive\\"...the song being bookended by a guitar picking notes. The sound is vaguely mildly black metal, including the vocal style, at times. However, at other times the vocals are mellower and melodic.    The last baron - 13 minutes long (this song and The Czar almost account for half of this cd's running time). Has some more note picking on the guitar, multi-vocal harmonies which chime sometimes (percussive effect). A smooth song, but has some furious drumming at times. Pleasant vocal melody and the piano features at the end.       In conclusion, I don't mind this album, but I don't rate it very highly. It's sort of easy listening metal. If this is 'progressive' metal, then perhaps you need to be into that genre to appreciate this more than I did.       Since the version of this cd which came with the DVD cost only a few dollars more, I bought the version with the DVD. Not really looking to watch that dvd. Maybe it is a bit presumptious to have released the cd with that, but, of course, if you really dig this kind of music, then no doubt you will want to watch the dvd too.       Score? I'll say 73/100 tops. If you could call Metallica's Master Of Puppets 'progressive' metal, I'd say that I liked that more than this album. For an album that I rate very highly, with lots of different genres and styles played, I'd nominate Coldseed's debut album, \\"Completion makes the tragedy\\" which is a lot catchier and more sonically textured than this album.
0451217403|5.0|After watching the Godfather films on Blu-ray, I thought, it would be a great idea to revisit the underworld of Don Corleone.  This book brings us into the world of Don Corleone and his Mafia family.  We learn a great deal about the culture of the Mafia underworld.  While some people sometimes say certain forms of violence are \\"senseless\\" or irrational, Puzo shows that there are often times a rational reason for such actions.  This is not to excuse the violence and illegal behavior--but rather to explain the causes for such behavior.  By seeing the world through the lens of Don Corleone, it enables us to understand why such enterprises have been as successful as they have been in certain locations in the United States and around the world.  Rituals and rules such as secrecy, loyalty, friendships with important people in high places (Congress, local politicians, judges), and the aggressive use of force against \\"enemies\\" who violate the rules--all serve to protect and solidify this type of underworld family business.<br /><br />The Godfather family is not poor, but yet continues to pursue crime as a business, mainly because it is so successful at it.  Despite the loses that occur, and the pain that arises, the family presses on.  Ayn Rand would say that the Godfather family's philosophy is quite problematic in that they believe in unearned benefits through wealth distribution, thuggery and the influence of \\"pull.\\"  These are important factors to take into account when reading this book.
B001FB4W16|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I love True Blood.  I watched some of them on HBO, and I was anxious to buy them when they came out, especially hearing they were on Blu-Ray.  The series is wonderful and I loved every episode when I rented the series on DVD.  I would watch them over and over.    However, I was really annoyed by what I saw as a blatant attempt to charge more money by HBO for the BluRay set.  I remember the HiDef format war between BluRay and HD-DVD, and one of the selling points of BluRay is that it could be cheaper because it can store 6 times as much data as a regular DVD.  So why is it that TB S1 is on 5 DVD's, and in BR is on 5 BR disks?  I have grave doubts that moving the show to 1080p makes each episode's data 6 times as large.  In other words, HBO put the season on 5 disks to justify their being able to charge more.  BluRay could have saved them money, but they won't pass that on to customers.  For that, I sadly won't allow myself to buy the show.
0920668364|1.0|I got this book as a shower gift. I just read it to my daughter. Wow...I was following along fine, then I got to the middle of the book. Really? Is this book serious?<br /><br />A creepy mother sneaking into her adult son's bedroom.[...all I could think of is my mother sneaking in our room and my husband waking up to find her...or worse, my mother in law sneaking into our room and me waking up finding her holding him.] This would just be creepy. Weird and creepy. Talk about giving a child a complex.<br /><br />I did find myself laughing at the absurdity, but in a sarcastic and shocked way, not a way in which a toddler would or could ever understand.<br /><br />I am not sure how people find this book sentimental...If you want a sweet story for your baby, I prefer the book[[ASIN:0763642649 Guess How Much I Love You]]. Its a simple light story. The book has cardboard pages, easy for a young baby to turn. Its short, sweet, and a good quick bedtime story.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|I would gladly pay full admission just to see the first five minutes in a theatre. Don't listen to the \\"Amazon\\" reviewer; this film is much more than a parade of pretty pictures. It's far more powerful than you might expect, even two-thirds of the way through the movie. Life is often times not what it seems, nor what we would like for it to appear; yet life goes on nonetheless. This is the essence of this beautiful tale. Highly recommended.

The basic fundamental lesson in economics is to look at the impact of policy, not just on the selected groups to which benefit from that policy, but how all groups are impacted. It sounds rather elementary but with today's economists looking for short term political gain, it is a lesson people need to learn again and again. This book should be in all economics classes.

B00272NH0Y|4.0|Ok well let me start off by saying that the Stones best recording days are far bahind them.  Never again will they release a classic like...well you know...THE CLASSICS, and yeah Voodoo Lounge...Yes I called Voodoo Lounge a classic...because it is...Ok enought about the past on to \\"A Bigger Bang.\\"  Not a bad album but not a classic either.  I would classify it along the same lines as Goat's Head Soup, Emotional Rescue and Steel Wheels...all good albums but they all do miss that certain something, but \\"A Bigger Bang\\" seems to meander just a tad.  Great songs including Rough Justice, She Saw Me Coming, the politically sensitive Sweet Neo-Con and one of Keith's best songs, Infamy are among the best.  If you like the Stones you will enjoy this album!!!
1594488916|5.0|John Gilkey... Is there any name that provokes more revulsion amongst those who sell rare books? I don't think so. What a fascinating character to explore in a book-length treatment. I'd read little bits and pieces about him before, being an enthusiast for books about books, but never had I imagined the depth of his utter lack of remorse and sense of entitlement.<br /><br />The author herself doesn't collect books. She reads them, and loves them, but owning rare books isn't an interest of hers. That's a plus, allowing her to write this book without prejudice. She's able to write objectively, though with a clear idea of how wrong her subject's actions were. She writes:<br /><br />\\"What makes someone cross the line from admirer to thief, and how fine is that line? I wanted to find out.\\"<br /><br />And find out she did, through the thorough investigation required in order to write this book. Not only did her interviews with Gilkey and his victims give her a lot of background on bibliomanes; she also interjects much information about the rare book world in the process - how it operates, how difficult it can be to find specific volumes, how prized these books truly are by legitimate collectors. And, it would seem, by borderline insane people.<br /><br />I don't know if Gilkey is technically a sociopath, but there's definitely something wrong with a man who sees himself as entitled to steal rare books. His intention? Partly to make money by selling them, and partly to inspire the image he's a man of exquisite taste. His ideal is to have a home library with showy, expensive books:<br /><br />\\"I like the feeling of having a book worth five or ten grand in my hands. And there's that sense of admiration you're gonna get from other people.\\"<br /><br />And later:<br /><br />\\"It's a visual thing, the way they look, all lined up on the shelf.\\"<br /><br />It's his feeling of deserving to own books he can't afford that baffles me most. I can't imagine looking at, say, a Ferrari thinking \\"I deserve that!\\" I admire it, yes, but there's nothing that makes a person deserve an expensive, material object. Gilkey, on the other hand, feels angry and resentful he doesn't own rare and expensive books, and that others do. Never mind the bookseller is a legitimate businessperson who's gone to a great deal of trouble and expense compiling a collection. Never mind the rare book world is one in which dealers seldom make money. The fact Gilkey can't afford to own every rare book he covets drives him mad. Literally. And, for the dealers who've been swindled:<br /><br />\\"Those books that we \\"may never see again for the rest of our lives\\" are more than just beautiful objects, and their physicality makes their contents seem more meaningful, somehow.\\"<br /><br />This breaks my book-loving heart.<br /><br />As an almost librarian, semi book collector, book reviewer, former bookseller and former owner/operator of a book search service, it sends chills down my spine reading about the many ways in which Gilkey - rather ingeniously, I must add - swindled so many respected booksellers out of so many books. One thing you must say about him, he was/is sharp. That's the scary part. And he's still out there, having served what time the justice system could keep him.<br /><br />He makes a fascinating, though disgusting, subject. Learning how he went about stealing - because he was so open with Bartlett in the course of their interviews - is irresistable in the same way as looking at an accident. It compells you, against your better instincts.<br /><br />Despite the fact the author isn't smitten by book collecting by the end of this book, she definitely comes to sympathize with the love of obtaining books:<br /><br />\\"I did not succumb to full-blown bibliomania, as I thought I might. I did, however, come to understand more fully the satisfaction of the pursuit. Hunting down treasures for a collection brings its own rewards, but, ultimately even more satisfying, building it as a way of creating a narrative.\\"<br /><br />And yes, the hunt is addictive. As one who's been a hunter and collector - though not of books anywhere near this rare - I know the thrill of finding a gem. But mostly, my books are utilitarian objects. I have a few somewhat rare items, and a nice collection of signed and inscribed books, but nothing a man like Gilkey would yearn to get his hands on. My books are mostly for reading, for writing in and highlighting, for enthusing about when I love them, and for donating to my library when I've had my fill. As for the impulse to own fine books? Sure, I'd love that. So would many bibliophiles, but we content ourselves with looking at them when we can, marvelling at their beauty. My idea of heaven would be the sort of library Gilkey would covet. But in the meantime, we true book lovers are happy just knowing there's a wealth of wonderful books out there, and hope someone's taking care of those which are rare. For us, that's as far as it goes. And that's enough.though not of books anywhere near this rare - I know the thrill of finding a gem. But mostly, my books are utilitarian objects.

B001J9AQA0|5.0|When a band with one album is chosen by Paul McCartney to open for him in his big return to Shea Stadium (at the new Citi Field), and by U2 to open for them as they start their tour in Dublin, you would guess that these lads from Dublin are pretty good. The fact that, of the 10 songs on their CD, 6 have gone Number One in Europe, would confirm the 'pretty good' status, and get them towards 'really good'. Hear them live, and you will know that their performances are often better than the recorded versions, and singer Danny O'Donohue is an amazing, soulful, singer who will have you thinking Bono one minute and then do a dead-on Sting the next. His range is amazing and his Celtic soul sound is a welcome change to the dreary 'Boom Boom GaGa' sound of Pop Radio these days.     The history here is two of the members (Danny and Mark) were in a boy band called MyTown that had a huge signing bonus and then flopped. They were supposed to be an Irish version of NSYNC. After that they went to the US and worked with a lot of the top R&B producers and honed their craft. Mark is supposed to be one of the best choreographers in Ireland, but now stands still and plays the guitar while singing background or rapping. The boys are all jeans and work boots or sneakers, and the glitter is long gone. It works and they should be around for a long while.    Favorite songs include: We Cry, The Man Who Can't Be Moved, Breakeven, Before the Worst, Fall For Anything, Talk You Down, and the End Where I Begin. Good, but not Great (for me): Rusty Halo. Many friends LOVE it though.... Danny is definitely channeling Sting on that track, and the bass line is definitely Sting-like. This could fit on a Police album without modification. Not a fan of: If You See Kay...they are a little too clever here (think of each word as a letter). Kills the song for me.  (I wonder if Britney's writers pilfered this idea when they wrote If You Seek Amy...? Creepy to think of little girls singing along...) The songs are a blend of pop, soul, rap, rock, and R & B. I would say the lyrics, which are really important to me, are not as poignant as U2, The Clash, Dylan, etc. but definitely a cut-above the generic pop song, and the band clearly tried not to write a whole album of love songs. We Cry is about how life can trash people's dreams and be brutally difficult for many. Fall For Anything is about developing boundaries (You have to stand for something or you'll fall for anything), but in a boy-girl social context. Rusty Halo is about how fear and the rat-race can l overwhelm a person's spirit and cause them to forget the right things.    9 out of 10 ain't bad, to paraphrase Jim Steinman. Everybody I have told about this album has come back to me raving about it, and have become fanatical fans.The bottom line is the songs are very well crafted, (mostly) love songs, that are extremely catchy, well sung, with good lyrics, that you'll be singing along to for weeks. Get this album... you will love it. A solid 4 and a half stars for me.  And try to catch a performance online or live, you will be blown away by how good they are in person, often with just an acoustic guitar and box to bang on...
0307588335|5.0|This is a very good book.  It gives a very good and compelling account of what happened and if any of these low ratings are no more than Hillary/Bill lovers, Politicians who don't want you to know the corruption bs that goes on in Washington DC and Wall Street or the crooked Goldman Sachs.    Read the book, enjoy- everyone has opinions of how things happened, and unless Lawrence McDonald was a techno geek who stuck his head in the sand - they all know something - and being fired on Wall Street - is a badge honor.    Good book gives you some history of the Clinton and Roberta going around strong arming and call bankers racists - kind of brings a tear to your eye when you think of Obama doing the same thing -     Good read - good content - enjoy -
B0026RHR6K|1.0|Almost all of the DVDs arrived scratched. The DVDs are stored in cheap cardboard sleeves and slide around everywhere. If you want this set to last, buy the original season releases with better packaging.    Also, they are literally just re-packaged DVDs of the original season releases. They didn't even change the menus.     There is no reason to buy this when you can find the individual seasons for less money.
B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd:The Wall is,as far as I know,the first dark,depressing album in history.From the hostile funky groove Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2 to the cries for help in Comfortably Numb(Which is the greatest song of all time).I've had some people say that Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2 is trash beacause they're ignorant and don't listen to the rest of the fricken album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When they say \\"We don't need no education....\\"what they mean is by \\"education\\" is that over in England at that time and even today some places they virtually beat the children into submission trying to get them to do things their way.That's the education they give.Remember Pink Floyd is an English band,originating in Cambridge,England.They were all born in England and therefore that's what they grew up with.Over there that's normal.Maybe now some of the critics will change their minds.Try listening to 107.5 or sometimes 96.1 but mostly 107.5,they play Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 1,The Happiest Days of Our Lives,and Another Brick in the wall Pt. 2 all in a row.Listen to the lyrics and then you'll get it.       That brings me to another point,the flow of the storyline.Basically the album is like a book which is why they were able to create a movie out of it.From Pink's(the main character,you on the second side in \\"In the Flesh\\"note not \\"In the Flesh?\\"you hear him say \\"Pink isn't well he stayed back at the hotel.....\\" and on the first side in Young Lust\\"We have a call from Mr.Floyd to Ms.Floyd\\",at least it's supposed to say that but it says \\"Ms.Floyd to Ms.Floyd\\" instead.What gives?)father's death in \\"In the Flesh?\\" to abandonment by his wife(\\"Don't Leave Me Now\\") to his breaking point in \\"Outside the Wall\\".It's a very sad story,but it happens.Hehehe as I'm typing the Forest Gump scene \\"**** happens\\" flashes through my head.       So in other words all you critics shut mouths and listen to entire the album.Pink Floyd schools all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not eventhe Beatles compare to them!!!!!!!!!!!        P.S. Rap sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QGAX|5.0|Well, I'll just get straight to the point and review the songs, track by track.    Bad- When I was younger, this was always my favorite- mainly because of how he looked in the video. I thought he was the prettiest guy I'd ever seen, and I was so smitten. This is when we first hear Michael with a rougher edgier sound. It's a nice, catchy track, but in retrospect, a bit forgettable and generic. 7/10    The Way You Make Me Feel- Now this is another great video from him, and probably one of his most covered songs. It's got a great beat, and is very cutesy and young, and so fun to sing along to which I like. But once again, it's far from the best track on the album. 8/10    Speed Demon- Now this is one of my personal favorites. Most people dismiss it as filler, but I actually really enjoy it. It's more of an instrumental track than a vocal one- there's a lot of mumbling and oohs going on. But I love the use of the motors- it sounds like the perfect theme song for a car game. Very cool. 8/10    Liberian Girl- For the longest time, I thought this was called Librarian Girl. Unfortunately, this is my least favorite track. It's a nice mid tempo ballad, and the vocals are quite lovely, but I just can't get into it. I do enjoy the video with all the '80s stars. 5/10    Just Good Friends- Oh, man. I love this one. Admittedly, it does sound more like a Stevie Wonder song featuring Michael Jackson. But it's just so happy and cute, despite Michael's newly found \\"rough\\" vocals. They sound lovely together, and the beat and chorus are really great. 10/10    Another Part of Me- This has a nice melodic intro, and I'm sure a lot of non fans know the little keyboard part,  but it's one of the weaker tracks on the record. The video, however, is a dream- probably the best live performance music video I've ever see. The video helps the song a lot. But on it's own, the song is no competiton for the stronger tracks. 6/10    Man in the Mirror- Now, I know many dismiss this as cheesy and preachy, but I just love it so much. The words actually make you stop and think- hey! that's a good point! And Michael's *legendary* performance at the '88 grammys only makes me love it more. Such an inspirational thought provoking piece. And Michael's voice just takes it to the next level. Classic. 10/10    I Just Can't Stop Loving You- this is the love duet of the album, and was a huge success when it came out. Personally, I'm just not too into it. It seems like such a generic '80s love ballad. I do enjoy watching his live perfoamnces with Sheryl and Sieda, but the song itself is one of the weaker points on the record. 6/10    Dirty Diana- In one word, perfection. This is by far, the best song on this album. It tells the tale of a groupie who will do anything to \\"get it in.\\" It's hainting, sexy, sad, and most importantly, *cool.* This is Michael's best rock song- the bass line is just sublime, and then the guitar solo is insane... this song is regarded one of his secondary classics, but it's definitely in his top 5 best singles. 10/10    Smooth Crminal- Ok, how cool was the video? Michael in his white suit, in the '40's underground club, everyone doing such great choreography- just perfect. The song iteslf is overshadowed by the video, but it is a classic in itself. This is actually the first track where Michael is literally singing and hissing through his teeth- something he begins to do more frequently as time goes on. The falsettoed chorus Annie are you Ok- everybody knows that chant. This is an iconic moment for Mike, and deservedly so. 10/10    Leave Me Alone- *Sigh.* And so it begins. Me against the media. Another melodic intro, it's actually very catchy and very easy to sing along. Considering the subject of the song, the vocals actually aren't very harsh or angry sounding. At this point, it's still a game between him and the media, with a bit of a playfulness to it. If only it'd stayed that way... Either way, the song is very nice with a rad video. 9/10    Streetwalker- Mike was right on this one. Yes, it's quite similar to \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" but it's certainly better than \\"Another Part of Me.\\" I love how it begins with the far away vocal effect. He just sounds so young and cute on the chorus, yet rough and demanding on the verses. It's like two different people! But it's a great track- would've loved a video for it. 10/10    Fly Away- Now, here's a nice ballad. His vocals are very tender on it. He's basically begging his lover to stop messing up or else he'll leave her. It's one of his most romantic moments- more so than the duet on the album. I like it a lot. It should've been included on the album. 8/10      In short, this is his only album where I can listen all the way, and not feel the urge to skip tracks. There's so many hit worthy tracks on the album- more hitworthy tracks than any other album I've ever owned. And it's one of the few albums that has a second half that's stronger and more enjoyable than the first! It's odd how Michael himself was able to write his first and only filler free album. Maybe he should've believed in himself more, and written more on his albums, because this is by far his most consistent and catchy album. I'll go ahead and say it's better than Thriller. It's just lovely in every sense. Great classic album to own.
0439023483|5.0|This book, the hunger games, is nothing like i've ever read.  It's original and written in a style that totally fits my liking :]  It's definitely something i'd recommend to friends.
0553801473|2.0|Title says it all. It took years for this book to come into our hands, and it falls short. I guess between his other books he was able to write and his HBO series even George has forgotten his story line. I for one will not wait another 6 years for book Six. Its a shame because this series could grip readers by the throat! But I can't justify the wait or tolerate the authors indifference to his readers.
0780631684|4.0|The \\"Final Destination\\" series started off with this low-key and middle-budget suspense film. Cast with a bunch of young actors in a twist on the old slasher formula, except this time, the mad killer is old Grimm himself. It makes this movie a minor classic, in that there's never anyone chasing these kids through the woods (so to speak). You don't need to set up a story about the killer that got killed by the angry mob or tormented by nasty classmates. Death doesn't need that kind of contraption, Death just is.<br /><br />Of the actors, only Sean William Scott (aka \\"[[ASIN:B000031WD9 Stifler]]\\") and [[ASIN:B0024FAD9C Heroes']] Ari Larter have moved up from this series starter. Then one of the kids - Devon Sawa - has a premonition that gets him and six classmates plus one teacher booted from the flight. Said plane then explodes upon take-off. This team of cast-offs realize they've cheated death...or did they? Seems Death's Design isn't to crazy about being disrupted, and comes back for the stragglers. This is where \\"Final Destination\\" slips back into formula, and became more inventive in the way the teens get killed off. This does sort of make FD a precursor to the [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] series, in that the kills had to be elaborately set up and executed (har har).<br /><br />Even with the beach-blanket-bingo of the FD plotline, the suspense is real. Who goes next and who beats the reaper? The concept was so successful that the Big D came back for two more sets of teens ([[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]] and [[ASIN:B000FC2HS6 Final Destination 3]]) with a 4th in the works with little variance in the formula.
0470449748|5.0|My GMAT review instructor recommended this book, as it is... well... the Official Guide published by the test makers.  It was a great companion for the class, as it has a TON of practice and the questions get significantly harder as you work your way through each section.  I agree with the other reviewers, there is no test strategy here, but once you know the strategy (from a class or from a book like Princeton Review, which I also have), this is a great practice resource.  My one qualm is that the book is quite heavy (significantly heavier than Princeton Review)... carrying it to class was annoying, but definitely worth it.    If you are looking for hundreds of practice problems from real (retired) GMATS, this is the book for you.  If you are looking for test taking strategies, look elsewhere.
B000002GW5|5.0|When I first got this album in 1977, it knocked me over.  One of the best live albums ever recorded.  Every song is a gem from start to finish.  In my opinion, any greatest hits album that Browne comes out with should include every song on this album and sprinkled with a few of his absolute best from all the other albums.      A fun album because the songs are fun, the band is having fun and is playing tight and it still has a professional feel along with a touch of that raw garage band sound.  This is THE album to have of Jackson Browne's.
0307277453|4.0|This is a very brilliant, very accessible book. My only problem that I have with the book is that the common origin of teeth, feathers, and hair weren't explained in great detail. Also, lung evolution was only cursorily described. The explanation of the activity of the Hox genes, the Originator, Sonic Hedgehog activity in the zone of polarizing activity and the descriptions of Eusthenopteron, Tiktaalik and Acanthostega were riveting. One of my favorite books. I would also recommend \\"At the Water's Edge: Whales with Fingers, Fish with Legs\\" by Carl Zimmer for those interested in the water to land transition.
B000A59PMO|5.0|My friends turned me onto this show in 2007 and I just can't get enough.  I really wish they had not canceled it!  The characters are fun (and funny) and the high school scenarios are more realistic than say, Saved By The Bell.  Mars (Kristen Bell) encounters a lot of issues that face teens today, and she overcomes them with wit and attitude.
0007288387|5.0|This book is classic girly escapism and I loved it. Our heroine flees a bad relationship and goes to New York, immediately makes impossibly cool, beautiful and stylish friends, states flat-out she has a fairly unlimited credit card and bank balance, has a full makeover, shops a lot, and is asked out by lots of lovely handsome men who make her forget her troubles. The writing lingeringly describes the shopping experiences (Bloomingdales et al) and fully describes each outfit the heroine wears. My favourite novel is Madame Bovary, and this is totally the 21st century version (without the adultery and death-by-arsenic.) I enjoyed it more than any of Marion Keys books, even Sushi for Beginners, and it is frothier and even less realistic. This novel is not supposed to be realistic; it is idealized fantasy. If, like me, your fantasies include Marc Jacob handbags then you will enjoy this book. Perfect for holidays, or long wet weekends with hot chocolate.

B001JNNE64|3.0|A love the movie Amadeus. The music is superb! The scenes, costuming and historical rendering a superb! The choice of actors and screen writing a superb. However, in this rendition it is my opinion that the added scenes distract from the story. Some of them are good, adding details to the story. However, the partial nude scene of Mozart's wife did nothing. Other sections perforated the original rendition. The Blu-ray was great HD movie watching. However, the added scenes spoiled it for me.
B0028SVXR6|3.0|I loved The Bedlam in Goliath, so adjust your barometer accordingly when considering my review.  The previous Volta album was a muscular, diverse, intense, disturbing, ambitious album with little reprieve throughout; Octahedron is, from one possible perspective, constrastingly refreshing.  From another, it is a weak, dissolved effort; the shortest, slowest, and quietest album thus far from the band, and with few surprises.  For those who found that TBiG rocked too hard, the subdued Octahedron will offer some relaxed music, but (as I imagine the majority of fans' opinions are directed) the rest may find disappointment.       As I've indicated, the album is short.  Eight tracks, fifty minutes.  A numerical analysis suggests the band has grown lazy.  Anyone familiar with the progressive death metal band Opeth might see an analogous situation between Deliverance/Damnation and TMV's TBiG/Octahedron.  It's clear the decision here for a less bombastic approach was deliberate; the lingering question is whether or not the change is appealing.  All TMV fans (in my experience) adore De-loused; many consider it the band's greatest piece of work (I tend to vacillate), and Octahedron contains several cuts that remind the listener of parts from De-loused.  Copernicus is almost equal parts Televators and Radiohead.  The drawn out, reflective melodies and harmonies featured consistently over the album are interesting, but there is nothing here as haunting as Miranda That Ghost..., or as sprawlingly eerie Soothsayer.  Desperate Graves does steal the catchy chorus award, making it a highlight of the album.    The album does rock in parts, and the results are generally not failures.  Luciforms, the longest track on the record, alternates heavy, mid-tempo sections with ponderous, mysterious ones; building up towards a climax that is embarrassingly reminiscent of Tetragrammaton (one of the greater pieces of music the band ever created).  This latest track doesn't approach the level of visceral delight characteristic of Amputechture, however.  This is the worst album from the band and arguably the least progressive; it isn't bad, but hopefully we can expect more energized efforts from them in the future.  It seems that the unpleasant occult experiences associated with TBiG may have scarred TMV's creative tenacity.  Still, the album is worth hearing for its more exciting moments.  Since We've Been Wrong exudes a lulling drift of atmospheric, melancholic prog-pop/rock that beckons at the album's gates for a full listen.

I just listened to the 63 minute CD... I got what I needed - but I'm sure the book has even more relevant and effective information. I am more determined than ever to quit more often - and never give up in other areas.

Love this show! It will be missed.

The attack quickly escalates into an all out battle on the streets of Manhattan and Percy and his friends realize their odds of winning are slim. Still, Percy knows they must try, so he fights for their survival even as he worries about the prophecy surrounding his sixteenth birthday.<br /><br />\\"The Last Olympian\\" is the exciting, action packed fifth and final book in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the Olympians series for children. Riordan loses very little time getting the action going as Percy is called to battle within the first few pages. Because of its premise, while the book does have some light moments, it is not nearly as humorous as some of the other books in the series, notably the fourth book, \\"The Battle of the Labyrinth\\" which was laugh out loud funny at times. While the battle scenes aren't particularly graphic or bloody, they can be a bit upsetting for younger readers as many characters die, including some of the \\"good\\" guys. The Harry Potter comparisons have been inevitable throughout the series and never so much as in this book - the prophecy and the epic battle especially - but Riordan makes this series his own. Like Harry Potter, Percy finds romance (teenage style) and readers will have fun guessing who Percy will end up with - Rachel or Annabeth. The battle in the streets of Manhattan is an inspired thought and the action scenes will keep readers on the edge of their seats while reading the book. There are some great monsters in this book, notably Typhon, and readers will enjoy cheering on Percy and his friends as they struggle to defeat the bad guys. While this is the last book in the Percy Jackson series and Riordan neatly ties things up for Percy and friends, Riordan also deftly sets the stage for a new series at Camp Half Blood.<br /><br />\\"The Last Olympian\\" is an exciting book in an excellent series that readers of all ages will enjoy. Highly recommended!y. Highly recommended!
B0021L8UPI|3.0|The movie seems to be based on a mix of movie story-arc plots like The Good Son, Misery, and Silence of the lamb, and while those movies were decent with the story plot lines an all this one while having a little shock value won't be anything spectacular either.  The one truly hilarious and somewhat unbelievable part is the truth about the character of Esther, I can't give away to much I'm sorry but if you see this movie later on you'll see what I'm talking about.  The movie will give people their money with the violence and blood but again if you've seen the movies mentioned before the ending is pretty much a given on what happens at the end.  The actors are pretty decent for their roles but after watching the movie for twenty minutes you'll more or less just want to see what happens at the finale rather than what happens to the characters.  While my friends and I were watching the movie a lot of the scenes will probably bring a sense of deja vu as they seem so reminiscent of other movies seen before, and while they are different there still to close to those scenes with what you've seen on the other movies.  So if you're bored and are deciding to watch a movie and there not playing Harry Potter, G-Force, or Transformers here's the last one to with a tad of doubt try watching...
B00288KNLS|1.0|As an illustrator, I have to send a strong warning.  THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN.    This is a demented vile film being aimed at children as young as 11 years old. It's one of the most psychologically disturbing twisted films I've ever seen. It looks superficially like a benign animated film, but in reality, you discover it's an animated film wrapped around darkness, evil, voodoo, violence and insanity. Please,consider strongly whether to let a child see this sick flick. If you read the editors summary, please note the clear mention of \\"dark and creepy,\\" \\"demonic grins,\\" \\"disturbing and intriguing\\".  Sound like an R rated horror movie?  I happen to love horror movies, but films such as those are not aimed at children nor should they be.  THIS IS NOT CINDERELLA'S EVIL STEP MOTHER.  It's so much worse. It's a demented story about a hideous evil entity trying to get a child.    Sometimes artistic freedom is confused with license. In this case the producer has used artistic \\"License,\\" to make a film that is sick and warped...and yes, disgustingly aimed at children.    In this film, a core element is dolls that are created by an evil being to look like characters being chosen for exploitation...isn't that a voodoo doll?  Oh, and how about the idea of sewing buttons into a live child's eyes, \\"It will only hurt a little.\\" This film made, \\"Blue Velvet,\\" look like a tea party.   Love your children.  Guard your children. This is Hollywood once again spewing their twisted dreams on the public.  In this case, aiming vilely at children.    Kate

0345479092|1.0|A friend bought me this book because of the good reviews on Amazon, and gave it to me at my baby shower.  When my son was born, I tried to follow Tracy Hogg's advice, not knowing any better.  It turns out her book was useless for my colicky son.  Worse, her advice made him more and more agitated.  Desperate for help, I tried many other books (including Dr. Sears' book), and the only one that helped was \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Dr. Weissbluth.  Of all the books I tried, it was the only one grounded on actual sleep research.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Don't waste your money on Tracy Hogg's book.
B0026ZNL80|5.0|Although Riverside bears some similarities to other bands  in the progressive genre, they have managed to carve out a place that is unique - distinctly their own. They truly have a signature sound.    This album pours out the usual ambient, psychedelic, and metal mixtures that capture your attention, and take you on a mental, imaginary journey of musical ecstasy for its brief length of 44 minutes (and 44 seconds).     If any musician stands out in this album (they are all outstanding) it is the keyboard player who adds flavor after flavor, sound diversity and effects, who paints a musical picture that takes more than a thousand words to describe. The use of the Hammond organ adds a great feel to the songs, a 70's recollection, yet perfectly new millennium at the same time.     Passionate vocals with some intentional voice cracking, solid guitar - a cross of Gilmour and Petrucci, energetic drumming, creative basslines, even some horns, and absolutely perfect keyboard sounds/effects all add to a GREAT Riverside album. IMO, their best offering to date.     I am completely impressed by this band's consistent excellence. Do yourself a favor, buy this album, give it half a dozen spins (at least), and discover one of the most exciting bands to emerge on the music scene in a long time.

0312383320|1.0|I recently came into the world of Stephanie Plum and was suprised to learn that in addition to the 15 regular books, there are also \\"In-Between-the-Numbers\\" novels. No wonder it's starting to get old. There were funny moments in this novel, mostly from the weird dezizens of the Pine Barrens, but much of the intended humor did not amuse me much.     One other thing that annoyed me: Does she really need another man in her life? Aren't two enough? What is it about Stephanie Plum that gets three men in her bed? Make a decision and marry someone already, woman!
B000001DYY|4.0|To me, Roland Orzabel was the heart and soul of Tears for Fears, a British rock group that struck it big in the 1980s. Even with Curt Smith's departure, songs like Breaking It Down Again are still fresh and meaningful. Tears for Fears always sang from the heart and mind. Roland Orzabel recruited Alan Smith to join the void left by Curt Smith but I think the product would have ended up equally as well but not superb.     Elementals album is strong in songs like Breaking It Down Again and others. It's still a joy to listen to Tears for Fears anyway. This album is still a pleasure to listen too with it's unique sound and style. Tears for Fears didn't change for a new audience but maintained the same style and sound for an older, mature audience like myself.    This album is a must for Tears for Fears fans or for those who miss the sound the eighties and early nineties.
B001FB55H6|1.0|Beautiful graphics meets cliche after cliche after cliche. A fantastic bore where character's voices become a drone of redundant expression. Blah blah blah, after the first 3 hours (yes its that long) it really doesn't matter what the script is, it all sounds the same. So much visual emotion is expressed in the first 15 minutes that the rest leaves the viewer numb and in a state of sheer bordom. This goes for everything, the sound track, the graphics, the gore, the script... its so dramatic and intense that it cancels itself out.     Imagine if the great Star Wars trilogy was originally 3 years long. You'd want to murder the Ewoks by the first 12 hours and Ja Ja Binks the next (if not sooner)... now you've got 1094 days left to fill watching the same not-so-dramatic dialog repeat itself for the next 1094 days. A snooze fest, indeed or a future replacement for water boarding.    I give it one Star for artistic expression without substance.
0646418432|4.0|I'm embarrassed to admit that, prior to reading this book, I had never read anything by Agatha Christie. Last week, PBS featured one of her books on their Masterpiece Mystery show, and I thought it was very well done. My interest was piqued as to whether the books were as good as the show. I decided to start with her very first book published, rather than start with a later book and run the risk of encountering spoilers. So, I requested The Mysterious Affair at Styles from my library, and hoped for the best.    I was not disappointed! One big plus to The Mysterious Affair at Styles is that the culprit is not obvious. At the end of the book, I was just as surprised as the characters to learn who the murderer was, and what had happened. It was refreshing not to have it be predictable. I also like that the reader is given lots of clues along the way, to try and piece things together. The book moves quick enough that you don't get bored, yet provides plenty of details and complex characters. I definitely plan on reading more by Christie, if this book is any indication to what the rest of her mysteries are like.
B001N26GFC|3.0|Honestly, I can't quite see this as a comedy, more of a character study and human drama. Sally Hawkins plays the eternally optimistic and highly cheerful [annoyingly so at times] primary [elementary] school teacher Poppy, who goes through life smiling & bouncing along, attired in mind-boggling, outrageous outfits in brilliant, bold colors. When Poppy's bicycle gets stolen, she shrugs it off and begins driving lessons under the tutelage of acerbic and uptight Scott [Eddie Marsan]. Both these individuals are poles apart, and the driving scenes had some of the truly hilarious and maddening scenes in the movie [en-ra-ha! en-ra-ha! goes Scott, as he vainly tries to get Poppy focused on driving, whilst she's busy looking at squirrels whilst behind the wheel!].<br /><br />What works - Sally Hawkins [who was amazing in the BBC period drama \\"Persuasion\\"] is credible in her role as the upbeat and happy Poppy. She is 30, single, has lived with a female flatmate [who's also her BFF] for 10 years, and is okay with it [despite her younger, married and pregnant sister's remonstrations that she get a 'real' life]. This is an individual that seems utterly at ease with her life, taking flamenco lessons from an emotionally distraught dance instructor [another highlight of the film are the dance lessons and the emotional outbursts by the instructor]. Yet, despite Hawkins' convincing [and yes, annoying] performance, there seems to be something darker underneath - as though this eternal cheerfulness and upbeat manner is masking Polly's own awkwardness in some situations. I just got the sense [perhaps I'm wrong] that this over-cheerful manner wasn't all natural.<br /><br />The movie also seems choppy in its storytelling - some of the scenes don't really mesh- it's like a series of different stories being put together to form a movie. As I mentioned earlier, I didn't really see this as a comedy, more of a character study. The supporting cast are credible enough, but the almost manic driving instructor, as portrayed by Eddie Marsan was especially compelling in his performance, spittle and all. I'd have given it 4*, but the movie was too long, at almost 2 hrs, and could have been better with some editing.portrayed by Eddie Marsan was especially compelling in his performance, spittle and all.

B000007SPT|5.0|I'm moving away from my hometown this month and my best friend, whom I have known since we were fourteen, took me on a surprise driving tour of the area where all us kids used to live-- the park we used to frolick at in the rain, the coffee shops at which we used to try to wheedle pastries out of our friends when they got jobs, the local churches were we staged polaroid photo shoots, the movie theaters that we used to smuggle in alcohol to. The second I realized we were taking a trip down memory lane I nearly tore the CD playing out of the deck and put this one in immediately. Yeah, we were a bunch of kids decked in black running around in suburbia, and now we're a bunch of grown ups, and we are still friends, and we still love this CD.    This was one of the fist albums I ever owned, and I still reach for it, years later.    Anyway in case you're wondering I totally started crying with the \\"waaah i luv you guys so much omg waaah ur mah best friend\\" and he was like, \\"ewww no way stop it!!\\" and then we tried to score pastries at the coffee shop.

Me gusto mucho, porque es muy divertida y no llega al nivel de Narnia y el senor de los anillos, pero seguire leyendo la serie! Compralo no te arrepentiras.<br /><br />Dicen que la serie se enfoca mucho en la brujeria pero no es cierto. Primero que nada, la hechiceria es diabolica, y ellos hacen magia con una varita, por Dios a eso le llamas diabolico!! Por favor, Pues entonces las personas que hacen trucos de magia con varitas o que hacen ilusiones son malos tambien! La gente es bien envidiosa y si no les gusta la serie pues que no la lean.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This was probably one of the better movies made at the time. I wouldn't go as far as saying its a kids movie because this is one of the CREEPIEST movies I've ever seen in my life. Definitely a great fantasy movie though.<br /><br />One thing i never liked about this movie is the fact that the ALWAYS advertise this movie with 'From the director of Nightmare Before Xmas.\\" This implies that this is a Tim Burton film and/or that you should see this movie if you liked Nightmare Before Xmas, which i find to be false because they are not that similar.<br /><br />NOW the 3D in this movie was so/so. There were about 3 really great 3D scenes, and the other 90% of the 3D was sub-par. (of course there are many who argue), but out of all the 3D movie's i have seen, this does not make it to the 'greatest' list.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|In Treatment, a hypnotic HBO series, offers deep insight into the lives of others, other people's pain, suffering, wounds and neurosis. This excellent series operates within the structure of weekly sessions of six patients: One sexually-intense female doctor; one top gun; one teenage gymnast; a couple in trouble; and the therapist seeing his own therapist.    Gabriel Brynne does a grand job of portraying a therapist with great compassion and insight, and troubles of his own. Blaire Underwood does an outstanding job as an incredibly high achiever, and the list goes on with the great direction and the superb cast. The characters don't always fill the assigned professional shoes, i.e., the character that is supposed to be an anesthesiologist, as well as, a woman that uses sex as a sort of currency. The unbelievable part is that she's an anesthesiologist. Diane Wiest doesn't really seem like a therapist but pulls off the role by playing the role of a somewhat clichéd, self-absorbed therapist with foibles of her own, very awkwardly.    The episodes frequently end very uncomfortably, which remains one of its many charms.    I'm looking forward to watching Be'Tipul, the Israeli program upon which  In Treatment is based.
B0018TNMC0|1.0|Very, very poor HD transfer - save your money and make warner Brothers do this one right. The new BluRay release has poor picture quality. Buying this one for $10 does not justify a poor transfer. The 20 - 25% of this film that takes place in a brighter sky does look very nice. But a dominant amount of the film reveals poor black levels, look at the far right side of your screen - throughout the film. Even visible to some degree in the brighter scenes. The story is a classic, but hang on to your DVD for a while longer. Shame on you Warner Brothers!
0385341008|5.0|I don't mean it in a cutesy way. This epistolary book starts out a tad confusing, but the letters are such a light into the lives of the characters that becoming thoroughly entrenched in the novel happens very quickly. I'd say within the second page. Juliet's sense of humor really comes through, and even the education levels and life experiences of some of the characters can be inferred through the writing styles. The book harkens back to a time where letters were a literary communicative device, and language can be employed to a much higher degree than in today's email and txt society.

0767834739|4.0|Those evil, all powerful corporations just never learn.  Rule #1:  never, never go back into the secret, underground research facility after it has been sealed off because of cannibalistic zombies, rampant viruses, and a crazed, out of control, killer computer.  But in RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE, the big, bad Umbrella Corporation does just that.  And baaaaad things are released into Raccoon City.  Very bad things.  And it looks like only Alice can stop them.<br /><br />As with the original Resident Evil, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a monster-mashing, gore-filled zombie flick which is unexpectedly entertaining.  The pace is fast, the plot is thin, but followable (and even contains a few surprises), and the acting is typical for a monster movie...but then again, you don't watch monster movies for the acting.  The special effects are decent, if corny at times.<br /><br />If you take this flick for what it is, RESIDENT EVIL - APOCALYPSE is a fun, modern day B-movie, perfect for a popcorn evening at home.  My husband and I had as surprisingly good time with this.  And we are actually looking forward to seeing the next one!
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008)<br /><br />It has taken me a very long time to get around to reviewing The Reader, Stephen Daldry's Oscar-winning flick. This is because every time I sat down to review it, I found that the controversy surrounding the movie was still going strong (or had re-ignited), and I wanted to wait until everyone had given closing arguments. At this point, I'm not sure that will ever happen, but it's reached that point where the usual suspects are rehashing the same tired arguments over and over, so I'm abandoning any pretense of being able to report something comprehensive and pretty much ignoring the whole thing; in other words, this is probably the same review I'd have written last December. oops.<br /><br />In The Reader, Daldry (The Hours) tells the story of Michael Berg (played as a teen by Krabat's David Kross and as an adult by Ralph Fiennes), a German boy in the fifties who finds himself befriending, and then becoming the lover of, tram ticket-taker Hannah Schmitz (Kate Winslet). All goes well for one wonderful summer, as Berg and Schmitz romp and Berg reads aloud to her as foreplay or afterglow; one day, however, Schmitz vanishes without a trace. Berg remains haunted by her disappearance until a few years later, when he's in law school and is assigned by one of his professors to cover the trial of a contingent of female Nazi guards; Schmitz is one of them. As if this isn't bad enough, when Berg puts some pieces of the trial together with what he knows of Schmitz, he realizes he has information that could change the outcome of the trial. What's a boy to do?<br /><br />The core of the movie, the piece by which it must stand or fall, is the performances of the two main characters by the three actors who play them. Winslet, who's been racking up Oscar nominations right and left, finally and deservedly won the Oscar that has eluded her for so long, while Kross and Fiennes are both phenomenal as the two phases of Berg. With all the controversy surrounding the setting and the subtexts here, when it comes right down to it, The Reader is a love story, and in that regard, it is an undeniable success.<br /><br />But one cannot ignore the setting and subtexts; without them, it would be as forgettable as something like Message in a Bottle. I have a confession to make; I have never been a fan of Stephen Daldry's films, and the reason for that is that Daldry has always been as subtle as a steel mallet when it comes to subtexts. While that is the case here in more than one scene (one of the very few places I had a problem with Kross here is the wordless scene at the prison, with an agonized look on his face right out of the climax of The Perfect Storm), Daldry has certainly learned to be more subtle with such things than he was in the awful Billy Elliott or the painfully maudlin The Hours. A bit more subtlety, a bit more flair, in the handling of the Nazi question and this could have been one for the ages (and, I'm sure far less controversial than it was); as it is, it's still enough of a success to get a high recommendation from yours truly. I should have given it seven months ago. Silly me. ****ting and the subtexts here, when it comes right down to it, The Reader is a love story, and in that regard, it is an undeniable success.

B001KVZ6FM|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />For a few perilous moments in the middle of \\"Up,\\" I began to suspect that the folks at Pixar just might be about to register their first major stumble in the studio's hitherto flawless reign as \\"king\\" of the computer-animated film (a reign which began with \\"Toy Story\\" all the way back in 1995).  But, like the airborne house that floats at the center of the story, the movie eventually righted itself and sailed off smoothly into the wild blue yonder.<br /><br />This generally wistful and enchanting film tells the tale of Carl Fredricksen, a grumpy old man whose beloved wife, Ellie, has recently died, taking their dream - of traveling to South America, to a place called Paradise Falls, and setting up home there - to the grave with her.  When Carl is threatened with eviction, he hatches a fantastical scheme of attaching hundreds of helium-filled balloons to the house and flying to South America on sheer wind power alone.  This he does, accompanied by an adorable little tyke named Russell, who just happens to be caught under the porch at the moment of liftoff.<br /><br />So far, so good, as \\"Up\\" captivates us completely with its imagination, its lyricism and its charm, along with its visual homage to such earlier classics as \\"The Red Balloon,\\" \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Around the World in 80 Days.\\"  There's also a stunning montage sequence which chronicles - without narration or dialogue - the complete married life of the Fredricksens, starting with their wedding and ending in Ellie's eventual death.<br /><br />The trouble for \\"Up\\" begins to rear its ugly head only after Carl and Russell have arrived at their intended destination.  Here they are confronted by a number of strange and exotic creatures, including a hitherto unclassified species of bird and a bunch of dogs who've been given the ability to speak by some sort of shadowy mad scientist who's clearly up to no good in this remote corner of the world.  At times, we begin to suspect that once the writers, Bob Petersen and Pete Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there.  But the messy mixture of science fiction and jungle melodrama they've come up with is unworthy of all the quality work that has come before it.<br /><br />Yet, what eventually saves \\"Up\\" from crashing and burning in its second half is the wonderful voice work by Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer and Jordan Nagai, the soaring and sweetly romantic score by Michael Giacchino, and the theme that sometimes our yearning for adventure can make us so myopic that we fail to perceive the \\"adventure\\" that's happening right in front of our eyes on a day-by-wonderful-day basis (more shades of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\").  These alone are enough to compensate for the occasional narrative misfires, a made-to-order villain, and an overabundance of drooling, snarling pooches that feel strangely out-of-place in a tender and lyrical fable such as this one.<br /><br />The animation and backgrounds aren't quite as rich and compelling as they were in Pixar`s previous two ventures, \\"Ratatouille\\" and \\"Wall-E,\\" but the less spectacular look actually makes \\"Up\\" a more contemplative, relaxing work to sit through.e Docter, came up with the idea of launching an old Victorian house into the stratosphere, they never really figured out what to do with it once they got it up there.

B000G8NXYG|4.0|The Seven Samurai (Akira Kurosawa, 1954)<br /><br />It is no secret among those who follow my reviews that I tend to disagree with a lot of both critical and public choices for the best movies ever made. The Seven Samurai is currently ranked at #18 on IMDB's Top 250 list, and only two thousand-best lists I've ever seen have a Japanese film ranked higher on their lists than this one (the Halliwell Guide not only has a Japanese film higher--it ranks Ozu's Tokyo Monogatari as the finest movie ever made--while on IMDB's list, Spirited Away occasionally supplants it for a short time). And as you can probably guess form the opening, I disagree. While I understanding the reasoning behind the reverence--The Seven Samurai is, after all, the first modern action film, and is just as innovative as Nosferatu had been thirty years earlier--it's not really all that memorable when it comes to anything but its technical innovations. (It's also possible I just don't cotton to Akira Kurosawa's movies; the only one I've seen to date that's stuck with me for more than a few weeks is Dersu Uzala.)<br /><br />Simple plot: a village is under siege by bandits, and the elders decide to hire out-of-work samurai to guard them. They get a mix ranging from the stern, masterful warrior to the illiterate samurai wannabe who's not afraid to break any rules necessary to make sure the job gets done (Throne of Blood's Yoshio Inaba and Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune, respectively). Much of the film focuses on the samurai's preparations for the village, the day-to-day lives of the villagers and the samurai, weaving in understated humor and pathos with the drama before the explosive action sequences.<br /><br />Of course it's been influential; I can't think of a major action film made afterwards that doesn't co-opt one or more aspects from this movie. But just because it's influential doesn't mean it's immortal; one of the things about influential movies is that when so many people do what you did, some of them are bound to do it better. I don't think many people necessarily disagree with me on this; after all, one of the movies on IMDB ranked higher is The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which ripped its structure straight from The Seven Samurai. (I have to say I wasn't that fond of that one, either, and probably for the same reason; glacial pace punctuated by action sequences that are entirely too short, especially given previous films like Alexander Nevsky that were much better paced). Still, while you're watching it, there's more than enough to compensate for the film's running time. I am not in any way saying that The Seven Samurai is a bad movie. It's a good movie, and it is without doubt one of the most influential films in history. But is it, from the standpoint of simply being a fun, watchable, perfectly-made film, one of the twenty best movies ever made?

0307269981|5.0|When we last left the Millenium Trilogy, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander had solved a decades old serial murders, and teamed up to take down Blomkvist's dodgy nemisis. The story continues when Blomkvist is preparing to run a shattering expose on the Sweden sex trade.  The reporters writing the story and Lisbeth's guardian are murdered, Salander becomes the prime suspect in three of murders.  Cryptic as always Lisbeth is avoiding Blomkvist and has disapeared.  Blomkvist is convinced that she is innocent, and so they team up (sort of) to save Lisbeth's furture from her secret past.<br /><br />The tremendous reception of these books must have something to do with Stieg Larsson's ability to make them feel so modern.  The story is Lisbeth's as Larsson adds layers to his fascinatingly complex and uttely charming character. It is so rare to come across an original character in fiction, much less a suspense/crime/mystery novel where formulas and clich&eacute;s abound.<br /><br />So what if some of the plot revolves around improbable coincidences?  The plot moves.  I read these books back to back, more than 950 pages combined, and to my surprise the story never stalled and my interest never lagged.  Instead I was disappointed when the second book concluded, and I'm dying to read the third. If you liked The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, you'll be glad to know that The Girl Who Played with Fire exceeds even high expectations.  Fire stands well on its own, but it is more of an extension of everything I loved about the Tattoo.  I find that I can't talk about one novel without recalling the other.  Larsson's characters and dramatic twists continuously shock. These novels set the benchmark of what a crime novel can be.  They are an unparalleled achievement in fiction and worthy of all the buzz and fanfare readers can laud.
B0021L8UPI|3.0|Orphan (Jaume Collet-Serra, 2009)<br /><br />To Orphan's credit, I will say that the assertion made in the trailer is accurate: I never saw the Big Reveal coming. The flipside of that is that I didn't see it coming because it's a huge cop-out, as it is with most films of this type. This is a problem, because in order to explain what's wrong with this movie, I'd have to give away the big reveal, and I do try not to do spoilers in a review--especially when I'm going to end up telling you to see the movie, as I probably will with this one. There are a number of good things about this movie, and the fact that they're each balanced with a bad aspect doesn't make the good parts any less rewarding. But it's the Big Reveal that was the killer here; I'd have unhesitatingly recommended the movie, warts and all, were it not for that.<br /><br />Orphan is the story of a family who adopt a nine-year-old girl named Esther, played quite creepily by Hounddog's Isabelle Fuhrman in her first big-budget flick. Previous to Esther's arrival, the family--mother Kate (The Manchurian Candidate's Vera Farmiga), father John (The Mysteries of Pittsburgh's Peter Sarsgaard), son Daniel (Star Trek's Jimmy Bennett), and Daughter Max (Aryanna Engineer in her first screen role)--is your basic family, though they have recently (it's never explicitly stated, but is seems to have been roughly six months before this) had a devastating event. The couple's third child, Jessica, was stillborn, and they're looking for a child to whom they can give the love, in Kate's words, they had for Jessica. When they first meet Esther, at the St. Mary's Home for Girls, she seems bright, open, and friendly, and Sister Abigail (the wonderful CCH Pounder) is actually kind of impressed that the usually reserved Esther has opened up to them. When they get her home, though, things start going wrong. While John is convinced it's all in her head, Kate thinks that perhaps Esther is not the innocent she passes herself off as (and thanks to the way the story unfolds, we know that Kate is right, and that the big thing here is Kate needing to convince John that she's not crazy).<br /><br />I think a lot of the problem Orphan has had with early reviewers has to do with its marketing; this is not a horror film in any way, it's a bad-kid movie along the lines of The Good Son or Godsend, a psychological thriller rather than a horror flick. It doesn't help that Dark Castle's name is attached to it, but somewhere along the way, Dark Castle has graduated from being a purveyor of crappy remakes to a distributor of movies that are actually trying, and the first few scenes here definitely try. Check out the shot at the beginning of the third scene in, where Vera Farmiga is walking across a schoolyard. The optical illusion as she walks just along the tree branch's path is just great. Not at all the kind of thing I'd have expected from Collet-Serra (House of Wax). Looked at as a thriller, it's not as much of a disconnect. And the acting here is top-notch from everyone involved, which makes it a great deal stronger than other movies of this type. There's quite a bit to like here.<br /><br />Balancing that, though, are the movie's problems, all of which come from a screenplay by first-time write David Johnson, formerly a production assistant to Frank Darabont. For a movie that essentially revolves around this family's dynamic and how it changes in Esther's presence, we don't actually get to see much of that family dynamic; it suffers from the American problem of thinking that too much character development is a bad thing, and so we get told a lot of things we should be shown, and a lot of things that would probably have helped make this a great movie (one of the biggest is the character of John's mother, who we see as nothing more than a way to advance the plot; there's a scene she has with Vera Farmiga that tells us, though, she could have been so much more). And, of course, there's a Big Reveal, which seems to exist as a way for the screenwriter to assuage his conscience about making a bad-kid movie (compare, for example, to Godsend, where the cop-out wasn't so much in the Big Reveal as it was scattered throughout the movie). More subtly, though, I think the bond formed between Esther and Max would have been a lot more believable if Esther's personality hadn't been so simplistic. We know from the opening scenes that Esther is capable of acting friendly; wouldn't it have been obvious to have Esther build a strong friendship with Max in order to secure her trust, instead of doing what she does? (It got so bad I really thought the Big Reveal was going to be that she was a pint-sized hitman for the Russian Mob.) Contrasted with all this is the script's willingness to allow us to get to know these characters, which is something of a contradiction in terms; I wonder if a lot of the problems with this didn't happen in the editing room rather than in the script. Perhaps they cut it because they thought it was too long (the theatrical cut runs just over two hours); I'd have been more than willing to sit through another thirty or forty-five minutes of the slow, but wonderful, setup here in order to see more of the family and the way it changes before we get to the nasty stuff. And for the record, the nasty stuff isn't all that nasty (the movie's opening scene is actually its most gruesome).<br /><br />This movie stirred up controversy months before it opened, which telegraphs to me that, obviously, those stirring didn't actually see the movie. I don't think I'll be wrong in my prediction that few of them, if any, will ever actually see it; movie protesters rarely do (I quizzed protesters outside movies from The Last Temptation of Christ to Kinsey, and have yet to find one who actually saw the movie they were complaining about). Ignore them. While Orphan has its share of problems, as far as bad-kid movies go, it's the best I've come across. At this rate, we should finally get the definitive bad-kid psychological thriller in about ten years. I'll be waiting. ** ½screenwriter to assuage his conscience about making a bad-kid movie (compare, for example, to Godsend, where the cop-out wasn't so much in the Big Reveal as it was scattered throughout the movie).

B002436WFI|4.0|i'm going to presume that you, like myself, are a long-time Discworld reader.  if you're not familiar with the plot of the first two books, or Terry Pratchett's writing, or the themes and characters of Discworld, you should skip this.  although the movie would be a good starting point for anyone unfamiliar with Discworld lore, this review is specifically for veterans of the books, if not the previous adaptations (Wyrd Sisters, Soul Music, Hogfather).    the plot(s) of The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic were carried over mostly intact.  some specific scenes or events are left out or glossed over, but i think it was an acceptable adaptation.    i have no problem with Twoflower being \\"American.\\"  it works, it really does!  i don't remember it saying anywhere that Agateans *look* Asian.  but Twoflower's gormless optimism?  Sean Astin nails it!    i *do* have a problem with Rincewind.  for one, he seems too old; i know that's also a minor complaint, but he didn't look much younger than Cohen.  my bigger gripe is that Rincewind is supposed to be a runner (away), not a eye-roller.  less befuddled muttering, more screaming for help in 87 languages.  too much of his faux-exasperation falls flat    since i mentioned Cohen, i must say they did him justice.  mostly.  i mean, you can *clearly* see his teeth while he's complaining about not having teeth.  but his mannerisms and fight scenes are spot-on!    what else?  oh, the Librarian.  one of everyone's favorite characters, they must have gotten him perfect, right?  nope, it's an unconvincing guy in an ape suite.  i'm presuming they had reasons not to use a *real* orangutan, but the costume simply didn't work, in my eye.  put a man in an ape suit and it still moves like a man, not an ape.  it would have been less unreal (eg, more fantastic) to use a CG orang, or a Henson-esque puppet.    Death seemed better actuated (physically) than in Hogfather, but some of his lines sound more like Marvin from HHGTTG than Death.  for easy example: \\"I WAS AT A PARTY, YOU KNOW\\" sounded more like a complaint than a reproach.  still, \\"I THINK I JUST HAD ANOTHER NEAR-RINCEWIND EXPERIENCE\\" is worth the price of admission  =)    finally, the Luggage.  its movement was perfect!  it trundles around in a bouncy gait, often chasing people around in the background.  i wish its homicidal nature had been more on display, and they never did show its mouth (\\"lots of big square teeth, white as sycamore, and a pulsating tongue, red as mahogany\\") but its \\"expressions\\" and reactions were subtle and brilliant.    all in all, i enjoyed The Colour of Magic more than Hogfather.  i also feel more comfortable recommending it to non-fans as there's less background to know and hidden context to be aware of.    i can't wait for Going Postal, the next adaptation.  oook!
B00005JLWN|3.0|Equilibrium (Kurt Wimmer, 2003)<br /><br />Matrix ripoff that's actually a good deal better than Matrix, but that's not saying much. In this one, John Preston (Christian Bale) is a member of the Tetragrammaton, a sort of secret police-style organization dedicated to the stamping out of anything in society that causes people to feel emotion (in the opening scene, for example, Preston and crew destroy the Mona Lisa). Preston and his partner Partridge (The Dark's Sean Bean) are Clerics, members of the inner Tetragrammaton circle, and rigorously screened to be above suspicion; Preston, however, discovers that Partridge has kept back a piece of contraband from a recent raid, a book of Yeats' poetry. Preston is forced to execute Partridge, and soon gets his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be even more fanatical than Preston. Preston, though, has his own secret: he's stopped taking the drug that blocks emotion, the drug that the entire society takes. And maybe emotions aren't quite as awful as he's always thought...<br /><br />The thing that stands out about Equilibrium at first glance is the cast, which contains a stable of incredible B-list stars--Bale, Bean, Diggs, Emily Watson, William Fichtner, Dominic Purcell, Sean Pertwee, John Keogh, Angus McFadyen, and more. Which is good, because Kurt Wimmer, writer of such classic film adaptations as Sphere and The Thomas Crown Affair and director of the immortal Milla Jovovich film Ultraviolet (just in case you didn't catch it, the first half of this sentence is rather heavy with sarcasm), is neither a good enough writer nor a good enough director to make this into the truly excellent movie it could have been. The strength of the cast saves it from being as horrible as The Matrix, but it does rely far too heavily on staged action sequences. There is a surprising amount of character development here, and it's very nicely acted, though it'd be nice if it were better-paced or had a slightly stronger plot to hang on. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying, well, maybe more than it should. ** ½t of sound and fury, signifying, well, maybe more than it should. ** ½

B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972)<br /><br />Put ten critics in a room and ask them what the best movie ever made is. At least seven of them will tell you it's The Godfather. (An eighth will tell you it's The Godfather Part II, but that's another review. The other two will come up with something way out of left field that you've never heard of, but is made of awesome anyway.) I first tried to watch The Godfather about twenty years ago and found it an unwatchable, unforgivably slow mess of a movie that became one of the handful (at best) of movies I turned off without finishing. With all the critical acclaim the movie continues to receive, however, I decided to go back and given it a second chance; I'm a lot more patient now than I used to be. In fact, this time I grabbed the entire extended trilogy boxed set form the library and watched all three films over the course of a week. I liked this one a whole lot better the second time around, to be sure, but I do still think it had its share of shortcomings.<br /><br />The Godfather was made (as, I assume, the novel was written) with an eye toward the epic; everything about this movie is bigger than life, from its Bollywood-esque running time (just shy of three hours) to its frankly jaw-dropping cast. It tells the story of the passing of the guard in the Corleone family from the aging patriarch, Vito (Marlon Brando), to one of his sons. (While I seriously doubt there's anyone who doesn't know the end, I won't give it away.) The thing is, all three of Vito's kids--Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael (Al Pacino)--are in some way unsuitable for the role. Fredo is what we'd call these days a little slow (may, in fact, be mentally challenged); Sonny, the closest of the three to the old man, is loyal but wants to do things his way; and Michael wants to shake free of the family business entirely, to the point where he's enlisted in the army and found himself a non-Italian wife (Diane Keaton). In fact, things are so bad that Vito's even considering naming his adopted lieutenant, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), as the head of the family--and he's Irish. The fireworks erupt when the entire clan gets together for a wedding, and the gang warfare in the city, which has been in a state of uneasy truce for a while, swings back into high gear.<br /><br />The depth of acting talent in this movie is beyond compare. Brando, of course, had already won an Oscar (for On the Waterfront) and had been nominated for four more. Pacino would pick up an Oscar nomination for his role here, and would go on to nab six more nominations and a win (including being one of the very few actors to be nominated in two different categories in the same year). Caan picked up a nomination for his role here. Duvall picked up his first nomination here, and would go on to four more nominations and a win. Keaton would go on to an Oscar win and three more nominations. The only one of the main cast without an single Oscar nomination is John Cazale, who made only five films before his untimely death (but he did pick up a Golden Globe nomination for Dog Day Afternoon). And that's just the principal cast; we're not even getting into the incredible cast of supporting players (Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda, and Sterling Hayden are just the tip of the iceberg). It goes without saying that the acting here is stellar. Mario Puzo's script, adapted from his own novel, is well-done, but my complaint about the leisurely pace of the movie still stands (though not nearly as strongly as before); yes, there's a lot of character development here, but I don't see why it couldn't have been done in about two-thirds the time. It also helps to think of this less as an action film than as a character-driven family drama, but not like any family drama you'll ever see on the Lifetime Movie Network; this is family in all its bloody glory (and let's face it, the mafia stuff is nothing more than overblown allegory for the more intimate familydynamic here), and despite the incredible slowness, it's all fascinating.<br /><br />As I said about The Seven Samurai (above), I'm not saying The Godfather is a bad movie in any way (though I'll agree with that eighth critic that Part II is the slightly better movie). It is, in fact, a very good movie. But is it the best movie ever made? As I keep my own list of the 100 Best Movies Ever Made, and something else is at the top of it, the answer in my case should be obvious. But that doesn't mean it's bad. ***<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />The Godfather, Part II (Francis Ford Coppola, 1974)<br /><br />[NOTE: this review necessarily contains spoilers for The Godfather. If you haven't seen that one and plan to, don't read this.]<br /><br />Where Francis Ford Coppola set out (as my hypothesis goes; see review of The Godfather above) with The Godfather to make an epic film, when he wrote the screenplay for The Godfather Part II, he set out to surpass epic and head into the realm of the immortal. And how does one do that, you ask? By taking an already amazing cast and adding one of the finest actors of his generation, Robert DeNiro. After all, when you're already the finest screenwriter on the planet (and Coppola had already proved that on several occasions, including screenplays for Patton and The Conversation), you've got Mario Puzo's writings to work from, and the first movie was widely hailed as a masterpiece, all you have to do is keep doing what you were doing before.<br /><br />Part II of the series interpolates scenes of Vito (De Niro) as a young man, showing how he became the man we saw in the first film, with present-day footage of Michael (Al Pacino) trying to clean up the mess left for him by Vito's death. The family is still in tatters, and things are only getting worse; his wife Kay (Diane Keaton) , originally part of the driving force behind Michael's decision to walk away from the family, is upset by his taking over, adding stress to his already fragile situation. In order to expand his empire, as well, Michael reaches out to Cuba, and its insane dictator Batista.<br /><br />It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original film it follows, and whether Part II does that is something that's been hotly debated by both critics and the public for decades. I'm one of those who thinks it does; we already know many of these characters, but that doesn't prevent Coppola from continuing to deepen our relationships with them (and them with each other), while adding in new characters and giving them the same treatment. As a result, this one's even longer than the first, running about three and a half hours. Unlike the first, however, Coppola had gotten into the groove of this thing and had a better handle on how it should be paced; this one has far fewer places where it drags. As well, while the first film is essentially plotless, just showing us the family in its decline, within the story of the family's rises to power, we get the story of Vito and his wife, which is a true masterpiece in every way. It could have been a film on its own.<br /><br />I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that The Godfather Part II is a great film; you've probably heard it from every critic you've ever read. Well worth seeing, even if you weren't thrilled with the first one. ****<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />The Godfather, Part III (Francis Ford Coppola, 1990)<br /><br />When it was originally released, Coppola's third (and, to date, final) entry in the Godfather series was almost universally panned, considered by most to be a case of a lot of those involved needing the money and capitalizing on the series name. In the intervening twenty years, however, perception of the film seems to have mellowed a good deal, and the good things about it have gotten more press; after all, despite its critical reception, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, and there's usually a reason for that.<br /><br />The action takes place (mostly) during the late seventies.Michael Corleone is approaching sixty, and feels tremendous guilt about the violence and mayhem his family was responsible for in previous decades, and he has turned the family business towards legitimate interests. The bulk of the movie deals with Michael's attempt to buy the Vatican's shares in a real estate holding company (the Vatican needs the money, while Corleone needs the legitimacy); all well and good, except Corleone's old mafia buddies also wantin on the deal, and are willing to go to great lengths to secure a part of it. Meanwhile, Michael's old bodygyard Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), feeling slighted on the deal and an enemy of Michael's new prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Sonny's illegitimate son), declares war on the family he served for so long. Life is never tranquil in the world of the Corleones.<br /><br />Much of the criticism surrounding this movie, it always seemed to me, centered on the performance of Sophia Coppola. I don't think it deserved anywhere near the vituperation poured upon it. It's not that Coppola's performance is bad, it's that the Godfather series has always featured the kind of acting that makes a good performance look mediocre. There are some interestingly topical bits (like the ascension of Pope John Paul I) that haven't aged terribly well, but anyone old enough to have been alive during that time should have no problem with it.

B002DKGWSE|2.0|Last House on the Left (Dennis Iliadis, 2009)<br /><br />Among hardcore horror fans, I seem to be one of the very few who considers Wes Craven's debut film, The Last House on the Left, to be one of his worst. (Thankfully, I saw The Hills Have Eyes, one of my favorite movies, before that, and was already an established fan when I saw Last House.) When I heard a remake was being done, I figured it would probably be better than the original, and when every criticism levelled at the movie by the Ben show (aka At the Movies) could have equally been levelled at the original movie, I did have some small hope that the remake might actually be worth watching. It was, as I expected, better than the original, but it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.<br /><br />If you've seen the original, the plot will be familiar, though it's got some variations. Two lovely young things, Mary (Superhero Movie's Sara Paxton) and Paige (Superbad's Martha MacIsaac), find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, and one ends up dead, the other raped. The bad guys end up at Mary's house, where her parents have a perfect opportunity to exact revenge.<br /><br />The big thing about this one that makes it better than the original is that we actually get a bit of character development, and it's quite well-paced (when was the last time you saw a major, big-budget American horror film with a running time of almost two hours that didn't make you say \\"this could be half an hour shorter\\"?). The big change that didn't work for me, on the other hand, was the general make-up of the parents. One of the things I actually kind of liked about the original was the absolute cheesiness of the parents, who were straight out of the American Gothic painting--old, kind of infirm, but entirely without scruple when it came to torturing and killing the bad guys. The cognitive disjunction there was fascinating; here's an old geezer with the blandest of smiles wielding a chainsaw in order to hack up a dead body. Awesome! In this one, we get young-and-beautifuls as the parents of young-and-beautifuls; we're supposed to believe, somehow, that Monica Potter gave birth to Sara Paxton? I mean, come on, Monica Potter was barely old enough to have given birth to the not-quite-toddler in Saw, and that was only five years before this. Also, the new screenplay, scripted by Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth (this is Alleca's first writing credit; Ellsworth's most recent film is Disturbia), gives the parents, especially Potter, much more in the way of moral quandary about killing the bad guys off in inventive ways. It's an interesting reversal of form from the Hills Have Eyes remake, where the moral quandary was taken away. I'm amused.<br /><br />All in all it's not a terrible little film as long as you can get past the idea (as the Bens obviously couldn't), integral to both the original and the remake, that this movie exists for the sole purpose of allowing the parents to exact brutal, bloody revenge on the bad guys--which also involves making the bad guys bad enough for us to sympathize with, if not cheer for, the parents. It's not deathless cinema, and I'll be amazed if it finds its way into too many permanent collections, but it's worth watching once. Kinda. ** ½ne, we get young-and-beautifuls as the parents of young-and-beautifuls; we're supposed to believe, somehow, that Monica Potter gave birth to Sara Paxton? I mean, come on, Monica Potter was barely old enough to have given birth to the not-quite-toddler in Saw, and that was only five years before this.

0525950079|4.0|\\"Expecting the world to treat you fairly because you are a good person is a little like expecting the bull not to attack you because you are a vegetarian.\\" ~Dennis Wholey     This book takes place in the 14th century, 200 years after The Pillars of Earth. I really enjoyed both books. This book felt like a carbon copy of the prequel but with different character names and a little different storyline. Some may consider this a negative, but I say stick with what works.     The characters in this book are inserted into the troubles of the time: war with France, the plague, and famine. One reviewer said that the book makes for chutes-and-ladders reading, and I think that's the perfect description. A crisis arises and just as a resolution arrives there's a new dilemma to take its place. Just as in the first book, the good people are good and the bad people are bad. There is no in between. There is a constant struggle between the good characters in the book and the bad. The two elements at the heart of this book are injustice and revenge and that makes for a fun read.     I think Follett is a great storyteller and an average writer but he writes great page turners and that will keep me coming back.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|I own dozens of Cds By Elvis. This is the BEST STUDIO RECORDING OF HIS CAREER. Included in this collection are pop,rock,  R & B, soul, \\"the Memphis Sound\\", gospel, blues, and many other well known genres. The production is first class.

The quality, production, song selection and arrangements  are outstanding. Of course you have the hits, In the Ghetto, Suspicious Minds, Don't Cry Daddy, Kentucky Rain, and Rubberneckin'.  If you only need one Cd by the King of Rock 'n' Roll, this is the one. Great selection of songs, outstanding production.  This is Elvis at his very best. This validates why he is the KING. You get 34 songs that showcase his voice and  the power of the artist. BUY IT!
B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Call it superstition or karma, but I guess the fours have to mean something here.  Four words to the title of the album and then 44 minutes and 44 seconds in length.  I have had this release since June and this is another great album from this band that hails from Poland.  While you can call it progressive, ambient, eclectic Riverside has a sound all its own and that's what drove me to them in the first place.  There is just something unique that they deliver album after album.  Each song here is a keeper and won't disappoint.  If you haven't tried Riverside before then this would be a great start to add to your collection.  The only negative would have to be the length.  But if you desire more then check out lead singer Mariusz's side project \\"Lunatic Soul\\".  A little bit more somber, but still a great listen.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Why this motion picture did not gain more attention is confusing.    Even the DVD is lacking in Extras and should have been a prime candidate for Commentary.    Anthony Hopkins can do no wrong.    Alec Baldwin is terrific and at his best.    The supporting cast of Mr. Perrinneau, Ms. MacPherson, Ms. Wilhoite, and Mr. Jones are superb.    All under the grand direction of Lee Tamahori who gives David Mamet's dialogue a run for the money.    It is an action tale. A story of survival intertwined with an intense character study of two men who find their values at the wrong time in the wrong place.    One cannot forget to mention the magnificent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith which in itself has become a rarity to procure.    A fine piece of cinema that needs to be seen more than once.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I was skeptical at first, reading all of the pre-release \\"reviews\\" badmouthing this set, but I am very glad I ordered. The movies look amazing in HD, and it is a real treat to see them in their original theatrical format. I'll write a brief blurb on each below:    Star Trek I - After becoming used to the Director's Edition over the past few years, I was sure I'd be disappointed by the theatrical version, but instead I found it a true masterpiece. To me, this film had the clearest picture, at least until I watched Star Trek VI. Hands down, the sound on this film beat all others easily. The soundtrack with the symphony orchestra and James Horner's score sounds beautiful. Visually I did not miss the Director's Edition updated effects shots at all. In fact, given the choice between the two now, I would prefer the original, as the shots in the Director's Edition can look a little bit overdone when considering the context of when the film was made and the overall style.    Star Trek II - If I had to choose a disappointment with this set, this would be it. I still give the set 5 stars, but unfortunately Wrath of Khan's picture and sound were underwhelming for a blu-ray release. As some critics have suggested, it probably has to do with the restoration of the film and subsequent remastering. While still superior to the dvd release, the image is not as sharp and sound not as powerful as the other films. It's sad to think that the original source must have been that far gone.    Star Trek III - This is probably the least exciting of all the movies, but picture was good and sound just as good as the others, even in the bright, hazy scenes on Vulcan. There was no distortion as there would be on dvd.    Star Trek IV - It was a real treat to see this on blu-ray since this was the first of the Trek movies I saw in the theater. Watching Kirk and co. run amuck in S.F. in high-def in the 80s is a real visual time capsule, and very enjoyable to watch.    Star Trek V - I've always feltthis movie got a bum rap. It is cheesey and hokey, and the \\"search for god\\" actually ties back to a theme in the first movie, but the picture quality was excellent, and sound was especially good. Especially during the Sha Ka Ree scenes with the \\"god\\"-being. It was fun to see the detail in all the scenes, ESPECIALLY in the opening scenes filmed on location in Yosemite. The film is good for a few chuckles and shakes of the head, why not enjoy them in high def?    Star Trek VI - This had the absolute best picture quality. Sound was clear and crisp, though nothing special. This film didn't have the grandeur of some of the earlier ones as far as sound is concerned (Like I, IV or V), so it's not a knock on the quality of the blu-ray, just a fact about the film. I'm guessing this one really shined from a picture perspective owing to its relatively younger age.    All in all, I highly recommend this set. If you enjoy HD movies on blu-ray and are even a casual Trek fan, you will enjoy it!
B0013FYTA8|5.0|This is such a great album! The lyrics are catchy and clever, the vocals are alternately growly and melodic, depending upon the subject matter and mood of any given song. I love this band because they have this uncanny way of putting common human experiences so eloquently into words. Just about everyone can relate to the pleasure and pain of love and loss. These guys are haunted by the memory of lost loves and have been on both the giving and receiving end of the pain. The hard rocking facade nicely packages the wisdom and sad beauty of the experiences they so aptly describe. My favorites are Not Meant To Be, All Or Nothing, Heaven, and Wait For Me. This band is one of my favorites, and severely underrated! Their previous album Gasoline is great as well! Check it out - you definitely won't be disappointed by either record if you enjoy catchy guitar riffs and heartfelt but sometimes hard-edged lyrics.
B00260HH3K|2.0|I've never been anything close to a superfan of Dragonball Z, but I greatly appreciate the global following that it has managed to sustain for years.  When I first saw clips and shots of the live-action Dragonball: Evolution, I had feared that it would be one of the absolute worst things ever committed to celuloid.  Well thankfully, Dragonball: Evolution is not the train wreck of a movie that many thought it would be, but is instead an overly hammy and slightly overcooked take on the Dragonball mythos that's biggest accomplishment is the fact that its cast manages to keep straight faces throughout the proceedings.  Justin Chatwin (War of the Worlds, The Invisible) stars as Goku, who seeks revenge on the evil Lord Piccolo (Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters) for the death of his grandfather in his search to collect the mystical Dragonballs and jump-start some universal destruction.  Chow Yun-Fat is along for the ride as well as Master Roshi, as is Emmy Rossum as Bulma and Jamie Chung as Chi Chi; but none of which other than Marsters stands out as anything memorable.  The rest of the film's aspects, from its special effects to its fight choreography, to the sloppy direction from Final Destination helmer James Wong, to the fact that the film is just over before you know it, all end up sealing Dragonball: Evolution's grave.  Still, there is something about it that makes it worth seeing, although for die hard Dragonball fans, this can pretty much be considered blasphemy.
B00284BMBM|5.0|This album is amazing, and the more I listen to it the more I like it! Chris' voice is powerful, haunting, mesmerizing...the songs on this album range from hard rockers to slow and kinda twangy (but in a good way!), so I believe there is something to appeal to just about anyone. The lyrics are heartfelt and powerful as they have always been - very beautiful and moving. Great follow-up (and very long-awaited for me personally), I hope these guys keep putting out great records for years to come. As long as you make 'em, I'll be a loyal and enthusiastic fan! :-D Daughtry is definitely one of my all-time favorite bands.

1439157383|1.0|Seriously one the worst books I've read. I feel like the author didn't have the courage to follow the through with the story. I know she has said she had it planned out from the beginning but seriously, you are going to boil the whole story down to a random accident? Then in future everything is okay so don't get to glum...  Cheap, why don't I just listen to a Brittney Spears song and eat some pop tarts while laying on some 50 thread count sheets to finish the experience.    Honestly it would be like if at the end of the Joy Luck Club a meteor hit the town and vaporized the mothers, and sisters in China, then flashing forward and showing how that ironed everything out and made the daughters overcome their issues with their mothers. Seriously a cowardly writer, I don't think I will explore anymore of her work.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Had an old video cassette recording of this updated \\"Romeo-Juliet\\" film, which I use to teach my 9th grade English classes for the required curriculum, but the old tape wore out and skipped and blipped, so I recently ordered the new CD, at a most reasonable price (which I can deduct for income taxes for school supplies I pay for myself yearly), and it arrived on a timely basis, in brand-new seal-wrapped conditon. Already showed it last week at the end of my summer school English 9 classes and it was fab, as always. I like the original Zefferelli (sic?) version, but love this one, too, with Leonardo, Claire, John, and the incredible actors playing Mercutio and Prince Escalus. I NEVER before really understood Mercutio's \\"Queen Mab\\" soliloquy until I saw this modern version and then it all hit me like a \\"crystal bullet to the brain\\" (was that Marlon speaking in \\"Apocalypse\\"? --  Did I get that quote right?). Anyhow, thanks, Amazon, for your always timely and affordable service, particularly where teachers are concerned. I'm your biggest fan! DeLana Beagle (:
B001VZY4M8|4.0|I recently purchased the 1st four Neil Young CD'S remastered and I was quite pleased with the overall sound.The music is cleaner,louder,livelier,with more punch to it.It is a DEFINITE IMPROVEMENT over the original CD'S.What I don't like about them is the noise and excessive tape hiss at the end of each track.Instead of smooth fade outs,when the music ends a blast of loud air blows through your headphones (tape hiss)followed by dead silence ( oh yeah the songs over STOP ).For me it ruins some of the listening experience.I know I\\"m picky but smoother segues like the originals,would have been easier to take.The great sounding music with QUIETER SEGUES would have been perfect.Don't let this stop you from buying them they are an improvement just be aware.This is one man's opinion.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Nathan Fillion is of, course, the main star attraction in Castle, and everything that has been said about him in the above reviews is absolutely spot on:  he is wonderful in this roll he was born to play. But don't overlook Stana Katic.  She is phenomenal. Her intensity is pitch perfect as a foil to Castle's bonhomie.  He sparkles and she reacts, with humor or aggravation.  She is intensely private;  he is extremely open.  His family is funny, loving, and endearing;  she really has no one, except a distant, grieving father.  She is all business, and he is ostensibly all pleasure.  But, of course, he has depth.  It is wonderful to see him get under her skin and help her to feel, and relax, while revealing his often hidden strength of character.    The camera loves Stana.  She has an intensely, beautiful face and fine bone structure. The close ups of her interrogating a suspect or consoling a victim are like nothing else in the usual round up of television's female detectives. She grieves for the victim and slices the suspect with her clarity.  Her eyes are luminous and reveal intelligence, and compassion, as well as grit and determination. Nathan's eyes are all twinkle, but awareness of the depth and sometimes despair in his \\"partner's\\" eyes is not far from the surface.    She is toughness and dedication to duty personified;  he is not afraid to appear silly and shallow, traits he has perfected, with not too much depth ever expected of the playboy author.    The two of them are magnificent foils to each other; the stuff of good drama and comedy. The show embodies a good mystery, often paralleling the events in Castle's and Beckett's lives, and with sharp writing, excellent secondary characters are drawn to the delight of the audience, but make no mistake, the show is about Castle and Beckett, and they simply light up the screen. Because of their partnership, both characters grow and share their individual lives, feelings and true personalities. Need I say I love thisshow. It is a joy to see them shine, Nathan and Stana, Castle and Beckett and demonstrate through this high quality show that neither one is  \\"just another pretty face.\\"      .....continued.....September 10, 2011...Today, looking back over three seasons of Castle, I cannot help but think about the beginning, the themes and threads developed through excellent writing and stellar acting, and realize that Castle is still my favorite show but with one difference.  Now it is epic.     \\"Who are you?\\"  With these three words, Kate Beckett, the \\"hauntingly\\" beautiful detective, seizes the Castle stage, and with scorching intensity, surveys the crime scene and never gives in; she is \\"extraordinary.\\"  We are fascinated by her tenacity, her integrity, and her beauty, from our first encounter with her, and so, too, is Rick Castle, best-selling author, young father, and playboy, man-about -town.   Indeed, the two unlikely \\"partners,\\" Richard Castle and Kate Beckett, spend their time together attempting to answer these existential questions about themselves and each other, as their true personalities grow and meet, sometimes, somewhere between real and magic.     Sated with fluff and fake, Rick is bored with his pampered, predictable life, empty of \\"surprise.\\"  He remarks to his daughter, \\"I would like someone to come up sometime and say something new.\\"  Then Kate, real and dedicated, walks into his life, and everything changes for him, so much more demanded and expected. In fact, they have turned each other's world upside down.    Without a doubt, Castle is about so much more than just another pretty face. The writing, and acting are superb, \\"on so many levels,\\" to borrow a Rick-ism, although he is usually referring to something provocative, as in \\"disturbing on so many levels.\\"  Revisiting the show's first season and seasons two and three, is illuminating, providing  an opportunity to trace two themes or threads and the incredible writing and stellar acting, embodied in a meretelevision show.  The journey to self-knowledge, trust and love propels the story, involving all of the characters, Rick's mother Martha and his daughter Alexis, as well as detectives Ryan and Esposito.  But lighting up the screen, is the dynamic between two ostensibly different, sometimes-confused, would-be lovers, Rick and Kate, as they struggle to define themselves and each other.     Often with preconceived notions, both Rick and Kate seem to think they know the answers or can solve the riddle of their \\"partner.\\"  Kate teases on one occasion, \\"So many layers to the Beckett onion; however will you peel them off?\\" The fun, frustration and passion lie in the unraveling.  Frequently Kate says, \\"You don't know who I am,\\" words echoing though out the entire three seasons of Castle.      From the beginning Kate shuts Rick down when she feels that he is getting too close to the real Kate: \\"Don't think you know me,\\" she defends. And in one of the final scenes between them in the season three finale, Kate still cries out:  \\"You think you know me, but you don't.\\"  In an earlier episode, Rick pointedly says, that he understands Nikki Heat a lot better than she thinks. Then, too, late in season three, in \\"To Live and Love in LA,\\" Rick confesses to Kate:  \\"You know what I thought when I first met you.  You were a mystery I would never solve...I am amazed at the depths of your strength and your heart.\\"  Slowly the layers begin to peel back and unravel.     Also, Rick wants to know the story behind Kate's career choice.  He theorizes in the first episode: \\"Something happened. You are wounded....not that wounded...you lost someone you loved.\\"   Then Kate's achingly, lovely, face changes from mildly amused with this playboy, to seared and stripped, exposed. Reading her face, her pain, Rick retreats, revealing one of his finer qualities:  kindness.      Shoring up his playboy image, however, Rick asks Kate to join him for a \\"debriefing\\" dinner date at the end of their first casetogether, but Kate is sure she knows Rick's type, or so she judges:  \\"What,  and become one of your conquests,\\" she responds.     Then Rick makes a singular reply for one so sure of himself:  \\"Or I could become one of yours.\\"  This man is not all that he pretends to be.  True, Rick is not yet the steadfast man he gradually becomes. In the beginning Kate considers his actions similar to \\"a nine year old on a sugar rush,\\" and she feels forced to endure him. Consequently, she treats him like a child, poking him or grabbing his nose or ears to admonish his demanding, spoiled behavior.  Although childish and pampered, he is generous; and honor defines him.  A nurturing father, Rick is present for Alexis, for fun, in crisis and for decisions, and Kate begins to see the loving father in his soul-searching and in their discussions on raising a teenager. This is a rare man she discovers.      In their dance of discovery, Rick, like Kate, reveals a compassionate and sincere nature, and this revelation disrupts Kate's preconceptions or fears of Rick. Rick often makes witty, self- effacing remarks, charmingly side-swiping a conversation, reluctant to expose his serious side. He is invested in maintaining his shallow, bad boy image, and he, too, is hiding.  He may think he is peeling Kate layer by layer, but he, too, is exposed. When Rick tells Kate he was a lonely kid, Kate kindly comments: \\"You had a lot of imaginary friends.\\"  Rick quips,\\" I still do.\\"    Slowly, the seemingly shallow man realizes the harsh truths of Kate's cop world. Real heart break and death are not as easy to handle as they are in his novels, and the cop's burden is a harsh reality.   What will you tell Alexis, Kate frequently challenges Rick.  His clear response is always:  \\"the truth.\\" Indeed, truth is the essence of this man, this story teller.    Another theme originates in the opening scenes of this drama, and threads across three years until the season three finale.  Kate asks Rick:  \\"Why are you here?\\" He considers the story his first reason for shadowing the detective.  Inspiration and research for his next novel are also safe answers.  Gradually, however, the charming novelist realizes what everyone suspects; he is there for her.  Rick admits this to his mother when she asks him why he is risking his life, for he cannot rewrite the endings and charm his way out of a bullet. With love for Kate etched on his face, he admits to his mother that, \\"it's not about the books anymore.\\"     In season one we see his growing love and awareness of Kate and his need to be near her, and we see him change to become a better man, for her and his daughter.   In season three Captain Montgomery advises his four, young protégés regarding marriage.  So much of a successful, caring relationship, he explains, is realized by \\"just showing up.\\" It was as if he were speaking to Rick alone because no matter the obstacles, Rick will not leave Kate's side; she cannot \\"get rid of him.\\"    In another moment of self-discovery, Rick confides to his mother:  \\"I don't want ordinary.  I want...\\" His mother fills in the word...magic.  Kate recognizes his magical qualities, pointing out Rick's innocence, noting his love of zoos and museums.  She won't admit it always, but she enjoys his amusing stories and his witty repartee.  Rick loves life and enjoys fantasy.  With a child-like joy in life, he plays laser tag and fences with his daughter, rocks out with his guitar, carves pumpkins, throws costume parties, flies black-hawk, model helicopters, or dons the trappings of the mad scientist.  He sees the magic in life, in family, in fate, in the universe, in love, in the heart, in Santa and in hope.  And he wants to share the magic, especially with Kate.      Rick's beliefs and their differences are never more poignant then in this exchange between them when they part company for the day.      \\"Until tomorrow,\\" Rick remarks.     \\"You can't just say good night?\\" Kate retorts.    \\"I am a writer; until tomorrow is more hopeful.\\"      \\"I'm a cop.  Goodnight.\\"     However, when allowing Rick back, in seasons two and three, Kate does say to him:  \\"I'll see you tomorrow.\\"    Over time, Kate awakens to the fun in Rick's company with him \\"pulling her pigtails,\\" and begins to relax and enjoy herself a bit more. In a final scene, Captain Montgomery sums up the impact Rick has had on Kate. He sees how good Rick is for her, and he tells her that she wasn't having any fun until Rick came into her life.      Well-grounded, nevertheless, Kate believes in real and always.  She isn't sure that Rick fully understands these concepts, given his track record of two failed marriages and many empty conquests.  \\"When it comes to marriage, I am a one and done kind of girl,\\" Kate reveals. But along the way, Rick learns the word always.  \\"Always\\" becomes a code word for their unspoken love and commitment to each other, and they use this word guardedly and tenderly.      Gradually, throughout the first season, Kate begins to trust Rick with cases and thus with her life.  His magic works in season one, until Rick tries too hard to fix Kate and bring her some closure in her mother's murder.  With his anguish visible and knowing he will cause her pain, Rick tells Kate the truth about his discoveries regarding her mother's murder, clearly knowing that she will withdraw completely from him. Feeling betrayed and unwilling to go down the same path that nearly destroyed her before, and even with Rick by her side, Kate wants Rick gone and no longer shadowing her. His worst fear is realized, and he must leave her. The end of each season brings something to separate them, a betrayal, another man or woman, and finally... a bullet.     And so it goes, sometimes... star-crossed love.      Their love story begins with two questions:  Who are you? Why are you here?  For three years, Kate and Rick struggle with shyness, hesitation and rejection, unable to find love and fulfillment with each other. Sometimes they come so achingly close to a declaration of need and love, but they are so star-crossed that it hurts the heart to witness their pain and poor timing.      Finally, it is the symmetry of those first words, colliding with their resounding echoes and responses in the final scene, crushing and uplifting us simultaneously, gripping us with heart-stopping intimacy.  \\"Who are you?\\"  \\"Why are you here?\\"  a lover's quest.  At last, Rick and Kate solve the existential mystery, each in his own way.  Kate's response is her last loving look at Rick before she is shot and before their world falls apart, and her trusting gaze at him while in his arms, fallen and bleeding. For Rick, the writer, the answers to the mystery are etched in his last words:       \\"I love you...Kate.\\"
1594202249|5.0|4.5 out of 5: Cloaked as a detective thriller, Inherent Vice contains the snappy dialog, complicated plot, and criminal underworld types typical of the genre. Don't be fooled by the packaging, though. This novel is pure everything-including-the-kitchen-sink Pynchon with satirical song lyrics, paranoia, drugs, pop culture, lawyers, sex, politics, zombies, more drugs, and a side-trip to Vegas. The neat resolution of a convoluted plot is not really the point. Instead, let go of your need for closure and join Pynchon for a buoyant romp through the psychedelic haze that was L.A. in the late 1960s.<br /><br />Doc, an amiable, drug-addled personal investigator, stumbles onto a vicious international crime ring as he works on a case brought to him by his ex-girlfriend. By turns brilliant and bumbling, Doc exudes a kind of humble innocence and is the likeable center of this novel. He's both trustworthy and trustful and never far from questioning his own abilities and actions (\\"Did I say that outloud?\\"). In a typical example of the endearing workings of Doc's logic, he tries to deduce the origin of a postcard he receives \\"from some island he had never heard of out in the Pacific Ocean, with a lot of vowels in its name\\":<br /><br />\\"The cancellation was in French and initialed by a local postmaster, along with the notation courrier par lance-coco which as close as he could figure from the Petit Larousse must mean some kind of catapult mail delivery involving coconut shells, maybe as a way of dealing with an unapproachable reef.\\"<br /><br />In Doc's world, postcards delivered via coconut catapults make perfect sense.<br /><br />Clearly, Pynchon is having fun with the detective genre. In one scene, Doc drives to a mansion protected by a moat with a drawbridge. After the drawbridge descends \\"rumbling and creaking,\\" \\"the night was very quiet again--not even the distant freeway traffic could be heard, or the footpads of coyotes, or the slither of snakes.\\" Beneath all the humor and satire, there's a darker message here. The fun is almost over for Doc and his fellow hippies as paranoia, the harbinger of future oppression, overtakes the fun-loving sixties \\"like blood in a swimming pool, till it occupies all the volume of the day.\\"<br /><br />At times Inherent Vice is overly constrained by its purported genre as Pynchon weaves together the complicated plotlines of a detective story, maintaining too tight a grasp on a linear reality. The excessive plotting hampers some of the book's whimsical exuberance. But, unlike much of Pynchon's previous work, Inherent Vice is eminently readable and even, at times, actually suspenseful. At under 400 pages, Inherent Vice is also one of Pynchon's shortest novels. If you've been too intimidated to attempt a Pynchon novel up to now, try this one.here.

0307460444|5.0|I recently got the cupcakes book and I've tried two recipes so far.  The cookies and cream cheesecake and the red velvet cupcake. I'm always a bit wary with trying out American recipes in Australia but both translated well. I didn't have any problems getting the ingredients and the measurements worked out. They were both very easy to make and have gotten great reviews from friends and coworkers. The cheesecake is no fuss and visually appealing, and the red velvet has a great texture and taste - even without the icing.
B001993Y2C|3.0|I'm posing a question as a review and hopefully a hero will come along to answer it for the masses:    Has anyone purchased this (FOR BLU-RAY) and can they attest to the picture and audio quality?    I watched it on Sci-Fi (SyFy) HD and enjoyed it but I would say it was 720i, far from paying the extra money for the Blu-Ray version.  I can save $100 and buy it for on DVD for my upconverting player but if it is a true 1080i or 720p version then, for me, it is worth the extra money to by the Blu-Ray version.    ___________________________________________________________________________    Notes:    I've watched the series, I like it.  So I don't need your IMDb copy and paste.    I'm looking at Blu-Ray.  So I don't want your DVD review.    I want to know hard facts about the disc.  Not the box, not the action figure, not the price, not your opinion.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I am not an audiophile.  Others reviewing this album have explained the subtle nuances of the sound that, honestly, is well beyond my appreciation of music.  But I have loved this album since it first came out, I heard them perform it at Saratoga, NY in 1974.  And I knew once cds became capable of surround sound, that this album would eventually be released in such a format.  When the surround sound Dark Side of the Moon (\\"DSOTM\\")was released, I purchased it immediately, and I (a 50-something year old lawyer) laid in the middle of my living room with the lights out and had an amazing experience.  Wonderful, huh?    Except Sony did not release it on DVD-audio so that everyone could have this experience.  It manufactured it using it proprietary SACD format.  This is not the first time Sony has left consumers in the lurch.  (Remember Beta video, anyone?)  There are probably more than 100 million DVD machines and perhaps 1 million SACD-capable players. Like laser-discs, this format has been left in the dust, EXCEPT Sony owns the rights to DSOTM.  So those who were not stupid enough to buy an SACD-capable Sony player, will never get to hear this album in surround sound -- an album that should be heard in surround sound.  Of course, I was one of the fools who bought an SACD capable machine so I get to listen to it as it should be heard.      Maybe Sony will relent and offer this album in dvd-audio at some time.  It did this with one of the top ten albums of all time -- Miles Davis's Kind of Blue.  At first it was released in SACD. But then, once Sony realized that SACD was not going to make it, it offered that album in DVD-audio.  So there is hope.  But in the meantime, I've now got three dvd players crowding my audio/visual set up:  (1)the Sony because it is SACD capable and I have albums like DSOFM, Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms, Big Brother's Cheap Thrills, and Roxy Music's Avalon which may be heard in surround sound only through an SACD player, (2) an oppo that can play any disc from any region (I've got some British comedy series, such as Green Wing, that is only available only as a Region 2 set, and (3) a blu-ray player. (Thank goodness i wasn't sucked into buying an HD-DVD player.)    I sincerely hope that Sony does the right thing and releases this in a DVD-audio format.  It should not be punishing those who were smart enough to realize that SACD was going to lose the surround sound competition.
B001UN1KVE|5.0|In a Galaxy not so far away, a ruthless race of beings called Spaceballs lead by the dreaded runt Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and moronic president Scroobe (Mel Brooks) have came up with a diabolical plan to take all the air away from their neighboring planet Druidia. A runaway princess named Vespa (Daphne Zungia) with sassy robot maid Dot Matrix (Voice by Joan Rivers) is rescued by a stubborn but lovable space trucker named Lonestarr (Bill Pullman) with half-man half-dog alien companion Barf (John Candy) as they all join forces to learn the ways of the magical and mysterious Schwartz power from master Yogurt (Mel Brooks) and stop Dark Helmet's plans.<br /><br />Excellent Sci-fi satire from co-writer, producer and director including actor Mel Brooks is one of the coolest and best comedies i've ever seen. I love how he makes fun of the Sci-fi genre with movies like \\"Star Wars\\", \\"Alien\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Star Trek\\", and other sci-fi movies of the time. The film co-stars Dick Van Patten as King Roland, George Wyner as Colnel Sanders, Michael Winslow and the voice of Dom Deluise as Pizza The Hutt even with a cameo by John Hurt. It's a great 80's cult favorite that provides the best laughs of the decade thanks to the magic of Mel Brooks and is always pure comedy gold.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray offers the movie in beautiful high definition that it's not even funny even with quality sound that would make you go into luduicrous speed including a standard definition DVD of the movie. The extras including BD-exclusive which is \\"Watch the Movie in Luduicrous Speed\\", Trailers, Audio Commentaries, Film Flubs, Storyboard comparisons, interviews, Spaceballs: The Documentary, a memorial featurette on John Candy, behind-the-scenes footage and of course still galleries.
B00284BMBM|5.0|For Daughtry's second album the Band pulls out all of the stops. I was eagerly awaiting this cd when I heard them perform NO SURPRISE on LENO. It was awesome and almost acoustic. Now I have it cranked up in my bose headphone so i dont miss anything. Just flat out amazing.<br /><br />IDOL didnt know what they had when he came through. Now Daughtry competes with his big name established competition NICKELBACK, SEETHER, etc.<br /><br />If you thought the first album was good you will love the new cd. It doesn't disappoint.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Somewhere in New York City 1985 in an alternate dimension, President Nixon is still the president of the United States instead of Ronald Regan and superheroes have existed but have been outlawed since the late 70's. A former superhero and soldier named The Comedian (Jeffery Dean Morgan) was brutally murdered mysteriously for he worked for a superhero team called \\"Crime Busters\\" then later renamed \\"Watchmen\\" as his friends Roscache (Jackie Earl Haley) whom is a mysterious masked vigilantee, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a god-like Superman-esque blue skinned being with unique powers, sexy Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) and very smart and brilliant crimefighter NightOwl (Patrick Wilson) all join together to try to solve the mystery of the Comedian's death. They are even trying to find out who is behind a mysterious conspiracy that could lead to World War III before it's too late.<br /><br />Co-starring Matt Frewer, this brilliant adaptation of David Gibbon's and Alan Moore's classic graphic novel. After years of development hell through various studios, Warner Brothers wih DC films and Paramount have finally greenlighted the film thanks to the director Zack Snydner's successful \\"300\\" which in turn was based on a graphic novel. I'd say it was worth the effort Snyder has done to bring a classic masterpiece of comics to the big screen in a successful way in fact he's a fan of the graphic novel and used it as storyboards for the film. It's a complex mix of superhero film, fantasy, Sci-fi and film noir all combined as it's definitely a comic book movie not for kids due to some language, gory violence and sexuality  but more for adult audiences. Greg Cannom's make-up effects even for Nixon are quite convincing and has terrific acting with wonderous special effects and great action sequences. It's Zack Sydner's finest hour next to \\"300\\" for it's one of the best comic book movies in recent memory.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers a high theatrical quality experience that will sky-rocket your home system up into orbit and offers the movie in it's extended director's cut the way it was meant to be. Featurettes include BD-exclusive Maximum Experience which is a feature length live commentary by Zack Sydner including on how he took the graphic novel to the silver screen, featurettes, music video and 11 Watchmen Video Journels and BD-live exclusives.your home system up into orbit and offers the movie in it's extended director's cut the way it was meant to be.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I was never much of a Coldplay fan, as their songs always sounded sorta catchy and nice, but never anything that I would actually turn on myself and listen to.  However, I kept hearing how good \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" was, from friends, and even from people who also normally weren't wild about Coldplay, so I figured I should give it a shot, and I am glad I did.  It was the surprise of 2008.     Not trying to take anything away from the band, but the Brian Eno influence is all over this record, and I can't help but think that it wouldn't have been close to what it was without him.  I hope they use him on future records after the success they had with him on this one.  Not only are there catchy and memorable melodies all over the place, but there is a lot of unique instrumentation that you previously wouldn't have heard on a Coldplay record.  They definitely took their game to a whole new level on this record.  Every song is very good.      Overall, probably a 3 1/2-star effort, but I bumped it up to 4 when rating it here, simply for the surprise factor.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|I watched this movie with eager anticipation.  However, I was disappointed with the low light beginning scenes of the killing of a character.  This movie is not for the average family.  It is gross and depressing.  I filled this movie in the circular file at the end of my desk.  Do not waste money.  Movies like Iron Man are far better and have action, as well.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|I rented this DVD with anticipation of a blockbuster hit,instead I find that this film has too many long dialogs,not enough action,unnecessary sex scenes,a plot that make no damn sense what so ever! The only parts of the film that I enjoyed were the scene with the DR. MANHATTAN character,the film failed to impress me and entertain me!
B000SEJHRA|1.0|I was looking for a good laugh, and many reviews led me to believe that Sedaris would come through, but this book is a disaster. I got a minor chuckle at best, and a great put-me-to-sleep at worst. If you're hoping for humor, go elsewhere.
0066620996|1.0|The book has a poor record of identifying \\"great\\" companies. Among the 11 \\"great\\" companies in the book, two no longer exist: Circuit City (bankrupt and liquidated in 2009) and Gillette (swallowed by P&G in 2005, now defunct as a company). Another, Fannie Mae, doesn't deserve to exist, and books are being written on what a failure it was. Maybe P&G took over Gillette because Gillette was great, but the fact remains that Gillette is dead, and survival should be a quality of greatness.
B00012QM86|5.0|It's amazing a film on this subject of the brutality of the Nazi regime took this long to be showcased as an epic Hollywood movie.  Thankfully though it has been made before the last surviving victims/witnesses have gone on to the after life.  Just think how much more disturbingly graphic this film would be if it wasn't shot in black and white!  Irrespective of just how \\"accurate\\" the depiction of the true nature of Oskar Schindler is this historical film gives us an insight into just how evil racism is and how incredibly barbaric \\"people\\" can be to their fellow humans.  There are so many great and memorable scenes that I don't know where to start although the scene with the girl in red and the subsequent scene with her on the cart was extremely touching indeed.<br /><br />This is by far Spielberg's masterpiece and is certainly one of the best ever films.  This dvd version is also very well put together in a slim digipak with interviews and a documentary on the b-side in addition to the continuation of the main course from side a.  The picture quality is very, very good and so is the sound quality which I watched using the DTS channel.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of great historical epics and essential for any film buff's dvd library.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|For anyone to attempt to tackle World War II in its entirety seems foolish.  The sheer scope of the war seems like an insurmountable mountain.  I mean, how can any one organization document events from the Beer Hall Putsch to the Japanese surrender aboard the U.S.S Missouri?  It seems impossible to do with 100 DVDs.<br /><br />The World At War series does the impossible.  The amount of obscure footage in this series is worth the price of admission.  One vivid example -- there is footage of the Japanese and Russian battles in the Far East!  There is footage of the Japanese invasion of China.  Footage of German soldiers swimming in a river on the Eastern Front...during WINTER.  The siege of Leningrad?  Yep, footage from INSIDE the city during the siege.<br /><br />There is some amazing U-boat footage from the battles in the North Atlantic.  Watching merchant ships being torpedoed is quite awful.  Seeing the tight and confined spaces inside the U-boats made my skin crawl.<br /><br />In the Far East, there is footage of Japanese cities prior to the start of hostilities!  It is fascinating footage.  There is even a clip from inside a Japanese theater that shows some of a propaganda movie from the era.<br /><br />Sir Laurence Olivier's narration and timing is nothing short of brilliant.  He provides vivid descriptions and details when appropriate.  Sir Laurence also knows when to let the pictures speak for themselves.  As the cameras panned over the utterly destroyed Stalingrad, Sir Laurence lets the pictures speak volumes for the ruined city.<br /><br />A&E, despite their awful broadcast habits, managed to stay out of the way of this series.  No annoying on-screen distractions.  No popups.  Just straight footage and narration.<br /><br />I'm only about a third of the way through the series but am utterly addicted.<br /><br />As other reviewers note, this series was originally created in the mid-1970s.  Still, for any person interested in studying World War II, this series is a must-have.s is a must-have.
0684833395|5.0|The premise of \\"Catch 22\\" is about characters, particularly soldiers, getting stuck in situations where no matter their decision, they're screwed. Some reviewers have said that the point is made within the first 100 pages and so why another 400 pages. However, for me it didn't get old. Yossarian's zaniness and Heller's swift style make it like one punchline after the next, and who ever wants a funny book to end? Although there's strong socio-political undertones, one shouldn't read this book as anti-war, or expect any preachiness, because again, the hilarity sticks out first and foremost. Is it comparable with Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\"? Only insofar as it's a dark comedy about wartime, and both authors served in war (so they have credibility). Either way, Heller provides brilliant situational comedy.
015206396X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in quite awhile.  It isn't just to be read it is to be felt. I got my copy from the library, but I'm thinking I need my own copy of this phenomenal book.  This is a first novel, but I surely can't imagine that Kristen Cashore could do better on the next.  It doesn't seem possible.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I am personally a very huge fan of Harry Potter, infact, I am biggest Harry Potter fan! In each movie/book, J.K. Rowling always pleases me! I love ALL the Harry Potter books/movies, and I feel each one gets better and better and better, and I feel this is the best one yet! Full of action, adventure, loud, sweet, interesting stuff! It IS the best Harry Potter movie yet! I encourage EVERYONE to see it! Harry Potter is also for all ages....please do not pay ANY attention to the reviewers who say Harry Potter is not for kids - I feel J.K. Rowling made these books for everyone to enjoy! Harry Potter is a great series and I feel ALL ages should be able to enjoy it! Anyways, you should really see this movie! AWESOME!!!
B000NJVWUA|5.0|I originally got this album on cassette tape back in the 80's.  I have been slowly replacing all of my tapes with CD's, and only recently got to the Alan Parsons Project.    This is truly a great album, with great songs from The Project.  Favorite of mine is Pipeline.  A great driving song!    A welcomed addition to the CD Library!!!!
B00180R06I|5.0|A young man, fascinated by the occult, arrives at a small village where his dreams of the supernatural become a nightmare that threatens to destroy him.  Drawing upon the worldwide fascination with legends of vampires that existed even in the 1930s, Dreyer set out to make a popular film, and brought his unique sensibilities to bear on a melodramatic subject.  Completing his film in the wake of Murnau's [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Nosferatu]] and just before Tod Browning's much more straightforward [[ASIN:B0001CNRLG Dracula]], Dreyer produced images and effects that remain powerful and compelling today.  A reaper, crossing the river.  Shadows that dance.  The point of view from a coffin.  Dreyer manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of dread throughout, that nevertheless cannot mute the astonishment at the subtlety of his inventions.<br /><br />Criterion's release of Vampyr has everything you could want.  There is the German version of the film, with English subtitles, all meticulously restored and looking quite impressive.  Additionally, there is an English version of the film, for which the intertitles have all been redone digitally into English - though the dialogue is still in German with subtitles.  The commentary, by Tony Rayns, is quite useful - drawing special attention to the way that Dreyer constructs multiple and fragmented points of view in the film.  The second disc holds a very intriguing documentary on Dreyer, which complements the more personal documentary (\\"Carl Th. Dreyer - My Metier\\") included with the Dreyer [[ASIN:B00005M2C7 set]], and an informative video essay on the history and background of Dreyer's take on vampires.  Finally, the set includes the entire screenplay, written in a descriptive form that seems closer to a novel, with only the indented dialogue to remind that it served as a screenplay.  Highly recommended for vampire enthusiasts and lovers of inventive cinema.
B00127RAJY|5.0|i have to admit, i was a little bit sceptical about this workout at first. i mean, a 22 min workout? doesn't sound like any good, right? wrong!!!! this is an amazing, ass kicking workout, that leaves you with sweat pouring down your face, and a good satisfied feeling in your stomach. i bought this dvd because of the short workout time, i mean, i'm a busy person. i heard it was hard, but i knew that she had modified versions, and i would catch up with the harder ones. and, i was mostly right. things like the pushups, squat and press, and bicycle crunches were hard, but all totally worth it. today was my 7th day on the dvd, and i just moved on to the second level. i've already seen a difference, and i feel really good. the morning after my first time, my legs and butt where aching, so make sure you stretch and all that before. if your self-concious about your boobs jumping up and down, do it in an area where no one can see you, especially on the first level, as almost all cardio moves involve jumping. overall though, this dvd is an amazing workout, and totally worth the money, and hey, even if you don't like it, it's only like $[...]. she says in the beginning you need hand weights, but you can just use full water bottles if it's easier. i did for the first few days and then i went out and bought some 2 lb ones, b/c she doesn't specify what weight to use. the annoying bit is in the beginning, b/c u can't skip over half of the commercials. obviously this doesn't really matter, but just in case that bothers you. overall, great, great buy, totally worth it, but you have to keep pushing everyday, even if you don't feel up to it. it doesn't take long, and you will see results.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|I have always been a fan of a-ha's music. Even with the roughness of their middle albums, I was always struck by Morten's amazing voice. Beginning with Minor Earth, Major Sky, the band began making a comeback with stronger melodies and soaring instrumentation. FotM is their strongest effort in a while. I absolutely love the references back to Hunting High and Low, and I think the frosty synths work wonders against Morten's vocals. Most importantly, the tracks on this album are strong melodically. My favorite album of 2009 thus far.
B000053VAZ|5.0|I remember seeing this movie way back in the early 90's,   then I rediscovered it the other day at a freinds house on DVD   and fell in love with it all over again!  I don't think that I really appreciated all the nuances of Depp's   very ethereal and quicksilver performance back when I first saw it.   He studied silent film great Buster Keaton's classic physical comedy   routines to the letter for this role and it paid off!  This is a very cute, quirky and feel good story that will get   you wrapped up in it all over again if you're already familiar with it,   and will endear you to it if you've never seen it before!  ---A definite Johnny Depp collectible.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Film was viewed on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35K player. PQ 4/5 and AQ 5/5.<br /><br />This film is a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" type film. For me, as a huge movie enthusiast, it provided the kind of comic relief that pokes fun at hollywood, its \\"system\\", the politics and of course, its stereotypes. Robert Downey Jr and the rest of the cast do a fantastic job of creating characters that never take themselves too seriously, which provides the comic relief in the film. The acting and storyline is necessarily over the top, and all of the blatant, non-PC comments are welcomed given the context of the film. A certain mindset is required to enjoy this film, and while some may find it offense, there are many other films that are more offensive, and less funny than this one. The sound track of this film is fantastic and is worth a separate purchase if you like the style and many of the songs add to the film's desire to appear as though it's a real war film (which of course its not). These are some of the funniest performances we may ever see by this cast. So if if you can lend yourself to its type of humor, you will have a blast.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I would go as far as to call this a modern era classic film!  This story is an excellent one which Juliette Binoche carries off well...  a mysterious woman and her daughter wander the european countryside  and come upon a quaint little village. They decide to set up shop  there and much magic & chocolate treats ensue!   Even though Johnny Depp's character doesn't come in until halfway  through the movie, he just lights it up!  The combination of he and Binoche is one you can't tear yourself  away from until Depp leaves the screen!--That guy is pure magic!  This is a keeper for sure! (-:
B00260HH3K|4.0|Let me say this. Its a great family film, better than Transformers 2.  Its better than it has any right to be.  The series were fun for a while. But when you drag out one fight through more episodes than there are comeback fight scenes with Jean Claude Van Damme in his films,  c'mon people. This is better.  The caroon had some good stuff but if anyone thought itwasgreat you need your head examined. The movie could have added more touches from the cartoon but overall its pretty enjoyable.Knuff said!

0060765380|4.0|This is the 2nd book I have read by James Rollins and I will definately be coming back for more.  Rollins combines history, science, politics, and a bit of religion to create a terrific action story that keeps you turning pages to find out what will happen next.  The characters are well defined and likeable; each is distinct with strengths and weaknesses.  The premise of the story was intriguing and I thoroughly enjoyed the two layers working to \\"solve\\" the problem - one branch investigated the scientific causes and impacts of the disease, the other followed the history of Marco Polo to also look for causes and cures to the disease.  I enjoyed all of the factual information woven throughout the story - information about animals, biology, geography, archaeology, and history to name a few.  The descriptions of DNA was a bit tedious at times so I tended to skim over some of those descriptions.  The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that the end seemed to have a bit of a supernatural feel to it that I did not enjoy. Overall, this was a wonderful action story!
B00005QGAV|4.0|1991's Dangerous includes many of Michael Jackson's under appreciated masterpieces. \\"Black or White\\" was a ubiquitous smash and certainly one of his greatest pop hits, but many other forgotten singles and album tracks rank right beside it. \\"Remember the Time\\" sounds like an updated \\"Rock with You\\" and, as such, is one of his greatest R&B efforts. The surprising \\"In the Closet,\\" one of the most sensuous recordings of his career, features an addictive arrangement of tough, rhythmic verses and melodic choruses. One of Jackson's trademarks is the inclusion of a rock track on each album. \\"Give into Me,\\" with its incredible electric guitar solo from Slash, is one of his best. \\"Will You Be There\\" is a powerful anthem that captures Michael at both his most vulnerable and his most triumphant. Though it includes a handful of less memorable tracks, Dangerous features many career highlights, ensuring its position as a classic album. 4 Stars.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Sequels and trilogies can be a minefield.  Some franchises can maintain or build momentum with a strong sophomore effort, but few can carry that a step further.  All too often, the third flick simply can't carry the weight of the first two and collapses under the weight of expectations.  The Bourne Ultimatum is the third flick in the Jason Bourne series starring Matt Damon as the amnesia-prone CIA killing machine.  And unlike so many others, Ultimatum is a third effort that continues the tense, edge-of-your-seat, action-packed prescedent created by the first two movies.    Ultimatum picks the story up right where Supremacy left off.  I won't delve into the plot as not to spoil anything, but this movie delivers it all - a rare feat for a third chapter in a franchise.  Chalk full of action - the chase scenes - both on-foot and in vehicles - are intense.  The fight scenes are frentic.  And the locations are exotic and beautiful.    If you enjoyed Identity and Supremacy, you certainly won't be disappointed by Ultimatum.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Although it bends the rules, including several tracks that never topped the Billboard Charts, Michael Jackson's Number Ones is an excellent career overview, featuring most of his hits, from 1979's \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" to 2001's \\"You Rock My World.\\" The previously released tracks speak for themselves, though too many singles from Bad are included (5 of the 6 were, in fact, number ones). A more well-balanced collection with greater emphasis on Off the Wall, Thriller, and even Dangerous would be preferable. \\"One More Chance\\" is a so-so ballad, while a live version of \\"Ben\\" is a nice, surprising inclusion. Overall, Number Ones has everything most casual fans will want. 4 Stars.
0446581348|5.0|The subtitle of BOBBI BROWN MAKEUP MANUAL indicates it is for the beginner to pro and I'm in the beginner category. All I'm interested in is doing my own makeup well. As a user of Bobbi Brown makeup for over ten years, I wanted to read this book to see what I could improve as formerly I was just applying the makeup as instructed by the BB counter saleswoman instructed me. I didn't know why I was doing what I was doing until I read this book.<br /><br />The bulk of the book (the first 138 pages) is designed to be used by both individual women for their own makeup and can also be used by professionals. After giving some brief opinions and recommendations on which products or product types to use on various skin types or for different purposes (such as when to use cr&egrave;me blush versus powder blush for example), clear directions for applying the makeup properly are given in brief text along with full step by step directions. Important to note is that all skin colors and different ethnicities are included. Special techniques for Asians are given such as handling eye makeup. I was happily surprised to see special advice given for women with freckles, the advice is to not cover them up completely but to use special makeup effects that allow them to show through. Also covered is how to handle makeup with skin conditions such as rosacea and others.<br /><br />A section at the beginning gives information about brush selection, the importance of proper brush maintenance, and the reasons to use high quality brushes. Advice on compiling makeup kits is included, specifically, what items to buy and how to organize them for different purposes (travel, everyday use, and so forth).<br /><br />I was impressed also with the section about eyebrows and eyelashes. Included is information about the benefits of and best ways to shape the eyebrows and when eyebrow makeup should be used. Directions for penciling in eyebrows for women with sparse eyebrows or who are currently undergoing chemotherapy is useful too. The proper way to apply mascara, how to use an eyelash curler and even how to apply false eyelashes correctly is included.<br /><br />What struck me the most about this book is that it gives just enough information to be thorough but not too much so as to bog down or intimidate the reader. The photographed stepped out directions are done well. It is easy to find the makeup technique or effect you want to achieve to use the book's directions when needed. When to use various effects is explained, such as daytime makeup and then touching it up for evening. Makeup for weddings and other formal events is also covered.<br /><br />The last 80 pages are dedicated to professional makeup artists or those striving to become professional makeup artists. Those pages cover a range of topics from special makeup procedures to use on models in dramatic photo shoots to job basics such as career options, marketing oneself and booking work.<br /><br />A short resources section is included at the end.<br /><br />I read the book cover to cover and learned some things about makeup and makeup application that I never knew. I finally know how to pick the right shade of lipstick and foundation, and how to bring up the various levels of makeup for a more dramatic effect if desired. Now I will use the book as a reference guide for applying makeup. The book can easily be referenced for step by step directions.<br /><br />Again from the perspective of an amateur, I loved this book. It breaks down a lot of information into easy to understand manner. I like the makeup style used by Bobbi Brown, of how natural her everyday makeup look is and the fact that Brown seeks to enhance a woman's unique features rather than putting the makeup first and the women second. Unlike other makeup companies, Brown does not just churn out trendy colors each season and expect women to buy and use them as they are `in style' at the moment. Brown wants women to look their best, to look natural but an \\"enhanced\\" natural. Brown's makeup recommendations for evening and special occasions is elegant and beautiful, the makeup is not overpowering.ing and special occasions is elegant and beautiful, the makeup is not overpowering.
1594488916|5.0|This is a fascinating study of rare book theft from ancient times to the present, by a writer whose work has appeared in The New Yorker and other notable publications. It also is a grand detective mystery. Author Bartlett, cocerned how a rare book without traceable provenance has come into her possession, sets about to return it the the library she fears it may have been stolen from. Along the way, she comes up with a fascinating cast of charcaters; Ken Sanders, a rare book dealer who for many a year served as \\"security chair\\" for the primary rare book dealers association and is the detective hero of the book; and his personal nemesis, John Gilkey, an out-of-control OCD book thief who keeps Sanders and Bartlett on the run during many, often successful attempts to put Gilkey behind bars. We are introduced to the history of books and the reasons for their rarity; the frauds and forgeries, the \\"bibliomania\\" first described in Gustav Flaubert's first story; the love and feel of old books, Bartlett's conviction that E-books will not replace them all, and her careful distancing of herself lest she not become too involved or criminally culpable in this grand detective story, the true hero of which is Ken Sanders. If you've ever opened up a book printed 100 years before Gutenberg, and felt it's cotton-rag pages and smelled the perfume of seven centuries wafting through its pages, or maybe just have a first edition of Joseph Heller, Steinbeck, or Kerouac, don't miss this book. It made me shed a tear for all the valuable books I have given away in the course of my life, but made me realize that books, unlike diamonds, are not forever. Some of it was eerily reminisecent of Johnny Depp's character in the film \\"The Ninth Gate\\" (Depp is a real-life book collector too). One thing that becomes apparent in the course of this book is that all collections are not static and are destined for the ages. Very highly recommended.
B00005LC1H|5.0|What a feast for all admirers of good comedy, English humor, British sitcoms, and John Cleese. God bless him and his wife at the time and collaborator Connie Booth for brilliant flawless writing of twelve (sadly, only twelve) 30 minutes episodes and to all cast for starring in the series that went on to become the top on the list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programs drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000. Having watched all twelve episodes during last weekend, I see very clearly where my favorite comedy of all times, A Fish Called Wanda swam from. Some episodes of Fawlty Towers are simply perfect or very close to being perfect. All twelve are always funny, crazy, hilarious and never ever for a second are boring or outdated despite been made over 30 years ago. Cleese is fabulous participating in almost every scene of the show and playing rude, cheap, obnoxious, and incompetent owner of the Seaside hotel in \\"English Riviera\\" which he manages along with domineering, and much more confident wife Sybil (Prunella Scales). With all these characteristics, Cleese manages to make Basil Fawlty somehow sympathetic in this never ending escalation of comical frustration. The point is - the show is absolutely hilarious without ever stooping to vulgarity or stupidity. It is a highest class entertainment and I am happy that I finally was able to enjoy all 12 episodes. The show was transferred beautifully to 3 DVD Set which IMO is one of the best sets I've had pleasure to experience. Each of three DVDs comes with the nice bonus features that include among many three parts interview with John Cleese who tells in great details about the origins of the show, its production, and how much fun it was for everyone involved. Cleese recalls visiting a hotel similar to Fawlty Towers during the filming of Monty Python  series.  The hotel manager whom Cleese describes as \\"He was so rude, he was wonderful\\" had become an inspiration for Basil Fawlty. The interview with Prunella Scales and Andrew Sacks who was as hilarious as Cleese playing Spanish waiter/porter Manuel (\\"You'll have to forgive him. He is from Barcelona\\") with very limited command in English also add to the great feast that Fawlty Towers has been since its original showing in the 70s. The best episode, IMO is Communication Problems which is absolute perfection. It introduces us to the \\"guest from hell\\" in the body of Mrs. Richards, a very demanding lady with the hearing problems and the hearing aid that she would use quite selectively. Along with this guest, Basil Fawlty has to deal with the old passion for horses betting, the avenue of pleasure that is completely closed by his bossy wife Sybil. The result is the funniest and best acting episode of all - thanks to the regular players and late Joan Sanderson who almost stole the show as Mrs. Richards. The single most hilarious scene in all episodes definitely is the one in the episode \\"Germans\\" and it has to do with a talking moose head. I've returned to it several times while watching the episode and the scene always brought the tears from laughing too hard. To make the long story short - watch Fawlty Towers. It's got the top position on the list of 100 Best British TV programs for very good reasons and totally deserves it. It is one of the best and funniest sitcoms ever in the TV history.Scales and Andrew Sacks who was as hilarious as Cleese playing Spanish waiter/porter Manuel (\\"You'll have to forgive him.

B00288KNL8|2.0|In the book, Coraline is somewhat of an abandoned child- she's been moved away from her friends, and her parents are too busy to take care of her properly. Other than the cat, she really has no friends, and this doesn't really change throughout the story. It's a central element in the novel. So how do we handle this in Hollywood? We add an extraneous male character as a kind of \\"friend\\" for Coraline. This male character (Wybee short for \\"Whyborn?\\" which they got that right, as he has absolutely no purpose in the story) shows up at the beginning of the film, intermittently in the \\"other\\" world with button eyes, and finally swoops down on his RV just in time to save Coraline at the very end. In the book Coraline figures out how to wrap things up on her own.  Maybe this ending wasn't dramatic enough for the movies, but it was a hell of a lot more satisfying. So add sexist to pointless. We couldn't have a smart capable heroine solve her problems without male help, now could we?    The movie has a lot of good effects and spooky atmospherics which is why I gave it 2 stars, but the pointless vandalism committed on the book and the implications of those changes ruined the experience for me. Read the book...
B00000DWG6|5.0|I bought this as vinyl when it first came out, before I had really heard much about The Who.  I hadn't heard \\"Tommy\\" and was only familiar with the \\"Magic Bus\\" and \\"Happy Jack\\" singles.  I was not very impressed with those, but took a chance on the album.    \\"Young Man Blues\\" exploded out of the speakers, with a whirlwind of drums and cymbals careening about the intro.  And, the song finally takes off with all three instrumenatlists going great guns....    Listening to it today on a CD it is easier to hear everything.  And what jumps out at me is not Daltry's voice (which is great), or Townshend's guitar (which is great), but John Entwhistle's bass thundering along with Keith Moon's drumming.  ANYone that can glean the rhythm section from the vocal and lead guitar should buy this record to hear two masters at work.    The Ox plays fat, thundering runs up and down the neck, effortlessly, and you sit and marvel...he gets the perfect bass line, and he gets it right EVERY time.  Listen to his bludgeon on YMB as Townshend soloes.  Amazing! Thing about The OX, there are a lot of Bass players that can play fast.  But, as fast and plump as Entwhistle plays, he is always playing \\"the bass\\".  He never forgets that, never sounds like a lead guitar player going at it with 4 strings.      But, here we go now!  Anyone that argues about who is the best Rock drummer...listen to how Moonie propels that song along....rolls with one hand while the cymbals are beaten into submission with the other.  Listen to a couple of his runs on \\"Happy Jack\\"....they are the fastest I have ever heard.  Flamboyant?  Sure.  Powerful?  You have no idea.  Fast?  Holy crap, the fastest I have ever heard, and that is no kidding.  The man was a dynamo, and sure he played 'lead drums', but he also made the band GO!  People go gaga over John Paul Jones' drumming on \\"Rock and Roll\\", and it is superb.  But, folks, you get that same attack on EVERY song with The Who. And, as much as we all love Bonzo, Moonie was faster.  Sadly, both of these superb musicians have passed on.  And, as much of a tribute to Moon as anything else, listening to the Band with a different drummer is....well.  The Band didn't go like it used to.      OK.  Besides all that, this is a perfect example of a Band at the top of their powers blazing away.  They do some GREAT covers, like \\"YMB\\" and \\"Shaking All Over\\", and blister their own songs like \\"Substitute\\" and \\"Happy Jack\\".    If you like Hard Rock, and a great, great rhythm section to rival \\"Cream\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin\\", topped of by a power chording assault backing a roughed voiced vocalist, playing up tempo songs as loud as you can stand it, recorded live, this little set is at the top of the paramid.  A true classic in every sense of the word, it is a moment when it all came together.  Great players, doing great songs at their peak, in a great venue.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's third book is a curious mixture of interesting ideas and sound mechanics blended with a handful of well written but somewhat redundant essays about culture and turning failure into success.  The combination and arrangement of the two sections (Part 1: Opportunity and Part 2: Legacy) almost feel as if this was intended to be two separate books that became fused into one, or perhaps one book that ran short on ideas and got stretched into something a bit longer than it needed to be in order to match its predecessors.  In any case, Gladwell's ability to write continues to distinguish itself as it aptly carries this book from beginning to end quickly and thoroughly in an efficient manner that, even despite times towards the book's last third where substance and continuity become scarce, will still manage to leave the reader feeling more like they have just enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's latest book and less like they have just sat through an uninspired management seminar.  Ultimately, despite moments of disappointment, the book never ceases to be enjoyable and offers plenty of topics worth pondering.<br /><br />The book starts off as well as a book can and is somewhat reminiscent of Gladwell's first and best effort \\"The Tipping Point\\" with one single idea that is explained and then demonstrated in a multitude of examples, which are for the most part quite good and make for a strong beginning with good continuity.  The principle idea that gets discussed is the aspect of timing on those that we frequently deem as great - the Outliers.  The initial example is an effective attention getter - a comparison of professional hockey players and their relative age when they started playing organized hockey before the age of 10.  Regardless of anything else the book may or may not achieve, the point made here is a good one; the comparative difference in development between six years and one day and six years and 11 months is significant.  Group a bunch of kids together based on their current age digit and overwhelmingly the ones closest to the next birthday will significantly outperform the ones who just celebrated their last birthday.  This idea is expanded directly from athletics to academics.  The remainder of Part One looks at numerous cases where the importance of timing has played a significant part in choosing the \\"outlier\\" - The class of the PC revolution and their birthdates, a successful and powerful law firm that specializes in corporate takeovers driven by a senior partner who graduated from a less than prestigious law school, and an interesting study of potential geniuses and the correlation between their success and their birthday's proximity to 1911.<br /><br />As interesting as Part One is, it does not take long to realize that this is a book about one of the oldest arguments in existence--nature verses nurture.  Gladwell does a good job of making some useful observations, but like every other attempt to tackle this subject, one never gets too far away from one side, before the other side comes roaring back.  On one hand, Gladwell's observations are good ones.  But ultimately, they are merely examples of particular instances where timing was a key factor.  They do not rule out the existence of true outliers.  The chapter on the 10,000 hour rule is well worth the read, and again it makes a good point - those who are able to have the opportunity to work at something for 10,000 hours will become highly proficient at it. It says nothing of those who \\"achieve greatness\\" at something in far less time.  For example, two of Gladwell's arguments include Bill Gates and The Beatles, both tremendously influential in their respective fields and to the world at large.  Yes, Bill Gates programmed for many hours and no doubt he was proficient at it (as his work with Paul Allen in writing BASIC suggests), but a large part of his success was based on his purchasing the operating system QDOS and renaming/repackaging it as DOS and selling it to IBM.  And Yes, The Beatles were one of the greatest bands in Pop/Rock music history, perhaps the greatest. But their greatness was much more a function of their song-writing and less about their technical musicianship.  This is not to say that Bill Gates is/was a bad programmer or that The Beatles were bad musicians. Merely that using them to argue in favor of the 10,000 rule builds an incomplete case that does not drive the point as far as it could and leaves important questions unanswered.  How many programmers are better than Gates (Steve Jobs?) and how many reach that level of proficiency in 10,000 hours and how many reach is in less?  How many musicians achieve technical musicianship in 10,000 hours or less?  The fact that some people just seem to have a \\"knack\\" for something does not get discussed.<br /><br />Part Two is where some issues develop.  Whereas Part One contains points on which one may agree or disagree, the chapters are coherent, consistent and develop nicely around the central theme of timing and its influence on selection.  Anyone can follow the common thread that runs through them with ease.  And they all relate, in some fashion, to the book's main idea.  Part Two however consists of four separate accounts of culture and its influence on people's approach to understanding that which confronts them. Yes, all four share the common theme of culture an its influence, and yes all four are well written, but as a set they don't hold together nearly as well Part One, and they don't really have anything to do with the book's man theme of Outliers - they just tell the story of culture and its influence on people 4 times.  Most notable is the chapter on the abysmal safety record of the Korean airlines during the 1980's and 1990's, which is in fact the longest chapter in the book at 46 pages.  It has some good things to say, and in typical Gadwell fashion, tells a good story.  But after a long buildup and analysis the reader is left with the fact that changes were made and cultural differences were overcome and people over 50 learned new things and the unsuccessful was turned into the successful. Not that positive change is a bad thing (it certainly is not a bad thing), but even with Gladwell at his best, it's difficult for something like this to avoid sounding generic, empty, and out of place in a book of this nature.<br /><br />Still, even in its moments of disappointment, the book never fails to be readable and never departs from its relative fast pace.  And again, even when the chapters aren't all that well connected they manage to include interesting points of reference, such as the reference to David Hackett Fischer's book Albion's Seed and the chapter on the Asian rice patties comparison of the Asian and Western methods of counting.  Books of this nature are at their best when they connect to other interesting topics, and regardless of its problems, this book does that relatively well.  Even the a fore mention disappointing and lengthy chapter on the Korean Air problems contains a classic example of Gladwell's concise observatory wit - \\"Who we are cannot be separated from where we're from - and when we ignore that fact, planes crash.\\"<br /><br />It may seem odd to describe a book as an enjoyable disappointment, but in this instance it fits rather well.  Mechanically is rates an easy 5, but the nature of the ending feels more like a 3.  From someone partial to Gladwell's books, this one has earned some generosity and nets a 4 (a 4- if such a rating were allowed.)  Fans of Gladwell should enjoy this book as should fans of other non-fiction/hack-social science/hack-psychology/hack-economics and commentary. Enjoy -- and from time-to-time be patient.BM.

0132350882|5.0|This book definitely changed my outlook on writing code. It does an excellent job at explaining and clearly demonstrating the importance of clean code - separation of abstraction levels, recognition and removal of common smells and constant reevaluation and improvement of system in question.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|$7 and 107 minutes of my life I will never get back.  OUCH!  It's titled \\"Origins\\" but it still leaves a number of those questions unanswered.  This one was just phoned in for the paycheck.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|I do not know if Clint is saying adieu in this movie or not.  I would tend to think that he is because most of his acting in it consists of trademark scowls, \\"make my day\\" confrontations and other stock Eastwood mannerisms. It some ways it is a parody of all his previous flicks. If Clint was to say \\"good bye\\" this movie does for him what the Shootist did for John Wayne.<br /><br />The general features of the movie overlap the Shootist in several particulars:  both involve a crusty old guy with a violent past, both center on the relationship that develops between that guy and a young man whom he effectively teaches to be a man, both have the main character ill with a terminal disease (apparently in this movie) and both move toward the inevitable show down which the main character knows he will not survive.  This movie has a lot more street language.<br /><br />Now, what I really like about this movie is its intentional, in your face celebration of masculine, pre-Political Correctness, pre-sensitivity, pre- just about everything else, grittiness.  Eastwood is making a statement here about what we lost when modern sensibilities have reduced male role models for young men to the artificial \\"either-or\\" of wimpish angst ridden pretty boys or mean, crotch-gripping gangstas.  There used to be more of a continuum in male-ness and Eastwood reminds us of an era when \\"being a man\\" had certain cultural connotations.  A man helps a little old lady when she spills her groceries getting them out of the car.  It also, as well, meantsnarling at a punk as you pushed a 357 magnum into his face in the act of rescuing a young woman that was otherwise an object of bigoted contempt.<br /><br />So, compared to \\"The Shootist\\" this movie comes in a distant second but not without its own merit and value.  It's well worth watching even if some of the scenes are a bit forced (the Barbershop scene with the kid especially).
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is a masterful writer. He has the enviable talent of turning the most mundane occurrences into engaging and often hilarious anecdotes. I am envious of how far and how well he has traveled. While I may not always agree with his opinions, they are just that, opinions. What I really enjoy is how he shares them. In this book he covers an amazing array of countries and cultures. His insights aren't always spot on, but the are almost always amusing. I think his writing was a bit more crass and vulgar than in some of his other books, but it didn't detract much from my enjoyment of this book.
0380715430|2.0|I'm a fan of Bill Bryson.  \\"Walk in the Woods\\" and \\"The History Of Almost Everything\\" are 2 books I  recommend to friends and family.      I'm facintated by the subject of languages and how they develop and evolve. Some chapters were very interesting, others became bogged down in too many linguistic technicalities for me and I resorted to skimming or even skipping to get through them.  Others with more knowlege than I,  have commented on the errors and misstatements by the author.  After reading those reviews,  I'm sorry  I spent  time  trying to absorb  many of his explanations, observations and factoids.  There may be other books, with equal credibility but more readability on the subject.
B0013D4J5K|5.0|I have been a MJ fan since I was a kid, I'm now in my early thirties so that speaks volumes I remember staying up to see the Thriller all night and when he got in the Pepsi accident I cried myself to sleep and never drank a pepsi in my life lol!!! anyway I say all of that to comeback to the original topic OFF THE WALL I discovered this wonderful album in my case cassette tape  when I was in the 4th grade we had something called mini-society and everyone brought things to sell so I purchased the tape  because it said Michael Jackson, and I remember being mesmerized by the sound I heard come out of my Sony walkman. the only thing I knew Michael for at that point was The E.T. Storybook , Thriller and We are the World. It was just a beautiful discovery and an introduction to my appreciation for Jazz. I cried like a baby the first time I heard She's out of my life. as the years passed by I replaced that old tape for the CD several times because It stays in heavy rotation.. every song is magical and dare I say a better concept album than Thriller. I love it!!!!!!!!!! I love everything he did!!!
B0000029LG|5.0|Well, Disc 1 is a no brainer. 5 stars of course. However, I would have prefered the inclusion of Will You Be There and Dirty Dinana over Heal the World and I Just Can't Stop Loving You. But oh well. Now, on to disc 2.    Scream- This is the duet with his sister Janet, mostly popular for it's expensive (indulgent) music video. On first listen, the song comes off as cluttered and noisy, and doesn't seem all that catchy, compared to his earlier work. But upon multiple listens, it really grew on me. I really love the chant \\"stop pressuring me,\\" it's very telling. I've never really considered Janet much of a singer, but she manages to keep up with him here. 9/10    They Don't Care About Us- The most anthemic song he's ever recorded. Worldwide, this is one of his biggest hits. However, the US radio ignored it because of it's so-called \\"conbtroversial\\" lyrics. He's basically lashing out at his detractors, saying they'll never get him. Nowadays, it's a bit difficult to listen to after his passing, because well, they got him, didn't they? Either way, it's production is very simple but effective, reduced to a drumming clap rhythm, and his singing is more like hissing- very crass. Great, angry anthem from Mike. 10/10    Stranger in Moscow- A very personal track from him. It's lyrics are very thought provoking, and quite depressing. He basically talks about how, despite the adoration and fame, he's very lonely. This is another difficult one for me, especially after his death. But despite it's great lyrics, I just can't get into the tune. It's a bit of a bore, to be honest. 6/10    This Time Around- And yet another angry song from Mike! Are we seeing a pattern here? This is a very hip-hop track for him, basically saying that he's not taking any s**t from anybody this time, and it even has a nice little rap verse from the late Notorious BIG. It really works, and it's quite catchy, but not really single material. 7/10    Earth song- One word- EPIC. I'm aware of the critics who have written it off as preachy and indulgent, but that is so off base! This is his best work, as far as composition goes. I may also say this is one of his best vocal performances- he's literally *screaming* at us at the end. I guess this could be considered another angry song, but I would say it's more about scolding us (himself iuncluded) for how we've treated the earth. Easily the best song on the album. 10/10    D.S.- Boy is he angry on this! But he's also clearly hurt, and that upsets me. Upon first listen, a part of me felt that it was slightly... immature and inappropriate to put this on his album. But you know what? Michael is an artist, and his music is his love. If he was angry at someone, he had every right to write about it, and put it out there for his fans to listen to. It makes me feel closer to him, because I feel that he is sharing something very up close and personal, and I applaud any artist that is willing to do something like that. 9/10    Money- Well, this one is more snarky than angry, so it's a bit of a relief. Basically, this one is directed at... everybody? Seems like everyone around him was just after his money! I'm not too fond of the spoken word / rap thing he's doing, but I do think the lyrics are very well written, and the chorus is nice and catchy. Overall, it's pleasant, but not much of a standout. 7/10    Come Together- One of my favorite Beatles songs. You know, with Paul and John, I've always felt that they were great songwriters, but I wasn't too big of a fan of their voices or arrangements. I tend to prefer covers of their songs over the originals.  Mike's voice brings the extra punch to this song that I've always felt it needed. What can I say? Great cover of a great song. 10/10    You Are Not Alone- One of my favorite Michael songs ever. Yes, it is somewhat generic, especially considering it's an R. Kelly song. But I just love the message, and I love the tender way Michael sings it. It's something that I'm sure many Michael fanswould've loved to sing to him, and it's very hard for me, personally to listen to because of how it relates to Michael's life. Just a great ballad. 10/10    Childhood- Most people don't seem to care for it, and I can see why. But while the melody isn't much of a grabber, it's very pleasant to listen to. it seems quite old fashioned with the orchestra and bells and all, but I think that adds to it. It's another emotional one for me again, because it makes me think of my own childhood, and Michael's, and it's just an overall nostalgic feeling. Overall, enjoyable ballad. 8/10    Tabloid Junkie- This one's for da haters... uh, the ones who *listen* to the haters! It's actually a bit hard to understand what he's saying in the verses, because he's apparently so angry he's been reduced to hissing through his teeth! Thankfully, the rest of it is very clear and easy to understand. \\"Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on a TV screen don't make it factual.\\" Well, that sums it up, doesn't it? 9/10    2 Bad- This is a hidden gem of his! It actually sounds like something off \\"Bad,\\" but more... harsh? It's very catchy, chanty, great to dance to... just classic Michael! It's actually the only *classic* Michael track on the album. Listening to it makes me wanna get up and bust out my best Michael Jacksion moves! Yes, it's angry- but it manages to be very bouncy and boppy, and Shak's verse really adds some playfulness to it. 10/10    History- The title track- another EPIC one from Mike. The verses are like all angry and harsh, and make you want to shout, but then the chorus makes you want to stop and wave your hands along. Very choppy, but it really works. I love how they incorporated the historicalevents and such- and then the chorus comes in at the end- the whole thing should be an overworked mess, but it works perfectly. Excellent. 10/10    Little Susie- A very *artistic* track. I love the beginning with the chorus and the little girl. It's a perfect piece of music. That is, until Michael's voice comes in. I think it's a great composition, and he tries hard, but it's not really suited for his style. He sounds like he's trying to sound like Mary Poppins or something. Great music, but points off for the vocals. 7/10    Smile- Michael's favorute song. \\"Smile if your heart is breaking.\\" It's very autobiographical, isn't it? I honestly never cared too much for the song. But he sings it with so much tenderness and passion, it's quite heartbreaking. He kind of sounds like he's off in his own world on this song- espeically with the giggling and whistling. It's another... difficult one. 7/10      Overall, I will make the bold statement that this is his best album. Not his most enjoyable, not his catchiest, and certainly not his most fun album. But this is Michael, bared for us all to hear. This album tells me more about him than all his other albums combined. This album tells me more than all the experts and \\"close friends\\" I've seen all over TV. This is the one album where I feel like there's no front. There's actually, for the first time, no song that directly adresses a lover. I think that fact is very telling. Michael's life was difficult, so therefore, the album is difficult as well. This is not one for people who want to enjoy some good old fashioned Michael Jackson music. This is one for his fans. I think I finally understand, Michael. Rest in peace, luv.
0545123267|5.0|Forget the full moon and silver bullets. Maggie Stiefvater's werewolves are different from any you've seen before. After being bitten, a werewolf changes erratically for a while, then settles into a seasonal cycle. Cold weather brings on a change to wolf form; warm weather returns the werewolf to human form. However, this cycle doesn't last forever. As the years pass, it takes more and more heat to trigger the change back to human, until one year the werewolf remains a wolf for life.    Our heroine, Grace, was attacked by wolves as a child. Just before she was about to become lunch, one of the wolves intervened and saved her. Ever since, Grace has watched for \\"her\\" wolf in the woods each winter. And every summer, a golden-eyed boy named Sam watches Grace from afar, too shy to approach her. Then, when one of Grace's high school classmates is killed in another wolf attack, several of the local men take it upon themselves to rid the town of the beasts. This time it's Grace who helps Sam. Finally, the two have the chance to get to know one another. Their budding relationship is marred by one tragic truth: This is almost certainly Sam's last year as a human.    Like Deirdre, the heroine of [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]], Grace is more \\"real\\" and well-rounded than many of the girls who populate YA paranormal romance. She's neither too perfect nor too wild, and she doesn't become subservient once her love interest appears on the scene. She's just an ordinary girl, compassionate and resourceful and caught in an unimaginable situation. The relationship between Grace and Sam is also refreshingly \\"real.\\" They don't just fall in love because of the weird metaphysics that surround them. They bond over music and poetry and cooking and B-grade horror movies. The reader is left with the impression that, if only the looming metaphysical tragedy could be averted, they'd have a happy future together.    Which, of course, makes the inexorable approach of winter incredibly poignant. I couldn't put _Shiver_ down, wondering how Grace and Sam's story would end, and Stiefvater kept me hanging till the very last page.    _Shiver_ is written in vivid prose that engages all of the senses. Maggie Stiefvater does a great job of evoking the sight of a single spot of red against a sea of white, the sound of canine nails scratching at the deck outside Grace's house, and the smell of paper and ink in a bookstore on a warm summer day, making Shiver a fully immersive experience. I nearly forgot it was July here as I read; I could hear the winter winds howling.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I have never run in my life, but I just finished Born to Run and I am truly inspired. This book is such a page turner I could not put it down. After finishing the last page, I was so taken with the whole story that I ran to my laptop to google it. I have taken the Copper Canyon train and was familiar with the Tarahumara Indians, but I was so surprised to find the gringo characters are real live people with youtube videos of them at ultra races (which I had never heard of before)!  I am 55 years old, but I think I can do it too!  I am going to go outside and start running right now.
B001GCUER0|5.0|*Spoilers ahead!*<br /><br />Having just finished watching my boxed set, I would like to add my opinion to those who have already boldly stated theirs.<br /><br />Compulsively watchable in Season One, \\"Mad Men\\" in Season II is even more so, for it is here that we explore the relationships between the characters in depth, and watch as the plot lines set forth become more involved and fascinating.  I felt that Season II was the season of Betty Draper, although we also saw Peter Campbell's relationships both weaken and explode, Peggy grow into a more confident part of the team, and Joan Holloway give away her smoldering sexuality to a man who looks like the perfect match but who has sexual hangups that are hard to watch.<br /><br />As played by the stunning January Jones, Betty in Season One seemed like a beautiful ice maiden, always perfect down to her manicured nails, never out of control, able to withstand her suspicions of Don's infidelity without cracking her veneer.  In Season II all comes unravelled, and it is mesmerizing to watch as Betty's fragile hold on normalcy comes unglued.  I found myself cheering her on as she finally took hold of her life and wrested from it the shreds of her dignity.  I'm still not sure I like her, but I started to respect her.<br /><br />Don, as always mysterious, inscrutable, and morally bankrupt, undergoes a sea change as well.  Jon Hamm owns this part just as Michael C. Hall owns the part of \\"Dexter\\".  I watched enthralled as he went from a defensive, combative, egocentrically ambitious man to one floundering for the meaning of his life.  Without giving too much away, I can say that this was handled well by the writers, as they had to work within a time frame and could not accomplish everything by use of flashback without dragging Season II out too long.  What makes Don Draper a fascinating character is the way, just when he seems like the coldest cad imaginable, he then becomes a loving father or a caring mentor.  The writing in this series is truly fine.<br /><br />All of the supporting characters are excellent and have an essential part to play, as it should be with a series of this caliber.  John Slattery is always a favorite, so quick-witted and shamelessly lecherous, and the frat boy club of Ken Cosgrove, etc. are always fun and interesting to watch.<br /><br />History itself is a star of the show, as we watch the sixties simmer and explode, much as Betty Draper herself.  To those of us who lived through those years, the backdrop is every bit as interesting as the characters themselves.  One can't help but mourn what has befallen regular programming on television, when you see what can be produced by people who really care.All of the supporting characters are excellent and have an essential part to play, as it should be with a series of this caliber.

0394800184|1.0|If you are looking for a story to explain the mother-child bond and you live in an artificial society where all parents look like their children, then, perhaps this book is for you.  However, if you are an adoptive parent, a step-parent, a foster-parent, or just a mom whose child doesn't mirror you, don't even bother with this book.  I won't read it to my students (I am an elementary school teacher) or to my own children--who, incidentally, don't look like me.  The book reinforces the notion that in order for a child and his mother to have a bond, they must look alike.  Maybe I'm being a little overly sensitive or PC, but I simply loathe this book, which isn't even well written on top of everything else there is to dislike about it.  If you're looking for a moving story, that truly shows what it's really like to be a mom, regardless of who you are or what you look like, A Mother For Choco by Keiko Kasza is a far superior choice.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I loved the extended movie but the sound is good, the dialogue is very low. The video quality looks \\"dirty\\" in some places, specially when looking the background, similar to Dark Knight.    About the extras, well not so much of it. The only worthy thing all the extended minutes. If you want all whistle and stuffs in one place and can wait for the ultimate edition coming on december, it will come with Tales of The Black Freighter within the movie.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. It rocks very hard, and I prefer it immensely to Leto's second album, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\". In this album, the tempos are much slower, the guitars are simpler, and the singing sounds less desperate. I absolutely love the distortion on these songs; it definitely sounds hard without sounding metal. Honestly, if you really like their second album, you won't like this one much, and if you really like this one, you won't like their second much. Two very different types of rock. If you really like this album, I recommend: Chevelle, \\"Point #1\\" and Tool, \\"Lateralus\\".

B0000VCZKW|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter since she loved it. We used to rent it from the local library and the copy they had skipped. This movie was a great addition to my 3 year olds collection of movies.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I ran across this CD accidentally, and not knowing anything about it other than it seemed to fit in the genre of music I like (Iron & Wine, Bright Eyes, Elliot Smith, etc.), I gave it a listen. From the very beginning I was drawn in to the slow and methodical way the songs are put together, each one complex and unique. An acoustic guitar lays the groundwork for just about every song, but on top of that each song builds its own group of sounds, including choral elements and a horn section, that always work to compliment the slow but high-pitched singing of Justin Vernon (the man behind the psuedonym). His voice caught me off guard at first, but I've come to really enjoy it and the layered way Vernon put his vocal tracks together.     Part of the appeal of this album is also the storry behind it, with Vernon pulling himself away to a secluded cabin to get away from the world while he rode through a rough patch in his life. The fact that he was not in the most uplifiting of spirits is obvious in the songs and the production's haunting overtones. I think it's fairly obvious when an artist is really pumping their soul into their work, and \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" is definitely an acheivement of such.    And for me, another part of the appeal of the album is knowing that it is a solo work, Vernon recording and piecing all of the tracks together himself in order to create the feeling of music coming from a large group. While this creates some trouble for him playing live shows, I look at it as quite an acheivement, both musically and artistically, that he was able to work on the level of an entire band to create his vision.     As others have noted, this album is not for everyone and might take a few listenings to really get the hang of it and come to appreciate it. My suggestion would be to find some peace and quiet, put on a good pair of headphones, and take some time to really give it a listen. Keep an open mind, and you won't be dissapointed.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Outliers- The Story of Success\\" is a very insightful and well-written book on the true nature of success-- or just as importantly failure-- in a few very specific, real-world circumstances.  The indirect influence of an unseen cultural legacy posited as the true determinant of success/failure in many of these cases.    Gladwell's arguments certainly are well presented and compelling.  It would be difficult to argue that at least in some of the cases, he could be dead on.  But some of the topics such as the now-famous 10,000 Hour Rule involve so many variables and attempt to account for impossible-to-quantify factors such as native talent, it would be difficult to prove it beyond a doubt as a hard-and-fast rule.    I really enjoyed this book, however, because it tackles some complex situations and profound ideas and presents them in a very engaging and easy to read manner.  It is very intelligently written and reflects a very active and creative mind.    Overall, a great read.
B000H5V8DG|2.0|At one time I would've recommended Alias as the all-time greatest TV series ever made!  Though the plots are intriguing and tied together throughout 6 seasons in amazing ingenuity, if you're questioning this on the basis of whether or not it is a good movie suitable to watch with family values, it is definitely not.<br /><br />There is nothing explicit in it (no nudity or extreme profanity, etc), and the violence is relatively managed and not gory.  But fidelity has no place in the TV series, and truth is greatly maligned as this series brings sympathy to the darkness of deceit.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie to anyone for these reasons....

B0017617M6|5.0|Written over sixty years ago, time has not diminished the capacity of this book to capture the reader's heart. This coming of age story that takes place in turn of the century Brooklyn will simply enthrall the reader with its descriptive passages and its richly developed characters. This book survives the passage of time without becoming anachronistic, because the themes upon which it touches are universal ones.<br /><br />The story centers on the Nolan family. The central character is the daughter, Mary Frances Nolan. Known as \\"Francie\\" to all and sundry, she is an intelligent child growing up in poverty in the tenements of Brooklyn with her charming father, a singing waiter and an alcoholic, her hard-working and practical, no-nonsense mother, and her younger brother, who enjoys favored son status in his mother's heart. Surrounding the family are a host of characters that are richly drawn and serve to add to the ambiance of the story as it enfolds.<br /><br />The events that transpire in the book are seen through Francie's eyes. Her family's struggle with poverty, her father's alcoholism, her mother's steely-eyed determination to keep her family afloat, and Francie's thirst for knowledge and desire for higher education all serve to make this child strong and thrive, where others might only despair. Such is Francie's strength of character. It is that strength that helps her to battle her self-doubts, her loneliness, and lack of friends, while growing up.<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered story, a true American classic that will keep the reader turning its pages.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Vin Diesel and Paul Walker team up again for some more heart pounding adrenaline action. Also returning are Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. It's been almost eight years since The Fast and The Furious first debuted in the summer of 2001. This movie takes place five years after the original. After hijacking fuel tanks in the Dominican Republic Dom (Vin Diesel) leaves his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and becomes a criminal on the run. When Dom gets a devastating phone call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), Dom decides to return to LA to get revenge. Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) who is now an FBI agent gets assigned to hunt down a drug lord named Braga. This new enemy ultimately unites Brian and Don who want to get revenge for the tragedy that happened to Dom. I will not give away anymore as I don't want to ruin it for anyone who has not seen this movie. I will say as a huge fan of the first 2 movies in the franchise (especially the first one), I knew this movie had a lot to live up to. I'm happy to say Fast and Furious does not disappoint. This Movie will have your heart beating FAST and FURIOUS. Just like the original film that started it all, this new movie will also have you on the edge of your seat. Don't listen to bitter critics, if you like a fun entertaining movie to take you away from your life for a few hours check this movie out!

B0002XMF5S|5.0|I waited several years before breaking down and finally purchasing SEVENTH STAR, which is really a Tony Iommi solo release.  The record company insisted that the BLACK SABBATH name be attached to this album, in the hopes of generating more sales.  Well, this album didn't need much help, and for those who like hard rock/metal of the mid-eighties, then this one's for you.  Not only do the songs pack a punch, but the sound is awesome, and it deserves praise.  Glenn Hughes is on vocals, and does a stellar job.  The songs, &#34;No Stranger to Love&#34; and Danger Zone are standouts, while Angry Heart is the perfect closer, and my favorite song from the album. The songs transition well, and it's a quality release overall.  This album sounds NOTHING like Black Sabbath, but it still rocks.  I recommend this album for purchase--you won't be disappointed.  9/10

B0026RHR6K|1.0|I don't know why the studios have such a hard time figuring this out. The Bluray set retails for $350, and for that, the DVDs come in flimsy cardboard packaging which didn't survive shipping intact. Each of the 4 set boxes had the cardboard bend/deform inside because they insufficiently support the weight of the DVDs themselves. The box design is OK, but I'd probably put it in a closet. Alas, the DVD boxes won't go well on a DVD shelf and as I said, their packaging was already damaged as soon as I opened the box.    This isn't a shipping issue - it's clearly a horrible design from Universal. I'll be contacting Amazon for return or replacement, although really I just need new disc sleeves (which I'd love to be able to get from Universal).

B000021YQV|2.0|Look, I'll be honest: nu-metal ain't my thing. I am definitely not the target audience for this album. I didn't expect to like it; the reason why I'm reviewing it is that it's better than I expected, thus worth some discussion. Fans of the band should probably not read this, but if you're someone like me who looked up Toxicity basically out of idle curiosity, maybe you'll get something out of my opinion.    Firstly, this doesn't really sound like a metal album. There's a lot of shouting, but the music is not really heavy. The sound has more in common with hardcore punk -- lots of primitive, fast guitar rhythms (I wouldn't call them \\"riffs,\\" they don't have a lot of individual character) with frenzied vocals, plus flashy rebellious politics. \\"Prison Song\\" could go on a [[ASIN:B00005NT4I Dead Kennedys]] album. Musically, that song isn't what I'd call \\"good,\\" but the presentation is so hilariously over-the-top that it becomes a lot of fun. They cram it as full as possible -- not only with political slogans, but also with helpful facts for their listeners, delivered in a breathless, breakneck screech, spitting out the words in a hurry to get to the next slogan/fact. There's also a gratuitous, funny diss of Hollywood.    So that's one track that I enjoyed, for reasons having nothing to do with its musical content. But there are a couple of songs that are actually well-written musically. The best, in my opinion, is the title track, which has a neat guitar line, less aggressive than most of the album, but with some disquieting suggestion in the tone. Also good is the last track, \\"Aerials,\\" which has the album's best heavy riff, pretty much the only one that stands out. Both songs rely less on yelling, and feature a more interesting, theatrical delivery from frontman [[ASIN:B000TX7B5U Serj Tankian]]. I also quite like the instrumental hidden track, the most melodic piece of music on the album.    Elsewhere on the album, it's possible to find the occasional decent punk thrash. \\"Bounce\\" is probably the best, accompanied by a humorously nonsensical lyric, delivered with the usual frenetic energy. There are also a few catchy vocal bits, like the \\"you can see America\\" bridge in \\"Deer Dance.\\"    The rest, though...oh, man. Teenage angst has been a marketable commodity for many years. But in the 90s, such angst kings as [[ASIN:B00066N8JS Nine Inch Nails]] or [[ASIN:B000000WA4 Smashing Pumpkins]] at least tried to put a poetic veneer on their adolescent rage, to make their complaining sound more noble by expressing it with metaphors and allegories. It wasn't that subtle, but at least they tried. Toxicity, however, has a song that calls some nameless figure of authority a \\"parasite,\\" wallows in self-deprecation with the line, \\"my tapeworm tells me what to do,\\" and finally paints a portrait of alienation with the line, \\"sitting in my room.\\" It's such a blatant fit for the angsty youth of the turn of the millennium -- the perfect song to play during that brief sulk between dinner and TV.     Further on, \\"Deer Dance\\" states that \\"they like to push the weak around,\\" where \\"they\\" is again nameless authority. Then \\"X\\" adds some anti-humanity rage with the line, \\"we don't need to multiply\\" (this demonstratively misanthropic sentiment was in fashion among the angsty youth of 2001), \\"Chop Suey\\" preens about \\"my self-righteous suicide,\\" and \\"Atwa\\" proclaims, \\"all the world I've seen before me, passing by,\\" just before erupting into the tantrum, \\"You don't care about how I feel! I don't feel it anymore!\\"    \\"Science\\" condemns science for having \\"failed our Mother Earth.\\" Okay, so faith is good, fine, but the spirituality that the song offers instead is the safe, vague, pandering kind, where \\"spirit moves through all things\\" and that's it. And, finally, \\"Psycho\\" is the moving story of a drug-addicted groupie, who gets patronized with the very sensible advice: \\"So you want to see the show, but you really don't have to be a ho.\\" The funniest part is that heputs so much pathos into that goofy line. It's probably meant to be ironic (I hope), but that doesn't make it good.    So, dear hypothetical casual listener who is wracked with indecision about whether to spend money on Toxicity: I would have to advise you against it. It does contain a couple of good songs, which you might consider buying on MP3 if you're into the whole angry guitar punk thing. However, the good parts are nowhere near enough to justify buying the CD.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|There is nothing I can add to the first two reviews all I can say is Amen!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best cd ever by the greatest simgle performer of any genre.
B00082IJ08|5.0|What began as a novelty act with cartoon monkeys ended up becoming the most creative band of the decade. By now, the innovations of Demon Days have become more common (even a Japanese [[ASIN:B000T2ICFY video game soundtrack]] composer got wise to them, in 2007). But even so, the album remains absolutely dazzling. The sound of Demon Days is a freewheeling, kaleidoscopic fusion of rock, rap and electronica. The cartoon concept is a blessing, allowing mastermind [[ASIN:B000000WA2 Damon Albarn]] (the single most talented pop musician working today) to surround himself with numerous guest stars, shuffling them in and out of his songs at will. The album is more of a theatrical production than an album by a band.    For instance, the single \\"Dirty Harry\\" has the most unconventional song structure to be found in any hit single. The chorus is sung by a gospel choir; it is repeated twice in the beginning, with no words in between, and then the first line resurfaces once at the very end. After the second chorus, there is one long verse, performed by the [[ASIN:B00005A09L Pharcyde]] rapper Bootie Brown. The music itself makes an abrupt change, from a funk guitar in the beginning to a string-laden break and a much harder, crashing beat on the rap verse. \\"Kids With Guns\\" is a loping groove reminiscent of \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" by [[ASIN:B00004BZ0N The Clash]], but ends with a crescendo of crashing guitars against a slow, blunt beat and a fragile keyboard counter-melody. A less sudden change is the way the main melody switches from keyboards to strings in the second half of \\"Last Living Souls.\\"    The whole album does this. It jumps from one type of vocalist to another, often in the space of the same song, but somehow the elements of the songs always make a good fit. Albarn's sexy, dangerous vocal on the chorus of \\"November Has Come\\" makes a perfect match with [[ASIN:B001EDKXOK MF Doom]]'s slow, sinister rap delivery. The smash single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" (the best single of the decade) has Albarn first sing-speaking a verse with an uneasy, dark vibe, then moving to a more emotional, wistful chorus with an acoustic guitar backdrop, and then brings in [[ASIN:B000000HHE De La Soul]] for a blustering rap. Most of the guest stars are singers and rappers who have long been past their prime (most notably [[ASIN:B000005IS7 Shaun Ryder]]), but who are reinvigorated by the modern production. As for Albarn himself, his singing is excellent, smoother and more technically proficient than in the Blur days. His forlorn, gentle falsetto in \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" is his best vocal performance to date.    Aside from the stylistic variety, the album's secret weapon is the inventive drum programming by producer Danger Mouse, chosen for this project on the strength of his underground mash-up [[ASIN:B001EBMESU The Grey Album]]. I've already mentioned the incredible beat in the second half of \\"Dirty Harry,\\" but even when he's using more conventional rhythms (\\"Feel Good Inc.\\"), he adds all kinds of breaks and fills. \\"El Manana\\" is a relatively straightforward ballad, but it gains a certain resilience from the unobtrusive, yet detailed and varied percussion.     For all the pop flourishes, however, the album is also very atmospheric. Danger Mouse throws all kinds of sound effects into the backgrounds, creating a murky feeling. The bass is prominent throughout: among its many strengths, \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" also has a superb bass line. The strings in \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" have a vaguely sorrowful sound, and the keyboard melodies in \\"Last Living Souls\\" and \\"Kids With Guns\\" are spare and spooky. The production gives a glacial sheen to the disco stylings of \\"DARE.\\"     The lyrics are impressionistic, but usually contribute to the dark mood in some way, like Albarn's tense, portending chorus of \\"now you know November has come, and it's gone away,\\" or his laments about how \\"I lost my way\\" and \\"we're the last living souls,\\" or even Shaun Ryder's plea (surrounded by ghostly multi-tracked backing vocals) of \\"never did no harm\\" in \\"DARE.\\" The rap verse in \\"Dirty Harry\\" makes a topical connection, evoking the paranoia of a soldier trying to survive in a strange land. But the unease of Demon Days is all-pervasive. In some way, the album captures the mood of the 2000s just as well as Blur's landmark [[ASIN:B000002TQB Parklife]] epitomized the 1990s.    The best songs occur in the middle of the album -- tracks five through nine are spell-binding. But, unfortunately, the sprawling compositional style does over-extend itself sometimes. I'm not sure the album really needed two songs with a gospel choir at the end. Sure, the title track is supposed to show a ray of hope among the clouds, but when it urges you to \\"turn to the sun,\\" that sounds like an awfully glib resolution. Furthermore, a couple of songs borrow the drab guitar chug of \\"Crazy Beat\\" from the [[ASIN:B0000931OG last]] Blur album: \\"O Green World\\" has a good vocal performance, but the backing is grating, and \\"White Light\\" is a drag, a noisy and pointless two-minute instrumental with pounding drums. On the plus side, the reggae-inflected spoken-word track \\"Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head\\" (where Dennis Hopper reads a morality play of sorts), though it may sound like a bad idea, actually ends up being very enjoyable.    The fact remains that, out of the fifteen tracks on Demon Days, seven or eight are the best music made by anyone during the 2000s. I recommend Demon Days to everyone. Even if you don't normally like rap or electronica, this may be the one album that warrants making an exception.

B001QTXM5Y|5.0|Zack Snyder has created a stunning cinematic achievement with  \\"Watchmen\\".  He accomplished what was considered to be impossible in bringing the graphic novel to the screen.  \\"Watchmen\\" is not going to be for everyone, and I think that a familiarity with the subject matter through the motion comic DVD or the novel itself would help for overall enjoyment due to the complexity of its plot.  The themes, visual imagery and the entire parallel universe that is envisioned are unforgettable.  One word of warning :  the movie is very violent so don't think it's for the kiddies plus the \\"Director's Cut\\" is the best choice.  I am completely in awe that a comic book movie could so quickly come along that is the equal or superior to \\"The Dark Knight\\", but Watchmen is such a film.  I do not think that \\"Watchmen\\" has been properly recognized as the cinematic masterpiece which it will be viewed as in the future.  Movies this  spectacular do not come around very often, and Snyder has really showcased his talents here.  \\"Watchmen\\" is truly a classic that invites repeated viewings so sit back and enjoy the ride.....again and again !
B001RNI1Z0|4.0|This is a very thought provoking, but expressly simple book. There may be some contention considering a great deal of this book is based on metaphysics and mysticism of the Subconscious Mind. There are no references or endnotes, at least in this edition, to allow the reader to vet the verity of his abundant usage of \\"actual\\" events. Also, there are some issues I have with some of the events, but I think the holistic end that one gets from the energy of the book is more valuable than steering one away from this philosophy of mind altogether. Not to mention, I do believe he made his point with an over burdening emphasis by the middle of the book, so it does become a monotonous read after around this point.<br /><br />  Murphy's stress upon meditation (or prayer, for those who follow that path) is a hint of Buddhist wisdom; this is how we manage the data in our subconscious mind. How we think is indicative of the life we experience, and how we experience life is indicative of how we think. The focal point of mine here is to stress the verity of the fact that we should \\"know that [we] can remake [our self] by giving a new blueprint [(program)] to [our] subconscious mind\\" (page 6). Through meditation we have the ability to alter our patterns of thinking which alters how we perceive the world, but this does not mean that we are immune to the outside influences. Every human being is in a different reality, because our individual realities are based on what we know, what we know is based on the information downloaded from our five sensory data programmers, those signals we import from Communal Reality. Communal Reality is that which we are all here together experiencing, but we can never experience or occupy the space that an individual is in, therefore we can never experience or occupy that individual's reality. The only true reality that exists is the Universe itself. From these individualistic realities we all exert force, be it physical, audible or intellectual (religions, theories, dogmas, principles and other propaganda), upon the Communal Reality to make our sway influence what it is that we experience in our somatic vessels, and that in turn is where the chaos comes from along with those unfortunate random occurrences of nature. That is how we inadvertently bring the Chaos within to create the Chaos without. You can experience NOTHING beyond your Mind, it is the Alpha and Omega of your experience in that body you are in; it regulates all, so you may as well manage its data so you can experience a divine approach to life.<br /><br />[Stepping off soapbox]<br /><br />Back to the book, it definitely illuminates the truth that the mind is a central and divine power, through its activation and usage anything is possible. To sum it up in elementary terms, on page 78 Murphy identifies three properties of the mind that allow us to achieve our intentions, Principles-Ideal Visualization-Execution. First, you identify the fact that there are outside influences of \\"stresses and strains\\" to contend with, the principles. Second, create an ideal visualization of the outcome of your approach. Third, execute the approach with unwavering perseverance. This, to me, is the thesis of the book, and merely is a FACT not mystical or metaphysical. There are parts of the book that does definitely take on a tone of the metaphysics and mysticism, I do not believe anyone can deny the results of positive thinking that is goal oriented and wavers to no adversity to obtain individual success.<br /><br />In summary, get the book, of course you are going to have contentions, what book have you ever read that you emphatically agree with every word, every sentence or every page?!-(Please do not reply \\"The Bible\\")- There is something to gain from this book. The mind is indeed a powerful tool, between this book and Timothy Leary's \\"Your Brain is God\\" my perspective of the Mind has become an integral part of my ontological journey. While I will admit that I am superficially ignoring the parts of the book I disagree with, there is a reason. The parts I agree with, to me, far out weigh those that I disagreed with. Most of this book is simply going to be experiential and either resonates with one or it does not.f the book I disagree with, there is a reason.

0385335482|5.0|I am just now getting into this series and have read all 5 books. I love reading about Rebecca's trials and tribulations and how she got out of all those messes she got herself into. I saw the movie and was NOT impressed at all. I think the book is much better. I also was under the impression that Becky wouldn't be a red head as she was in the movie. I remember in Shopaholic and Baby that the baby doctor, who was an old boyfriend of Luke's,had red hair and Becky called her the red haired b.... and kept talking about her swishy red hair. We never do get a description of what Becky looks like but I know she wouldn't have red hair based on the doctor being red haired. I also pictured Luke differently than the actor who played him in the movie. All in all this series is good light reading as well as enjoyable. I felt like I was escaping into another world when I read these books. I love to shop but I am fortunate to say I have never been in debt or had bill collectors call me like they did Becky. I loved her creative excuses and letters when bills were sent to her.

B00001OH7U|5.0|Recorded in late 1975 and released in 1976, David Bowie's \\"Station To Station\\" offers a transition between his previous funk/soul \\"Young Americans\\" sound and his late 1970's electronica-influenced \\"Berlin Trilogy\\".  The six-song album charted in the top 5 in both the US and UK and has appeared on numerous critics' \\"best of\\" lists in subsequent decades.  Bowie adopted his character \\"The Thin White Duke\\" during this stage of this career, and claims to remember little of these recording sessions due to copious drug use.  His backing band featured guitarist Carlos Alomar, drummer Dennis Davis, bassist George Murray, and Roy Bittan on piano.  This release features the 1999 digital remasters of the original six tracks, and the MP3 download is a great bargain, costing less than $7.      The ten minute title track is Bowie's longest studio recording, and the only song from this album that was not released on a US or UK single.  It opens with train sounds and a slow piano, and later segues into a driving upbeat riff reminiscent of his previous albums.  The infectious \\"Golden Years\\" was a top 10 single in the US and the UK in 1976 and remains popular on the radio over thirty years later.  Bowie has said that he originally offered this song for Elvis Presley, but Presley declined!  Bowie explores spiritual despair in the hymn-like \\"Word On A Wing\\" that closes Side A of the original release.  Side B opens with the rocker \\"TVC15\\", allegedly about Iggy Pop's hallucination that his girlfriend was being consumed by a television set.  The funky, six-minute \\"Stay\\" follows, and the closer is a cover of \\"Wild Is The Wind\\", previously popularized by Johnny Mathis and Nina Simone.

B00422LESO|3.0|I found Austenland in the bargain book section at BN online and decided to get it though I am not normally a sucker for Austen-inspired novels. It also worked out because I can use it for the book challenge (Everything Austen). I wasn't sure I was going to like this in the beginning, the premise was a bit silly. The main character, Jane (of course), is infatuated with Pride and Prejudice and the DVD version with Colin Firth. Who isn't? But her great-aunt discovers Jane has them hidden and thinks Jane has put her life on hold waiting for her own Darcy. A year later, her aunt passes away and leaves Jane a 3 week paid vacation to Austenland, in England, with it's own Pemberley and actors to play Austenesque characters. Jane must dress in the Regency period, talk in character to fully have this experience.<br />I really began to get into the book, it was amusing to read about Jane struggling to stay in character, wanting to know about the actors, reality blending with fiction. Jane begins to discover more about herself and is determined to fully participate and put Darcy behind her. Each chapter starts with a blurb about a past relationship of Jane's.<br />And of course, I wanted to know if Jane would end up with her own Darcy or leaves that fantasy behind with her vacation. You'll have to read it to find out for yourself.<br />This book may not appeal to those burned out by P&P themed books, and I don't often read those, but this had a decent plot and was written well but definitely falls under the chick-lit genre.

With all the past TV shows available, why hasn't this one be made available?
B0027G783W|4.0|It's no surprise that Moby's music has appeared in so many movies, TV shows and commercials - he has a real flair for the cinematic theme, and if you like that side of him, you'll love this album.  Mr. Melville knows how to compose a gorgeous theme, and they are here in abundance on his new release.  There are vocals, too, from guest female singers, as well as Moby himself (on only one track, \\"Mistake\\").  There is some vocal sampling as well, especially in the gospel-tinged \\"Study War\\". But for the most part this is an instrumental album that tends to wash over, rather than excite, the listener. There are no dance-worthy tracks, at least as produced on this album. (There will inevitably be some remixes in the near future, knowing Moby and his love of studio noodling.) It's a vast improvement over 2005's disjointed \\"Hotel\\", though it won't replace \\"Play\\" atop the list of his best albums.  That album, one of the best releases of the 1990's, had the perfect balance of rock, hip-hop, techno, samples of vocal field recordings, and some sublime instrumentals.  \\"Wait for Me\\" isn't nearly as varied musically, but like \\"Play\\", it can be appreciated thematically from beginning to end, and although the album may not get you up and dancing, it does reward the listener in subtler, even moving, ways.
B00204AA0O|2.0|I am supremely disappointed that I spent money on this cd.  I was attracted to Regina Spektor in the beginning because of her voice and the piano arrangements.  Her voice and piano on this cd are very good.  However, the lyrics are way too uninspired and badly written.  She also needs to stop saying goofy things and making goofy sounds with her voice.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this cd for purchase.  Borrow it from the library and then decide if it's worth it.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Henry Selick, best known for \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" (1993) and \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" (1996) brings his talent for stop-motion animation to this adaptation of Neil Gaiman's children's novel \\"Coraline\\". Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is an 11-year-old girl whose family has just moved into an apartment in a slightly dilapidated Victorian house. While her parents are busy finishing up work on a deadline, and it pours rain outside, Coraline is bored. Then she discovers a small door in the living room that has been papered over. At night the door leads to another house like hers, only better, with more attentive versions of her parents and perfected versions of her eccentric neighbors. Her Other Mother (Terry Hatcher) invites Coraline to stay in the other world, but there is high price to pay, and Coraline begins to suspect something sinister.<br /><br />Stop-motion animation was the choice for this film because it ages well. I couldn't agree more. \\"Coraline\\" looks fantastic and distinctive. It leaves a strong visual impression. I was reminded of \\"The Mascot\\" (1934), an early example of stop-motion that is as strong today as it was 75 years ago. I have not read the novel \\"Coraline\\", but I understand that the film has made significant changes, including that addition of a prologue in which we see mechanical hands creating a doll of Coraline. I'm grateful for that sequence, as it contains some of the film's most memorable animation. Like so many children's stories, there is a lesson imbedded in the tale. The film's tagline is \\"Be careful what you wish for\\". In the Other World, everything is exactly how Coraline would like it, for herself and for others. But it makes her value her real family all the more.<br /><br />There has been a lot of discussion about whether \\"Coraline\\" is actually a children's film. It is not graphic; there is no blood or guts. There are disturbing ideas which are enhanced by creepy imagery. I would caution that it is probably too scary for children under six. For 6-10-year-olds, it is an entirely individual matter. The book on which it is based is fantasy/horror intended for 9-12-year-olds. Some children like to be scared, and if your 8-year-old is one of those kids, \\"Coraline\\" might be just the thing. If your child is sensitive, you may not want to cope with the nightmares. It's a nice film for older children, because it encourages children to be bright and independent and never condescends to them. It doesn't have the thematic sophistication that makes many Pixar films equally suitable for adults. But \\"Coraline\\" is visually interesting enough that it won't bore adults either.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009 single disc edition): The single disc edition has the 2-D film on one side of the disc and a 3-D version on the other. It comes with 4 pairs of glasses for viewing the 3-D. This isn't the same 3-D as was in movie theaters. That technology is not available for home viewing, so this version is the old blue-red 3-D.

B002AT4KA0|5.0|This is a great movie, any fan of the first one gotta love this one.  The main characters are back, the story is pretty good, and action is even better.  First movie was good, second one sucked, third was alright it had few good scenes but with this one they went back to the roots. I hope next one they have more imports, because American cars suck, they always break down and need to be fixed.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I had such high hopes for this film but what I saw was a jumbled mess.  Everything in this movie was wrong.  I didn't know Tarantino could make such a bad movie.Apparently he was trying to adapt his famous  conversation scenes to women but they just sound like male gab fests.  The action is non existent except for 2 car crashes. The plot is non existent.Half way through the movie the four female leads are killed and Tarantino replaces them with four more and we don't care about any of them.  Kurt Russell is wasted.  He is neither menacing or funny.  Even the  lap dance scene is contrived and boring. Shame on Tarantino for making this indulgent drivel.  I hope he returns to his artistic senses with his next film.  This is a must to avoid!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|First I thoroughly enjoyed The Forgotten Garden.  It was enchanting and my great pleasure to have read the book.  While I will not divulge the storyline - that for the editorial staff to do - I want to recommend this book and this is why:<br />I was shocked to find it was nearly 600 pages as I sped through the book in such a short time, even trying to put on the brakes as I didn't want it to end.  It was a story that will cause you to root for the main characters as if they were your dearest friends and to plot against the villains as if they were a real threat.<br />The book kept my interest piqued throughout without the pandemonium that often accompanies mysteries.  I was always ready to turn the page to see what would be revealed, yet at the same time I felt the book had a sense of calm and tranquility that left me content.  It is the perfect book to read when you have nothing to do but snuggle up on the sofa and read, as for me I was totally absorbed.<br />This is my second Kate Morton book and I very much look forward to more.  In this book she truly weaves the past and present together seamlessly.  It was an easy sashay from one era to another, from one woman to another.  No confusion, no chaos, no turmoil. The book is twined together with clarity and composure, which would also describe the main characters.  They, like the author, are a class act.

B001U5V03U|3.0|Let's face it: modern operatic productions are now facing a dire crisis in terms of vocal as well as visual standard.<br />This ROH production has enough vices in respect of both, but frankly speaking, this is by no means the worst.<br />Vocally, Simon Keenlyside's reprisal of Don G is a failure for himself.<br />The Champagne Aria simply fails to take off, and the duet with Zerlina too 'creamy', while the Serenade is sorely 'under'.<br />One misses sadly the Don of Cesare Siepi in that 1950's mono and black and white DVD under Furtwangler. Not one single modern production on DVD came any close to that one, let alone surpassing it.<br />The only salvage point in this ROH 2008 production is Joyce Didonato's Donna Elvira, the best since Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.<br />And whoever casts Ramon Vargas as Don Ottavio commits a grave mistake - Vargas is a first-rate bel canto lyrical tenor; not Mozartian tenor. Whatever happened to the Donna Anna in this production, there is surely an understudy competent enough to take her role, especially that this is to be commercially released on DVD!<br />And the conductor even fails to keep pace with the singers in more than one entry, undoubtedly the result of under-rehersal.  But, why so?<br />As for the sets, well, suffice to mention that it could be worse.

It's funny, it's clever, and it has a hint of romance between the Big Bad Wolf, now a security officer and detective, and Snow White, a powerful politician/business woman who runs the world of the exiled fable community. While the mystery of who killed party girl Rose Red drives the plot, what I really loved seeing was the twist that the authors gave the characters: Prince Charming is a womanizing leech, the perpetual unemployed ex who mooches off the women he seduces. Rose Red's boyfriend, Jack of Tales, is a hustler who is always coming up with a get-rich-quick scheme. I will definitely be buying more of these!

It is a beautiful rendering of the original film, whether it is true in all ways (color variance or whatever) to the orginal or not. I love it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Several of my friends assure me that because I enjoy the paranormal genre, I should watch True Blood. Unfortunately I don't have HBO, so I purchased the series with the explicit understanding that it would be worth it. Guess what girls and boys it was....it rocked. What was most surprising is that I have read a couple Charlaine Harris novels and did not recognize that it was the same storyline (I must re-read when I get a chance). Anyway, in a nutshell the entire first season is a murder mystery revolving around the deaths of several women who are \\"fang bangers\\" or willing to have sex with vampires. Let me start over, perhaps I jumped too quickly into the plot and you are lost. I should explain a few things first. The vampires live openly with the rest of society due to a recently manufactured product known as \\"True Blood\\". This product is synthetic blood which the vamps can drink versus human blood. Of course there are opposing sides, the religious fanatics, the vamps and the rest of the world who are either curious about the entire \\"vamp lifestyle\\" or scared to death of what living with vampires could mean. Meanwhile, there is a rash of murders in a small Louisiana town that hint to either a vampire killer or a someone who wants to make it look like a vampire.     Sookie Stackhouse is the main character and is a waitress at Merlotte's Diner. She also has a secret, she can hear people's thoughts. One night she overhears a couple plotting to harvest a vampire's blood to get \\"high\\". Apparently vampire blood enhances sexual experiences and fetches a pretty penny on the drug scene. Saving the vampire's life, Sookie begins a relationship with Bill, a hundred something year old vamp. Meanwhile, Sookie's brother, Jason (a simpleton and womanizer) appears to be the prime suspect in the recent murders in town. It seems that every woman he has sex with is turning up dead. Hot on the killer's trail is Officer Andy Bellefleur, who will stop at nothing to get the truth. There are several other characters to love in this series: Tara (her best friend); Sam (Merlotte's owner who has a secret...and it's not just that he has a crush on Sookie although he does); Nelson (a cross dressing/gay cook who sells vamp blood on the side); a gang of cool vamps; some religious fanatics; and a town full of interesting characters. As the plot unfolds, so does the genius writing of the show. What makes this series so wonderful is the build up to future storylines and an expectation of things to come. I definitely feel that I got a deal when I purchased the series. I definitely would recommend it, especially if you like shows like Nip Tuck, Sunny in Philadelphia, HBO's old series OZ or 6th Feet Under, Rescue Me......although True Blood does have more nudity. I think what makes all these series a hit is that they are edgy and offer something new to viewers. However, the challenge will be can the writers maintain the integrity of the show. I hope so and look forward to purchasing Season 2.
0439023491|5.0|I was lucky enough to get my hands on an advance copy of the book and without going into detail (as not to spoil it) I can guarantee that if you enjoyed The Hunger Games you're going to love Catching Fire. I read Hunger in about 4 days and I think I spent 3 on Catching Fire. I simply could not put it down. Collins has a riveting way of hooking you into the story where you feel like you're cheating yourself out of great storytelling if you put the book down. I was up WAY past my bedtime just cause I didn't want to stop, and I definitely paid the price the next day at work... but it was totally worth it.<br /><br />Of course the major downside of reading a book early is that now I have to wait even longer for the 3rd book to come out!
B001G83TQ2|5.0|Fans of Sly Stone, Average White Band, Sade, and Swing Out Sister, to name a few, will all find something appealing about Simply Red's sophomore release, \\"Men And Women\\", originally released in 1987.  After enjoying a worldwide smash and instant standard in the single \\"Holding Back The Years\\", the temptation to produce a clone had to be on the band's mind.  That clone is \\"Maybe Someday...\\", but let's put that aside a moment.     Delightfully, the rest of the album finds the band confident, exploratory, and exuberant.  Lyrically, Mick Hucknall has love on the mind.  Specifically, the lustful kind.  The working class Brit viewpoint, especially on matters of the heart, is still intact and at its zenith here.  The band sounds incredible too.  From horns, piano, synth, and hearty background vocal, these are just the right bandmates to match Hucknall's take-no-prisoners mood.    The songs :  \\"The Right Thing\\", a fine eighties pop tune.  \\"Infidelity\\", an ode to that cheating mood.  \\"Let Me Have It All\\", hands-down funk exercise a la AWB and Sly.  \\"Love Fire\\", touches elements of reggae and ska.  \\"Move On Out\\" and \\"Shine\\", smooth soul with slinky minor chords.    The good news : there's not a dud in the bunch, and this import adds six more tracks to the original album.    The bad news : the US didn't take to \\"Men And Women\\" as this great work merited.  \\"The Right Thing\\" scraped the top forty; the rest was virtually forgotten.  It put Simply Red in the position of slicking it up way too far on their next release, \\"A New Flame\\".  The reward was another #1 in the form of a tame Philly soul cover on a tame release.      Here, they weren't yet playing safe, the results are spectacular.  I'm not big on giving anything 5 stars, but I have no reservations about how highly I recommend this to fans of true soul music.

B000VWE5OY|2.0|I just finished season one and it is amazing how they can take the character of Captain Jack and turn him into a jerk. He was great in Doctor Who, I liked a few of the episodes and there are too many half naked men, other then that I am okay with all the Homosexuality. My only other gripe is that Ianto should have been fired after that cyberwoman episode, instead of just getting a slap on the wrist. I thought this would be a more scfi oriented show, hopefully season two is better, I am starting on that next.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I had no idea what Watchmen was about before I watched it. I thought it was just another hollywood superhero movie. I was glad I was wrong! The movie is very dark, very human and disturbing but thought-provoking. I was so pleased with the blu-ray rental so I ordered it. I plan to grab a graphic novel version of it.     The movie doesn't have a happy ending so don't expect walking away from the moive feeling good. The ending was depressing for me. I understand it was for the \\"greater good\\" but I disagree. There got to be some other way. I was on the other side that unfortunately got killed. What the superheroes did was what a communist nation would do when you think about it. Nothing about the ending to knock the stars down. It was just something to think and discuss about.    The movie has some very graphic violence and strong sexual content. It is NOT suitable for people under age of 17. I could imagine some ignorant parents taking their children to the movie, thinking it was just another popcorn superhero flick. Haha! I feel sorry for them.    This movie may be too long for some but it was no issue for me because you can just pause it in the DVD/Blu-ray version to take a break.    If you are mature and intelligent enough for a thought-provoking movie and want something different from your typical superhero movie, Watchmen is it!
B0000CNY27|5.0|[[ASIN:B0000CNY27 Escape from New York (Special Edition)]]<br />When the film was actually released in India, there were only a very meagre number of people owning television sets or for that matter even VCRs in the entire city of Mangalore. I saw it on the big screen and was immeadiately hooked to the film. The popularity spread through word of mouth and it ran for not less than thirty days. That was a record for any hollywood movie including Star Wars. Eventhough, when viewed today, in 2009, youngsters might complain that the theme feels rather ludicrous (the concept of Manhattan island becoming a maximum security penetentiary in the year 1997, seperated from the rest of the United States and patrolled by highly trained cops.) Kurt Russell plays 'Snake Plisken' a decorated Vet, gone renegade, who is sent on a mission into Manhattan island to rescue the President of the United States, when Airforce One crashes into New York.Donald Pleasence plays the President, held hostage by a criminal named 'the Duke' of New York (Issac Hayes).John Carpenter's crisp direction,the gripping score and the low-light cinematography will surely have you at the edge of your seat. Each and every character is well written and portrayed. Ernest Borgnine as a cabby, Harry Dean Stanton as 'Brain', Adrienne Barbeau, another Carpenter regular, portrays Brain's girl-friend, Maggie. All give terrific performances. Many of my friends have critisized the film as a mere two dimentional pulp. But probably they are comparing it to modern day special effects wizardry in films like The Terminator etc..But I still maintain that in the 1980s there was no other film in the futuristic category which earned it such a mass hysteric CULT following that has not waned even to this day. Even John Carpenter could not come up with a good follow-up movie. 'Escape from L.A', is nothing even remotely near 'Escape from New York'. The film even created a whole new generation of Kurt Russel fans, which significantly benifitted Mr.Russell's career graph. I strongly recommend the film to all die-hard fans of John Carpenter or Kurt Russell. Even if you are not a fan, every time you see this DVD from Amazon, you will get the urge to watch it again and again. The images in the restored version are really good. The sound quality also has been re-masterd, from the original print. If you have a good home-theater with either Dolby 5.1 or DTS, then this film is a treat to watch. You will wonder,\\"Gosh, the film ended so quickly.\\" That is the magic of this film. 'The Duke of New York\\", Issac Hayes travels in a special Cadillac fitted with Chandeliars in the front.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This review is for; [[ASIN:B001KVZ6F2 Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br /> As a life long Clint Eastwood fan watching \\"Gran Torino\\" stirred up memories of Dirty Harry, Sgt Gunney Highway from \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\" and any other similar characters that Clint has done throughout his illustrious career in his iconic, \\"Eastwood\\" style. A style complete with his trademark raspy voice, angry-eyed stares & straight to the point, but sometimes humourous dialouge.  Set in a Detroit neighborhood we learn that Eastwood's character Walt Kwolski has just become a widow. A decorated veteran of the Korean War he has two sons, but he isn't close to them nor their families. His grand-daughter talks to him about what is going to happen to his possessions when he is going to die. His son & daughter-in-law talks to him about going to a retirement home. He also hates the Toyota SUV his son is driving as we learn Walt used to work at the Ford factory. \\"Buy American\\" he curses! I'm not from Detroit, but I heard import cars are sometimes frowned upon there since American cars are produced by the big three American manufacturers in Detroit.<br /><br />With the look of frustration he continues to live alone with his dog. He has immigrant neighbors that he initially despises, but ultimately gets drawn to them after a local gang encounter with the family's son Thao. The same son that attempts to steal Walt's prized 72 Gran Torino from Walt's garage but fails. Walt becomes a neighborhood hero and is showered with gifts of plants or food by his neighbors that he initially refuses. Thao's sister Sue, befriends Walt and he returns the favor by rescuing her from three men who threaten her & her very, scarred boyfriend. However the very shy & reclusive Thao becomes the interim student for Walt, as Walt sort of takes him under his wing and attempts to make him more of a man by teaching him. His dialogue lesson in the barber shop is one of the greatest and funniest moments in the film, which helps him immensely for his next encounter during the construction job interview. Walt still periodically communicates with his son's family with little or no success (his son's attempt to give his father birthday presents were funny to watch!), but it is the immigrant family that Walt really bonds with in this film as they are the true focal point for Walt. We also learn of Walt's impending sickness that may very well influence him for what he decides to do in the end.<br /><br />This is a coming of age film for the character Thao and a redemption story for Walt who despite his severed relationship with his sons & their families finds solace with another family he initially despises but learns to trust & love towards the end. There are many racial slurs spoken throughout the film as well as profanity, but the kind of language you might hear from street gangs anyways. Actually, every time Eastwood spoke with profanity, he always made it sound funny! The film climaxes to the eventual final confrontation with Walt & the terrorizing gang. Without revealing what really happens in the end, the results were satisfactory. This is another great Eastwood film that goes up there with \\"Unforgiven\\" & \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". Although I think \\"Gran Torino\\" should satisfy more of the Eastwood fans that enjoyed the type of character Eastwood portrays from his Dirty Harry movie series or a similar character from \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\". Classic Eastwood at his best!<br /><br />Oh yeah & the next time someone gets on my front yard, I will give them the iconic Eastwood stare & say \\"Get Off my Lawn!\\".ely for his next encounter during the construction job interview.

B002HJYJUY|5.0|The 40th Anniversary Legacy edition of this classic album is its best release to date!! Vic Anesini's mastering is fantastic! He brings the music to life as if it were recorded in 2009, not 1969. There are many reasons why you should buy this 2 disc issue. Aside from the mastering, this collection brings together all of the masters from those incredible sessions in one package. This includes the two albums that came from the sessions, From Elvis in Memphis and Back in Memphis, as well as the 10 other tracks that were released over time. Another fantasic offering from this package are the singles in original mono. In 1960 and 1970, when the vinyl singles were released, they were released in mono. Including these masters is a wonderful trip down memory lane. They do sound different, and to my ear perhaps even better that the stereo versions. It's a matter of taste. Ernst and Roger, if you read this, the only thing that would have made this package better would have been to include the stereo masters of the singles as well. Since we have the stereo version of In The Ghetto already in the album, it would have made the set complete to place Suspicious Minds, Don't Cry Daddy, and Kentucky Rain in stereo on the end of disc 1, leaving disc 2 with the mono versions for comparison. No matter, Vic Anesini has remastered those as well on other packages. This release is a must for all fans. It truly shows the mastery of Elvis Presley.

I recommended the book to my book club and I believe everyone (13 people) liked the book.  I have also lent it to some friends and they really liked it.  It is a book, I believe I can read again in a few years.  I will keep it in my library. I will definitely read more books by Diane Setterfield.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone, an adolescent on the autism spectrum, likes dogs: dogs do not have complicated faces and emotions. When he finds the neighbor's dog, Wellington, murdered, he decides to investigate despite warnings to leave the matter alone. From the beginning, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nigh-Time references The Hound of the Baskervilles both explicitly and subtly. Like Watson in the Hound of the Baskervilles, Christopher begins to question exactly whom he can trust when he makes a shocking discovering about his family that leads him to travel to London alone. The structure of a traditional Who-Dun-It shapes Christopher's narrative and investigation, but beneath the question of who killed Wellington lies a far greater mystery of how to manage in a strange world where people act in strange and confusing ways. Christopher is a believable character with an unintentionally funny and authentic voice that comes across clearly where characters on the spectrum all too often do not speak for themselves. Highly Recommended.    [[ASIN:0451528018 The Hound of the Baskervilles: 100th Anniversary Edition (Signet Classics)]]
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Gran Torino was a surprisingly emotional experience for me, both due to it being one of Eastwood's most affecting and human movies, and because my Dad loved Clint and we used to see all his films together. Clint has made some real classics, and this ranks with any of them in its own unique way.<br /><br />Schenk's script keeps getting better as the film moves along; the opening scene is almost ham-handed exposition, telling us everything we need to know right away instead of showing it. That's the weakest moment of the film, though, and as we dig into Walt's character Clint informs him with many perfect and telling details, visually and verbally. Eastwood is totally inside this role, an absolutely masterful performance that should have won the Oscar hands down, and his direction is equally crisp. Rarely has a director acted so well, and vice-versa.<br /><br />There are many perfect moments here, from Walt's family trying to make sure they're in his will but never spending time with him, Walt's exchanges with his barber, his love of his talismanic Torino, and above all his growing love towards his Hmong neighbors. One of the best things about the blu-ray version is the extra doc about making the movie, a very fine little piece with some great Clint interviews that makes clear how careful he was to get all the cultural details right in this (very rare) cinematic look at Hmong culture in the US.<br /><br />Here we see a very mature Eastwood, in all the best ways. Dirty Harry has progressed into the sort of quietly loving being that was his destiny all along, and I believe that's what my Dad always loved about Clint: under all that toughness and edge is a truly intelligent and compassionate man who knows that the underdog is oft worth fighting for, and that the values we carry in our hearts are what define us in our most difficult times. The old Clint revenge motif is as usual in full force, but this time there's more soul in it than is sometimes the case, and the unexpected ending truly makes it clear that Dirty Harry and the Man With No Name have learned a lot in the past four decades.<br /><br />We've been watching plenty of films this very hot summer (thank goodness there's no global warming! It would really be hot, not just 105 most every day for the past month), and this is one of the only ones I can recall where about halfway in I suddenly hoped the movie would never end. I wanted to see Walt grow and develop; Clint's performance is just that good, certainly one of his best.<br /><br />There is also a lot of wonderfully wry humor, especially if you know any semi-bigots who are deep down very just and decent people. Clint's not afraid to poke fun at himself or Archie Bunkers or anything else by this point, and there are some hilarious lines that come out of nowhere. Walt's little grunts say more than any dialogue. I don't think Walt would ever say \\"colored guy\\", but Clint's knowing that the N-word would unnecessarily offend a lot of folks makes that line acceptable if unrealistic in this context. It's one of the film's few odd moments but doesn't detract at all.<br /><br />The music is also very fine, simple but moving, and Eastwood's son Kyle (what a great name, another sign of Clint's genius) has progressed a lot in the last 20 years. If Clint's basic but heartfelt singing over the credits doesn't bring tears to your eyes, you're a stronger man than I, and welcome to it. When Clint makes you cry you know something special has happened; this is a long way from Detective Callahan and even Unforgiven, another masterpiece.<br /><br />But the best thing here is the growth of Clint's love for Thao and Sue, his young Hmong neighbors who show him more real love than his own family. The bond between Walt and Thao is one of the more touching screen relationships I have ever seen, and it really becomes affecting as the film evolves. Wonderful acting from both of these hitherto unknown players makes this movie glow with a feeling unlike anything Eastwood has ever done, and it's seeing one of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.<br /><br />I had no idea this film would be anywhere near this fine, and rarely have I missed my Dad more since his death. He would have loved Gran Torino in so many ways, and I can't recommend enough that any fathers and sons out there see this film together. It has a lot to say about men and how we relate to each other and ourselves. It made me realize yet again that my old man knew what was up in many ways that only getting older can reveal to me, and that I sure was lucky to have him for a father. Any film that can bring that home so forcefully, and with so much laughter amongst the pathos, is nothing other than a true classic.<br /><br />This movie will live a long life and eventually be seen as one of the finest of our era. It's a fitting end to Eastwood's stellar career, one of the American cinema's most interesting. Or is it the end? Clint, man of many surprises, may still have one or two up his sleeve....<br /><br />Not bad for a 78-year-old old man.of our great American film heroes become Walt so completely that makes this movie truly special.

B0000047GA|5.0|Miles Davis may have added rock beats to jazz, but it was Tony Williams Lifetime that made jazz rock.<br /><br />Williams, John McGlachlan and Larry Yound formed no less than a jazz power trio in 1969. This music has complex soloing and collosus drumming. But this band plays so hard and so loud, this advanced music has a 100% rock impulse. Picture John Coltrane joining Cream, and you might get an idea of what Lifetime's musical instincts were.<br /><br />But unlike most power trios, Lifetime did not need a bass. Larry Young is a brilliant organist, but a minimalist. His style is subtle and lends itself well to comping for the guitar and drums' virtuoso excursions. For the function he serves, he is not even using his foot pedals as much as you would think. Most of the music's bottom--and there is not a lot of it-- comes  from his organ chords.<br /><br />Williams lays complex poloyrhythms on top of one another, taking the music far from its center of gravity, and then snapping it back at just the right point to create an incredible dynamic. It's ironic that this material is more rock-oriented than Miles' work at the time, since Miles main change was to provide a much more straight ahead bottom to his music. Lifetime is so hard and heavy, their music can afford to function on an IMPLIED bottom and still work as rock<br /><br />Mcglachlan's axe is dense and loud, but his playing has its heart in jazz improvosation and not rock crunchiness. Williams also sings on this, and like with any old friend I love and respect, I'll  avoid the subject.<br /><br />The sound on this is horrible. In 1969 recording technology has improved by leaps and bounds, and there is no excuse for the tinny, transister radio buzz of this music;  given the times, the engineer must have dropped a few tabs before going to work.<br /><br />In 2009, there is no excuse for Emergancy to still sound so bad. There has got to be a way today's digital technology can fix this.<br /><br />If any music deserves it, this does.

B001UW58WW|4.0|Wunderkind David Garrett grew up in Aachen, Germany and studied violin under Ida Haendel and Itzhak Perlman before graduating from Juilliard in 2004. As a child prodigy, he was subjected to a grueling rehearsal schedule of classical repertoire (he injured his back and shoulders recording [[ASIN:B0000012Z7 Paganini: Caprices]] as a teen), but the freedom of NYC (including the huge music library at Juilliard and various clubs) opened up a new world of musical possibilities. David supplemented his income by modeling for print magazines like Vogue and Fashion Week for Armani while at Juilliard; his striking looks and broad crossover appeal have earned him the nickname \\"the David Beckham of classical music.\\" Garrett's response?  \\"He kind of drew a new audience to football, OK mostly female, but that's not a bad thing. I think that's why people actually say that because they know I really try very hard to get new audiences for classical music.\\"<br /><br />I first heard of David Garrett in a Barnes and Noble and was hooked. After watching numerous clips and interviews (both German and English) on YouTube, I was blown away by his utter confidence and poise. You can see at once that this is someone who truly loves music and his instrument (he plays both a 1717 Stradivarius and a 1772 Guadagnini, which he badly damaged after falling on it); just like growing up bilingually with a German father and American mother, he's equally at home as ambassador of classical and pop.<br /><br />\\"David Garrett\\" is actually David's fourth solo album for Decca after [[ASIN:B000NJWSE4 Free]], [[ASIN:B0010NX274 Virtuoso]], and Encore, and most of the tracks are pulled from these three albums (I would have liked to see the inclusion of \\"Claire de Lune\\" from Encore). The themes run the gamut from Baroque (Vivaldi's \\"Summer\\" from the Four Seasons, Bach's \\"Air\\") to Romantic (Bizet's \\"Carmen Fantasie\\"), a dash of Italian Gypsy, modern rock (Metallica, Queen, AC/DC, Michael Jackson), film scores (Zorba the Greek, Pirates of the Caribbean), and original works (\\"Chelsea Girl,\\" \\"Rock Prelude\\"). The album opens with a high-octane rendition of Vivaldi that might bring to mind Vanessa-Mae or perhaps the eccentric Nigel Kennedy, but David makes this all his own, and at breakneck speed.<br /><br />My favorites are the uptempo tracks, particularly the \\"He's a Pirate\\" theme from Pirates of the Caribbean. This Hans Zimmer gem is a cross between sweeping score reminiscent of the Chieftains' score for TNT's \\"Treasure Island\\" with the stately delicacy of a bourr&eacute;e. The xylophone echoes the violin, accented by triangle and harp. The intense \\"Smooth Criminal\\" opens with tympani mimicking a heartbeat...chilling and effective. David's aggressive bowing in the first part slides into a near-human wail as he duets with the electric guitar, then returns to the staccato melody. Queen and AC/DC are given similarly effective treatment. Bill Withers' \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" also translates well to the violin medium, buoyed by the assertive piano bassline. I loved the rollicking \\"Zorba's Dance\\" but was a little underwhelmed by \\"Dueling Strings\\" (I just can't distance the song from [[ASIN:B000RTB0R6 Deliverance (Deluxe Edition)]]).<br /><br />Overall, this is a fun, flashy album that showcases David's immense technical talent and will hopefully attract younger listeners to classical repertoire. Purists will likely not be impressed, but for casual listeners, this is a catchy album that does justice to familiar tunes (hey, if it gets today's youth interested in Bach and Vivaldi, that's a good thing).

B001KMB6VE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I was entertained from start to finish    The Vin Diesel persona works really well here. There's lots of action and intrigue with characters you can care about.    My only regret is that the movie could have been longer.    The Blu-ray picture and sound quality are top notch with vibrant colors, great contrast, and well balanced yet dynamic sound with consistently clear dialogue.
B00197POXG|1.0|I, too, was excited to see all the seasons in a compact package as opposed to videotapes. I've read other reviews and I agree about the poor packaging and manufacturing of the DVDs. the \\"leather\\" isn't leather and the cord to hold everything together wasn't glued on well. The pockets to hold the DVDs are attached to the box with springs that became stretched out easily (the design is similar to that of school one-subject notebooks) and quickly, and tear the paper binding. The DVDs themselves aren't easy to remove from the sleeves, and have a tendency to skip. the packaging became \\"ratty\\" so quickly I ended up buying a more \\"modern\\" DVD holder. I've also had trouble moving from one episode to the next. If I decide to stop an episode to watch another, frequently the DVD stops completely and starts again at the FBI warning. and while not hearing impaired, I was very disappointed that the set is not closed-captioned. I use closed-captioning frequently because dialogue isn't always clear.
1594488916|5.0|I'm in Allison Bartlett's non-fiction writers' group, N. 24th, so I have a special interest in this book, but that stated, it is a fascinating and nuanced portrait of a high-class thief and the arcane world of rare book collectors, which also explores the nature of why so many of us non-collectors love books so much -- just as books are so under siege. Bartlett is a compelling, engaging author who combines mystery, psychological insights and comic moments to illuminate this hidden world.
1439152756|4.0|A good friend recommended this book.  It was hard to read because it seemed so real.  I liked the way the author connected the time line using the questions Alice needed to remember to determine how much she was losing to Alzheimers.  Tear jerker at the end.  Amazing to read about the disease from the patient's point of view.

Issues: results not quantitative- as stated by others- you don't know how 'strong' your strengths are comparatively. Also, my husband wanted to take the test and the book only allows one user to take the test. We would have been willing to purchase another 'test' online but the only way someone else can take the test is to purchase another book- big waste of paper!

B0000A1WNY|5.0|This classic collaboration between Sinatra and Count Basie in Las Vegas is a definitive portrait of two consummate artist in an exciting \\"live\\" environment.  It captures the full gamut of the \\"swinging\\" Frank of the classic \\"Fly Me To the Moon\\" and \\"My Kind of Town\\" as well as the \\"poignant\\" Sinatra of \\"Angel Eyes\\" and \\"September of My Years.\\"  Basie and his orchestra are tight, swinging and dynamic, a joy to listen to.  Ok, some of the short patter may be a bit dated and insensitive, but the overall performance is one for the ages, with Sinatra being in excellent voice. My biggest regret is that I wasn't there. Oh, and the fact that this DVD is out of print and going for ripoff prices on the used market.  The recording engineers outdid themselves on this one, so if you can grab it at a decent price, go for it, you won't regret it! I use it as a showcase for my audio system.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I bought this mobile for my granddaughter.  She LOVES it, I LOVE it!  A variety of tunes, the mobile action, the ability of the baby to turn it on themselves, the little night light that glows while it plays -- if you want it to. I have one of those sleigh bed cribs and this fits just great!  The old mobile was cute, had to be wound up, would play for a couple of minutes, and would not fit on the crib.  I can't believe that anyone would be unhappy with this product.  Some thought it was too quiet, but the only one that is supposed to hear the thing is the baby and it is just the right volume for lulling to sleep.  Ok, one thing was not too great:  the remote that came with it has a problem with line-of-sight for the crib position in the room.  But, I have yet to even think of using the remote.  Buy it!
0634049011|5.0|I've been \\"playing\\" guitar for years, but never bothered to learn scales or musical theory.  The exercises were very helpful and allowed me to visualize concepts that had evaded me all this time.  I recommend this as a pair with Music Theory Workbook for Guitar Volume 1.  This one contains less exercises, but explains concepts a lot better.  I'd suggest starting out with this one and moving on to the more detailed exercises in that book.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|When this film was released in 1999 it did not get the press it deserved and I never saw it until I it aired on HBO.  After the first viewing, I was hooked on the film.  I have always thought Depp was an excellent actor and he plays an almost likable but undoubtedly dark character than has clearly adopted the \\"me above all others\\" way of thinking.  He is hired by Frank Langella who plays a very dark, Devil worshiping book collector with a hidden agenda, lyrically named Boris Balkan. Throughout the film, Depp is visited and aided by Emmanuelle Seigner (who to this day I have never seen in anything else in spite of a long European filmography)but one of the mysteries of the film is that you never know who this girl is.  An agent of the Devil, the Devil itself or a dark angel?  As usual, Lena Olin plays a forgettable character and is probably the weakest part of the film.  Even though Langella's portrayal of the evil book collector goes a little over the top toward the end, the film and the interactions between Depp and the other possessors of this rare book are not to be missed.  I am looking forward to the blu-ray release.
1591391105|1.0|I purchased this book for my spouse as an audio download from Audible.com. I can say nothing about contents of the book, but the experience with Audible was terrible.     Cumulative Time = 0     As a tech-savvy individual, I found the experience with Audible frustating, time-consuming and in the end, a waste. I downloaded the audible software plug-in to work with iTunes. I then followed their instructions to get the audio book onto my PC via iTunes. After burning the file to CD - it required 5 CDs - I tested them on two CD players, including the one from which it was being burnt. CDs 1, 2 & 5 burned without a hitch, but CDs 3 and 4 only partially burned onto the CD. Note, this effort on a 24X CDROM took nearly 2 hours. Assuming there was some error between the chair and keyboard, I tried to burn it a 2nd time. iTunes informed me that Audible is only a 1x burn onto CD. What?? That was not stated anywhere on their website when I purchased it.     Cumulative Time = 2.00 hours    After digging around Audible's FAQS listing, about half way down, they mention only a single burn to CD is possible. If problems occur during CD burn to call their 800 number. After being on hold for 38 minutes, I was connected to a rep, who was very polite and helpful, he reset my Audible file BY HAVING TO SHARE MY PC CONTROL TO HIM. Yes, I had to download an Audible software link to my PC so he could MANUALLY REMOVE THE FILES REMOTELY AND THEN RE-DOWNLOAD THEM. In essence, I had to trust the rep not to do anything nefarious to my PC. Thank God for honest tech people.    Cumulative Time = 3 hours, 10 minutes    Reburned all 5 CDs again. CDs 3 and 4 showed same problem. I can assuredly say that since CDs 1, 2 and 5 worked perfectly after the first try and the second try that the problem was in the Audible download or its association with iTunes.    Cumulative Time = 5 hours, 10 minutes    Got to toss out 4 CDROMS (2x CDs #3 and #4) at $1 a piece. Went back online and bought audio CDs from Amazon directly that cost $3 more than my originally purchase from Audible.    Cumulative Time = 5 hours, 13 minutes    In other words, spending 3 more bucks for Amazon to ship me the CDs directly, disregarding the shipping time, took only 3 minutes total. In comparison, my Audible purchase ended up with 5 hours and 10 minutes of wasted time that did not get me the product I purchased. Avoid Audible.
B00288KNJU|3.0|When I purchased this Blu-ray I did extensive searches on review trying to figure out what type of glasses they used for the movie and nobody talked about them. When you look at the outside of the case they show cardboard glasses with what looks like they grey style lenses you get at the movie theater. So I was interested to see if our glasses we kept from the theater would work. Upon getting the movie last night and opening the case i was very disappointed to see that they were using green and pink lenses instead of the grey lenses they showed on the cover. We watched the first 10 minutes of the movie because they said they it could take up to 5 minutes to get use to watching the movie with the glasses. As soon as the movie starts Coraline looked like her hair was green for the whole time we watched in 3D even though when i took of my glasses i could see that her hair was blue. When we switched to the 2D version and got through the opening credits we noticed that they were showing a whole different scene then where the 3D version starts. In the 3D version it starts with Coraline looking out the window at the rain and getting a package from Wybie. But in the 2D version you see them unpack the truck and Coraline go up the hill to the hidden well where she meets Wybie for the first time.    I give the Blu-ray a 3 star rating only because the 3D was so bad and they left out a very important part of the movie in the beginning. Other then that the 2D version gets a 5 from me. I loved the story line.

0312330537|4.0|A rich and robust giant of a story, the kind you search for and rarely find, enthralling and a can't-put-down.  I read it slower and slower, dreading the time this would come to an end.    This book deals with an escaped Australian criminal's arrival and life in Bombay, how he survived, the fascinating characters he met, the lessons he learned about honor among thieves, and the steaming underbelly of Bombaby's slums, the dwellers therein and the rich lives lived in the dire poverty of the denizens of the underworld.  The writer hs the rare gift of bringing the reader into the life he describes, and what a life it is - criminal, generous, unforgiving, honorable, veined throughout with heartfulness, the nature of love, encounters with evil snd betrayal and how such things are dealt with in the culture.  He at first  lives in the vilest slum and finds himself, a white man, looked upon with surprise and then acceptance as he labors with others to heal himself and the other dwellers, learning from wise men of all stripes and professions, funny, heartbreaking,  constantly being tested by his life and circumstances.  A wonderful read and an experience that will stay with me for a long time, full of wisdom and suffering and transcendant joys, unsparing descriptions of every possible experience - a natural and remarkably gifted writer who wastes no words and uses those words he has chosen to paint a picture that will stay with the reader  long while after he has come to the final words.
6305922756|5.0|This was at the beginning of the hair metal scene.  However, this film relates the rock band with the normal ordinary person.  The full DVD is what really does, and I'm talking about the special features.  Deleted scenes, fictional character commentary, and a new interview with the fictional characters.  The idea the commentary expresses mainly is that the film showed ninety minutes of mess-ups out of hours and hours of footage.  There are also a lot of funny bits in the commentary, and there are a lot of funny features.  However, the best part of it is definitely the movie itself.  Every musician has at least one embarrassing moment on stage.  Mine was I plugged my guitar in and started rocking out, but I couldn't hear any sound, and suddenly I realized, the amp was on standby.  That's just one moment for me, but technical difficulties with the visual, a blunder in mapping out a set design, getting lost on the way to a stage, and several other moments are what make this film such a classic.  This was also probably the first time when anyone publicly expressed to such a large audience the idea of turning the volume up to eleven.  What makes this even better is that when the film first came out, people believed that this was an actual documentary.

B000001FDQ|5.0|There was someone who commented on how lame a singer David Lee Roth was and commented on how Dave got \\"the most emotionally blank guitarist next to Yngwie Malmsteen.\\"  With discussions with this guy, it feels like he hates almost every instrumental guitarist with technical skills, except for Eric Johnson, claiming that they don't have any soul.  I feel that several people, including this guy, can't get past the fact that these artists put more technical aspects into their music than many people are used to.  However, these musicians do have soul.  Another guy that I know comments on how much he likes odd time signatures, high speed, and modal scales, but he never really acknowledges any emotional aspects of music.  When I was hanging out with these two guys, I tried to show that Yngwie Malmsteen does have emotion to the first guy I mentioned, the second guy said something like \\"check this out.\\"<br /><br />Yngwie Malmsteen is a great composer and guitarist, his music really makes me feel like I'm visiting an old castle, especially \\"Icarus Dream Op. 4.\\"  The beginning of \\"Black Star\\" is beautiful, but the rest of that track is somewhat boring.  After \\"Black Star\\" the album is a mix of beautiful and lyrical guitar playing with exciting shredding.  Most people only see the exciting shredding part of it, and half of them say that the exciting shredding aspect is showing off skills without expressing emotion, but when you're in that situation where you can't think, you can't breathe, everything is just coming at you, how can you express that idea musically?  I would say that speed would be the way to do it.  In my personal opinion, Yngwie is nowhere near as good as Steve Vai, but he's also a very different guitarist.  The other problem that people have with Yngwie is that everything he does sounds pretty much the same.  At least it works.  One of the main things I like about Yngwie Malmsteen is that he has this beautiful sound from his playing.  Although usually lacking variety, Yngwie is great, and this is probably Yngwie at his best.  It includes most of the tunes that he's known for.Yngwie is great, and this is probably Yngwie at his best.  It includes most of the tunes that he's known for.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I saw this series when it first was presented on television and enjoyed it very much.  I decided I wanted to see it again and spent the $40 bucks for the privelege.  It is well worth it.  It seemed more objective than other films about World War II, notably Victory at Sea which strikes me as jingoistic wartime propaganda, even though it didn't come out until after the war.  A couple of segments of World at War struck me as curious.  In the segment about the Battle of the Bulge, there was no mention of the heroic holdout at Bastogne.  There was also no mention of the Remagen Bridge crossing in the presentation about the Rhine crossing.  The British Black Watch division or regiment or whatever, was given credit for the first crossing of the Rhine.  Is that a British bias?  I am watching for that as I proceed through the rest of the series.
B0000026DJ|3.0|\\"Diesel and Dust\\" is an enjoyable album but it comes across as a collection of B-Sides when compared to \\"Blue Sky Mining.\\" The song-writing, lyrics and atmosphere of Blue Sky are a step above Diesel. In fact, in comparing the two albums, a song-by song comparison arose in my mind. I won't bore the reader by going track-by track, but just as an example, Blue Sky Mining is a much better opener than Beds are Burning. Never liked that song much. Antarctica is a MUCH better song than Arcticworld. Forgotten Years is better than, well, just about anything on Diesel. I even love Mountains of Burma. Perhaps some individuals have put the hype for Diesel into overdrive? Blue Sky gets the 5 stars over Diesel.
B001DHE9KG|3.0|I didn't think this was a bad prouduction and it had some solid points like Plishka's Alcindoro and Benoit, Zeffirelli's awesome direction, and a great Marcello and Schaunard. Vargas and Gheorghiu turn in solid performances but they are nowhere near the caliber they were in Traviata. Both seem not to be able to take their pieces at a proper tempi, they make Von Karajan's seem fast by comparison. This is not the conductor's fault as the rest of the opera plays well.     I found the extra features interesting, but distracting from the opera. Sure I've seen and heard Bohème a few times but I still want to see the performance as is and get into the story and music. Save the backstage stuff for the special features. Add to this the fact that Renee Fleming does more acting while interviewing cast and crew members during the performance than any opera I've seen or heard her in and you just have a big, jumbled, thing that is almost good on your hands. With the truckload of other La Bohème recordings and DVD's out there(a lot of them great) you should be alright without this.
B0029NY9YO|3.0|Hard to Watch the Watchmen!<br /><br />Already I was scared -- an alternate America where Nixon is going on to a third term?  Every baby boomer's nightmare.  However, the old rock, Pete Seeger and Paul Simon songs lulled me into a \\"oh boy\\" factor -- and in a lot of ways it was \\"oh boy.\\"<br /><br />The fight scenes were nicely choreographed.  Silk Spectre II and the Night Owl made a great team.<br /><br />Did I care for the Comedian or that he was murdered early in the film?  Nope.  A very anti-hero's hero.  Whatever heroism he had in the Forties was lost on me.  Beating up and raping, shooting a pregnant woman, -- in fact, women were handled fairly badly throughout the film purely for shock value.  What was Alan Moore thinking?<br /><br />There's a difference between breaking the mold in comic book or filming and then there's just plain porn.  Porn in the sense of  blood and guts and gore and Moore's almost misogynous writing as well as  the broken bones cutting through flesh, chopping off limbs with a saw, and buckets of blood -- a lot of the violence a bit too much.<br /><br />A film not for the squeamish.<br /><br />Zack Snyder's 300 was quite the tour de force -- the ancients were as bad and as bloody as they came complete with \\"madness.\\"<br /><br />Watchmen was uneven.  I was thrilled ,repulsed and excited and depressed all at once.<br /><br />Almost like an X-rated \\"the Incredibles\\"; heroes being banned (becoming and old hat plot) and then coming back -- except in The Incredibles the heroes won.

B000002UAF|5.0|Beatlemania, 1964.<br /><br />Screaming fans, worried parents, collarless suits and mop tops. From our perspective, forty five years later, the whole thing seems remote, unfathomable and scarcely believable.<br /><br />If you really want to understand what the whole Beatles fuss was all about, you could do much worse than get \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".<br /><br />For in its own pure, joyous way, this is the record that sums them up. Well before the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and not so long after their days at the seedy Hamburg Star Club, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" remains a vibrant, intriguing and innovative work.<br /><br />\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was the first and only Beatles record comprised of all Lennon/McCartney originals - 13 of them in fact. Several appeared in the film of the same name, and the undiminished quality of the rest, including \\"You Can't Do That\\", \\"Anytime At All\\" and \\"I'll Be Back\\" only enhances the record's appeal.<br /><br />And from that first, famous ringing guitar chord on the title track, it delivers throughout. The early Beatles blueprint, laid down in their first two albums, reaches its most satisfying and rounded incarnation right here. From rockers to ballads, from complex three point vocal harmonies to George Harrison's brand new twelve string Rickenbacker electric guitar (which prompted Roger McGuinn to get himself one and start The Byrds), this is a beautifully realised record.<br /><br />It's the best example of John Lennon and Paul McCartney's work as a songwriting team, as well. On \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", many of the songs are genuine co-compositions - you can hear it as they swap lead vocals and harmonise throughout. After this, they would increasingly write their songs separately. Their later personas of cynical rocker and romantic balladeer respectively aren't readily apparent here either - Lennon sings the prettiest song on the record (\\"If I Fell\\"), while McCartney's responsible for \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", for a start.<br /><br />George Harrison's contribution is largely limited to his tasteful lead playing and harmonies, although he does get a chance at the mike on \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\", while the eternally underrated Ringo Starr drives the band on drums and percussion.<br /><br />\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" crystallises all that was great about The Beatles in their early days - punchy, innovative, literate songwriting, flawless harmonies and an underlying cheery swagger born of their shared love of rock and roll. A masterpiece in its own modest way, I can't think of a better record to introduce anyone to this group.playing and harmonies, although he does get a chance at the mike on \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You\\", while the eternally underrated Ringo Starr drives the band on drums and percussion.    \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" crystallises all that was great about The Beatles in their early days - punchy, innovative, literate songwriting, flawless harmonies and an underlying cheery swagger born of their shared love of rock and roll.

B0000067L2|4.0|\\"Disraeli Gears\\" was featured on the tv series \\"Classic albums\\". Whilst I can't exactly see why this constitutes a 'classic' album, I did enjoy it a whole lot more than their debut, which I gave 3 stars and 65/100 too. Their debut, \\"Fresh cream\\", which I reviewed here, also features on many lists on the greatest albums of all time...Australian Rolling Stone and American Rolling Stone lists, for starters. For me, this is a reasonably good album, but it is only with their third, and final regular studio album, \\"Wheels of fire\\", that Cream make an album worthy of the label \\"classic\\".       That being said...       The two songs that I consider to be the best on this album are:    Sunshine of your love - a bluesy rock song with an instantly identificable introduction. Good riff, drum pattern and noticeable bass. Has the lyric \\"give you my dawn surprise\\", which, if sung by Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant, would be thought really cool, but if sung by AC/DC's Bon Scott, would be thought sleazy.    Tales of brave Ulysses - seems to presage their later song \\"White room\\". Has fantasy/poetic type lyrics. Noticeable bass and I like the tone of the drum and its pattern. Has a \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" type guitar solo.        The rest:    Strange brew - bluesy rock with distorted rock guitars (rhythm and lead guitars). The singer has a high voice in the album opener and the bass in noticeable.    World of pain - laidback, soulful song. Has some breathy, high pitched vocals. Bass, and a nice drum tone feature as well.     Dance the night away - another laidback, soulful sounding song. Similar to the previous song, in any case.    Blue condition - laidback track, with a classic blues riff. Has a drunken melody and the vocals have a sort of carnival/novelty record type vibe (Monty Python style). Piano features.    Swlabr - the intro features bluesy hard rock, with some soulful and bluesy lead guitar. The guitars remind me of the kind of buzzy guitar sound Led Zeppelin make (I'm assuming that Led Zeppelin create that sound with guitars).    We're going wrong - high pitched vocals, bass, with a repeated, complex drum pattern. The guitar strums a simple pattern.    Outside woman blues - a funky blues track, in a Beatle-esque way. Harder drumming here. Bass and a bluesy lead guitar. Not sure, but I think that the singer may get the lyrics wrong one time, re the order of \\"food/dirt\\".    Take it back - the intro reminded me of The Red Hot Chili Pepper's classic intro to \\"Around the world\\". A jaunty blues song with harmonica.     Mother's lament - has a self-conscious intro, with dual lead vocals which aren't synchronised. Piano features, and one of the singers seemed to have a New Zealand type accent in this song! There is an ethereal echo in this song too...but I suppose the song mainly comes across as a novelty song.    Recommendations from this period in music history:    Cream: Wheels of fire    The Jimmi Hendrix Experience: \\"Are you experienced?\\", \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"Axis: Bold as love\\".
B001FB55H6|3.0|I'll echo what a lot of people are saying.  The film was too long.  It would have served them better to break out the story into 2 or 3 films.  By the end I was just hanging on by a thread.  Only sticking around because I already invested over 2.5 hours of my time.  The script/acting simply were not strong enough to support over 3 hours of film.  More often then not I was bored.    I was also put off by how they decided to present Nixon physically.  They really couldn't find an actor that actually looks like Nixon, or close enough to sell on film?  They had to put some poor guy in makeup?    Soundtrack was great.

B00122IYJY|4.0|Some great music was produced around this time, and this Southern California band was absolutely one of them. For those who were not around in '78, this album appeared with such popularity because of the lead guitarist's unusual riffs on some songs. However, the lead guitarist's talent did not eclipse the talent of his band members. The others were equally talented and equally made the sound very big.<br /><br />At the time, it was an album whose sound was very big, heavy, and rebellious. It made many get up and dance.<br /><br />Not all songs are originals.<br /><br />I don't recall who worked the sound and produced the album, but they certainly deserve a lot of credit. It's real bright, solid, and well mixed. The production is very well done.<br /><br />The lead singer was exceptional for this genre.
B000002OPN|4.0|This album didn't impress me much as their debut album, which I also reviewed here. In a sense, it sort of reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Houses of the holy\\" album, in that is alright, but it may have the potential to grow on you more in future.        On my first listen, the one song which I put a dot next to in my notes (signifying that I find a song interesting in some way...a tick means I really like it) was:    You got me floatin' - features some experimental sounds which are generated in a studio.  It has a modern rock sound and I liked the cool sound and playing of the bass guitar. This song makes me think that Lenny Kravitz may have been influence by this kind of material. The song also has backing vocals. Eric Clapton's song which features the lyric \\"tearing us apart\\" was also brought to mind listening to this song.       On second listen, some more songs got dots next to them in my notes...chronologically:    Spanish castle magic - has a heavy metal/hard rock kind of sound to it. The drum sound is chunky and I like the catchy vocal melody. Bass noticeable.    Wait until tomorrow - the bass is in your face, so to speak. The vocals are of the sing-song variety, and the lead guitar is 'chatty', if you know what I mean. The guitar sound was sort of familiar to me, though I can't pinpoint what other songs it reminded me of. American born Australian \\"Diesel\\" has a song called \\"Cry in shame\\" which this song made me think of. The drums are chunky on this song too and I like the cute falsetto backing vocals on this song.    Little wing - easy going song with nice lead guitar. I like the tone of the guitar as well. Sounds like glass objects are used for percussion too.       Next best songs:    Castle's made of sand - reliant on studio effects, features a guitar playing a melody in reverse (having recently started listening to Hendrix, I'm beginning to wonder if he beat The Beatles into innovating in the studio). Vocals are catchy and the lyrics are chatty. Leadguitar and bass guitar also play a part in this track. At 2:32 into this track, I hear a click, which may be a problem with the source tapes.    She's so fine - more chunky drums and in your face bass. Features falsetto backing vocals, and the main vocals are catchy, in a Beatle-esque kind of way (I don't think that Hendrix sings in this song). The outro features distorted hard rock guitar playing.       The rest:    Exp - an experimental sounding track with heavy, distorted guitar sounds...it sounds like they are imagining what a U.F.O would sound like! Also features an radio announcer with an Australian sounding accent. This year, I think, a British movie called \\"The boat that rocked\\" covered this time frame in music history. A criticism that I had come across here in Australia was that the movie didn't really reflect the number of Australian voices on pirate radio...there is one New Zealand actor in the movie. Just guessing, but maybe this Australian sounding voice is recognition of the fact that such voices were common in Britain on the radio, at this time.    Up from the skies - features brush drumming. A rootsy, bassy track with a twangy sounding guitar and sing-song mellow vocals. Reminded me of The John Butler Trio in style. John Butler is an American born Australian roots artist. Great song in \\"Zebra\\"...anyway...    If 6 was 9 - the guitar and bass intro part reminded me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Living loving maid\\". You can hear Jimi chewing gum in this song, which is sort of cool! The middle part of this track has some intense drumming and the mood as a whole can be described as 'moody, bluesy rock'. But it does seem psychedelic at times, too. Song features a solo too, and I found the stereo quality in this song to be excellent, which I don't usually associate with music from this period, which often sounded 'faux' stereo, if you know what I mean.    One rainy wish - has a velvety guitar tone, mellow in parts, but rock at other times (quiet, loud, quiet format). Features wailing lead guitar and noticeable bass.      Little miss lover - I like the drum pattern at the start, as the track goes into a funky bass and lead guitar groove...a bit Red Hot Chili Peppery, in other words. Has a driving bass guitar sound. At 1:46 there seems to be a glitch in the vocals, which may suggest that the master tapes aren't perfect.    Bold as love - another song which reminds me of Diesel's \\"Cry in shame\\". Think that the outro may have a harpsichord in it, and the drumming gets quite spacey.    Generally I like the textured sound of the instruments in this album...from the crisp drums to the tone of the guitars and back to some chunky drumming. For the first time, I think I can hear the influence of Hendrix in Australian acts like Diesel, John Butler, and overseas acts like Lenny Kravitz.    Like I said before, the music on this album does sound modern, but with a moody, bluesy, experimental rock bent.    This album might be a grower for me.    Recommended albums from this period in time:    The Jimmi Hendrix Experience: \\"Are you experienced?\\" and \\"Electric Ladyland\\".    Cream: Wheels of fire.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|After reading about this gadget from a number of reliable sources, I went ahead and gambled the 40 ducats on it and couldn't be happier. The first time I popped this little doohicky into my Ibanez RG, plugged in the phones, maxed the gain and slowly raised the volume I was nearly slammed into the wall by forcefield of metal madness. I attacked the Phrygian scale then glided into my favorite riffs. Power chords: BANG! Who knew you could get such big amp sound out of this tiny plastic box?    Substitute a plain old minijack cable between the phones jack and anything with speakers and you have an improvised amp with sound as big as the remote speakers allow.    It also has a minijack auxiliary input so you can jam along to your iPod or PC output in virtually total silence. No more annoying neighbors banging on your walls when you get the urge to shred at 2:00 a.m.    It would be nice if there was some reverb on the device, but metal holds up well with big gain so I'm not complaining. The device also has a tendency to swing around while you play -- if you are a highly mobile shredder this might annoy you (but can easily be fixed with a bit of gaffers tape).    If you're on a budget or just want to jam loudly in peace, you could do much worse than this. Throw one in a gig bag with a set of decent phones (and an iPod if you want) and you may as well be carrying a pocket sized amp with you. Note also that this was designed for METAL -- it's all about the gain. If you are looking for something bluesy or some other wimpy sound, consider the other amPlugs.
0670020478|4.0|The Element is what Robinson identifies as the point where a talent meets personal passion. The book offers a wide range of stories about the creative journeys of different people with diverse paths to the element; including Paul McCartney, Paulo Coelho, and Vidal Sassoon as well as lesser-known examples. Robinson demonstrates a vision of human ability and creativity. The Element covers such topics as the power of creativity, circles of influence, and attitude and aptitude. Robinson emphasizes the importance of nurturing talent along with developing an understanding of how talent expresses itself differently in every individual. The book highlights the importance of mentors and reforming and transforming education, making a convincing argument bolstered by solid strategies for honing creativity.<br /><br />The Element is a great read. The book covers a great topic for anyone who is getting bored with their job. Robinson mainly discusses how good it is when you find your Element but lacks information on how to discover your own Element. I assume this is because everyone has different passions and they discover them in different ways.
031606792X|3.0|I must say that Breaking Dawn was a big disappointment for me!  Over the course of the first 3 books, Stephenie Meyer really did a fantastic job of building up the suspense for the events that we all hoped would take place in Breaking Dawn.  Bella and Edward's wedding, Bella becoming a vampire, the \\"confrontation\\" with the Volturi.....  all the things that we knew would happen and waited for eagerly, but for what?  It's almost like Stephenie just rushed through the book to try and wrap up the story quickly.  I'm not saying that I hate the book, but it is clearly nothing like the first three.  And the whole Jacob / Renesmee thing is just freaky!  I hope and pray that this is not the end, although I did hear that Stephenie said that there would not be any more books (besides Midnight Sun, IF she finishes it), but she simply cannot DO this to her fans!  She could easily have kept the story going for ten more books if she wanted to.  I'm not sure why Breaking Dawn went the way that it did.  I know that alot of people said that BD ruined the whole Twilight Saga for them; I disagree with that, I just wish Stephenie would have been a little more creative!  I don't think she did alot of the characters justice in this book either.  All of the characters that we grew to love were kind of just thrust into the background, because everything was centered around Renesmee!  FRUSTRATING!!  Overall, this book wasn't HORRIBLE.... but it wasn't fantastic either.  Twilight captivated me, New Moon made me emotional, Eclipse left me yearning for more.... and Breaking Dawn kind of left all of that to just fizzle out.  Let's hope that Stephenie can redeem herself with the next book!
0385337388|5.0|This is a great book, especially for medical students and interns.  People who are not in Medicine might not understand the book as well as those of us who are.  Shem is a first time writer, and you can tell it through some of his prose.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is in medical school.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I just bought my BSG complete series and rewatched from the begining (am currently on season 2) wow! what an incredible show!. The packaging is simply lovely, no problems with the box to report.  Everything about this show stands out: the production, the acting, the direction, etc., so much so that it's style has influenced a great many television shows and films right now.  The music is also lush and beautiful unlike any other I have EVER heard for any other television show or film for that matter. Favorite characters have to be Boomer/Athena(played by Grace Park and Helo(played by Tahmoh Penikett)...their journey together is probably the most inspiring. All of the actors are wonderful the best ensemble cast ever!...shame on you Emmy!. My hat is off to the entire cast and crew, thank you for the best television show ever made.
6304712936|4.0|Amadeus: 7 out of 10: Amadeus is a brilliantly filmed fictional account of the rivalry between Antonio Salieri (Well-deserved Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance).      The costumes and settings are spot on, as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. This is truly one place independent film does not hold a candle to Hollywood. With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife, the supporting cast is excellent; paramount is Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the second like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.      The plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart, not himself; this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered.      Besides Berridge's performance, there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of Mozart's work. It is a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his fifth and ninth symphonies.      The movie is also bit long and drags a bit in the middle. One scene lampshades this; during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. Considering Amadeus runs 2 hours 40 minutes, it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from me.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|This is easily the best album I have ever purchased. It is my favorite album of all time, and I have listened to a lot of music in my day. I'll let the music do the rest of the talking. Fancy words can't describe this masterpiece.
B00004TX5F|5.0|This film left me cold when I first saw it; I almost think I was watching a different film. But recently I've revisited it and its excerpts on YouTube, and I have been completely captivated by the story and music. And although this \\"biography\\" is reportedly more fiction than fact, it is still too lush, fascinating, tragic, and beautiful to be overlooked. (Music of the Baroque Era is my favorite genre, Handel my favorite composer; I'm certainly biased in favor of both.)<br /><br />Here's my suggestion: If you watch this movie, be sure to find the lyrics at least to \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" and to follow them during that sequence. Better yet, stock up with all the lyrics; they're easy to find on the Web. Just search for the arias' titles.<br /><br />Here's why: For viewers like me who speak only one language, the subtitles on the DVD of this film don't include the lyrics to the music. Without the lyrics, you can't fully appreciate the richness of the story: the relationship between the brothers Carlo (the younger, stage name Farinelli) and Riccardo Broschi (the older); the tormented position of the castrato in society (loved, lauded, exploited, denied, and reviled); and of the era itself.<br /><br />These conflicts are particularly revealed in the \\"Lascia ch'io pianga\\" sequence. In that aria, the imprisoned hero of the opera (sung by Farinelli) mourns the loss of his freedom, while the intertwined flashbacks reveal how he really became a castrato. Carlo/Farinelli has always been told his castration was the result of a tragic accident. We learn in the preceding sequence and we see in the flashbacks that Farinelli's (Carlo's) own brother had him castrated while the child Carlo was drugged, to ensure that Carlo's splendid voice would endure to grace Riccardo's own music -- music unworthy of the sacrifice. But the betrayal that stole Carlo's freedom to choose his fate preserved his art. How can Carlo reconcile himself to such betrayal and loss -- and yet gain?
0375842209|5.0|From the moment I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  I had never heard of it before.  I read the first page, and that was it.  I was hooked.  The pages seem to flow like lava.  Dark, poetic, beautiful, sad, happy.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  There were pages that i just kept reading over and over because they were written so beautifully.    I loved the way he developed all of the characters, and the way he describes the landscape of the town they live in.  There were many times I could completely see this town, and the kids playing, as I read the book.  I was transported there, even though it was a horrible place to be. When you are looking at things through children's eyes, and playing, not aware of what may happen next, those rose colored glasses are sometimes needed to live a normal life.    There was a lot of German in the book, which made me feel at home.  My parents spoke it to each other, yet I never understood.  And still, I didn't understand, but i actually heard the accents as I read it, and it made me think of my parents talking in the kitchen.  I also enjoyed the way he allowed us to completely understand what they were saying, without always telling us verbatim what the words meant.  Aside from my other favorite book, The Glass Castle, this is my favorite book EVER.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|I bought this contemplation because I could get a large variety of Michael Jackson songs.  The set does provide that. The songs are mainly a greatest hits collection and contain most of best songs.  I really enjoy many of them especially near the Thriller years.  It also contains some songs that aren't as great as the others from the disco era and early 90s.  The album provides a great wide ranging of tunes and I like owning them.  Michael may be dead now but his music can be appreciated further.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is spectacular. It is better than ALL of those crappy sitcoms that play on network TV. If you want to stop watching crap like \\"Lguna Beach\\" or \\"The Hills,\\" then try Dexter on for size.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I got this CD at the same time as I got Shinedown's Sound of Madness and I have to say that Nickelback really let me down this time. All the tracks sound overly commercialized and much less authentic than their previous work. It sounds like they put something out in a hurry just to make some money. Anyway, the only good tracks on the album are the two popular ones \\"Gotta be somebody\\" (my favorite) and \\"If today was your last day\\" (pretty good). S.E.X is probably the worst rock number I have ever heard in my life - it completely lacks any rhythm, thought or musicality. What a disappointment. And I usually love their raunchy numbers! Anyway, get this album only if you're a die-hard fan and just want to add it to your collection.
B000YENUI6|4.0|David Cronenberg's career has been one of the most unusual among prominent directors. After a decade of making highly novel and intellectual horror films Cronenberg flirted with the mainstream in \\"The Fly\\" and \\"Dead Ringers\\" before retreating into a bizarre third phase marked by adaptations of seemingly unfilmable material in the forms of \\"Naked Lunch\\" and \\"Crash.\\" With \\"A History of Violence\\" Cronenberg opened the fourth phase of his career and took one more stab at a conventional narrative. Of course, \\"A History of Violence\\" is a far more unusual thriller than it may initially appear, and the same can be said of his follow up \\"Eastern Promises.\\" Eastern Promises\\" is ultimately not as striking or as distinct as the aforementioned film, but it provides further evidence that the controlled, idea-oriented Cronenberg can (with assistance from screenwriter Knight) craft a more human drama, and can still place a distinct stamp on a convention-dominated genre.<br /><br />\\"Eastern Promises\\" explores Russian-run organized crime in modern day London, opening when a young prostitute Tatiana (Sarah Jeanne Labrosse) dies during childbirth, and her nurse Anna (Naomi Watts), a second generation Anglo-Russian, discovers Tatiana's tragedy-filled diary. Anna takes it upon herself to place the child with the girl's relatives, and her investigations lead her to Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), a seemingly helpful elderly Russian man who is soon revealed to be a powerful mobster with good reason to hide Tatiana's story. Simultaneously we glimpse into the core of the mafia while following the day-to-day lives of Kirill (Vincent Cassel), Semyon's haughty, self-absorbed son who constantly causes trouble and the cool, detached Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), Kirill's friend and an up and coming \\"driver\\" within Semyon's organization. Nikolai soon notices Anna's investigations and, after first trying to warn her away, becomes personally involved, even at the risk to his place in the organization.<br /><br />Though that synopsis suggests a crime/thriller film, \\"Eastern Promises\\" is substantially more staid than that, playing more as a straight drama set in the mafia's world. Though punctuated by moments of striking violence, the film is more obsessed with character and sorrowful mood, and Cronenberg cuts down on his an ace visuals to create a wintry London locale that is a flat, desolate place, wholly appropriate to the somber nature of the narrative. Moreover, \\"Eastern Promises\\" takes a more classically-styled approach to character than most recent mafia pics. While modern cinematic mobsters are typically mundane, bestial or neurotic, the brass of the Russian mafia here display a sort of self-regarding, aristocratic air even as they commit the basest crimes. The film's greatest strength is in the depth of the characters, most of whom initially appear to be standard types, but who grow to be more sophisticated as the film progresses. Particularly notable is Kirill, who is so tiresome and whiny at first, but who finally displays a surprising humanity, especially compared to his cold, business-like compatriots. (Cassel has long specialized in playing self-absorbed French punks, and he makes the transition to self-absorbed, Russian punk effortlessly.)<br /><br />Watts and Mortensen make up the heart of the film. Though Watts's Anna is somewhat thinly written, she is the film's line to the real world, the shocked innocent who finds that a dark, unseen underworld surrounds us all. Conversely, Mortensen's mysterious Nikolai may seem to be nothing more than the mobster with a heart of gold, but his commanding presence dominates the film. Some are dissatisfied with his accent, but I fear that Russian accents are naturally goofy, and Mortensen's pure physical presence, with his dark glasses and slicked hair, generates cool aloofness. He is, however, a deeply sympathetic character who takes great personal risk for no personal benefit. In short, Nikolai displays the mix of detachment and self-control underlined by altruism/honor that marks so many classic heroes.<br /><br />If \\"Eastern Promises\\" has a weakness, it is the thinness of the story. Even though Tatiana's story has wide-ranging impact on the mafia, by the film's end it still feels as if we've barely scratched the surface. The later acts are highly compelling, especially Nikolai's deservedly famous, audacious naked brawl in a public bathhouse, but the viewer can't help but feel that there is more to be uncovered. (Of course, this weakness is arguably a testament to the film's effect as well, as few movies seem to demand that they be longer and more elaborate, but the slight let down exists nevertheless.)<br /><br />Still, that minor caveat aside, this is a distinctive, if not utterly unique, film and among Cronenberg's finest. He is known for his transformations, but I hope Cronenberg sticks with this approach for a little bit longer, as quality crime pics are in short supply, and he has the track record to bolster those standards quite a bit. Check it out.<br /><br />Grade: B+ontrol underlined by altruism/honor that marks so many classic heroes.    If \\"Eastern Promises\\" has a weakness, it is the thinness of the story.

B001DHXT2A|5.0|Excellent movie, this is how the hulk should have been made.  This one follows the hulk the way we all know and remember.  there is also some good cameo footage I liked. A deffinite must see.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Loved pretty much every song on the album. There's something for everyone in here from the fast-paced Devour to the slower sound of Call Me. My favorite track is Sound of Madness... LOVE the lyrics! The entire record completely exceeded my expectations.
0307460444|5.0|\\"Martha Stewart's Cupcakes\\" is a great buy.    Beautifully styled, like all Martha's books, it's also very practical with excellent instructions, lots of helpful tips & wonderful decorating ideas covering every occasion you could imagine.    I found the decorating ideas inspiring, & easy to carry out in the home kitchen. The instructions were clear & detailed without being overwhelming. The choices in frosting recipes had me dithering over which one to try next. The buttercream recipe is the nicest one I've ever made.    The cupcakes I've made so far are the Boston Cream Pie Cupcakes, the Ladybug Cupcakes & the Nesting Bluebird Cupcakes. The recipe for red velvet cupcakes is delicious, & I was interested to see a flourless chocolate recipe which will be very handy for gluten intolerant cupcake lovers. The cupcakes were all moist & delicious when baked.    I was able to make the recipes without altering the sugar content (in Australia, we use much less sugar in baking than is used in most American recipes) which was a nice surprise.    This really is the ultimate cupcake recipe book. It is well worth buying for anybody that enjoys baking.
