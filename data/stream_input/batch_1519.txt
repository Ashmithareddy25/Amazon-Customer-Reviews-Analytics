The whole album Is pure steel and power hail from Kansas USA
B0046EZSW6|4.0|This incredible account, told with frank detachment, is hailed as the best World War II memoir of an enlisted man, and with good reason. Part adventure, part history, \\"Sledgehammer\\" not only relates many of the clich&eacute;s every Hollywood movie depicted on the subject, but also everything they left out.
034580404X|5.0|I read all three books in less than a week. I feel in love with Christian and Ana and could not put these books down. I was sad when I finished the series and I would recommend that people read it for themselves to form their own opinions. I was reluctant at first because of the risqué content but honestly it was entertaining and I could not wait to see what happened next to these two characters. I was totally wrapped up in their story and would tell people to judge it for themselves.

B007Y6OZE0|2.0|After all of the positive reviews on this album, I'm about to offer an opposing opinion of The Offspring's Days Go By album:<br /><br />First let me say that this album isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I really liked a total of three songs out of the twelve, but roughly a third of the songs on the album are decent, while a few are mix of mediocre and just plain bad. All of them, however, total to a very unmemorable album for me.<br /><br />The album begins The Future is Now, a mid-tempo punk song that basically sets the overall tone for the album. While not bad, it certainly did not grab me. This song, like Secrets From The Underground and Turning Into You, has been referred to as a Rise Against rip off and like Rise Against's Appeal to Reason, the songs on Days Go By feel more like a tired old band's attempt to recreate the fire that made them such a good punk band in the first place. This may be due to the redundancy of the vocals or the mid-tempo rhythms, but whatever it is, these songs lack the emotional punch, the raw energy that makes you want to jump out of your chair and sing at the top of your lungs, not to mention cohesion which I will address next.<br /><br />Four songs stand out as simply out of place on this album, and sadly these will probably be the album's hit singles. The first one is the albums title track. For the most part, Days Go By is not a bad song in it's own right but as an Offspring song, it stands out like a sore thumb. Foo Fighters inspired, I can understand that bands mature and feel the need to create more alternative rock songs, but the slight lack of creativity and country harmonies in this song made it sound more like a radio single creation versus an original inspiration. Then there is the much hated Cruising California' (bumpin in my trunk) song, which is actually extremely catchy and is one of those songs that annoyingly replays itself for days in your head until you want to lobotomize yourself. One could argue that it's inthe spirit of \\"Pretty Fly For A White Guy\\" but this is seems more like a cheap excuse to play with auto tune and drum loops to create a summer jam, rather than a parody of today's pop songs. The same applies to the Sublime knock off OC Guns song, that lifts Dexter's nasally vocals to new and annoying heights. Which brings us to the last of the misplaced songs on the album: All I Have Left Is You. Simply put, this is a ballad love song and a growing trend with many bands who's albums have \\"matured\\" over the years. With All I Have Left Is You, the song starts off sounding like something off of Linkin Park's A Thousand Suns album and ends with a mediocre mid tempo guitar riff.<br /><br />Little needs to be said about the Offspring's \\"new and improved\\" Dirty Magic, same song with a more polished sound. And then we have the pop punk/alternative diddy I Want A Secret Family With You, which sounds like Greenday meets Smashmouth with slightly cheesier lyrics.<br /><br />The final three songs mentioned are my favorites on the album. These songs have all the energy and enthusiasm of an old school punk song, and all three are distinctly Offspring, void of auto tune, electronic drum loops and melody rip-offs. If you were to listen to only three songs on the album, Hurting As One, Dividing By Zero and Slim Pickins would be my picks.<br /><br />In closing, this album's music isn't really all that bad. What works against it is a combination of song placement and the mediocrity of the album in general. As far as placement goes; The album starts off decently strong, then kills it with Days Go By, then builds back up and hits you with Hurting As One right before it takes a bad left turn with Cruising California and continues this drunken musical roller coaster until Dirty Magic. The only redeeming quality to this mid album SNAFU is that it does end with two strong songs, but only after leaping into cheesy pop punk heaven with I Want A Secret Family With You.<br /><br />So is this album worth buying? In my opinion, no. But I would recommend giving it a listen, you may disagree with me and totally love it. But to me, the majority of the songs are unmemorable (half of which aren't even punk) and will soon be lost to time. If you came here looking for a solid punk album, I recommend picking up a copy of Pennywise's new album All Or Nothing...a modern day masterpiece, one which the Offspring should take notes from when writing their next album.
B000002UY5|5.0|Each and every song is excellent.  Bought this CD back in the 90's when it first came out.  I really liked the lyrics.  Quickly became used to and really appreciated the vocals.  I  loaned the CD to a friend and it was never returned.  I bought the CD for Christmas, and now realize the groove of the music is just as much a contributor to awesomeness of this CD.
0446547654|3.0|It was okay. I enjoyed it but the ending was just too sad. If you think your life was unfair wait till you read this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read many reviews before I read this book. I was very skeptical about all the great reviews because I never heard about this author. Once I starting reading it, I was hooked. I loved all the characters and the author just did a great job describing the environment and the emotions that went along with living in a silo for years. Each book within this book had great endings, I thought to my self at the end of each book, what is the author going to do now with the next book. But Hugh Howey kept writing and creating exciting material and just delivered a really good book overall. I can't wait to read the 6th book in the series, it's a prequel. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy
B008B3H4VQ|1.0|This album is fairly terrible. The lyrics aren't crisp, the beats are forced... and they sampled the wrong types of sounds. Honestly... it sounds like Daft Punk covering Nine Inch Nails. I like Daft Punk. I like Nine Inch Nails. But my first impression of the album, from the first song \\"Lost in the Echo,\\" was.. \\"is that a wazoo?\\" It sounds like it was mixed at a \\"Toys R Us.\\" So much for machine shop rock. Think Owl City with Shinoda guest vocals. Although, in retrospect, that might be pretty cool.<br /><br />I like Linkin Park. This is the only album of theirs I've ever recoiled from. If you can tell yourself that the last cut from their previous album, \\"A Thousand Suns\\" - \\"The Messenger,\\" wasn't a complete mess, then you can probably talk yourself into liking this. For the rest of us its rather a significant letdown.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|it used to be a lot more fun when the mini games showed when they were unlocked..its still a pretty fun game anyway.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a great game because the game is adickting and very fun and smart but sometimes annoying. It can be annoying when you move your finger but it still says that you died.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|Really!  What more can you say about some movies?  You either enjoyed it, liked the cast, the premise, didn't regret the time or money spent...or...you didn't.<br /><br />I read several of the reviews...mostly 1 or 5 star ones.  The 5 star generally sound like paid adverts and 1 stars probably wouldn't like a movie about their own grandmothers and would complain that the mole on her face was one centimeter out of line and had a tinge of green rather than black.<br /><br />I'm not a critic...though I can be critical.  I don't like my time wasted.  I like Denzel ( I like to think we're on a first name basis even if he has no idea I exist.) I like Spike Lee.  I really liked the movie...it moved, it twisted, it sometimes contorted...and the music rocked me.

0553593544|4.0|I loved the Bourne movies. I was very hestitant to read the books just because I worried that I would love the movies less afterwards. I had great faith that these books were all they had been billed to be. Luckily, though I now also love the books, it hasn't tainted my love for the movies at all. Possibly because there are so many differences between them.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, in either medium, Jason Bourne is no joke. This book is a thriller, and Bourne is pitted against a very worthy adversary. His life depends on what he can't remember, and as he slowly pieces the puzzle of his life together, he also allows his gut reactions to help him out.<br /><br />I didn't think the forced romance was all that necessary in the movie, and I don't think it is in the book either, but some people like that and it didn't bother me too much. Otherwise, this is a solid action-thriller offering and captures all the intrigue of the Bourne saga, while still leaving readers wanting more.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put it down today!  If you love Christian Grey you will love Gideon Cross!!!  It was well written and it was nice to see both characters have problems.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I saw the movie and read the book back in the 80's. I am a big Car buff since the 70's when I was in Junior High School.<br />I am not a big fan of Horror films.But This is one that I can watch over & over. I remembered bullies that Arnie had to deal with.<br />And loved what happen to them.  As for the car,an aunt & uncle had a black Fury back in the early 60's. Thats what pulled me to the movie. And now I am in multimedia classes learning all things media,including film making. I had a copy of the regular VHS.<br />But I just read about the car club of Christine,so I going to get the special edition DVD.
B00846REIS|2.0|I'm not sure how this was published without the author being sued to writing a bad version of 50 Shades of Grey. The book has FAR too many similarities from the blown up photos, the jobs, money power and bad version of his \\"controlling behavior\\". I'm 50 Shades all the way, and thought this looked like a similar book when I bought it for my kindle but I can't help but get annoyed and roll my eyes when literally ever scene is the same, but more rushed in this book. Waste of money.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has hooked me.  Wool is an excellent sci-fi distopian adventure with lots of action but also a lot of artistic description and philosophical thinking.  Howey has done a great job of developing characters and revealing their thoughts so I felt like I knew these people.  I'll read almost anything, but I REALLY enjoyed reading Wool.  Best new science fiction that I have read.
B007M45PMU|5.0|My husband had heard The Lumineers and told me to check out a sample. After just one song, I knew I liked what I heard and I bought the album. Little did I know that once I bought it I wouldn't be able to stop listening to it! I have it in my car and when it ends, I just start it back at the beginning! It's not that I don't have 5 other good CD's in my car, but The Black Keys, Jack White, Alabama Shakes, Radiohead and even Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros are just being put on hold for now.<br /><br />The songs are very catchy (I constantly catch myself drumming on my steering wheel), but it really is the lyrics that I like the most. It is refreshing to hear something different for a change too. I believe the album starts off with a bang and ends with one too. There is not a track that I don't like, but I do have my favorites- Stubborn Love and Morning Song are a couple.<br /><br />I agree with others that say the album gets better the more you listen to it. It is a great CD for summer BBQ's and get-togethers too. I think it's got a great folksy sound that most people can appreciate and enjoy. 5 stars from me!
B007TG34QU|2.0|No doubts that this is a 'curiosa' assemblage of lesser known petite-scale-Vivaldi-concertos with the occasional scattered tiny semi-precious-stones here and there - not even close to Vivaldi 4-seasons glory, and do not expect a four-seasons-for-runner here...<br />My concern here is more with the audio properties of this 2-SACD set.<br /><br />During the first few minuets of listening to this SACD recording one is reminded of the sonic properties or finger print if you will, of the now legendary, analogue recording \\"Music ancient du Greece\\" made in the seventies by French Harmonia-Mundi (which also features period instruments), or to the \\"Devil's Trill\\" - Palladian Ensemble SACD recording by Linn (also with period instruments - and also recorded in a church) - but the similarity in sonic and sonority with this La-Cetra ends right there;<br />Where the French Harmonia-Mundi recording and the Linn SACD Palladians recording (featuring Tartini and Veracini) has more body, more focus, more presence, more depth and clues about the instruments location in relationship to each other - this Channel-Classics SACD (listened to in multichannel mode) has too much reverberation, haze throughout the sound field and around the instruments which lends it an added vagueness.<br />And what's more; the engineers went out-board here, with the rear channels emphasized beyond proportion to the front channels;<br />one has to tame the rear-channel's volume DRASTICALLY (almost attenuating them to zero output) in order to achieve any sensible sound-picture of what's going on on the front channels.<br /><br />Simply put, the more one listens to this recording the more one become tired of that church acoustics, the reverberation captured and the haze that prevail there.<br />For such a bonbon-pack-low-key Vivaldi oeuvres this is wrong.<br />Make no mistake; the recording chain used here is one of the best in the business: Best calibrated microphones (too many of those for that simple revenue), great interconnect cables, best Analogue to Digital converter by Grim Audio, etc... and yet, and yet...<br />A good small to mid-size hall, furnished, draped and carpeted, would have done more justice to these Vivaldi short 'concert pieces'.<br /><br />As it stands right now, this is not a very attractive SACD offer and certainly the praises endowed on this item are grossly misleading., great interconnect cables, best Analogue to Digital converter by Grim Audio, etc... and yet, and yet...<br />A good small to mid-size hall, furnished, draped and carpeted, would have done more justice to these Vivaldi short 'concert pieces'.<br /><br />As it stands right now, this is not a very attractive SACD offer and certainly the praises endowed on this item are grossly misleading.

0345803485|5.0|I LOVE this book. Really, really LOVE it. I haven't read a single word, but I think this is the greatest book that has ever been written.<br /><br />Well, at least in the last 7 years since I've been married. This work of literary genius turned my wife into a raging nymphomaniac from the first page until the last. How did I know she had completed this future Pulitzer Prize Winner?<br /><br />No more wake me up in the middle of the night with sudden bursts of passion. No more pull me away from SportsCenter by the scruff of my neck. No more unexpected entrances into the shower. DISASTER!!!<br /><br />After I had regained some of my desire to live. I happen to see her contemplating getting the followup. (There's a sequel? THERE'S A SEQUEL!!!!) Trying to remain nonchalant, I asked: \\"Is that the second book?\\"<br />\\"Yeah, but it's really expensive...\\"<br />\\"Really...I'll tell you what, let me buy it for you.\\"<br />She smiled and was about to place an order for the hardcopy when I asked, \\"is there was a Kindle edition?\\"<br />\\"Ah, yeah...\\"<br />\\"Let me download it on my new Fire for you.\\"<br /><br />That night, it was back ON!<br /><br />This scenario repeated for the third book, and now, the well has runneth dry. Dark days.<br /><br />I have only two wishes: 1) This future Nobel Prize in Literature winner should churn out more books. PRONTO!<br />Don't sleep, don't eat...just write. (While writing, start a friggin' daily blog or something, you've got to keep the magic flowing!!) and...<br />2) I really, really wish my wife was a much slower reader....

There's nothing preachy about these suggestions, so it's not as though he ever says \\"you must set it this way.\\"  Indeed, there are times when he comes right out and says \\"this might not work for you, but here's why it works for me.\\"  I find that refreshing and invaluable.<br /><br />I make my living writing technical manuals and appreciate the fine line a writer must walk between making things simple enough for new users to understand (at the risk of boring or under-informing more advanced users) and comprehensive enough for more savvy photographers (at the risk of causing less experienced readers to close the book in frustration).  Darrell walks that line extremely well here, and has created a book that is both easy to read and deeply informative.<br /><br />He also has a knack for breaking complex concepts, functions, and menus down into useable information, which is not an easy task with a camera this complex (or with Nikon's sometimes baffling menu system).<br /><br />Perhaps the most refreshing thing about this book, though, is that you don't get the impression that it's just a re-hash of the manual or of another book.  There are plenty of books out there that just seem to re-package the information already contained in the manual, or, worse yet, are pretty much word-for-word cut and paste copies of the books the same author has written for a dozen other cameras with \\"D7000\\" inserted where it would make a difference.  You get the impression this book was written from the ground up for the D7000.<br /><br />As a bonus, the book comes with a coupon that offers a significant savings on a membership to one of the best Nikon forums on the web.  In fact, if you intended to purchase a subscription to that forum anyway, the coupon more than offsets the purchase price of the book.  Quite the deal!<br /><br />Bottom line:  This is the best book I've found to date for those who really want to comprehend and master all of the capabilities of the Nikon D7000, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Jim

0547569653|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations. I have known of Scott for many years, but like so many, I had stereotyped him a bit as an Uber God born and blessed with incredible running talent. The story of his early life and his running highs AND lows showed me a much more human athlete than I imagined. Besides the story of his life and running, Scott's explanation of a plant based diet, why he chose that and the science behind it is also very compelling. I highly recommend Eat & Run for runners and non-runners alike.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Generally I do not review movies. I give more attention to the written word. But having just seen PROMETHEUS at a theater, I know as a science fiction fan and as an appreciator of A-quality films that this was a good solid movie that would be bashed by many ignorant viewers who do not understand why this good movie does not deserve to be bashed. I have not read any reviews, but I imagine some viewers will bash PROMETHEUS because it was not as good as the original ALIEN or because it did not give them an orgasm while they watched it.<br /><br />Well, it is not a stand-up-and-cheer movie. Nor are most good movies, and you are going to starve to death if your hunger for a good movie is not satiated unless it makes you stand up and cheer. No, it did not have the impact of the original ALIEN, but that was because the original ALIEN was original and for that reason you should not expect an ALIEN tie-in to be better.<br /><br />Nevertheless PROMETHEUS has many excellent things going for it. One is the acting, which--from my perspective as an amateur--seemed perfect. No one smiled out of place. The characterizations were presented earnestly with depth and convincingness. Though when everyone does a good job at acting, maybe the credit should go to the director. Another excellent thing was the artwork. Cinematics, sound, art, background, props--they were all science fictionally immersive, setting a proper, believable atmosphere. I especially appreciated the concept of the Engineers, the giant hereditary progenitors of human beings. They were a good conceptual take on the mythological Greek Titans and they put Michelangelo's David to shame.<br /><br />Certainly the movie had its flaws. Every movie does. But they are not worth pointing out because the movie is worth your time. The story is pretty much a platitude, reminiscent of preceding ALIEN movies. Still it holds together logically, well enough, and it pulls you on so you can experience the good sound and visuals and the suspense. And if you don't stand up and cheer at the ending, you can at least be pleased that Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is one tough gal, with heart, soul, and inspiration.uspense.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|i really enjoy this game; plenty of characters and interesting items to find; story line moves along really well; graphics are really well done.
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|This movie is not even worth renting and definitely not worth owning.  First DVD ever I am considering throwing away!<br /><br />If you like to hear references to male genitalia A LOT then maybe, just maybe this movie is for you?  Probably not though.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I was so happy Rush finally came out with another studio release and for good reason. I think this is the best Rush album ever released. I've always loved these guys and went back and listened to some of the earlier stuff just to make sure and for me this is the best. The musicianship is flawless, the songs are very well layered but yet it has a raw sound about it that can't be beat. This is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over and it always gets better. Rush has just dethroned Dream Theater as my favorite band again... lol
B002F6FQGK|5.0|Best musical group I have heard in a long time.  The purchase of the entire CD is worth it!  There isn't a song to complain about on this album or anything by this group for that matter.  Enjoy!
B007AMMHSY|5.0|In a world of vanilla productions - most movies in all genres (bad, good or excellent) are cut the same  and have become somewhat predictable...but not this Almodovar film (or any of his films)...deep, dark, provocative, UNEXPECTED! Not for the faint at heart! No spoilers in this review...a must see!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! I enjoyed every minute of it! It was so exciting and had me wanting more.

B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fun fun fun game if you don't got it get it trust me best game ever invented
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Linkin Park has once again put out a great album. I love everything from Hybrid Theory to A Thousand Suns and Living things combines the best elements from all of those albums into one energetic, well written, experimental hit album. Some songs i like less than others( LIES GREED MISERY, UNTIL IT BREAKS)and it could be a bit longer(although roughly being the same length as Hybrid Theory and Meteora,but for the most part this album is not going to disappoint.  Linkin Park continue to grow and expand themselves while still sounding like Linkin Park. In my opinion, being a Linkin Park fan since Hybrid Theory, Living Things is the Hybrid Theory of this Decade!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Good game but the original game is so much better. I liked small and bigger part in the original game.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|one word this is the best photo editing app In the WORLD! by the way GET THIS APP you will be satisfied
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game but you have to play each game 101 times to unlock the other games in order to play them. But free is free.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|Watched it just to see the prequel to Step Up 2, which I'd already seen.  The storyline was a little predictable, but not bad.  The dancing made it worthwhile, though.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This is a fun app.  Lots of options although the stickers option could use more variety.  Other than that it's great.
B007XF0X16|5.0|Saw the movie 2 times in theatres and I just got it today in the mail. I've watched it one time so far, and I cant get enough. The storyline carries over very nicely from the first movie. Perseus now has a son and his wife, Io from the first movie has passed away. He is once again needed to save the world and the gods from the destruction that will ensue if Cronus is released.<br /><br />  I dont want to say too much because of people who have not seen the movie yet. Ill keep it short and simple. The movie was great and lives up to the previous installment. A definite watch for all mythology fans out there.
B001K3ENEA|4.0|very comfortable and light, sound is good too but not the best even in this price range, i could have sworn my superlux sounded better but I only got these last month so hopefully the sound gets better. and even if it doesnt its still very good all around i recommend them to anyone proudly
B002ZG9788|5.0|A great remake of the classic movie, true fans will enjoy it. A lot of people out there gave this movie bad reviews simply because they think they are die hard movie critics. The story was great, the action scenes were even better.<br /><br />  To everyone reading this review. Stop listening to what everyone else says about this movie!!! Watch it and decide for yourself.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|i have owned many other cheap headphones in this price range but this is by far the best sounding one<br />very comfortable too but maybe a bit too big for some people<br />again, i repeat myself for under 40 bucks the sound cannnot be beat
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Great book which speaks of the truth~just when you thought you had achieved your success based on all of your hard work~this book helps to enlighten those thoughts and provide others to ponder prior to entering a new journey or phase in life's growth.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I bought this game weeks ago but could never play it due to the almost 400mb it took to download. Recently factory reset and decided to play before reinstalling everything else. This game was way too fun and looks amazing. I couldve done with less graphics in order to get it to install without taking up so much space though. It wasnt too hard and I finished it within a few hours. Ppl with the fire should know that it will not install unless you have more than enough space left on your device on both parts of the memory. Plenty of hints when needed and engaging Im looking forward to trying the other two though maybe on a pc.

8866131385|4.0|I really like the X-large sized notebook planners (though they really aren't THAT big). There is space to write something on each day. I bought this to use for school to keep track of my schedule, assignments, projects, and work schedules. One thing I wish was different: I wish the pages were swapped. If the weekly calendar part was on the right side of the planner and the lined pages were on the left side. That is the reason I only gave it 3 stars.

B005F3DFXG|5.0|The BBC's latest dinosaur documentary was all the talk among many of you when it was announced, even though we couldn't watch it here in America. (luckily we had \\"Dinosaur Revolution\\" to watch here in the US at the same time) Now you can watch it; well, sort of.<br /> Planet Dinosaur is an almost three hour Blu-Ray disc showing all six episodes from the BBC series special. Narrated by John Hurt, the CG graphics are extremely well done. I know its an over-used word but I thought several scenes were truly awesome. In between the CG action scenes, we are shown various graphics and fossilized bones that tell us stories about the dinosaur's fights and their lives. The show provides some great, very up-to-date information; some of which, I dare say, you did not know. The first episode is set in prehistoric Africa, where we follow a Spinosaurus and meet Carcharodontosaurus, Ouranosaurus, Sarchosuchus, Rugops and more. The second episode is all about the feathered dinosaurs of China. Episode 3 covers the Late Cretaceous and the meat-eaters of that era. Part 4 is set in the Jurassic where we watch not only stegosaurs and allosaurs but marine reptiles too, including the huge Predator X. (It's a funny term, so I was surprised to hear John Hurt seriously use the word \\"Thagomizer\\" to describe Stegosaurus spikes.) The fifth episode is mostly about sauropods and other large dinosaurs and the final episode shows various dinosaur forms that evolved to help dinosaurs survive. I highly recommend the show; but, as mentioned at the beginning of this review there is a possible problem. The Blu-Ray would not play on my Blu-Ray player, even though it is supposedly for all areas of the world. I have a new laptop that plays Blu-Ray movies and fortunately it did fine on it. I also understand you can update your Blu-Ray player to where it will play foreign discs, but you have been forewarned. Check before you buy this DVD. However, I give it all five stars.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|As a big fan of the original work (Edgar Rice Burrough's \\"A Princess of Mars\\", 1912) I was very pleased with this movie. Seeing the characters and world on the screen was a thrill, and the adaptation was well done. I highly recommend this, it will be a classic.
1401937519|5.0|Dying to Be Me, My Journey from Cancer to Near Death, to True Healing, book written by Anita Moorjani.<br /><br />As an amazing, spiritually oriented autobiography, Anita Moorjani has given us such a gift in Dying to Be Me, My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing. Because of her experiences that she relates in this book, Anita has been hailed as \\"the embodiment of truth\\" that we are children of the universe and have the insight, if we are open to it, to live this life with courage and audacity.<br /><br />Dealing with death is not a new experience for me, and I was fearful of reading Dying to Be Me by Anita Moorjani, when Hay House Publishing sent it to me for review. I just lost my only child (daughter, age 36) two years ago. Was this going to open up those painful wounds? I have accepted her passing, at least in part. And as a wonderful author, Maria Houston, author of Hannah's Gift, Lessons Fully Lived has said, \\"Grief has become a part of me, not something I needed to get through.\\" So I've been able to honor the grief, not ignore it.<br /><br />But I was surprised when I started reading Moorjani's story. It is not a book about death necessarily, but about re-connecting with the universal love that we come into this life with, and living Life in Love. Somehow we get sidetracked into believing what others have said about us, and what we mistakenly believe about ourselves. And in doing so, we lose the sense of that love.<br /><br />Moorjani gracefully portrays her life story. By sharing her experience, it becomes easier to see how we can become preoccupied and confused by other people's perceptions of ourselves. She relates her early life as the child of a Hindu family living in Hong Kong, and schooling in a strict British Catholic setting. Her life consisted of contradictions at every turn as she tried to fit in.  As Moorjani puts it, \\"Soon, I found myself locked in my own cage of fear and desperation, where my experience of life was getting smallerand smaller.\\"<br /><br />After coming of age, embarking on her own career, and meeting the man she would marry, Anita still held subconscious fear of life and self-expression. She ended up getting cancer. During the next few years, battling her own disease, she lost a dear friend and brother-in-law to cancer who each had slowly declined from treatment. Her illness continued to deteriorate and eventually she ended up in an emergency situation at the hospital. Her body had shut down and she was dying.<br /><br />Anita was so aware of everything, even though the doctors said she was in a coma. She became so sensitive to everything. She could feel her husband's emotions, recognized the nurse and doctor's conversation about her condition. But she couldn't understand why she was unable to comfort her mother. Everything going on in the medical area revolved around her. But she seemed to be above it. She was floating above, but still right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />Here is Moorjani's account of this near-death, coma-state: \\"I was more acutely aware of all that was going on around me than I've ever been in a normal physical state. I wasn't using my five biological senses, yet I was keenly taking everything in, much more so than if I'd been using my physical organs. It was as though another, completely different type of perception kicked in, and more than just perceive, I seemed to also encompass everything that was happening, as thought I was slowly merging with it all.\\"<br /><br />Much of the book deals with Moorjani's Near Death Experience (NDE), recovery and illumination. The illumination is what I find most interesting. It consisted of the extreme feeling or sensation of being completely enfolded in the arms of Love. The more Anita tried to explain the feeling of unconditional love; the more it became apparent that it was something that actually could not be explained, at least in human terms. You know the saying, \\"You had to be there,\\"? It seems to me that actually being there (in NDE) is the only time you would be able to completely understand what she really is experiencing.<br /><br />Anita was able, in this sensation of love, to realize that she is perfect just the way she is: that there is no such thing as judgment, or fault, or guilt. Experience in the human body is just that - experience. Spending all her life feeling like she was not good enough was simply wasted time and energy. She could have been moving through her life in complete confidence. Why had she chosen to feel inadequate? That seems to be one reason she returned to her physical body after the NDE: to understand that God is All, that she is All. There is no separation. And she was to live confidently thereafter. She was to share this glorious information with as many people as she could.<br /><br />At this stage, Wayne Dyer, author and spiritual teacher, came into play. He became acquainted with Anita's experience and situation. He encouraged her to write the book, Dying to Be Me, and was instrumental in having it published.<br /><br />And so, we move back to the beginning of this blog: the part where I said I was fearful of reading it. Yes, the book speaks of death. Yes, it opened old emotional wounds of my daughter's passing. But, we all experience death as part of life. It is the natural transition. Some of us live through much more than others do. But this book, Anita's account of her NDE, gives me solace in knowing that my daughter is in that indescribable state of love. Of course, I knew it on many levels already. But to hear it from someone who was actually there makes a major difference in how I understand it.<br /><br />If you or someone you know has moved through a place of grief, after losing someone in their life, then I whole-heartedly guarantee that they will find peace in this book. If you have ever entertained the idea of what it is like on \\"the other side,\\" then this book is for you. But most of all, if you intend on truly livingyour life this time around, then the book for your inspiration is \\"Dying to Be Me, My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Health\\".

B000JMKTLO|1.0|I don't understand the hype around this book.  I know I am late to the game, since it came out if 2006.

I guess I was holding out hope that it would get better.  It didn't.

B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I loved this album from beginning to end. It's different from anything but it still has their soul in it. I love it as i love Linkin Park! :)

B004EPYZSK|1.0|I have to say it was underwhelming and the special effects were mediocre to awful. Actors were stiff. Very long, I couldn't wait for it to end!
B007ZKY7V6|4.0|Continuing their Roxy Music art dance meets Elton John Piano pop, \\"Magic Hour\\" is the Scissor Sisters at their best. As they keep searching for an American Audience and switch to the Casablanca Records banner (home to the best of 70's dance music, take that as a clue), Jake, BabyDaddy, Del and Anna are still looking for love at the best parties.<br /><br />There's plenty here to tape your feet to, from the silly bonus track \\"Eff Yeah!\\" to the pulsing \\"Keep Your Shoes On,\\" the Sisters are playing to their strengths. After all, not every band could take a phone message about a crappy night on the NYC clubs and mix it into a party anthem (\\"Let's Have a Kiki\\"). They also allow the mood to be serious, as on the heartbreak story of \\"Inevitable\\" or the frothy \\"San Luis Obispo.\\" There are those who might think that the band is not changing much from their other albums; I say Scissor Sisters have a sound. For me, it's well worth the continuing interest in the band.
B006FE83UE|5.0|The product was recieved in excellent condition and was everything I expected it to be. The movie is a classic and I never tire of watching it. The acting was superb . Child actors that are convincing in their parts are rare these days and the children in this movie were very convincing. Gregory Peck is an excellent actor who never overplays his part. I would always recommend this movie.

B0000DJZ8R|4.0|It was one of Fonda's best acting jobs. Though the theme of the movie is depressing it could be because those were depressing times. It is a movie young people should watch to learn how their ancestors struggled to make a living during the Depression era. It highlights the ruthlessness of people who took advantage of those desperate to find work of any kind to provide for their families. The lighting is weak and shadowy but is overshadowed by the acting. Family loyalty is the theme that comes through. I recommend it for the whole family.

0345803485|1.0|Here is what I've discerned about these books: People who do not read very often, or don't read good books often (by good, I mean well written, good stories, and well edited) like them. They consist of terrible editing, ridiculous repetition, and a stupid, ridiculous, unrealistic storyline. I'd equate it to the Twilight saga: milquetoast heroine (much like Bella) and a 'horrible for her' guy, but it's ok because he's hot (Like Edward,) and in the case of Grey, super rich. Now, unlike Twilight, they've added in a lot of kinky sex, mental illness, and deep rooted mommy issues. Along with that, it is a stupid story with unrealistic, under researched mental issues, the main character is a horrible person, and the girl is a doormat.<br /><br />I think for others, it's an excuse to read erotica without getting 'caught' (no bodice ripping on the cover) or it's been made ok to read erotica because everyone else is doing it. You can't just skim over the sex parts because they are in every chapter. I don't mind some sex in a book, especially if it's pertinent to the story, but this is over the top by 10 miles and disgusting to boot. Did I mention badly written? Furthermore, the book is immature and chalked full of VERY unrealistic sexual scenarios. As if it was written by a very hopeful 15 year old virgin or a man who's wife/girlfriend is a GOOD faker and he assumes that this is the way women work. It's just not realistic by medical and physical standards.<br /><br />Again, I didn't understand the hype.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|I've been listening to Linkin Park since their debut with Hybrid Theory when i was 12...as have many of you.<br /><br />Let me first say that this is NOT a BAD album. It flows well, and is overall enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />However, I will also say that it only has one or two songs that really stand out as memorable, which is \\"Castle of Glass\\" and \\"I'll Be Gone\\". They are powerful and fun, and are the only ones I referred back to the song name for.<br /><br />It was clear what the intent of the album was: bring back older fans, and take minimal risks. It lacked the explosive creative finesse of the other albums.<br /><br />Sure, I know everyone seemingly hated the previous two albums, and I'd similarly argue Minutes to Midnight was the weakest thusfar (though still enjoyable). I would however argue that A Thousand Suns was one of the best, only beaten by Meteora, which was perhaps the best album ever from them by a decent margin.<br /><br />The problem with this album was there wasn't an epically refreshing song like the single \\"Cataclysm\\", or \\"When They Come for Me\\", or the underrated gem \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\", \\"Bleed it Out\\", or many of the songs from Meteora and Hybrid Theory that stand out explicity as incredible and groundbreaking in feel.<br /><br />Living Things has nothing of that caliber of originality, albiet the songs are enjoyable, especially the two mentioned above. Overall, it sounded entirely too pop-like and mainstream, and entirely too \\"easy\\" and plain. Don't get me wrong, I listen to all sorts of popular music, I am not against it because of that. I am against it because it's not what Linkin Park does, they don't go with the grain. They haven't done it for their previous 4 albums...for better or for worse, to some. At least everything was original and fresh. I find that bravery seemingly lacking in this album.<br /><br />In style its the closest to their first two albums (but still arguably far away), but they don't do it in a \\"wow, what an interesting/original sound!\\" kind of way. The songs are also too similar/consistent in sound or style as a whole. Also, the songs are much too short...you can't fully explore the life of most songs in 3-3.5 minutes.<br /><br />I hope Linkin Park can still feel free to explore their creativity without the need to fulfill the teen-nostalgia'ed crowd raging about their evolving sound throughout the past 10 years. I appreciate what they were going for, and I will still enjoy listening to it, but I would argue it is their second-to-worst album, beating only Minutes to Midnight, i.e.<br /><br />Best to Worst:<br /><br />1. Meteora<br />2. A Thousand Suns<br />3. Hybrid Theory<br />4. Living Things<br />5. Minutes to Midnight

B002TZS5GU|5.0|This take on a topic that is constantly examined and re-made is still refreshing. development of each character makes you see something of yourself in them all, and when they fall, together and as individuals, I found myself wanting to help them get back up. Some cheap thrills, but you expected that right? a funny way the movie has stayed with me is that they draw silly mouths over the masks they wear to protect themselves from the virus, and now I do too.<br /><br />This movie was a bargain. It was one that I never saw ads for, but I should have, because it was that good.

0307719219|2.0|I read this book because I wanted to know more about the poor countries and regions of the world, their nature, and what could done to raise their prosperity. Previously, I had read Jeffrey Sachs' [[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time]].<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson proceed to build a theory of poverty versus prosperity by providing detailed histories of dozens of countries of both types. Their theory focuses on political and economic systems of each country. According to them, a political system or an economy can be either extractive or inclusive. Extractive, which leads to poverty, means that a small elite group, for example, a dictator, a strongman, the military, the clergy, or just a gang of cronies, makes all the decisions and wields the power. In an inclusive system, synonymous with prosperity, power is shared broadly by the people. \\"Extractive\\" refers to a situation in which the elite group extracts resources from the masses, thus making them poorer. Although extractive and inclusive are usually used as black-and-white terms, there is a range between them, as the authors discuss.<br /><br />Countries become inclusive or extractive due to past events, often centuries in the past. Thus, most of the book comprises fascinating historical accounts of the countries in question. For instance, Britain is inclusive today because of how it reacted to the fall of the Roman Empire (fifth century), the Magna Carta (1215), the plague (1348), the Glorious Revolution (1688), and the Industrial Revolution (eighteenth century). Thus, according to the authors' theory, extractiveness can change to inclusiveness only slowly and only in response to occasional critical junctures of history, which are largely outside of human control.<br /><br />Moreover, extractiveness tends to follow a vicious circle, wherein an extractive state leads to greater poverty, which causes a more extractive state. In contrast, inclusiveness tends to encourage a virtuous circle, leading to prosperity and even greater inclusiveness.<br /><br />So this is how this book explains poverty. What does it say about reducing or eradicating poverty? Essentially nothing--a sad conclusion. Because poverty, according to the authors, has long-term roots essentially outside of human control, there is little that can be done about it. The last three pages of the book make a lame attempt, suggesting that open media would help.<br /><br />In contrast to Acemoglu and Robinson's complete focus on just two factors--political institutions and economic institutions--Sachs assesses dozens of factors in determining the \\"thumbprint\\" of a particular country regarding its poverty. These factors can include, climate, geography, governance, ease of transport, economics (hyperinflation, for example), soil and water conditions, local diseases, ethnic differences, and many others. I believe that this approach makes much more sense than trying to boil a complex issue like poverty down to just two basic causes.<br /><br />Although \\"Why Nations Fail\\" appears to be carefully researched, I found two significant instances of sloppiness that cast a shadow on its credibility. On page 409 the authors state, \\"Today Botswana has the highest per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa . . . .\\" Income is a vague term that the authors don't define, but if we use the most common definition, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), Botswana is actually number five out of 45 sub-Saharan countries (excluding South Africa), following Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Seychelles, and Mauritius, according to UN data ([...]) for 2010 (the latest year available).<br /><br />More serious, on page 49 the authors state, \\"The theory that hot countries are intrinsically poor . . . is still forcefully advocated by some, such as the economist Jeffrey Sachs.\\" Nothing could be further from the truth. Two paragraphs above I list some of the many factors that Sachs takes into consideration. Sachs' wholethrust is that there are countless potential factors, and they differ for each country. This lapse suggests to me that Acemoglu and Robinson didn't actually even scan Sachs' book. And it suggests that the 18 illustrious endorsers--including six Nobel laureates--of \\"Why Nations Fail\\" didn't read this book before they endorsed it.<br /><br />Unlike most books of this type, this one has no Notes section. Instead, it has a Bibliographical Essay and Sources section, which is so vague as to be useless for fact checking.<br /><br />I see two uses for this book. First, for those who love history, it provides fascinating histories relating to wealth and poverty from around the world. Second, it would be a great supplement to Sachs' \\"The End of Poverty.\\" Sachs recommends foreign aid programs, in ample amounts, but for these to be successful, the host government must not be too corrupt or unorganized. Sachs doesn't devote much attention to this topic, so \\"Why Nations Fail\\" could contribute to this understanding so as to direct foreign aid to its most useful destinations.nd they differ for each country.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I only started the books when my nephew asked me to watch this series when it started (he is unable to get HBO).  I wnated to keep up with things.  well, I read them all before the second episode!  I have just re-read them all, and with everything fresher in my mind, I can say that the sex and violence is not HBO-enhaced, with the exception of a couple of scenes.  It is much tamed down.  I don't mind either.  Both season 1 and season 2 were great, I am enjoying going back to start the HBO series over again.  I also realized that a lot of the dialogue in the series which I didn't recall was in fact from the books.  So, this show is 98% George RR Martin at its core.  Enjoy, and I too am glad I slipped in under the gun and got the \\"controversial\\" original set.  I'm not a Bush fan, but I think he might have gotten a kick out of his \\"cameo\\". . .
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I enjoyed the action and the star's fight scenes were more convincing than most action films. However, there were many plot holes and I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end. It is nice to see a woman protagonist in an action film, though, and I hope she is given other opportunities to act in projects that have better stories and scripts. Overall, I'm glad I saw this film, but equally glad I did not pay to see it in a theater.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars because, to my opinion, it had great potential, but again, the movie never took off.  The story was pretty bland and the rendition of Olympus pretty scanty.  I found the new version of Clash of the Titans, to be a much better movie for story line and effects.  Think twice before purchasing.  Watch it first and if you think it is worth a place in your movie library, then by all means, go ahead and buy it.  I was glad,  I bought a used cheaper copy.  BTW, the film was way too dark.  I do not enjoy darker colors.  It is not the first time that films are to my opinion, ruined because of lack of proper color and light.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Found this book immensely valuable.  It provides great insights and also puts to bed many myths about strength training.<br /><br />What I found missing is some specific around specific routines and exercises - similar to the descriptions included for squats, etc. but for the other exercises.<br /><br />It also would have been helpful to have some guidelines around strength goals e.g very strong should be able to bench x1.5 body mass.<br /><br />The last improvement suggested would be including some metrics on how to measure progress -- key body stats and how and when to take them.

0553801473|4.0|I think a lot of reviews here are written in haste after finishing this book, which admittedly does not end with much of a bang.  This book was a vast improvement over A Feast for Crows, but a few criticisms come to mind:<br /><br />1) It's been an awfully long time since a major character has been killed.<br /><br />2) From a macro view virtually no major conflicts have made major progress towards resolution.<br /><br />3) Yet more characters are introduced to add complexity to the story with characters that are favored in the book whilst others are nearly or completely ignored.<br /><br />In other words, don't expect much more than a few developments that might make you lose control of your jaw.  Expect several that will elicit a deep sigh as you realize how far in the distance some highly anticipated meetings, battles, etc are likely to be.<br /><br />In the end though, I am eternally grateful to the author for his creation and all the hard work it continues to require.  I greatly anticipate the rest of the series!
B004132HZS|5.0|I first saw a preview for this show on another excellent BBC production (Merlin). I thought the preview seemed interesting and decided to check it out via Netflix. By the first half hour I was hopelessly addicted.<br />Sherlock is clever, engaging, energetic and just plain fun.<br />This DVD set has a all three 90 minute episodes, 2 commentaries, a making-of special feature and the 60 minute unaired pilot. Disc quality is good, I've rewatched them multiple times with no problems. The case is sturdy and well made...I accidently put it to the test by stepping on it: no damage to discs or case. Won't be doing that again, though!

B007U1FEJE|5.0|If you were a youth when the Beach Boys were the hottest thing before the Beatles, then buy this cd. If you saw them when they were touring California in the early 60s, then buy this cd.  I saw them at the Hollywood Teenage Fair in their flannels,but you knew there was something special. If you grew up with Fun,Fun,Fun, I Get Around, 409, you'll appreciate this cd because we all have gotten older.  There are no Fender riffs, but a lot of Beach Boy harmony. Can you still do the same thing that you did when you were a teenager? Well the Beach Boys are no different, but they can still offer the harmonies that are so reminiscent of the past.  It is like seeing an old friend again, you remember what they offered you when you were young, and appreciate them for what they offer you NOW.  Most of the songs rely on the memories of youth and address it in the present. From There to Back Again, Spring Vacation, Isn't it Tme, Beaches in Mind.<br />This cd is a \\"I remember when\\" or \\"back in the day\\" with a friend, and realize it was a wild ride, but father time is undefeated. Appreciate this cd as you would a good friend.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great story, well acted, enjoyed the music, sets, costumes and plotlines. It was overall a very entertaining series.  Now I'm going to buy the 2nd Season!
B003O97W4G|5.0|Was very impressed with the lengthy backstory involving all the studio and legal problems that went along with trying to make the film, which was not making Mr. Broccoli (he of the orig Bond Franchises) very happy at all.  Seems his studio went through all the legal meanderings trying to put a kabosh on the whole movie, and much to NSNA's producer, the late Jack Schwartzman, that did not happen!  Was also happy to see it in HD as well!<br />Overall the film was pretty much as I remembered it from years ago -- maybe better for NOT having seen it in some time.  I have to agree with the director that Barbara Carrera was not used to her fullest potential in prior roles, and so she made the most of this one -- thanks in large part to dierector Irvin Kershner.  A great lady villan -- over the top perhaps, but great!  Kim Basinger, on the other hand, did not look like she was having much fun, although most of the scenes with Connery were well done.  Kershner finally found out that Kim's halting acting was due to her boyfriend and/or husband being on the set (her hairdresser) and she was looking to him for direction instead of playing her role as written.  Kershner threw him off the set, and that may have lessened the tensions in later filming for Ms. Basinger...<br />Connery was not lacking much from his earlier efforts as 007; perhaps a bit drier and a tad slower, but he also did not try to \\"fake\\" his age or abilities.  His timing in every respect was spot on and his actions still like the 'Old Bond'.  Klaus Maria Brandauer was very good as the easily psychotic agent of SPECTRE -- cool and calculating, deceptively creepy and taken to instant violence.  You could not find a better leading cast overall than this film.<br />Since most filmgoers will not have to be told much about Bond films at this stage of the series' life, let me just say that this one has better earmarks of Ian Flemings original than a lot of the later movies.  In fact the more you dig into the details ofthis film the more surprised you're likely to get!<br />Music by Michel Legrand--\\"A\\"; cinematography by Douglas Slocombe --\\"A\\"; supporting characters -- \\"A\\" all the way!  Bernie Casey as the genuine Felix Lighter, Edward Fox as the crusty and by the book \\"M\\", Max Von Sydow plays the head of SPECTRE with a very believable demeanor (and the usual white Persian cat), and Lani Hall produces a very pleasant Pre and Post rendering of \\"Never Say Never Again\\".  And 'yes', that is Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) playing a rather inept agent \\"from the Home Office\\".<br />So, did I miss the obviously naked silhouettes of ladies tumbling over and over and all that other \\"franchise\\" stuff?  A hearty \\"NO!\\"  Yes, this film is a rehash of sorts of \\"Thunderball\\", and though it lacks the 20 minutes of underwater fighting in the original, and maybe (just a maybe) not quite as thrilling a finish (though the 1st version has a speeded up finish which looked quite 'tacky' and maybe just a bit implausible, if not downright impossible), though I thought that this ending was very satisfying and in keeping with what had gone before.  I would also say that the Blu-Ray is a cut above the regular DVD, especially in the sound department.<br />I use a SONY 46\\" HDTV, SONY BLu-Ray player and some Monsoon speakers to do my listening and viewing.  A real shame that Monsoon  are no longer around, as they made a very superior sounding product.  The SONY items I bought from Amazon, and have not been at all disappointed with anything  they have sold to me.  If you have not seen this film, then I hope you will try it out -- it's as good as most of the original Connery Bonds and maybe, in some aspects, better.<br />By the way, try out Amazon's resellers for a great used Blu-Ray -- you'll save a lot of $$$ and still get a terrific film!

B0052VUNHC|1.0|ok, I'll admit at first I loved it. I really did then I thought about somethings that had bothered me...<br /><br />1. Travis and &#34;Pigeon&#34; getting married at the end scared me. In fact it horrified me. From the viewpoint of the daughter of a co dependant Mom and an abusive alchoholic Dad, this Disaster was a predecessor to my worse nightmare.<br />2. all the rave reviews<br /> the fact that all of these women kept talking about how wonderful the &#34; romance&#34; was and how hot Travis was disturbed me. I truly hope you all don't consider this a healthy romantic relationship. Sure the tattoos and the motorcycle where hot. and even the smoking is tollerable. but drinking waaaaaaaaayyyyyy too much to deal with life's problems is not only dangerous but a sign of a much deeper problem.<br />3. VIOLENCE. Don't get me wrong, I love a good fight , I love MMA and UFC. I will even ocasionaly watch some hockey on t.v.<br />BUT I do not believe beating somone to a bloody pulp for making a snide remark at your girlfriend is any way right. Where on Earth where the cops when this was happening!?! even small colleges have campus police.<br />4. Despite all of this. I really want to see the author write a sequel for this book, from Abby(Pigeon) and Travis' children's perspective. So the women who seem to think this is an IDEAL relationship can see how ( if they have this type of relationship) it would affect they're future children.<br />5. even though they are fictional characters, I would like to say somethingto Abby and Travis.<br /><br />Travis, grow up. get into therapy. stay in therapy until you can call women names other than whores and bimbos and actually sincerely mean it. THEN and only then should you even consider dating .<br /><br />Abby, if you have any sense of self preservation and  of protectiveness for your future offspring. RUN. get a restraining order. get into therapy and please work out your parent issues with a shrink. it will help you out in the longrun. and IF your not smart enough to heed my advice, you only have yourself to blame.

0345803485|1.0|This is the most tragic piece of literature I have ever happened upon. (Can this even be called literature?) I could barely get through the first book, between Ana's lip-biting and her inner goddess that had be shouting \\"MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER\\" every time she was referenced. She was a weak character and one that I didn't mind seeing sensibly beaten every once in awhile. I probably would have wanted to smack her around too.<br />Christian was horrible--poor character development and inconsistent personality traits. I couldn't tell if he was bipolar or just a sociopath, which all miraculously changes when he meets Ana and falls in love, and suddenly his mommy issues and desire to dominate are forgotten. *poof*<br />I finished all three books in two days--not because I was so enchanted I couldn't put them down, but because I skipped all the sex scenes after reading the first two. That left about 13% of the book for me to toil through. Which is a disgustingly perverse ratio better suited for the porn industry and should be discouraged in bestselling novels.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|extremely good read... only thing I didn't like was the amount of non-English words... I felt that it detracted from the story a bit... you need to really think about what was being said... maybe there needed to be a glossary of Thai words in the back? I'd urge you to read the stories \\"The Calorie Man\\" and \\"Yellow Card Man.\\" Both stories take place before the events in \\"The Windup Girl.\\" You can download these stories from Night Shade Books on the downloads section. Ebook is called \\"Windup Stories\\" and it's free of charge.

1250006341|5.0|I love this series, so I was eager to see this accompanying book. It doesn't disappoint. Beautiful photographs and lots of yummy details about life above and below stairs just before and during WWI. Julian Fellowes, who writes the series' screenplay, is a spectacular writer with a vast knowledge of the period. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting both the fictional characters and their amazing setting while placing them within their historical context. Worth a long, satisfying look (took mine on the veranda with my feet up, a glass of ice tea in hand, and afternoon sun dappling through the trees).

0307730697|5.0|Fearless : The undaunted courage and ultimate sacrifice of navy SEAL team six operator Adam Brown is an amazing story of a true American hero. I was amazingly, pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this book. Adam's story is truly that of how God can turn something bad into something amazing! Adam struggled with drugs after high school and was headed for destruction, until he found God and his calling in the military. I was truly captivated with his life story, and could not believe that a man who had so many personal struggles could achieve the level of greatness in the SEAL program, which is highly selective and specialized. I loved reading about the details surrounding the SEAL program, and how Adam excelled, despite many curve balls in his life. The ending was obviously difficult and sad to read, but truly this man lived an amazing, extra-ordinary life, and made a difference in others's lives as well. I could not put this book down, and I think it would appeal to anyone interested in a good redemptive story centered around the SEAL program and the US Military. I highly recommend this book.

B001JNNDEW|5.0|Office Space is one of those movies everyone should see before they die. That having been said there is a lot of language and adult themes. Definitely NOT kid friendly. There is a scene where the main character and his almost room mate watch a breast examination on TV.<br /><br />That having been said, this is a hilarious movie that I definitely recommend to everyone. It is generally about an office environment, the horrors of poor management and consultants, and work depression. This movie presents these themes in a humorous way, and as such I know it is used in some actual workplaces to prelude mental health and depression discussions.<br /><br />However for the rest of us non-office dwellers, it is still a great comedy.<br />And it just gets better in HD.<br /><br />PS. I already found an easter egg for anyone interested. At the main menu go to \\"SET UP\\" and press select. Press select again on \\"AUDIO,\\" and then press the up directional arrow to reveal the \\"We are not in Kansas anymore!\\" flair. Press select again to play a mini game. :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved this series from the beginning, and this book was no exception. I thought it was absolutely brilliant for the most part, exciting and well-written as always. Unfortunately, I think the ending let it down greatly, that everything was wrapped up too quickly after dragging out too much a less important plot point earlier on.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />I think the descriptions of how lost and shell-shocked Katniss felt went on too long and made the plot begin to drag but most importantly, I feel like Suzanne Collins sort of chickened out with the final battle. Having Katniss pass out and then just hear what happened later from other people, in my opinion, was a weak ending.

B0000025OP|4.0|Eclipsed by the seminal follow-up release `Blood on the Tracks' and late-career Grammy winner `Time out of Mind', Dylan's 1974-released `Planet Waves' is nevertheless a very good album with some sublime moments. PW marked the beginning of a new creative period for Dylan in the mid-1970s, and is one of his more notable though less appreciated creations in a long and variable career with too many high points to list.<br /><br />This is the first (and only?) studio album Dylan recorded with The Band, his on-stage backing-group led by guitarist Robbie Robertson. The music has a lot of energy, plenty of light and shade and some sublime lyrical moments. The confident and heartfelt voice of an artist in his creative prime is evident here. Highlights are `Something there is about You', `You Angel You' and two very different versions of `Forever Young' - especially the first, slower and more personal variant (Dylan admitted during the recording sessions \\"I been carrying this song around in my head for five years and I never wrote it down, and now I come to record it I just can't decide how to do it\\" so he did several different versions, two of which ended up on the album).<br /><br />The closer `Wedding Song' is a Dylan-poetic classic with warm, poignant and heartfelt lyrics shot through with a hint of humor, reminiscent in lyrical content to `Sara' on the 1976 `Desire' album and in simple-acoustic musical form to `Shelter from the Storm' from BoTT.<br /><br />All in all, PW is an interesting and just-short-of-great album from one of Dylan's two or three most creative periods, the immediate precursor to BoTT and in a similar musical, lyrical and thematic groove. If you like BoTT and you have never heard PW, give it a listen.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow. This book was truely and utterly amazing. I read this book in one sitting! Slammed teaches you about what family truely is about and how important love is. I could go on and on about what this book hs taught me, but I'd rather not. Typing on a Kine can somewhat be tiring. Anyway, the poems especially caught my attention and delivered a VERY powerful meaning(s). Each poem made you feel something and related to the book. This book shows you that these very things can happene in reality when you least expect it. The sickness of her mother really brought tears to my eyes. It felt like I was with Lake every step of the way. All in all, I recommend Slammed for anyone willing to indulge themselves in a well-written book that teaches you lessons that will always stick by you :)

The main character, Christine, was totally pathetic. I was wondering when the book will end after only reading a few pages. The only plus was that it was a quick read for me. Thank goodness I didn't waste anymore time on this book. Two thumbs down...way down!
B007P4OTHO|4.0|I think the CD is a better remaster than the Ryko issue or the last reissue, but the differences aren't that major and certainly not worth the price. I bought this for the vinyl, and it was well worth it. The record sounds better than any CD version, comparable in fact to the original British pressing. So you can hunt around for a good-condition original and pay $50-$100 for it, or you can spend $40 and get a vinyl copy on better-quality brand-new vinyl. Go for it.

0547569653|5.0|Scott Jurek's book, Eat & Run, is inspiring in so many ways.  Although I don't (yet) aspire to be an ultramarathoner, I am a consistent runner (max out at 26.2 races) who greatly appreciates the solitude, freedom, introspection, and feeling of wholeness that comes from running.  This is not a book just for ultra-runners.  For anybody who is serious about body/mind/spirit issues, I think this book is an excellent resource whether  a recreational runner, a frequent racer (no matter the distance), cyclists, and even elite athletes from other sports who will appreciate the discussion about performance, nutrition, competition, camaraderie, and self-doubts.<br /><br /> A handful of things I appreciated about the book:<br />- The coming of age aspect of the book:  In this sense, Scott's life journey is told more like a novel than a biography.  The transparency into Scott's life (both good stuff and bad stuff) as it related to his underdog social status as a kid, his relationship challenges with his father, the tragedy with his mother's sickness, and his circle of friends helped create a meaningful feeling of a kid who faced both normal and abnormal struggles in life while searching for meaning and striving to overcome.<br />- Character development: Again, although this is not a novel, Scott and Steve Friedman did a fantastic job developing the various `characters' in the book. We got to know people really well.  So well, in fact, that if I was left wanting at the end of the book, it was to know more about some of these people in Scott's life (Dusty, first wife, Dad, brother & sister, coach)<br />- The philosophical nature of the book:  Scott's musings on why things happen, how and why you have to knuckle down and \\"sometimes you just do things,\\" finding good in the bad, and grappling with spiritual concepts as he wrestled with where he fit into the bigger world, etc...these aspects of the book made it `real' and readable.<br />- The humility Scott seems to exhibit and the respect for his sport: Admittedly, Scott Jurek has accomplished phenomenal and unimaginable things in the sport of ultra-running.  Legendary status is rightly bestowed up him.  And yet, he has obviously spent a lot of time wrestling with why winning is or isn't important, the balance of giving so much to a sport and yet being given so much back (friendships, character, courage, etc.), the fleeting aspects of success, the challenging unintended results that come with fame (relationship stress, marital strife), and the true meaning behind who we are and what we do.<br />- The journey into healthy eating: While I don't think my lifestyle will ever be fully conducive to a full-on vegan lifestyle, I was encouraged to do even better with my dietary habits - eating vegan when I can, paying closer attention to what my body is telling me after eating certain foods, exploring foods that I wouldn't have otherwise thought about without reading the book, etc.<br />- The recipes:  I liked the variety of different recipes and am eager to attempt them all.  I picked up some nourishment and performance tips, particularly focused on pre-race, in-race, and post-race ideas.<br />- The coaching:  I appreciated the sporadic segments that provided tips for performance - receiving meaningful yet simple advice from a world-class athlete is motivational.<br /><br />Toward the end of the book I found myself moving from being highly inspired to getting very melancholy.  The convergence of events in Scott's life mirror, I think, most lives - getting older, facing disappointments, failed relationships, stress and demands causing us to lose our edge, the temptation to give up, and the circling back to what is ultimately important.  As a 50+ year old who in many respects is looking over my shoulder at my glory days, I even found the melancholy tone of the book to be real and inspiring.  It was cool to see the book end on an impressive high note with the final race that he wrote about in France.<br/><br />If this book is even close to your reading sweet spot as a runner, athlete, health enthusiast, or philosopher it is a must read. Scott has made it to the top of my list as a `famous athlete who with whom I would most desire to share a meal and a beer.\\"<br /><br />Now I am going to go run./><br />If this book is even close to your reading sweet spot as a runner, athlete, health enthusiast, or philosopher it is a must read.

0345803485|1.0|I borrowed this from a friend to see what the hype was about; I went in with low expectations and they were met.  The book starts out as though it were written by a high schooler with foul language and it barely gets better.  When I started the book I kept thinking \\"it has to get better.\\"  Nope.<br /><br />I word more call this a romance novel with a little bit of kinky sex than erotica.  If you feel you must read it, borrow it from someone, definitely not worth paying for.  Book 2 and 3 are slightly better but still not really erotica (I don't think.)  Sure there is a lot of sex but it's not really all that interesting.
0307887448|5.0|I've read a few virtual reality books in the past, the Otherland series is probably the closest analogue to this book, but there's also Snow Crash, Reamde (to a lesser extent), and of course various Gibson novels.<br /><br />This one is among the most fun and entertaining of the lot - up there with Snow Crash. Like Snow Crash it's a bit silly a times, not meant to be taken too seriously, you have to suspend disbelief at times (mainly regarding the finer points of how the virtual reality could really work). but it's a hell of a ride.<br /><br />It's a quick, fun read, well worth the time.
B0068FYZCA|1.0|I LOVE American Graffiti and was so excited about watching it.. that is until I got it home, and popped it in my DVD player.  Everything is so dark, I couldn't see a blasted thing!  I realize this is mostly set at night, but I had previously watched this on Direct TV, and remember it to be much brighter, crisp & clear.  Just wondering what happened when they made this DVD, that it ended up being so dim.  There is a ton of action going on and I'm sitting there just lost, because I can't tell what is going on.  It totally ruined it for my viewing pleasure.  I'm wondering if there is a particular copy I can get that is not so dark.  I don't believe it's my DVD player or television, as I can play other DVD's with no problem.  If anybody knows of a different copy that might be more light friendly, could they please recommend.  The movie itself is 5 stars, unfortunately the actual film/DVD quality is not.  At least not to me anyway.

0345803485|1.0|The book was horrible!! I had heard mixed reviews about this book and decided to read it, but now I really regret it. Basically there is no story line, some woman just wrote pornography and some really boring filler in between sex scenes. I would not recommend this book unless Twilight just isn't doing it for you anymore. The writing style was comparable to Stephanie Meyer. I really wish that I could get this book out of my head now.

When people are tired of trite, uninspired, auto-tune crap that passes for music, then they should be listening to Emile.  I really enjoyed this CD.  Already have it on Repeat. She should definitely become the Next Big Thing!  Her voice is not perfect, but it has such a real rawness to it with a clarity that is hardly found nowadays.<br /><br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

For someone who has always done very well by her fans, it would have been nice. I still buy quite a bit of vinyl and most records come with either a CD or a free download, which is great for portability! (New albums by Paul McCartney, Rush, the Jayhawks, Glen Campbell, etc have all included a download card. The last Springsteen and Lucinda Willaims LPs had a CDs stuffed right in them!)

1401923127|5.0|Lipton is a cell biologist whose \\"study of cells turned [him] into a spiritual person.\\" This is a highly readable science book, defining how beliefs control behavior and gene activity, and consequently the unfolding of our lives. It's a fun learning tool that doesn't dig too deeply, with an uplifting message.<br /><br />Belief truly is biological. One interesting topic that Lipton addresses is the placebo effect. It \\"is quickly glossed over in medical schools so that students can get to the real tools of modern medicine like drugs and surgery. This is a giant mistake. The placebo affect should be a major topic of study in medical school.\\" Of course, Lipton is a realist; he realizes placebo pills are a threat to the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the scalpel holders, and Lipton is not one to mince words.<br /><br />It should be pointed out that this is no dry textbook; it borders in places on metaphysical and holistic speculation. But the book is so darn fun. In this light, do not ignore the epilogue; it's the best part of the book, where Lipton deals with speculative conclusions regarding our \\"me-ness\\" and the power of the mind that transformed him into a bubbly, optimistic believer. His \\"aha\\" moment was the realization that every protein in our bodies is a physical/electromagnetic complement to something in the environment ... that environment being the universe, or to many, God.  As we are inextricably intertwined with the divine, survival of the fittest turns out to mean survival of the most loving.

0316044695|2.0|No witness would be a more apt title.  Setting aside his ignorant political rantings for one minute, his story simply does not add up.  His team is in a sustained fire fight for hours, yet they only have 330 rounds each against \\"hundreds of evil Taliban?\\"  A simple google search reveals that official DOD reports indicate there were only \\"8-10\\" enemy. Indeed, even the official citation for  Luttrell's Navy Cross for abandoning his SEAL Team comrades, only dares to inflate the number to \\"30-40\\" enemy Taliban.  Basically, Luttrell describes a recon operation gone bad, which is immediately overwhelmed with superior enemy forces. Sad, tragic, yes.  In the same way that Custer's last stand was. His story is in the same vein as Jessica Lynch's, and the one fabricated for Pat Tillman. A grave injustice to all Americans.<br /> Another glaring falsehood that has yet to be refuted is the \\"story\\" of a vote by the team to let the goat herders go, rather than murder them to silence them. This has been flatly, and vehemently denied by the military, as well as by the friends and family of Luttrell.  The Lieutenant Mike, in command gave the order to release the civilians because they \\"weren't murderers\\". He embodied the epitome of the American ideals, and my heart weeps for his heroism and sacrifice for all Americans.<br /><br />The true story is that tactical mistakes were made in the planning of this specop and the unit paid in blood. If the book was written in this vein, it would be truly a book worth reading.  However, the author takes NO RESPONSIBILITY, for his actions, or errors that led to the massacre.  No review of tactical or strategic missteps that could be used to improve future tactics or strategy.<br /><br />Instead, he blames \\"liberals\\" and the \\"media\\" for the SEAL's biggest defeat in history.  The prose comes across as juvenile and ignorant. As if written by a community college dropout.  I find the character to be more of an anti-hero.  A conservative, Texan, who eschews self reliance, and personal responsibility, and blames a mythical \\"liberal\\" and a non-existent media on his personal failings.  War is about killing, and sometimes that means our troops are killed.  He fails to accept this fundamental fact.

It certainly is and its history goes back some 5 millennia apparently! However, bankruptcy itself has a more recent history set out in Roman times until we reach the modern legislation we now use: the Insolvency Act 1986.<br /><br />The purpose of the 1986 Act was to provide for the automatic discharge of debtors from bankruptcy after 3 years. The Enterprise Act 2002 reduced the period in most cases to 1 year, making our bankruptcy regime one of the most liberal in the world.<br /><br />What Watson-Gandy achieves here is a practical explanation of the central proposition we have today: the debtor obtains his discharge and release from his bankruptcy debts in exchange for the disclosure of information about his financial affairs, and the surrendering of his assets to his trustee to enable the assets to be released with a view to paying a dividend to the creditors.<br /><br />This book, together with its twin on corporate insolvency, gives practical guidance to the reader on the bankruptcy process, including the processes available to the trustee to enable him or her to get the information and the assets to which he is entitled.<br /><br />The chapter headings, each with short indexes at the front, are cleverly designed to explain in the simplest way how to deal with the main problems the debtor is faced with including: the debtor's bankruptcy petition; the statutory demand and how to set it aside; the creditor's bankruptcy petition and how to respond to it; and the many different types of application which may be made concerning all main aspects of the bankruptcy process.<br /><br />This 400 page book ends with a short chapter on the appeals process and finally an excellent `toolkit' chapter dealing with all the procedural key materials, precedents and skeleton arguments.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author makes intelligent use of the relevant forms in each chapter ending with the following general contents: an objective; the relevant type of form; matters such as fees, service, time limits and evidence; concluding with the key materials and precedents sections which are extremely helpful for the worried client and which answer most of the pertinent questions normally asked.<br /><br />The only thing missing is an index although readers will find that the contents section more than covers any search that is undertaken to find answers to a particular point. This book, without doubt, is a `how to do it' guide to personal insolvency and will be of great importance during this period of economic downturn.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green wouldn't be the first author to sensitively tackle the subject of a teen dying of cancer. Jenny Downham's, \\"Before I Die\\" comes to mind. But he would write the most provocative, and in my opinion, the best. Our narrator, Hazel meets Augustus in a cancer support group. her lungs have been ravaged by the disease and her constant companion is the oxygen tank she wheels along beside her. Augustus is a cancer survivor, and former basketball player who lost the lower half of one of legs to the disease. These are bright, inquisitive kids, full of the smart quippy dialogue that seemed to be muttered by actresses like Emma Stone, or to date myself Janeane Garofalo. Yet I think what makes the book so poignant is in this current culture of social media, and instant celebrity, faced with ones own mortality, the question is asked, How will I leave a mark, how will I be remembered?

Whilst Lord Nicholls, in his Foreword, calls the book `highly stimulating' where dissenting judgments always attract special rather than passing interest, the book's greatest value for the advocate lies with the impact of the dissenting judgment itself as it was at the time it was delivered... and, then, how we would assess the value of the judgment today.<br /><br />Many advocates would probably agree that the dissenting judgment of yesterday is probably going to be the good law of today as jurisprudential development takes account of changing modern opinions and social conditions.<br /><br />The editors, Neal Geach and Christopher Monaghan, have taken a modern look at 19 leading cases where there have been strong dissenting judgments and, not surprisingly, they have agreed with the dissent!<br /><br />Nicholls takes the line that the purpose of the book gives a `second wind', as he calls it, to these acts of dissent in the hope that appropriate law reforms will result. He has a good precedent for this with Herrington which ultimately led to the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.<br />We were particularly pleased to support what Lord Nicholls says - that many of our great modern judges are on the dissentient judges list... and rightly, `a place is found for Lord Denning'.<br /><br />Frankly, the book would lack some weight without Lord Denning's contribution but it is a highly thought-provoking book which will reach out to the law student, the practitioner and the jurisprudent for the excellence of the controversies set out in the six parts.<br /><br />The final few sentences of the Preface sum the book up brilliantly where the editors say that \\"the common law depends on the judiciary being able to offer their own opinion, which even if forming part of the majority or the dissent, could differ from their fellow judges.\\"<br /><br />They go on to say that \\"the survival of the opportunity to articulate the reasoning for dissent would mean the survival of a longstanding and proud record English legal history, and the tradition throughout history more generally.\\"<br /><br />Yes, that's it! That is what this book is all about and why the common law itself remains most important as our general legal concepts whilst explaining by example the excellence of the device of dissent to ameliorate the harshness of some judicial decisions which become outdated quite quickly.majority or the dissent, could differ from their fellow judges.\\"<br /><br />They go on to say that \\"the survival of the opportunity to articulate the reasoning for dissent would mean the survival of a longstanding and proud record English legal history, and the tradition throughout history more generally.\\"<br /><br />Yes, that's it!

Proposals currently under consideration by the Ministry of Justice to encourage more pre-trial mediation will attract a high readership for this new book almost certainly, so Kate Aubrey-Johnson with Helen Curtis are onto a winner here !<br /><br />The beauty of the book and a notable characteristic which distinguishes it from so many other legal advice publications is its crystalline clarity. Praise be - you don't need to be a lawyer to understand it, although if you are a lawyer, you will appreciate its straightforwardness and accessibility.  What wonderful time-savers these two latter attributes are!<br /><br />In the words of Harry Woolf, `this book should provide all the ammunition needed to conduct a successful mediation,' adding that it `deals simply and clearly with the hazards of mediation' and should (therefore) become `the standard companion of mediators....providing a way in which the citizen can, even without legal aid, find a way of resolving his or her problem'.<br /><br />Which is why, if you are not a lawyer, this book, with its practical approach, guides you straight to the right questions to ask regarding mediation (whether you decide to brief a lawyer or not) and the right routes to take through the mediation process.<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, however, and possibly a qualified mediator, you'll appreciate the book's comprehensive and authoritative coverage of its subject matter which examines the full spectrum of issues pertaining to mediation, from the  process itself to the skills, strategies and techniques required and of course much more.<br /><br />All areas of mediation are dealt with including civil, family, workplace and community mediation.<br /><br />The eleven appendices plus case studies, glossary and detailed index of some twenty-six pages are particularly helpful when you're under pressure and pressed for time.<br /><br />With most litigants now encouraged to mediate, this up-to-date handbook should be considered a must-have addition to the mediator's professional library, not to mention an enlightening read for non-lawyers.  The publication date is stated as at May 2012.you are not a lawyer, this book, with its practical approach, guides you straight to the right questions to ask regarding mediation (whether you decide to brief a lawyer or not) and the right routes to take through the mediation process.<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, however, and possibly a qualified mediator, you'll appreciate the book's comprehensive and authoritative coverage of its subject matter which examines the full spectrum of issues pertaining to mediation, from the  process itself to the skills, strategies and techniques required and of course much more.<br /><br />All areas of mediation are dealt with including civil, family, workplace and community mediation.<br /><br />The eleven appendices plus case studies, glossary and detailed index of some twenty-six pages are particularly helpful when you're under pressure and pressed for time.<br /><br />With most litigants now encouraged to mediate, this up-to-date handbook should be considered a must-have addition to the mediator's professional library, not to mention an enlightening read for non-lawyers.

0061122416|3.0|I read this while riding an airplane. It seemed like a child's book to me. It did help to pass the time but the constant reminders to \\"follow your dreams\\" and \\"the universe will help you\\" did get a bit monotonous. The story could be much better if it had been plumped up a bit. However it wasn't, so I was glad it was a short book. I would not consider it life changing, but it was mildly entertaining. I'm struggling to think of anything to say about it. I suspect my review will be about as interesting as I thought the book was. It's a harmless book that tries to stress believing in one's self and tries to inspire the courage for the reader to follow their dreams. Yet somehow it left me with a vaguely creepy 'have I been violated or something' feeling. I blame that on the authors insistence that if you follow your dream the universe will conspire to help you. I find that concept rather insulting now that I think about it. Still it was a mildly fun book I guess.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have been a Rush fan since Moving Pictures, and have enjoyed many of their albums since then... But this one... I can't stop listening to it.  I believe it is because of the thematic \\"concept\\" elements evident in this record.  Someone recommended listening to it in sequence, and I agree with that 100%.  It's like a story, reminiscent of \\"2112\\", and for some reason to me, \\"Analog Kid\\" from \\"Signals\\"... As a high school graduate awaiting college to start, I remember, \\"When I leave, I don't know what I'm hoping to find... and when I leave I don't know what I'm leaving behind...\\"...  and now, 30 years later, with a family, and mid-career - wondering what's next - \\"In a world where I feel so small, I can't stop thinking big...\\"  It even inspired me to go back and read \\"Anthem\\" by Ayn Rand!<br /><br />Like \\"2112\\", there's no individual instrumental track on this one.  I guess some of the songs have pretty lengthy instrumental sections, and that's just fine.  Alex's acoustic parts are terrific, and Geddy's work on bass, wow - let's just say if they measure \\"notes played per instrument per song\\", I think Geddy wins this one. And Neil, well, what can I say?  I can't even air-drum to keep up with him.<br /><br />This album is actually about something.  Even the artwork is fabulous.  Rush really knocks this one out of the park.

B00402FGE4|4.0|I'll come right out with it: I've typically considered the Stargate franchise a cut below the rest.  Now before you immediately close out my review and vote it \\"unhelpful\\", allow me to explain. Despite considering myself a bit of a science fiction connoisseur, I could only go as far as labeling the 1994 feature film Stargate, the one that started it all, as merely an average effort. I went to the theater opening-week, owned the VHS tape then DVD incarnation but there was never any real danger of it dethroning such classics as my Star Trek box set collections.<br /><br />Then there was SG-1, which I considered entertaining enough whenever there wasn't anything better on the tube. It carried on with many of the finer moments of the film, perhaps going as far as improving upon several of them. While it was solid enough for broadcast television, I fear a lack of connection with the characters made it not quite compelling enough to warrant purchase of the colossal 10-season & multiple-movie dvd releases.<br /><br />I did however purchase and toured the complete Atlantis release and found that to be an improvement to the franchise.  It was still a bit too quirky for me to be considered genuine competition for say Star Trek, Firefly or Farscape but it did have some pretty interesting moments/ characters along the way of its 5-season story arc.<br /><br />This brings us naturally to 2009's Stargate Universe.  Met with fairly lackluster critical response, I remember watching an occasional episode on SyFy but found it difficult to get into on account of the serial nature of the prose.  Having not been a part of it steadily, it was a bit too much to follow as a casual observer. Once MGM decided to release the entire show across two box sets, I decided it was time to add the final chapter of the Stargate franchise to the collection and let me start by saying that I'm extremely glad I did.<br /><br />SG:U follows the adventures of a present-day, multinational exploration team who \\"gate\\" onto an Ancient spaceship known as Destiny, which happens to be multiple-millions of light years outside the Milky Way. A good part of the plot centers on the crew's discovering secrets of the massive vessel while hoping to find a means of returning to Earth.<br /><br />Like all Stargate entries prior, there is no shortage of alien races and technology to help & hinder our crew of humans along the way.  This show, however, is certainly the most serialized of all the SG entries, truly coming off as a single story thread that just so happens to span 40-episodes.  Additionally, because the core of the tale takes place on an alien spacecraft, the reliance upon the stargate itself is certainly not the center-point of each episode as it's been in entries past.<br /><br />The show is often considered the \\"darkest\\" of the franchise to date- a seemingly dual-purpose description as it tackles some themes (like homosexuality) rarely covered in the mythos as well as having the distinction of being the darkest set/ lit; after all it does take place in space a majority of the time rather than on earth or in a sprawling cityscape.<br /><br />The characters in this show take a bit longer to accept than those in entries past but once the first few episodes are underway, the dynamic proves very, very effective.  I may go as far as to say some of the most memorable and likable characters of the franchise to date.  Not to worry if you find yourself missing series staples General O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) or Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks), as each make appearances here as do some of our favorite Atlantians (Dr. Rodney McKay played by David Hewlett for example).<br /><br />You've surely heard such buzzwords as \\"dark & edgy\\" used to describe the show but I would counter these claims by reminding that this series served to fill the void left by Ronald D Moore's reimagined Battlestar Galactica and, when compared directly, is far less sexual, violent or as alcohol swilling/ cigarette smoking dependent.  Of course the flip side to this is that there are undeniable influences of BSG present in SGU: Gritty/ character driven drama set in deep space, themes of survival outweighing exploration and the desperation of being cut off from one's home world.  Additionally the show makes use of the almost \\"documentary\\" style of shooting that comes with more handheld shots/ jitters rather than the laser precise steadycam stuff of big budget motion pictures.<br /><br />Pacing starts off a bit slow & cobby as is expected (the opposite of BSG in fact; which started off downright explosive and concluded fairly anticlimactically) but builds into 43-minute episodes that flow with orchestral precision.  By the time season 2 gets underway, the formula is absolutely perfected; with episodes that conclude with just enough of a cliffhanger flavor to crave \\"just one more episode\\" even when it's 3:00am and you have to be up in a few hours.<br /><br />Addressing the darkness (looks) of the show- I can attest that the broadcast of the show did indeed seem poorly lit but the situation is nearly completely remedied by high definition.  The Blu-ray reveals details that were otherwise lost to the shadows of course but even the standard DVD when viewed on a high def television through an upscaling DVD player looks remarkably better than the standard def broadcast in terms of contrast.<br /><br />In conclusion the biggest tragedy here is that the show has the unfortunate distinction of being the shortest-lived of the Stargate television franchise (2 seasons compared to Atlantis' 5 and SG-1's 10).  Make no mistake though; this is in no way a reflection on the quality of the show itself, which, in my opinion anyway, is by far the strongest of the trio.  The full-time space element finally pushes the Stargate franchise into more traditional space opera territory, a good thing in my opinion, without sacrificing the show's reliance upon mythology, alien technology and just a tad bit of zaniness usually absent in hardcore science fiction.  Perhaps the New York Times' Mike Hale put it best when he said that with Universe, Stargate was finally \\"catching up\\" to the long-running Star Trek franchise.ual, violent or as alcohol swilling/ cigarette smoking dependent.

B00009R86L|1.0|I used this pad briefly on my Tamrac 606 bag loaded with an EOS 5D, 2 lenses and Speedlite. This is a rigid, heavy and hard pad: does not warp around or mold to my shoulder but, instead, sits on top and bites into my flesh like an angry dog. It's also really heavy and makes the strap cumbersome. The original Tamrac strap pad is more comfy: softer and flexible enough to warp around my shoulder and chest and, thus, distribute weight across a larger area. All I can say is the USPS of yesteryear had shoulders of steel. Incidentally I checked out my postman's shoulder pad and it doesn't look anything like this one: real leather, longer, wider, more flexible and no velcro.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, read it in two evenings.  It's a really fun read and an interesting story.  I also think that parts of the world the author paints are a definite possible future 50 or so years down the road.  As someone who plays MMO type games, I expect a massive, virtual, immersive system to one day exist.  No, this is not an original idea created by this author, it has been explored many times.  He does quite a good job of developing his version, though.

Either way it is fun to play when you have downtime but I definitely wouldn't pay $4.99 for it...glad I got it when it was free :)  I guess I was hoping for more than what I got.

The lead actors were alright, but that was about it.  I can't really say anything good about this film. But I can say don't rent it and DEFINITELY don't buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun..highly addictive...would recommend to anyone looking for a fast paced and easy game.  wish it were easier to upgrade
B007K3JCAE|2.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but was really disappointed to find out that the \\"digital copy\\" isn't in fact a digital copy.  Instead, you have to sign up to stream the movie from UltraViolet or download an app to be able to play the movie.  Why bother competing against Apple?  They have a much less confusing, less time-intensive system already in place.  I don't want to register with another company and give my private information away to yet another company.  I don't want to have to access a different service to play different movies - I just want to be able to access them all on I-tunes.  Now I have to remember which movies I have in which system?  Plus, what guarantee do I have that this service will even be around in a couple of years.  Every other company that has gone up against Apple in this way has failed, and with how awkward and user-unfriendly UltraViolet is I don't see it being the exception.  The movie gets 5 stars.  The combo pack gets 2 stars because of the \\"digital copy,\\" since I now have to pay an additional $19.99 if I want to buy the I-Tunes digital copy I can actually use.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out, and every time I listen to it, I enjoy a new and wonderful nuance.  It's hard to describe the exact sound of this group; they've got a bit of old school to them.  The lead singer has been compared to Janis Joplin, but I think she way surpasses Janis (and I'm a Janis fan).  But this group also has a solid rock sound.  Like I said, it's difficult to put a genre label on this group, so I guess I'll just have to call them \\"Fantastic!\\"

B006PTZNSY|1.0|This is album is a pop album, not a hip hop album. If it is considered hip hop, then this album is garbage. I don't know what route she wanted to take but it's a total fail. This album is an easy skip or ignore for the year.
B007WA56OQ|5.0|Let's face it. There is no shortage of greatest hits albums, especially for Kylie. But this one, I love. I've loved Kylie since Fever. It came out when I was in 9th grade and I've followed her ever since.<br />What's great about this greatest hits album is that it is strictly just hits and for me, reminded me of songs I listened to when I was really little and had no idea they were by her.<br />This greatest hits also includes music from Aphrodite. In my opinion, her best album to date. A great compiliation, and a great cd to keep in the car!
B0078JRFZE|5.0|This a terrific series.  The acting is strong, plot is engaging and you will love watching Maggie Smith having a wonderful time playing the dowager.  This is one of the best satires of the early 20'th century  Brits; their upper class and their servants.  Whether it is meant as satire or not, it's brilliant fun.
1469984202|5.0|I do not throw out \\"5/5\\" very often, but Hugh Howey hit the nail on the head with this one.  Fantastic and compelling read.  Well paced, interesting charachters searching for meaning in a seemingly meaningless silo-world.  Well done!
1440503257|3.0|I picked this up for a friend of mine who I could quite confidently call a \\"Harry Potter Nutter\\" - that's definitely not me.  She's big into cooking, so I thought she'd like it.  She did find it amusing, as a perusal through the book prompted many \\"Oh yeah\\" type comments.<br /><br />As I'm not a cook, I can't say how well the recipes are constructed.  However, both of us thought the book could have done with some pictures.<br /><br />The target here is obviously hard core Harry Potter fans.  If you're one of them, and have the inclination (and ability) to cook, then you might want to look at it.  If you're a non potter head (like myself), then the book is probably lost on you.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must say that I really enjoyed these books. The premise was a unique take on the apocalyptic end of our world and a solution we might have taken to win in the end, or at least to continue.<br /><br />Sometimes I just wanted to speed read to the next part dealing with the characters I wanted to read about but that was a minor thing. I will add this author to my goto list and watch for new books to read. Thanks.
0062119044|4.0|I picked up this book because I was interested in the premise of a woman who is ambivalent about her child.  I often feel like women are pressured to view having children as the end-all-be-all of their existence, and I liked the honesty of the character in admitting the resentment she felt toward the child that forced her to give up the life she loved.  I don't have children myself for that same reason, and I wonder if some of the mothers I know ever have those feelings.  That said, I think this character did come off as overly selfish at times.  I also did find the tone and language of the book pretentious at times, though it seemed reasonable for that character to be talking this way.<br /><br />On the whole, I found it to be a compelling read that really made me think and stayed with me for awhile.  If you just want to read a book for lighthearted entertainment, this is probably not what you want.  If you are a mother who would find it disturbing to read about a woman who doesn't have the sort of unconditional love you'd expect for her child, this probably isn't for you either.  If you want an emotionally challenging novel that will make you think and question what motherhood, love, and responsibility are about, I recommend this.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|Good story, great characters, and very well done action scenes.  The addition of Mycroft was handled nicely and brilliantly portrayed by Stephen Fry. The production team are clearly huge Sherlock fans, and the actors have definitely done their homework. That comes across in the movie in a positive manner.<br /><br />The extra features on the Blu Ray were clearly value add to the consumer.  Nice juicy behind the scenes stuff with the cast and crew.<br /><br />What wasn't value add to the consumer was the added cost of the Ultraviolet streaming service.  Ultraviolet is NOT a \\"digital copy.\\" It requires the consumer to have yet one more set of login/password combinations to track, (I had to get separate accounts on both the Ultraviolet site and the Paramount site in order to \\"register\\" the only Ultraviolet movie I have access to.  Not going to go through that user hostile process again) in order to stream a movie they already have both the Blu Ray & DVD versions of.  The Ultraviolet support for mobile devices, as well as non-mobile units like Roku, is, to be generous, poor.<br /><br />Recap: Great Movie put out by a studio that has little or no respect for their customer base.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I taught a history class at a small private school years ago.  My materials included Tom Lehrer's \\"Merry Minuet\\", Bob Dylan's \\"Hard Rain\\" (which Dylan wrote during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and described as representing all the songs he did not think he would live to write) and Dr. Strangelove.<br /><br />I told my students, \\"None of the events in this film ever happened, but this is what it FELT like to live through those days.  We really, truly believed that we were liable to die at any moment, and that there was nothing we could do about it.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone over forty who wants to revisit the trauma, and anyone under forty who wants to understand why we are the way we are.
0061692042|1.0|The reason I decided to read this is because it sounded good in a magazine write-up (O, I think). Unfortunatey, it was such a waste of time.  Can you say monotonous?  Ok, I'd say 400 pages of it was boring.  Maybe an English lit professor would enjoy this book, but for someone who reads for pleasure and not to study/dissect a book, it fails miserably as a good read.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|So glad I got this app when it was free but having used it I would have paid. Love it. Works great on my Acer Tablet.If you like to mess with your pics definitely get this one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am not sure what I was expecting but I bought the book based on the reviews on TV and word of mouth.  Harlequin Romance I was told.  Pure pornography I would say.  Great writing I was told, basic and simple I would say.  I will not not be reading books 2 and 3, even if I ever finish book 1.  Reading a little sex is fun, but this is just weird.

Its not often you get a CD where every song is good and this does that for sure. For old fans you will love it and for new fans you will be surprised. I promise it won't be long and you will be singing the Harmonies again just like the Old Days. Favorite songs are God Made The Radio, Private Life of Bill and Sue, and Summer's Gone will make you tear up. Great job Boys. Have a great tour.
1741797802|2.0|I've used several editions of LP India for trips to India in the past. I'm preparing for another trip and purchased this new edition. What a disappointment! The format and content has changed dramatically, and not for the better. Some of the changes seem thoughtless. For example, the section on train travel (a major form of transport in India!) is 1-1/2 pages long!! A table with examples of fares is still there (although I recall specific destinations listed before), but there is no interpretation of classes of fare!!! The novice traveller to India has no way of knowing what how a \\"chair car\\" differs from \\"3AC\\"?  Are you kidding me?? I guess I'll look in my old edition!
B001974DG0|5.0|I love this book.  It's one of my favorite Dean Koontz novels.  I read it several years ago, but had to purchase it again for my Kindle.  Dean Koontz uses his literary skills and love of golden retrievers to write an extremely compelling book.  In only Koontz style, he manages to make the humans monsterous, and the monsters more human.  A wonderful read.

1466401885|5.0|This book was definitely what I was looking for after finishing Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy!  Some of the reviews I read about this book that didn't give a good review are obviously not interested in this type of book or this category all together.  Those who can see the underlying message in a story can have a better appreciation for this book!  It brings about a world of love triangles, overcoming fears, and the actuality of how college students live and act.  This is a young love story that describes a girl who has a past that she is trying to run from when she meets a guy that fits some of the characteristics in a man that she can relate to her past.  It is a discovery of a how two different people have gone through difficult struggles in their lives and overcome them.  It describes a girl who tries to push away anything that reminds her of her difficult past and a guy who struggles with love and relationships with women because of his own personal loss in his past.  The two learn that even though they think they don't want any future that reminds them of their pain of their past, they can overcome and get through it together by giving it a chance.  It's a story of how two people can overcome their fears and flaws to be with the one they truly love.  As far as the fighting...we have professional fighters everywhere and these are COLLEGE STUDENTS! Most college kids would do a lot of different things to make money to make it through college.  Awesome love story and discovery of how to work through problems in your life! I recommend this book highly!

0345803485|5.0|This Trilogy was a fantastic read.  I had people telling me to read it for a while and didn't get in any rush to start but once I did I could not stop reading!  Young love, erotic, overwhelming, and sensational are the best ways for me to define this book and the rave focused around it is completely understandable!  Worth every second of reading! After reading all three books I am hoping for a new one from his point of view!

This cover provides ample protection against the elements if you remember to use it(I've always been afraid the grill is too hot, then I fall asleep on the couch, then the rain comes, then I've gotta wait for the cover to dry out to throw it on top). It allows for the tool holder to fit easily under it. Overall, some covers are a pain in the butt to get on, this one is not, I kind of flip it up and get it to parachute and pull it down over it, easy peasy lemon squeezy.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|Led Zeppelin's MOTHERSHIP is a greatest hits package that spans the band's career.  Clocking in at 24 songs, these tracks have been mastered to make them crisper, cleaner, and louder than ever before.  Unfortunately, this remastering has created the collection's biggest complaints.  By making all the instruments louder, some of the dynamics have been lost.  I find this especially noticeable in instances when clean (or acoustic) guitars give way to Page's crunchy distortion.  Take \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" or \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" for example.  Part of the impact of these songs is the fact that they start soft before overlaying guitars boom in.  Due to this, the original albums are preferred over this remastered mix.<br /><br />However, this new mix is only a small gripe.  The songs are still great.  Robert Plant's voice is still howling, Jimmy Page's guitar is still crunchy, Bonham's drums are still pounding, and John Paul Jones' bass is still solid.  Everything that made this band great is collected on this greatest hits collection.  For new listeners, this collection can't really be beaten.  The tracks provided here represent some of the best of the band, and give unfamiliar listeners a good idea of what to expect from the band (and what albums to start with).  For longtime fans who already own the albums, skip this entry.
0671646788|5.0|When I received the book, I randomly opened a chapter and started reading it and I knew I was hooked to it. A lot of people read books and analyze it. I personally feel that EVERY book has at least one thing that can be learned to add value to our lives and other's lives. And this book has a bunch of them! I have not finished the book yet but every page teaches me something new or helps me generate new and positive ideas to improve my life and/or other's lives.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is think if it is worth the time and money. In 3 words - \\"Yes, it is!!\\"
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush's 20th studio album, CLOCKWORK ANGELS, finds the band revitalized and reinvigorated.  It is hard to believe, listening to this album, that the band at work here has been kicking around since the 70's.  While the songwriting here suggests that the band is experienced, the energy and passion feels very young.  Lee's vocals are strong, his bass thudding, Lifeson's guitarwork is just as interesting, and Peart's drums are mindboggling.  CLOCKWORK ANGELS is one of the best Rush albums in several years.<br /><br />Beginning with the excellent \\"Caravan,\\" the album chronicles a tale about a time traveler journey's.  The motif of \\"time\\" is apparent throughout the album (even in the album's name and artwork).  Neil Peart's imagination fuels the lyrics here; part science-fiction, part fantasy, part sweeping epic, apparently a novelization of CLOCKWORK ANGELS is in the work.  This opening track announces the band's energy; it's stomping, chugging, and energetic.  Many of these songs coalesce with one another -- these tracks are strong on their own, but they work the best within the context of the album.  The album ends with \\"The Garden,\\" a primarily acoustic number that doubles as a thoughtful meditation on the mediation of life and time.  Perhaps it's an unconventional way to end such a heavy album, but in retrospect, CLOCKWORK ANGELS couldn't end any other way.<br /><br />My only real gripe with CLOCKWORK ANGELS is the production.  As with most of Nick Raskulinecz's production, there seems to be a lot of compression going on.  It chokes the dynamics of the band, but it makes them sound louder and rawer.<br /><br />For fans of Rush, this album is a treat.  For listeners unfamiliar with the band, CLOCKWORK ANGELS turns out to be a good place to start listening (along with MOVING PICTURES perhaps).  Listeners who don't care much for Rush will probably not find a lot here to convince them otherwise; it's a lot of what made the band important in the first place.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Caravan,\\" \\"Seven Cities of Gold,\\" and \\"The Garden.\\"ks to sample/download: \\"Caravan,\\" \\"Seven Cities of Gold,\\" and \\"The Garden.\\"
B004FVHBXY|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars for the simple fact that someone had the patience to make a movie like this.when I went to see this in the theater it wasn't exactly what I expected but because of the effects and leo being in it I had to see it. It was a lot of explaining at times, but there had to be in order for you too understand a movie of this magnitude. My girlfriend was board to tears but kind of got interested at the end when things started happening. Chris Nolan is quickly rising on my list of favorite directors
B0081TZUAW|4.0|What is it that you enjoy about Garbage?  Is it Shirley Manson's vocals and attitude?  Is it the band's dark lyrics?  Is it the mix of loud guitars and electronics?  Is it the streamlined, glossy coat of production the band gives alternative rock?  NOT YOUR KIND OF PEOPLE includes all of these things.  As someone who has enjoyed all of the band's releases, this newest album does not disappoint.<br /><br />The first album in 7 years (since 2005's BLEED LIKE ME), it doesn't sound like the band has taken a day off from work.  I didn't particular like the lead single, \\"Blood for Poppies.\\"  Although the song begins with a nice, dirty guitar riff and good verses, the chorus doesn't sound like typical Garbage songwriting.  Garbage (in particular, producer/drummer Butch Vig) does a great job of taking a genre that is normally pretty unsettling, overly-aggressive, and inaccessible and making it immediate and accessible.  The band has done this for years, and they do it again here.<br /><br />For fans of music from the 90's, Garbage is definitely a band to check out.  NOT YOUR KIND OF PEOPLE wouldn't be a bad place to start listening, but I would recommend starting with their debut and working forward.  For pre-existing fans of Garbage, this record is well worth the price and time.  It's a great addition to the band's consistent catalog.  Standout songs to sample/download: \\"Control,\\" \\"Not Your Kind of People,\\" and \\"Automatic System Habit.\\"<br /><br />Additional release information:  The deluxe version of [[ASIN:B007H9B8FS NOT YOUR KIND OF PEOPLE]] contains 4 additional tracks: \\"The One,\\" \\"What Girls Are Made Of,\\" \\"Bright Tonight,\\" and \\"Show Me.\\"  Not only do these songs extend the length of the album, but they're good in their own right.  Recommended for long time Garbage fans.

B00001OH7V|5.0|[This review is based on the digital, MP3 version of \\"HEROES\\". These tracks are the same from the 1999 remasters.]<br /><br />Fans of Bowie are probably pretty familiar with the story by now. Coming off the heels of his album STATION TO STATION, Bowie found himself pushed to his limits by his crippling cocaine addiction. In an effort to change his life and escape his drug use, he fled to Berlin with Iggy Pop and producer Brian Eno. In Berlin, Bowie's creative process would become revitalized; the way that he envision music was fundamentally changed. From late 1976 to 1979, he would create a trio of albums that would stand as some of his most memorable and enduring work: LOW, \\"HEROES\\", and LODGER.<br /><br />As one may expect of Bowie, \\"HEROES\\" sounds nothing like HUNKY DORY, ZIGGY STARDUST, or YOUNG AMERICANS. It doesn't even sound like the same songwriter is at work either. Many of these songs reject traditional songwriting conventions, and find Bowie in a writing music unlike anything he ever did (or would ever do again). The first half of the album is stacked with the more conventional songs on the album. While the eponymous \\"Heroes\\" is the most accessible, it is surrounded by other gems that may be less immediate to those unfamiliar with Bowie. The latter half of the album is occupied with a trilogy of instrumental tracks: the secretly sinister \\"Sense of Doubt,\\" the ambient \\"Moss Garden,\\" and the smokey/chilling \\"Neukoln.\\" The final track \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" snaps the album back into focus, like waking out of a dream. It's a head-bopping, uptempo song that borders on experimental disco. The difference between this track and the preceding instrumentals is jarring, but the song works well to repeat right back to the first track \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"<br /><br />\\"HEROES\\" contains guitar work from Robert Fripp (of the legendary progressive rock band King Crimson). Much like Stevie Ray Vaughan's turn in LET'S DANCE, the guitar work here is tastefully done. It doesn't stand out or demand attention, but Fripp's work does well to layer and texture these songs. Similiarly, Bowie's saxophone does great to blend in (like in the title track), and adds a chilling echo in \\"Neukoln.\\"<br /><br />This album is wonderful, but LOW still stands as my favorite of the trilogy. Often overlooked, \\"HEROES\\" it is a tour-de-force of creativity. For listeners unfamiliar with Bowie, I would recommend starting with his earlier work and working forward. Otherwise, LOW might be another good starting point (as it essentially rebooted Bowie's career), and its music is a little less alienating than some of the tracks here. Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Heroes,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" and \\"The Secret Life of Arabia.\\" Fantastic album -- give it a listen!t doesn't stand out or demand attention, but Fripp's work does well to layer and texture these songs.

B002F6FQGK|4.0|Florence + The Machine are one of the few groups that are able to perfectly straddle the line between art and pop.  The group's debut, LUNGS, is a demonstration of great songwriting that is immediate, accessible, earnest, and streamlined.  Starting with the beginning ukelele strums in \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" to the closing howls of vocalist Florence Welch in \\"You've Got the Love,\\" this album is consistently good.<br /><br />Not only does F+tW straddle the art/pop line, but the music also strikes a great balance of natural rhythm and electronic instrumentation.  At times, the music is tribal and energetic (like the opening track for example), and at others, the rhythm section is completely electronic (like in \\"Howl\\").  The best songs on the album come from when the group tries to incorporate multiple musical facets into one track.  When the group shoehorns their song into a defined genre, the results are middling; \\"Kiss With A Fist,\\" for example, is interesting for its punk-rock departure, but it isn't the brightest spot on the album.  Florence Welch's vocal delivery is mostly pretty good, however, there are a few times when her voice wavers or falters (particularly in \\"I'm Not Calling You A Liar.\\")  Her voice would become stronger with the follow-up [[ASIN:B005RAO0GS CEREMONIALS]].<br /><br />LUNGS is a great album, and a fantastic debut from a group that is worth watching.  Rarely does a band deserve the mainstream attention it receives, but Florence + the Machine have been able to reach massive audiences with their brand of music.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" and \\"Hurricane Drunk.\\"  Highly recommended.

0871404133|5.0|Many readers may have read EO Wilson's expert work on ecology, ants and evolutionary selection in order to think through deeper insights into the human behaviour and history. In this book, Wilson takes the guesswork out of it, providing logical and evidence-based views on the human condition.  He posts a question in his Prologue which considers the life of the restless and irrepressible artist, Gauguin - is the human condition understandable through the scientific enquiry? Wilson is one of the best qualified people on the planet to weigh up the importance of individual, group and multi-level selection for a species, areas of science directly relevant to Gaugin's question.<br /><br />From a human perspective, the different mechanisms of tribalism are examined and its causes are analysed, pointing the finger past religion to competition for resources. An examination of the phenomenon of eusociality in insects, while fascinating in its own right, lends insights for human behaviour and societies. The reader is taken on an expertly guided tour of contemporary theories in social evolution, sometimes a little theoretical but easy enough to get your head around. The logical and simply explained chapter `Insects take the giant leap' is a key to understanding one of the most interesting aspects of biology. Similarly, `The forces of social evolution' sums up the gains and losses of the last few fifty years of research in this area, essentially comparing the merits of group selection and kin selection theory.<br /><br />The final parts of this book ask `What are we?' and `Where are we going?', collating information provided earlier or from referenced arguments to examine the roles and importance of language, culture, morality and creativity. Insights abound and set the stage for Wilson's final chapter 'A new enlightenment' which achieves two objectives: it shows that scientific enquiry can lead us to the big answers, and offers a lucid, optimistic and compelling synthesis of what really matters and where to next for human society. This book is transformative - some of Wilson's specific interpretations will be challenged but what's new about that - he has taken on an enormous topic and provided a synthesis unequalled in scope and contemporary relevance. I am pleased to see this point is drawn out by the significant and ranging commentary offered by the reviews at this site.at really matters and where to next for human society.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very well worth the download.  fun and similar to Mario.  Lep is cute and at a free price what's not to like?
B0077SGMXM|5.0|the game has a good level of difficulty and it has a ton of different courses.  it is a great time killer.
0670022411|5.0|Reading this book for the 2nd time, and I really don't re-read books, since the sequel is due our shortly and I read it a year ago. Can't wait for the sequel. Get on board people.  It is by no means a quick read, but it is oh so good.
B0086700CM|3.0|Love the game have it on all my devices, but on the androids it runs slow.  You will be running and all of a sudden it will begin to slow down, which almost always leads to me dying.

B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Hillarious had quite a few laugh out loud moments while reading this and have recommended it to friends ..it was an escape with some chilling familiar scenarios!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book I couldn't put down.  It is so visually presented that you can put yourself there.<br /><br />This is erotica but so beautifully written that you can't help but order 2 and 3.

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|It okay for a hidden object game, though like a few others some of the scenes don't make sense to the situation. That being said, good for FAOTD though I would not pay to play it as the type of game only moderately interests me and it is not.much different from others.
B005TKC2P2|3.0|but serious it just the same as stuff in a different package. Beautiful writing but little substance and all wrapped in Murakami's formula.
B005MLQUY2|5.0|Each episode is compelling. The character development is rich. The issues that each case raises are thought provoking.  The only aspect that is a little unrealistic is Kalinda's expertise!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have NEVER left a review for a book in my life!  After reading some of the horrible reviews left for this book by people who obviously don't read to escape from reality and enjoy the fantasy I was compelled to say something.  Christian Grey is a dream! He's a man who takes control without abusing it, he's enigmatic, attentive, caring, oh so romantic and fifty shades of f@&$ed up at no fault of his own.  I have read all 3 books in the time span of less than a week!  I was enthralled and captivated.  Ana's inner monologe had me laughing so hard tears were cascading down my cheeks. This is the first book of it's \\"class\\" that I have read and I can't say that I will be searching out books with this sort of sexual.... But, I am definitely anxious for another book from this amazing author!  Thank you so much E L James.  You gave me a weeks worth of shear delight, humor, fantasy and, let's just say, a few men will be given these books for note taking :). Thank you again
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ever had.I play this so much. only had it for three days and I have three people
B001POX73C|5.0|I have to admit, when I first began reading, I found the book a little...well, daunting.  Some of the sentences, while extremely clever, funny and well-crafted, are so long I'd forget what I was reading about and have to go back and re-read it!  But again, they were very clever, so I did, in fact, re-read them!<br /><br />I also found much of the dialog style rather awkward.  Maybe it's just because I'm an American and so many of the male characters speak like the bad American stereotype of the English.  \\"Going to be open with you.\\"  Or \\"Never liked him.\\"  I kept waiting for a, \\"Pip, pip!  Cheerio!\\"<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!  Throughout the book, I didn't care at all for Kitty's \\"love\\".  So when I reached the end -- and I do mean the very end -- of the book, I cheered!  Literally cheered.  The ending was absolutely worth reading the book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age is a great game for kids. I am a kid and ice age is one of my favorate games its really fun when you collect coins from the animals. Find scrat every day and Yokohama might win acorns :)
0307716546|4.0|I loved Rosamund Lupton's first novel Sister and so I was looking forward to her second outing; while not quite as good as her first book it was still a very satisfying story.<br /><br />While attending an outdoor sports day at her son's school Grace his horrified to see the school is on fire. Both her young son and teenage daughter are in the building and without hesitation Grace runs into the building to save her children.  The aftermath of the devastating fire forms the center of this intriguing mystery.<br /><br />Both Grace and her daughter Jenny have sustained grievous injuries and they are both in comas. Yet they seem to be able to leave their bodies and wander the hospital, seeing and hearing everything but only able to communicate with each other. Slowly the two women come to understand that the fire was arson and when it appears the police are making a rush to judgment they decide to try and learn the truth. But what good can they do if they cannot communicate with anyone?<br /><br />If you can accept the unusual premise you are in for an excellent mystery, which also explores a mother's love for her children as well as the bonds of marriage and family. It's a well-plotted mystery with enough red herrings and twists to make you keep turning the pages to find out what really happened that fateful day. Even with the shades of paranormal this is a well-done suspense story that I devoured in a couple of days.  I think the ending was a bit unbelievable, but overall a very solid and thought provoking read.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple run is okay. I mean sometimes it freezes for a couple minutes and then just goes back to the kindle homepage. Also, I really think they could of made it a bit more interesting as well instead of just making it go on and on.

B000OPPSXK|4.0|while #s 34-41 are more problematic. Wonderful playing by an unbloated RCOA, great winds and excellent sound.<br />In #s 21-33, tempi are just and orchestral balance is clear.  Emotionally there is sufficient feeling amid tempi on the quick side: G Minor angst in #25, serenity in #29, Parisian sizzle in #31. #33 is fine in<br />an extremely crowded field (Szell, Carlos Kleiber, Tate, Jochum).  While #34 is quite good, the Szell/RCOA<br />version eclpses it- more exciting outer movements and a deeply poetic second movement. I find the Haffner<br />middling c.f Szell and Dohnanyi-both more celebratory and energized. The introductions to #s 36 and 38 are<br />are too quick, while the second movement of #38 is even quicker (disastrously I think).  Some of the Linz drags. #38 is partly redeemed by the body of its<br />first movement (with the exposition repeat c.f Jochum/RCOA) and its entire finale- both exemplary. Of the final three, #39 is the most effective. The Jupiter is deficient in grandeur and propulsion, while the first movement of #40 is beautiful but too<br />slow-the remainder is quite good, especially the lovely second movement.<br /><br />Of competing sets,all  I recommend Tate/EMI most.  Other selected recommendations (see my reviews):<br />  Szell in #s 28, 29, 33-35 and 39-41<br />  Jochum in #s 30,33, and 35-41<br />  Dohnanyi in #s 35-41<br />  Carlos Kleiber in #s 33 and 36<br />  Klemperer/Testament #s 29,41, 38,39 and EMI in #s 25,31 and 40<br />  Steinberg in # 35 and 41 (mediocre sound)+ a fine #40<br />  Sawallisch in #s 38 and 39<br />  Kubelik in #s 35-41 +25<br />  Reiner in #s 35 and 40

B006BGZJJ4|4.0|With it being a white cable instead of black as most are it makes it easy to find. using it is easy and works well for areas like mine where wifi isn't available as well as cable etc. a bit of a struggle at first trying to figure out how to use to transfer books etc to kindle.
0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman caught my attention a few weeks ago in a discussion on the BBC's Newsnight with two of our current crop of hands-off-business evangelists. One was a particularly smug and odious know-all, and it was a pleasure to see him seen off as easily and urbanely as he was by Krugman. This gentleman's message to humanity appeared to be a version of what was known 80 years ago as either 'Say's Law' or `the Treasury View', which enunciated that any government spending would by its nature displace a corresponding amount of private spending. To anyone except a confirmed believer this must seem blithering nonsense, but I reflected that the person in question must know far more about the matter than I do, that I am not qualified to assess his grasp of such theories vis-a-vis Professor Krugman's, however we the public are simply abdicating our democratic duty if we leave the debate to the professionals and allow ourselves to be led slavishly by whichever school of oratory appeals more to us.<br /><br />One has to start somewhere, and Krugman appealed more to me, so I picked up this recent book to see whether my own instinctive belief-system was gaining impetus or being beaten back. Regardless of political stance, I think any reasonable person has to admit that Krugman puts his case well. However I am also in no doubt that we are suffering a dangerous deficit of reasonable persons when it comes to economic argument. Obviously this can't be the wholly-owned vice of either side in the dispute, but Krugman's placid argumentation throws into sharp relief what has been plain for years, namely that the right wing are runaway winners in the petulance stakes, and that they have for some time been dominating the conversation through volume and irascibility. What Krugman does is basically what he did with the bore he demolished on Newsnight - he deals with the intellectual arguments intellectually, and he presents his reasoning intelligibly to the general public. That will of course get him nowhere with those who just do not want to know. This sector of society includes intellectuals, idealists and dreamers, and the category of persons who, to adapt Swift, would die for `no Keynesianism' and know not if it be Man or Horse. What they have in common is that they are on a high, but every high will over time be laid low like every mountain and hill in Handel's Messiah, and the impact of Krugman's advocacy really depends on whether he is attacking a school of thought that is on a rising or breaking wave.<br /><br />Time by now must be starting to run out for the right wing, this book (and others) are suggesting to me. Modern communications allow the Keynesian school to be heard one way or another, the fire gradually dies in quasi-religious politico/economic convictions, that being the nature of trends and fashions generally, and to their great credit the Keynesian intellectuals are refusing to be shouted down. Something strange would have happened in academe if Krugman or the proponent of any contentious viewpoint were not told by his adversaries that failing to agree with them proves ipso facto that he does not understand the subject; and that kind of petitio principii can be kicked straight into touch by the least instructed reader, here and in academic disputes generally. What Krugman is doing is to restore Keynes. If anyone argues that Keynes is out of date, just think of the person I mentioned at the start who was thrilled by his rediscovery of something even older, and reflect on Galbraith's dictum that there are actually no new concepts in economics.<br /><br />At no point does Krugman suggest that debts, deficits and inflation are not serious issues, and don't believe anyone who tells you that he does. His message is that that they are not the whole story, and that the medicine being dished out is worse than the disease, not least in making the disease itself worse. This may actually be dawning on Britain's beloved Prime Minister Dave andhis Chancellor Boy George who have been pursuing deficit reduction regardless, even with demand flat or declining as currently. It's no use treating austerity and the deficit as alternatives, because we can't escape an increasing deficit, and you can either add austerity to that or not. This is what is manifestly happening, only it's hard to admit. Borrowing is increasing, and bound to increase, because there is stagnant demand and no growth. There is no available strategy of decreased borrowing, but to view borrowing as the ultimate horror is just superstition, Krugman argues. Restore some demand the way Roosevelt did, keep the increase in the deficit below the aggregate of growth-plus-inflation, and the debt problem is under restraint and can be addressed at the proper stage, namely when we have  some sustainable growth.<br /><br />Is that really saying that inflation is not to be eliminated at all costs? Too true it's saying that, Krugman argues. High blood pressure is a bad thing, so we should all have low blood pressure according to some of our conservative brainstrust. Out of control, inflation can be horrific, but keep an eye on the real problem, which is lack of demand. (I don't want to rehash Krugman's arguments because you should read them for yourself.) His manner is calm and unexcitable, and just as methodology it's worth noting that we should be careful of associating effects with what may not have been their causes, only what we prefer to think were their causes. In particular there is a British school that argues that if we just look after the rich all will be well for everyone. This is purportedly proved by an increase in tax take when once one Chancellor reduced the high band of income tax. We don't need to be experts, we just need not to be idiots not to make that association.<br /><br /> Professor Krugman, thanks for your encouragement.his Chancellor Boy George who have been pursuing deficit reduction regardless, even with demand flat or declining as currently.

B008EQIEWS|5.0|This movie was exciting, action-packed, and had great special effects. There was no nudity, no foul language, and it would be good viewing for an afternoon when you have time. Not every movie is, \\"Casablanca,\\" or even similar but every movie must strive to entertain. This movie accomplished this goal, in my estimation.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|This album is the best. Every song is precise. Justin Bieber is one of my fav artists. This album shows how much he has matured in his music career. I recommend you listen to Boyfriend, Be Alright, As Long As You Love Me. All of them really lol. One that stands out is \\" Maria\\" since he is telling his side of the story of a pregnancy scandal by Mariah Yeater who claims Justin fathered her child. I give this 5 Stars. My only problem was I preordered the album days b4 it came out & I got it late but overall 2 thumbs up.
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you are a Stevie Ray Vaughn fan, you will definitely need to add this one to your collection.  Bravo
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I was looking for something different with not too much of the same old sex scenes and no story and this book was a great change. The story was just engaging and had a few nice surprises. It also made you feel close to the charecters because of how real their life seemed sometimes. Liked the writing style. Loved some of the charecters. I gave it 4 stars because in some situations the main charecters became an imaginary hero. Fitted the story but pulled back on some of the reality of it as well. Also the last few pages I thought dragged on for o reason. Other than that , I loved it.
B000OVLINI|5.0|My favorite book has always been \\"The Historian\\" and until I read this book I almost gave up on my obsession of reading! Thank you author! I look forward to the two new books next month and next June!
B00846REIS|3.0|I knew it was a mistake that I bought this book just after a few pages, yet I thought I might as well give it a chance. This sounded too much like fifty shades, just not as good. I don't mean the writing either, since fifty shades is not exactly a master piece, writing style wise. The story line is just not as good and sometimes boring. Some change in the charecters but overall most would remind one of the \\"other book\\". Eva is not as exciting and appealing as Anastasia. She is also very irrational on different occasions which made no sense as to why but to move the story along. The sex scenes were good but got old fast because they were in every other page. Something I found irritating in fifty shades as well. I found myself skipping a page or two here and there. I really wOuld have liked to see an ending to the story in this book because I just don't see how stretching the story into a whole other book will work. I gave it three stars because the writing was good and some situations kept me engaged but not e whole book. Gideon is just no Christain Grey which doesn't make the book great but not a total failure either.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't remember who recommended that I read Wool, which is driving me crazy. I want to track that person down and give him or her a giant hug and say thank you. This is an excellent story, masterfully crafted and layered, building slowly at first and then rapidly mounting into an incredible crescendo. I'm glad to see that there are more pieces to this story - as soon as I finish this review I'll be buying Wool 6.<br /><br />To anyone wondering whether or not to purchase this omnibus: just do it. The story is gripping and well-written. It's a quick read, and easily worth ten times what Mr. Howey is charging. It's been years since a book has kept me up at night so I could devour more of it, and this one kept me up three in a row. The questions this story poses about human interaction and society are poignant and haunting. Is truth dangerous? Are those who guard it closely the bad guys? Is upsetting the status quo always a wise move? What is the purpose of continuing the human race?

My husband wore them nearly everyday during a 2-week vacation and found them to be as comfortable as any pair of sneakers he's ever worn.<br /><br />The only issues he found with this pair of crocs is that the edges thread within a few times of wearing them. Be prepared to enlist a pair of scissors to snip away the lose threads. Otherwise, they're great.

B005LAIHZE|3.0|I like to think I can appreciate a premise so far removed from reality as this, and certainly the filmmaker's and writers had a choice.  Do we play this up with a bit of campy humor or go with the serious-play-it-straight direction.  They chose the latter.<br /><br />As a boy, young Abe sees his mother slain by a vampire and vows revenge.  Years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker) he is schooled by a mysterious stranger (Dominic Cooper) in the art of killing vampires.  Abe's weapon of choice is a silver laden ax, because he has some experience splitting rails.  Abe becomes quite adept to the point of spinning that ax like a cheerleader's baton.  Interwoven during his vampire removal time in Springfield, Illinois he meets his wife Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), gets elected to Congress and eventually the presidency.<br /><br />In a career defining period of the Civil War, Lincoln learns that the vampires are siding with the Confederates because the slaves are nourishment for the vampires.  In a terrific scene he confounds the vampire leader, Adam (Rufus Sewell) boarding a train full of silver that will be used to arm the Union soldiers.  It's all misdirection, easily spotted but the confrontation on the train is well done.  Director Timur Bekmambetov has some experience dealing with vampires with \\"Day Watch\\" and \\"Night Watch\\" both rather leisurely paced thrillers.  I think a less serious tone might have helped with this film.  At least a few Bond-like quips to lighten the tone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A great story!  If you can see through the \\"mommy porn\\" it's a very good story, as each chapter ends it makes you want to read more.  Sleep can wait!!!

0062119044|3.0|Polished, finely crafted prose can't compensate for repellent characters and an implausible plot. Yes, the book is suspenseful, but in a manipulative way because the characters are not fully realized human beings but more like wooden puppets being twitched by the author's domineering hand. The climax borders on violence-porn.<br /><br />The improbability of the plot stems from two circumstances: first, the one-dimensionality of the characters: that any human being could be as totally unloving of her child as Eva, as credulous as Franklin, as unrelievedly malevolent as Kevin; and second, that no one would have recommended to this family, or that they themselves would not have realized, that they should seek professional help. (Where does the title \\"We Need to Talk about Kevin\\" come from? I don't recall any character in the book having expressed that degree of insight or concern.)<br /><br />Sure, the psychology of child mass-killers begs exploration. It does not get it here. Kevin's reasons are obscure even to himself.  He's just plain evil. And the literature of motherhood could stand to frankly explore the problem that dares not speak its name: maternal ambivalence and resentment of one's child. But Eva's loathing for Kevin is so extreme that it almost puts her into his league of psychopathology. But maybe -- given the perplexing last few paragraphs -- this is what the author intended for the reader to realize about her narrator/protagonist.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|When my son finished reading this book, he said, \\"Mom, can we get more books like THIS?\\" The story is fresh and modern, relevant with up-to-date references to things like Facebook, texting, etc. The message is told in a tender, genuine and compelling way, and it is told from all sides, so kids get a hint of the complexity that is life. I am so very thankful this book was written. What a joy for my child, who is a tough customer!
0345803485|5.0|About the fact that I love this book. I shouldn't like it, let alone like it as much as I do.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm usually very discerning about my reading, but after seeing some others compare the plotline to Twilight but with bondage, I had to read it. Just to compare the storyline. And yes, there are a lot of similarities. Rich hot male, a clumsy mouse of a girl with money being spent on her issues, I mean, if you know what happens in the vampire books, you can give it an extremely sexual slant and know what happens in Fifty Shades of Grey. To me, pecular person that I am, that is a bonus, no sparkly vampires and you basically know what's coming and can focus on the sex scenes. Now, if your so staid that the idea of being tied up during sex disturbs you, then these books aren't for you.<br /><br />There are those who make fun of all the frowns, and sighs, and mannerisms of the two main characters. And yes, they perform their mannerisms on a regular basis. But for all the eye rolling and lip biting, it wasn't as bad as it's made out to be in some reviews. And yes, there are pages of e-mail conversations between them. But to me, reading the subject, and the signatures did make me laugh.<br /><br />All in all, most of the negative reviews really make me think it could be a case of \\"The lady doth protest too much\\" about this book. Sure, it's not going to be put up for a well known literary prize, but that doesn't stop it from being carnal entertainment you could read in front of your grandma(though that might give you more issues than Christian Grey).<br /><br />Try it, you might like it.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am not usually the type of person to come on here and write a review but this book warrants one. I came across this as a suggested read from Amazon after reading another fantasy series. It was a \\"budget\\" buy book so I took the opportunity to purchase it because I saws all the positive reviews and I am a sucker for books with words like \\"blood\\" and pictures of swords.<br /><br />I was not disappointed, what an excellent read! Characters are well developed and likeable in a vicious, violent setting, the world-building is skillfully designed, the pace was good always keeping you entertained but never staying too long to be bored. The protagonist is a character you end up caring for, at first I thought he was the \\"wounded warrior\\" cliché but I was wrong, his development through the story keeps you turning pages. This is the first book in a long time I have read and when finished verbalized a \\"wow\\".<br /><br />Well done! I can't wait for the next one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this app. I downloaded it a couple days ago and I can't put it down. Great app that lets you create the city of your imagination.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The free version works great on my kindle fire. If you want a free solitaire app with little advertising then this is the game for you!!!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It felt like watching someone kick a cat. The lines between consensual and &#34;I'd do anything for him because he's so hot&#34; are too blurry for me. I wasnt entertained.
1582406723|5.0|Arrived 3 days early along with the other 2 volumes I bought. Didn't get folded in half in my mailbox, everything is great!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome! its like the chase scene in a movie that never ends! I don't see who couldn't like this game!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|yes I luv this app its the best in the world just anyone who doesn't have it get it its the best
0385335997|3.0|Here are my thoughts but it reveals a little spoiler. I like book one, \\"Outlander\\" and I was okay with \\"Dragonfly in Amber\\" but this book here just really upsets me. Mainly because of Jamie! Everything he's done just really upsets me and for Claire to forgive him so easily hurts me so much. I'm trying quite hard to forgive him as well, thinking about how Claire isn't so great herself while they were separated but... but... but... Jamie... WHY?! WHY?! All I know is that if I was in Claire's shoes, I wouldn't have forgiven him too easily. Come on, it's a freaking big book! Diana took so much time writing about other stuff that I really didn't care about. I don't understand why she couldn't just spend more time making Jamie beg Claire just a bit more? Just maybe a bit crying, begging, apology and so forth... Just so that I can heal my broken heart before we move on!! And then, and then... Then the last couple of chapters where his son was reveal to Clair... Even that was forgiven so easily!! What woman in their right mind would forgive their husband so easily? Couldn't Diana spend a little time there healing our hearts for what Jamie did? I mean, Claire didn't go out and had another kid!! She only had Bree, Jamie's daughter! WHY Diana are you killing us slowly here!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love different translations at my fingertips and the ease of searching for verses or subjects.  more functions I need to explore but so far it's great.  I highly recommend this.
B0067PEDLE|3.0|I got really exited when I started reading the book. I read first 3 chapters and thought this is my cuppa tea. It had all the elements that I love: bad boy, good girl and whole bunch of challenges that they have to overcome. The way that the relationship progressed between Brit and Alex was well written and pretty believable. I really liked the Alex character and his \\"pick up lines\\". The comments that he threw at Brit was hilarious.<br />One day I was on a subway, on my way home. I was reading and got to the point where Alex was thinking about school start, he thought \\"Senior year for me is like retirement party for a sixty-five-old. You know you can do more, but everyone expects you to quit.\\" and I started to laugh out loud and I realized that people were staring at me :-). The moment when he realized that he had \\"Tengo nu problema grande\\" was also funny. And Brit comparing her hangover to thousands Oompa Loompas hammering her head was beyond funny. Talking about good girl go bad :-). And then... everything went flat. I noticed that the moment that they got serious all humor was gone. What happened? I get it that the boy being in the gang and the girl having screwed up family are no laughing matter, but still. I felt like there was total 360 right after they got all serious (if u can call it that).<br />All this build up to the point where she finally gives in and give her self to him ( somewhere half way through the book) and all you get is \\" She was ready and I went for it\\" (or something like that)  and nothing more. I don't mean that I needed too meny details, but I felt like author could have made it a little bit more romantic than summing up the scene with a really lame sentences.<br />I felt like everything went down the drain from there. There still were few ok moments, but nothing that kept me exited.<br />I thought that the ending was really disappointing. There was 5 months jump in to the future ( at the very end) and five months again, and 23 years jumpin to the future AGAIN! And if it's not enough, author throws at you that Alex and Brit developed a cure or medicin to treat Alzheimer's. I got confused. I thought book was about forbidden love and the obstacles that two people have to overcome in order to be together?<br />I have read some reviews and I saw that quite a few gave 5 stars. I don't mean to be a party pooper here, but I gave it 3 stars only because I liked it first half of the book. If it hasn't been for sense of humor in the first half I would have given 2.<br />I think that the story had a HUGE POTENTIAL. I also think that if author of Perfect Chemestry and the author of Sempre (Forever) could have had the get together and written this  book together, it could have been a great piece of art. The first one have brilliant sense of humor and the second one have an amazing writing and editing skills. But I realize that I'm dreaming :-)
B007CBEO20|5.0|In my opinion a great cd, a must have for hard rock fans.<br />Its clasic hard rock with some bluesy adding, Norum one of the best, a real guitar hero, Tempest is at his best.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe I actually read this piece of trash.  One sex scene after another.  Trite.  Repetative.  Poor use of the English language.  How is it possible that it is on the best seller list?<br />It left such a bad taste, I had to reread Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of d'Urbervilles\\".  What a pleasure to read the beautiful descriptive passages and the development of a true plot and characters.
0891419195|5.0|I have generally found that it pays to read reviews before buying on Amazon; that's what makes this such a great community.  So when I read nothing but rave reviews about \\"The Old Breed\\" I had to give the book a try.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />I have read many first-hand accounts of War II, and have interviewed many who were there.  This book is indeed a rare jewel.  Honest, well-researched, interesting... and hard to put down.  Few books put you there- really there.  This one does.  Thoughtful, and with the right mix of pathos and resignation known only to a seasoned combat veteran.  There is no way I could do the book justice in a review like this.  A must read.
0345803485|3.0|** This review contains spoilers **<br /><br />Seems like alot of reviewers either hated the book and gave it one star or thought it changed their life and gave it five.  To the later I wonder if they simply read the book because of all the hype and discovered a new kind of fiction they may have overlooked in the past.  Despite the graphic sex the trilogy is pretty much a 'love' story between a girl who is finally growing up and a man who allows somebody in emotionally for the first time in his life.  I liked alot of the interaction between the two characters and thought the author could have hit a home run if she'd just allowed some of the mystery and suspense to play itself out.  Example the situation with Leila and Ana's boss Jack.  We have half a book where Leila is basically stalking the couple and the author could have chosen any number of ways to play it out but instead wraps it all up in a few pages with a neat little bow on top.  Same with Jack and the entire kidnapping scenario.  I enjoyed the books but did get a little bored since there was alot of repetition. And I really found it irritating how often we had to hear about Ana's 'inner goddess.'  Have to wonder about some of the reviewers on here who find Christian to be the ultimate partner/sex symbol.  I found him to be more than a little creepy at times and beyond controlling.  Will be interesting to see if they make this into a movie.
0061733199|5.0|I got this book as a resource for a survival skills class I'm teaching... it is very informative and gives good examples, recommended for any survival situation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LIKE ALL THE DIFFERENT GAMES YOU CAN PLAY.  IT NEVER GETS BORING. I LOVE IT. ALL AGES CAN PLAY THESE GAMES.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Game is easy to transverse. The first 16 chapters were accomplished in count down mode with only one or two repeats necessary. The last 4 chapters were completed without count down. It was intriguing not frustrating because of the ability to turn off countdown. Graphics were great.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This movie isn't good for younger kids, but it's a great movie. You won't stop laughing. Get it, and watch it. It's the funniest movie I've watched since the Hangover, but it also has a plot and is a great couples movie. My wife absolutely loved it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was a very long book. Paging ahead and skipping the drawn out details didn't take away from the story line. The author was able to include many kinds of psychotic behavior and family disfunction in this tale of evil intentions. There were a few twists, but once you read a couple of them the rest soon become expected. Not one of the characters wins in the end. I will never read this author's work again.
B00195BM3Y|3.0|For those disappointed in the compressed, limited \\"Loudness War\\" mastering of this release, there is now an alternative.<br /><br />Blue Apple Music has released a 2012 reissue of this album that has been professionally remastered at Abbey Road Studios by Guy Massey & Steve Rooke. The disc even comes with a message on it explaining to \\"turn up the volume\\". The album was released as a 2xLP + CD (1000 copies) and a standalone CD version (500 copies).<br /><br />I purchased the standalone CD version, which unfortunately comes in a mini-LP sleeve with no liner notes or bonus tracks...STILL for the phenomenal upgrade in sound quality this 2012 disc is 100% worth it. It sounds LEAGUES better than the old 90s CD reissue, what you'd get here, or even an original 80s LP.<br /><br />To sum up, if you actually care about sound quality and want something that's closer to the band's vision of what the album is supposed to sound like, avoid this release and track down the SUPERIOR 2012 Abbey Road Remaster from Blue Apple. You'll probably have to go to their website, which is where I purchased my copy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun to play.  kind of like playing Mario. I enjoy playing with my granddaughter.  my grand kids really like this game
B008COII1Y|2.0|the net has opened up a whole new world for young independent artists and giving lots of people room to breath away from the big movie and tv control freaks. I have seen 4 of the 5 that i found, and this was the worst, bad period props...they had two good veterans (actor-the evil sociopathic dr. and actress-played the backwoods healer)who did as best they could with the script and helped the new kids when they shared a scene.<br />  keep writin kid just don't let em give you the bum's rush and take a minite to consider the times you are shooting for...you'll get there.<br />  of the other three that i saw on netflix; there were some very good parts if a little spotty sometimes. the voice over was awful. some of the art was very well done and the makeup wasn't bad on the live ones.<br />  they did stupid things that will glare out at any who know much about the civil war era or even what it was really like to live back then.  the pistols were so shiny silver (like the toys given children in the 50's) any woodsman or fighting man of any kind would have seen the glint good enough to kill you before you knew you were dead.  and it's just plain stupid the way they sometimes pointed thier guns at each other (while making all sorts of noise talking and emoting for thier portfolio clips...}and not fighting. You NEVER point a gun at someone, loaded or not unless you are going to use it. boys back then learned to shoot almost as soon as they could hold a weapon and their daddys would have taken it away and knocked the kid flat,there was no room for carelessness.<br />  I suppose my main b*tch is that children watch a lot of tv a lot like horror and scifi; if there are guns; gun handling NEEDS to be accurate.<br />  the costumes were down right wrong in some cases. the so called southern soldier had no southern accent nor did any of his sothern friends. they should have made him a northener at least. none of the cookware was darkened by flame and hard use, and no frontier settler would ever just drop a torch in the tall dead grass and run off. their neighbors would have linched them. all these things kept popin me back out of the story.<br />  At least they found a sturdy horse like the farmers prized.<br />  the lead did give a credible battle cry when he rallied his troops<br />  dispite all of that they did give it a try and I doubt may of the actors have been off a college or comunity stage before...and i believe this movie company will be a power some day if they can tough it out. It looks like several small groups around the same flag. It is good to see some of the veteran old guard lending thier help. they certainly didn't get paid.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it's. agood game to pplay its hard though b cause every time u come back u have to repair stuff
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It fun would be better if you could actually get friends. Fix that and it will be a five star game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age Village is a great app. I was surprised it was such a good game even though it was free. You should definitely purchase the game. It is also very addicting. If you do get the game, I hope you enjoy it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game and i cannot think of enough words to describe it. but i have to try my best or else i cannot post this.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is great to have<br />Its fun and hours of entertainment u could beat this game and still get hours of fun out of it<br />U must get this game its great
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I just hope this one will not disintegrate like my first one did. Too expensive.  The outer cover of my first one disintegrated, leaving exposed wire in many places.  Dangerous electrically.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|Last year I had a bad case of plantar facitis in both my feet. I was doing some work in my basement last year and being on the hard concrete for long periods of time, wearing old sneakers, actually hurt my feet.<br /><br />For the most part the plantar facitis is gone but I have to make sure to wear footwear with proper arch support. I've not had a problem with shoes or sneakers but I've found that its a little more difficult with sandals.<br /><br />I came across these Teva sandals at a local sports/fitness store and tried them on. I could instantly feel that the sandal had arch support and walking around in them were very comfortable. Also have to mention that the three adjustable straps ensure a great fit! While at the store I decided to check amazon on my phone to compare prices and found amazon was selling it for 30 dollars cheaper. I bought the sandals online and had them at my door three days later.<br /><br />Yesterday I wore them all day around the house to give them a test run and they felt great! No pain in my feet while wearing them or the next morning. These are a great buy for folks with plantar facitis who want a good sandal!
B003DT19F0|5.0|This movie is awesome and my grandchildren have loved watching it.  The animation is so well done.  Also, it arrived much faster than I expected.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read a book like Fifty Shades of Grey in a long time. This book captivates you from the very first page and leave you wanting more at the end. I stayed up way past bedtime reading this trilogy. Enter the world of Christian Grey as his story moves you to question what society considers to be socially acceptable and if alternative lifestyles are something worth considering.
B0086700CM|4.0|I think this is a really good game. I don't understand why most people don't like it. you should get it
0061733199|5.0|I tend to be more of a prepper than a survivalist, but I did fit Wiseman's SAS Survival Handbook to contain some very useful information. If I ever find myself deep in the jungle with only some paracord and a knife, this is the book I would want in my back pocket. I read another book, 31 days to Survival by Creekmore, and I was shocked by how little information was in that survival book. The SAS guide has everything you could imagine, including foraging for food and water, getting rescued, building shelters, and more.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|It is an afordable mini shotgun mic. It deliveres incredibly well. The only complain, the cable is too thin. It should be sturdier.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This prequel Jesse Stone movie is an interesting look into how Chief Stone comes to Paradise. As he puts it several times, he wasn't drunk for the interview, he just had a small drink to help steady his hangover nerves! Despite his flaws, Selleck's character is likeable and compelling. He's smart and has an excellent intuition. The story was every bit as good as the first movie. My husband and I are hoping to watch the rest of the series.
0143142356|4.0|This audio book is 36 disks long (45-1/2 hours) so plan on spending some time with this story and the characters. It was a great investment of time and totally pleasurable.  As always Follett does a great job developing the people we get to know throughout the entire book.  Towards the end it did begin to drag a bit but bor the firs 33 disks I looked forward to listening every chance I got.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I like this CD, it's Shinedown at their best, with many great songs and the production is great also. All bow to Shinedown!
B005CFWJNO|5.0|Love these Crocs.  They are really comfortable and fit snug.  I wear size 8 and 1/2.  The fit is fine, great for the summer. This is the second pair of Crocs sandals I have purchased and think they are great.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|The game is great, but when you reach the purchase or maybe later screen the pop-up for all the others games won't let you get to play the whole review. I tried several times to get pass it..then finally removed it from my phone
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love how like the cars move and this is the only game that pretty much has that great game you should get it very addictive
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Loved this blueray. I was able to see it in theater. Went and ordered the movie the same day. Would suggest this for any phantom fan!!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! If u don't like it delete it!!!!!!!! It is soooo cool!! It is beyond my words!! I love it!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Azada is a fun game to play. It's challenging with the time limit. The plot is good to read and easy to remember as you play during work breaks.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A slightly slow start then interesting childhood development then addictive appeal...dark, yet heartwarming... fully surprising and multiple brilliant subplots. I'm glad I bought it and highly urge you to read it (I am no way related in any way to the author). Rarely do i find such fun multidimensional characters and unpredictable storylines. Somehow it grabs you. It is definitely one my top fave fantasy books this year (along with Queen's Blade series, Kingkiller chronicles, Mistborn, Azerick, Royal Assassin, Blood of Falcon).
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and it was reasonably priced. Would love to read more from this author. Totally recommend this book but not for the younger readers.
B005Q46HZM|5.0|Excellent collection of rare mixes, great sound quality..[[ASIN:B005Q46HZM Phil Harding Club Mixes of the 80s]] I would suggest this CD. A great blast from the past, yet very current.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|not too bad. enjoyable even.<br />downloaded on a rainy day now I am addicted.<br />glad I never run out of energy and earning money is fairly quick. overall nice game for boredom.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Awesome record!  Album of the Year 2012 for sure!  Brings me back to the Hybrid Theory and Meteora days.  Standout tracks for me include IN MY REMAINS, ROADS UNTRAVELED, AND CASTLE OF GLASS.  Entire record is awesome!  Buy it NOW!  :)  You will not be disappointed!  Worth every penny!
B002RT2BXQ|3.0|Very cheesey but also inspiring. The sex scenes are very strange and fantasy rape-like. The old view of 'no means yes' pervade. But the noble theme of 'don't sell out no matter what' shines thru. Wow!!!....How times have changed!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is amazing. I play it every day. get it now .you create your own village. and rescue animals from the earthquake and give them a home.
B001JRB16U|1.0|I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped.  I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was very interesting and a fun read.  I really enjoyed the characters overall.  I thought that the writing could have been better, as it is in the second and third books.  Worth the time, a page turner.
B000UW8596|4.0|Read the other reviews first to understand the extreme bestiality portrayed in the movie. It is a transposition of MARQUIS DE SADE stories to SALO, a transient fascist Italian republic.<br />The title of the review is a question asked and answered by SIMONE DE BEUVOIR. Her answer is a resounding NO, and I do concur. Nothing should be censured, even disgusting hate speech nor any kind of obscenities.<br />I must caution though that the movie is difficult to watch, as other reviewers do underline. Personally, I found that the second part, \\"CIRCLE OF SHIT\\", was hard to swallow (pun intented !) Yes shit is part of life, but seeing naked virgins forced to eat it with a spoon or a \\"marriage\\" with a slave boy, dressed as a bride, and his master where they do kiss mouth to mouth with plenty of shit mixed in the kiss, were really difficult to watch.<br />So you are warned ! It should not stop you to go ahead and watch it...As they say, there is no such thing as bad advertising and also the forbidden fruit attracts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I had this game on my Nintendo. It's a fun way to pass time. Mini mindless games. I enjoy trying to win points to buy extra games.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Each time a watch a Shakespeare drama I am frustrated by the medieval English and the lack of subtitles even in English. I wanted to stress that this movie is a double exception : Not only the spoken dialogue is almost our modern English but they are subtitles as well. They are of course other Shakespeare productions satisfying this criteria. For example : TITUS ANDRONICUS, produced by Julie Taymor, another great production.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is fun to challenge yourself to see how far you go or how much points you'll get and try to beat it! When you loose it has something funny on the top of screen. Also its great for when your bored!<br />  ~When I see rude foments I just get noobier~
B000FBJAOG|4.0|Since I heard about this book I say: It's mine. As a zombie and gore fan I always think a complete survival guide was an imperative. A pretty asured investment not just for the fans but for the curious as well: it's interesting and makes you think about yourself in situations like that and the actions you'll aquire to survival.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|The Verso Prologue Case Cover for Kindle Fire is amazing! This case straps on around the Kindle Fire and holds it in perfect place. The Quality of the case is very nice, more than I was expecting, and I feel like I am carrying around an old written book of some sort, gives a real old school feel to the new generation of technology. I would recommend this to a friend in a heart beat. Very nice Product!~
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Stargate Universe is a nice, fresh angle on the Stargate thing, darker and more ambiguous than the previous two series.<br /><br />I liked the second season better than the first. The feuding between major characters was put on the back burner - good, it was getting old. Many interesting new plot developments, and deeper character development.<br /><br />It ended prematurely. Yes, a shame.<br /><br />I see two choices now. Either I rage at the callous, greedy corporations that have taken over Hollywood, happy to take money for viewer eyeballs but not willing to even give viewers some story closure when they kill a series. And the idiocy of ignoring how popular this show is now that it's over, on Netflix for example.<br /><br />Or I can be glad for two years of another great Stargate series. At least the last episode had the feel of a partial wrapup, with people saying good bye, etc. And I can always use my own imagination for what happened next. \\"The crew of the Destiny was never heard from again. What happened to them?\\"<br /><br />One hopes they will at least put out some novels now to continue the story.
0385342063|4.0|I love that people are constantly inventing new ways to fall in love. I have always loved the stories of people falling in love through non-traditional means, and that is just what I've Got Your Number by Sophie Kinsella has to offer. It's light, fun, and takes a not overly expected route to an expected ending.<br /><br />It's shameful, but if I had realized ahead of time that Sophie Kinsella was the author of the Shopaholic books I probably wouldn't have ever bothered reading a review for I've Got Your Number. Everything about the term \\"shopaholic\\" just screams `This book is not for you!' to me, and so I'm glad I remained ignorant to that fact until I was thoroughly engaged with several very positive reviews of I've Got Your Number. The cover? Adorable, clean, and fitting, it grabbed my attention right off the bat. The title? That tongue in cheek dual meaning that makes me feel clever when I think `I see what you did there'. And then there's the fact that it's set in London, which as an Anglophile I love. I've Got Your Number won't be making any of my favorites lists, but I did enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Our lead, Poppy, was probably the biggest reason I didn't fully click with I've Got Your Number. This girl is nosey and invasive in ways that absolutely horrify me. I am an extremely private person, and I respect others' privacy with that same fervent way of thinking. I would never read someone else's e-mail or private messages, not even those closest to me, and I would be pretty upset if anyone read mine. Poppy does all of this. When she finds the phone of Sam's PA, she insists on keeping it, and forwarding him everything just as the assistant would have done, but she just can't stop herself from getting involved in everything. Not only does she read Sam's private correspondence, she comments on it, and horror of horrors acts on it--actions that I absolutely cannot fathom and couldn't really forgive her for. Hard to like someone whose morals you consider to be pretty fast and loose, even (maybe especially) when they think they're helping or doing the right thing. All of that aside though, there were some aspects of Poppy's personality that I found totally relatable. She's completely neurotic, always putting everyone else before herself, and pretty willing to believe that people think the worst of her. It was these flaws that made me feel for this girl, and want her to come out ahead in the end.<br /><br />And of course there's the men (and of course it is men, plural). Poppy is engaged, and one of the reasons she needs this phone so desperately is that not only is her wedding in about two weeks, she's also gone and lost her engagement ring. And not just any engagement ring, Magnus's family heirloom ring. Sam doesn't really have to help Poppy out with the phone situation, or with any situation, but he does, thus proving that he is a good guy despite his brisk manner in personal correspondence. I was a big fan of Sam, and he, more than Poppy, is what I liked about I've Got Your Number. Yeah, maybe he's a bit of a workaholic, but I love that he knows how to handle conflict, doesn't care at all what others think, and is willing to go out of his way to help a girl who quite frankly needs more than just a phone. Magnus, the fianc&eacute;, didn't come across as a bad guy, but he didn't come across as a particularly good one either. He seemed pretty self-involved, wasn't up-front with Poppy at times, and certainly didn't try to help her out with her neurosis the way a guy should (no sweetie, my parents don't hate you).<br /><br />So basically, if you don't abhor nosiness to the extent that I do, and you enjoy chick-lit, you'll have fun reading Sophie Kinsella's I've Got Your Number. The plot requires a bit of suspension of disbelief in some places (because really, how hard would it have been to just go get a new phone?), but it's still a chain of events one could totally imagine falling into place. The characters are well drawn, believable, and there's plenty of humor and awkwardness to get you through the day.e, and there's plenty of humor and awkwardness to get you through the day.

1589795474|5.0|Why did I like this book? Well it's first book that I read that used a scientific approach to investigate how rich people make and keep their money. I like science. Key take aways? Spend less than you earn, don't buy luxury items, take a risk when the rewards are there, teach your kids the value of money (so they aren't leaches in the future), and buy things that make money. By the end of reading this book I realized that through my own actions I affect my rate of wealth accumulation. The decisions I make, to spend or to save today, directly impact my ability to have money tomorrow.

0802473156|5.0|Gifts, Words, Service, Touch, Attention... everyone gives and receives love differently. In the beginning of a relationship... everything is hot and heavy... and you are just happy that someone is into you... but as time marches on, the love you give can fall on deaf ears.... And then all of a sudden you don't feel appreciated and the cycle of a relationship ending looms overhead. It's because you keep loving the other person the way that you feel loved rather than the way they feel loved. It's not easy to change the way you love someone... but you must if you want your marriage to last a lifetime. I tell my Honey all the time that she's awesome and touchable. She could care less! She wants little presents reminding her that I'm thinking of her. She wants to feel a part of a team, that I'm doing things for her that make her life easier. We love differently. We feel loved differently. So now, after reading this book, when I'm doing the dishes, the only thing I mutter under my breath is \\"I Love You, Baby\\" as a reminder that I'm not just cleaning, but showing my little lady that she's important to me.    the other 4 books are reviewed here: [...]
B007I1Q4W2|2.0|Beginning in Tennessee in 1865, during a battle of the American Civil War, a zombie staggers out of nowhere into the middle of the whole thing! Just one, but enough to enable our story to begin. Six years after the War, our hero Edward Young (Mark Gibson, whose story is told through his found Book of The Dead; and narrated by the always-brilliant Brian Cox as Malcolm Young) comes home to find his wife (Sarah Stunt) a zombie. So, he kills her. But he cannot find his son, Adam (Christian Martyn).<br /><br />So, after trying to find out what makes a zombie tick, he sets out to find his son. Along the way he encounters many more zombies. Some real and some shown in old school comic book style. Sadly, he quickly discovers that Adam has been bitten and so has to put him out of his misery too. And then soon thereafter his horse is next!<br /><br />And so Edward then steels himself in keeping a promise to his son when he was alive - in taking him (his son's ashes now) to the waterfalls. Along the way he runs into Isaac, another lost soul, unbitten and headed his way too. Then come a small bunch of Rebels (who are trying to find their own cure), and a \\"witch\\" named Eve - who turns out to be nothing of the sort!<br /><br />Come the finale, Rebels kill innocents, innocents kill Rebels, zombies keep eating whoever gets in their way, and closure is brought to the whole mess. A mess, as it turns out, that is also revealed as to why it came about in the first place! In truth, the animation and narration make this film waaaaay better than it ever should be!<br /><br />Russell A. Trunk<br />(ExclusiveMagazine.com)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For a Bible for the pad or laptop which travels this is a<br />good choice....The price was right and the program is useful.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is an excellent game - great graphics and music. super fun searches. My hubby looked over my shoulder this. morning and within minutes, he was playing alongside me...then taking my Kindle Fire away from me to play more! We are hooked...way fun!  Thanks for making it a FAOTD...made up for some of the poorer recent offerings mightily!!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I just received this and absolutely love it.  The case looks very elegant, I did not notice the odor mentioned in one review, nor did I have any problems placing the Kindle Fire in the case. The straps  over the speakers presented no problems with audio.  The case also closed flat immediately out of the package.  This is a lovely case, it looks and feels like leather, very luxurious feel and lovely antique look.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love it a lot everyone should get this game and love it!!!!!!  this is my favorite game personally it is just very very fun and entertaining!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is pretty good.  The dialogue does not make sense at times but the puzzles are pretty good without being too easy or hard.<br /><br />Good for someone just starting out with this genre.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was a fantastic story. But even more interesting to me was that it showed what it would be like to actually live as a hero. The type of person who would risk his life for magic and adventure might be a frightening person to be around. The author lets us see glimpses of fear behind the admiration that others have for him.
B000MXJ7LS|1.0|The world Trade Center captures only small fire and police rescue teams.  Does not show much of all that happened that terrible day.  If you're looking for anything close to a full story, don't waste your time.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs was arrogant, abusive, selfish, obsessive, vindictive, controlling, egotistical, and often cruel. He was also a genius, easily one of the most innovative minds of the 20th century, a brilliant marketing strategist, and when it came to technology and its impact on society he was right far more often than he was wrong. A man whose obsession with simplicity and beauty led to some of the best products ever made. A man who, for those who could take the abuse, could drive people to do what they initially thought was impossible.<br /><br />Most people interested in technology know the reader's digest version of Jobs' life, but Isaacson does a superb job of filling in the gaps. So many reviewers felt that Isaacson betrayed Jobs, but I didn't see that at all. The honest portrayal of the ugly side of Jobs' character only made the \\"insanely great\\" things he accomplished all the more spectacular.
B0002ONAM4|5.0|Love this album. Vinyl is where it's at....This is one of those records that just sounds better on a turn-table. The bass playing is highlighted in a way that you just can't fully appreciate on a cd/mp3.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i don't normal do puzzles but i really likes these. i wish you could import your own pictures but maybe in the future.
B0086700CM|4.0|Nice game. I really like it and I'm happy that Kindle got it. The only thing is that it lags a bit at times. It's kinds annoying. If you fixed it, that would make me a very happy girl.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I think it should be better the game is shit I would rate it a zero if I could don't get this game its a terribal game
B004GUSG4M|4.0|When I read the synopsis before purchasing this one, I reckoned it would be a '50 First Dates' kind of story, where the girl meets a jerk, instead of a nice guy. I don't know what made me still buy it, but I loved reading this one.<br /><br />Christine's world is fascinating, mysterious, morbid and downright scary at times. Who is guilty - her husband, her doctor, a stranger, her best friend? Or is she simply victim to games that her own mind is playing on her? SJ Watson manages to keep these questions unanswered for hundreds of pages, and leaves you gasping for breath.<br /><br />Yes, I do think that the book ended rather abruptly. But then, I think I can excuse that, considering how enthralled I was for most of the time I spent with this.<br /><br />Definitely a must-read!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|We've seen this movie a couple times from rentals, etc and decided to purchase it ($6) to have in the collection since we like it so much.  However, we watched this DVD the other night and this version is missing a couple of funny scenes.  I'm not sure if we rented a director's cut, extended feature or what previously but I feel like this DVD is lacking slightly.  Had I not seen the other version(s), I wouldn't care as much but for $6 I can't complain too much either.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This much-talked about, very popular book is utter trash. I don't normally criticise books in such strong language, but I found this one absolutely stupid. The amount of repetition, the number of cliches, the juvenile conversations/interactions... arghh!!!<br /><br />The author makes what might have been a decent read into total soft porn. I doubt if even a teen will like this kind of writing.<br /><br />I wish I could get a refund on my time and money spent on this book. Oh, and I also wish I could give less than 1-star to this book.
B00005N6RU|1.0|I purchased this DVD, sat with my visitors, made snacks only to find out I am unable to run the DVD on any of my DVD players. very disappointing, threw away the mailing return envelope never expecting that the DVD wouldn't work.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I just bought this movie this past weekend based on all the positive comments I had always heard about it. I can honestly say I truly enjoyed the very beginning (up to the time the toys made it to the daycare) but that rapidly changed. Just like some of the other comments, I felt this movie was depressing and creepy (even for an adult). My 3 year old got very scared of the monkey and told me he did not want to see the movie again. It was a huge disappointment since I was a big fan of the first two. I do not understand why they would make movies like these for children!
B007SGM084|3.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was well written.  I liked the suspense of the \\"who-dunnit\\" part of the book.  It had a bit more overt sexual content than I cared for, but it was well written and I enjoyed the book. I would have appreciated more left to the imagination.
B0086700CM|4.0|i played this on my friends ipod and i got addicted to it so i bought it on my kindle fire. at first the screen would get kinda choppy and not run very smoothly but after a few games it ran normaly. but everynow and then it still gets choppy which can get pretty frusterating. but overall i would recommend.
B007SGM084|5.0|I purchased all three books of the series .[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]. From the moment I read the first page to the last I was completely absorbed by the book. It's popularity made it a topic of conversation everywhere I traveled.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Expecting the worst, I was pleasantly surprised. It looks as if Oceania is an album that fans either love or hate. I'd rather avoid the politics and review the album on its own merit. It is leaps and bounds better than Zeitgeist, and is refreshing to say the least. The artwork is fabulous and there's fresh material on the record.<br /><br />It's not perfect by any means. Some of the songs could have shorter intros, which is my biggest gripe. (Quasar should have been a short rocker intro to Panopticon, and Pinwheels could have done without the 2 minute intro.) But it exceeded my expectations. It made me happy I bought the record.<br /><br />On its own merit, notwithstanding the past, I feel Oceania is a worthy effort garnering a listen. Don't go by what other people say on here - for all we know they could be your cranky neighbors. Give it a fair listen and decide for yourself. Listen to it on its own merit, and then listen to it in retrospect of what you know.<br /><br />Smashing Pumpkins are not what they were in '93. 3 out of the 4 members are doing other things with their lives, so we have entered a new era of songwriting and style. Give it a fair chance...it might actually grow on you.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|I've had my PS3 for sometime and finally decided to try a streaming service...Amazon came available and they had this movie that I was interested in seeing but missed at the movies so I took advantage of both!  Interesting movie, I enjoyed it not only once but twice and the service worked very well.
0385736002|4.0|I picked this book up to read because it was a book club read for the library. I wasn't sure how it would go and couldn't decide if it would be my kind of book or not. I was actually pleasantly surprised in the end.<br /><br />The beginning of the book was a little slow for my but once it picked up it was pretty amazing. Once we got to know the characters, it just took off and was full of non stop trouble, thrills, and surprises.<br /><br />I knew who Nicholas Flamel was and I knew a little about his story, but only a little, so this book was refreshing for me. I loved the idea of the immortals and elders. I enjoyed reading the spin on mythical creatures such as vampires and I really enjoyed reading about the mythology aspects.<br /><br />This book has an amazing set of characters and there is a bunch. We have of course Nicholas and his wife, John Dee, Josh and Sophie (the twins), and many many more characters to enjoy. It's really hard for me to say which character stands out because they are awesome at different times. I do love Scatty the vampire though. She is fun, quirky, loyal, and can really kick some butt. I also like the twins. Sophie and Josh are thrown into a world that makes them question everything they were ever told and knew but they handle it quite well. They both act with bravery and a bit of maturity for their age. I appreciated the loyalty they have for each other.<br /><br />Overall it was a very adventurous read. I can't wait to see where this story takes me.
B0002KZAKS|1.0|I ordered this mic based on all the reviews that said it was equilivant to the SM58.  When I connected it to my PA amp all I got was popping noises and handeling noise.  No voice at all.  On top of that, the included clips mounting threads are too small for my On Stage mic stand.  Am returning it and will buy a real Shure mic to replace it.<br /><br />Update I have since purchased the Samson Q7.  Much better mic.  This one really is as good as the SM58.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to use has other entertaining features. I use it everyday. I enjoy the word of the day and other informative feature.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the challenge<br />cant wait to play more go 101 go<br />play hard play to win. win with 101<br />love it love it love me loving it get it lil cud I sure dont
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An excellent story of courage and character. Adam is a real man with real problems who really lives life to its fullest. I was encouraged by his story of faith and perseverance in the face of addiction. It was refreshing that the family was willing to present this man as he was--scars, strengths, faults and all. Too often Christians are only willing to project their \\"cleaned up\\" side and not the reality of what lies within. Although I knew how it ended, I read this wanting it to somehow end differently. That said, however, it is Adam's faith in Jesus that makes the ending the beginning of the next and brightest phase of his life. All around a story that needed to be told and I am glad that it is well presented in this book.
B005PYZG6E|1.0|I read some of the other reviews and hoped that this item would hold me over for few shoots while I saved the money for a good steadicam - I was wrong. I used a Panasonic TM900 which is pretty light and balanced okay. But when I walked (after many many attempts to practice) this thing is all over the place. Maybe something was defective or I am just incapable of learning how to hold it, but it's really all over the place. I am returning the item and will save for a better model.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of variety, has kept me busy already and have only just scratched the surface. I highly recommend this app..
B003O86FMW|5.0|As soon as I finished Hunger Games I couldn't wait to read Catching Fire<br /> I found myself unable to put it down and even exclaiming out loud while reading it. It's a must read!
0307951529|5.0|The book arrived early and in excellent condition. I have only read part of it but it looks like it is exactly what I wanted. This was a excellent transaction.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Sweet, HOLY, JEBUS! If you have ever had an orgasm in your ears and crave for that experience again, buy this amazing debut album from the ALABAMA SHAKES because they have knocked it out of the park!
0316056871|5.0|I think Tina Fey is one of the funniest women in the world. She is smart, talented, beautiful... I loved the way she greets the challenges in life and telling funny stories about them. Thank you...
B005VR9328|4.0|In the process of becoming an avid ROOTS fan and this album is like the meth of tunes and leaves you jonezing for more! More! MORE! So BUY! BUY! BUY!
0736092269|5.0|good book, very informing, shows exactly what exercises work specific muscle groups...Ive been lifting for four yrs so alot of the stuff in this book wasnt new to me however I do enjoy looking at the clearly drawn illustrations and information in this book....i would absolutely recommend this book
0738711500|5.0|These cards are just wonderful!!! They are truly accurate and get the job done. Me and my friend use them for our heart warming questing all the time.<br /><br /> And we actually used them for a tarot party and they were a hit. I really recommend it. I have used others in the past. But I really like these they aren't too bright or too dark the are just right and opens your intuition up and I just love it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is addicting and i love love love it.<br />anyone who is thinking about getting it, do it please!
B00114LF4E|5.0|I was really thrilled when I saw that these recording were being issued!!  I am an un-repentant, dyed-in-the-wool Vienna \\"PhilharMANIAC\\"!!!!  They are the \\"sine qua non\\" of orchestras (then and now) and as a teen with a new HI FI I stocked up on any LP or cassette from the London \\"Treasury\\" series I could find, especially if they had this team on the label.  I wore them out!  I always found these recordings, when comparing them to Herr Von Karajan's other recordings with Berlin, to be really joyful and full of elan.  Maybe you can take the boy out of Austria, but you cant take the Austrian out of the boy- and I really think that, even though the VPO does not have \\"music directors\\" like Berlin and other orchestras, this maestro and this orchestra enjoyed a special bond.<br /><br />I love the way Decca has arranged the recordings fairly chronologically: to me it really seems to allow one to hear the progress in recording technology from 1959 to 1965.  True, they are dated and lack the clarity of alot of the best of today's recordings, but this was period when this fantastic group of men (the VPO) were really blessed with an amazing strength of talent in each section and London's talented team of Culshaw and co. were there to immortalize it.<br /><br />Von Karajan's recordings with Berlin will stand forever as a great testament of art, but, in my opinion, so do these.  Von Karajan was once quoted as saying he preferred conducting the Berlin Phil over the Vienna Phil. because, and I paraphrase:  \\"When I tell the Berliners to play something this way, they do it.  When I do this in Vienna, they ask 'why?'\\"  Well, maybe that questioning spirit was the result of some very deep thought from the players and in the end, can make for some beautiful music making.  I think you will hear that on these discs.  Dont pass them up.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is very addicting. My kids love playing it and watching the different movie clips. The only thing I would change is to allow you to spend money you collected from your village to buy acorns.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Not good. The first couple of pages make you think it might have potential, but soon after you realize it doesn't and you just wasted your money.  I finished it, because in a way I kept wanting it to get good, but it never really took off.  It was one serious situation happening after another that made the story unbelievable, and also didn't allow for the characters to develop enough...  I was disappointed. (And am confused because I purchased this book based on all the stellar ratings...did we read the same book??)
076115728X|5.0|Wish I had had this book when my children were young - but it applies to any age, really.  It has taken me so many years to learn that an unexpected mistake is not the end of the world, but really an opportunity to learn - that creativity HAS to involve acceptance of surprises, rather than guilt or fear of the unexpected.  I just loved it, as it is written with such simple clever joy !  I will be sure each to pass a copy on to each little one in our family, and to recommend it to anyone - AND keep a copy for myself!
030788743X|4.0|Well, it's hard to say how long it's been since I've had this much fun with a novel.  Maybe Snow Crash, and that's going back a bit.<br /><br />This is novel is not serious, but it is serious fun.<br /><br />The best recommendation I can give, I think, is from the geeky sixteen year-old who came down from the country to spend a weekend with me.  (I'm 40 years his senior.)<br /><br />We bought all the bits for his new computer, we went to a Computer Swap Meet and, while he was walking four blocks to save $2.00 at an ATM, I dropped into Readings and bought him a copy of this book.<br /><br />His mum says he used to read a lot but had grown out of it.  He said that he doesn't read any more.  I told him that you can't be a serious geek if you don't read but, anyway, just try a few pages and see how you go.  (I should point out that this book was about US$40 at Readings at the time.  Ouch!)<br /><br />Anyway, I rang geek-junior a few days later to see if 1) his new hand-built PC was doing OK and, 2) if he'd started the book.<br /><br />Turned out he'd not only finished the book, but he'd written to Ernest Cline to congratulate him.<br /><br />I agree.  If you're an old fart like me you'll have a ball dropping back in to the '80's.  If you're a noob and, frankly, you're just about all noobs, you'll still have a ball with this book.<br /><br />Fun, fun, fun 'til your daddy takes your T-shirt away.  (sic)
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I got the Kindle App for Androids for my tablet. It was great for the first few books that I bought. Then I attempted to download the novella \\"The First Dragoneer\\". That was when things went haywire. It never did download. And, now when I try to open my Kindle App it trys then fails to open. I tried uninstalling, then reinstalling, twice. Failure both times. It downloaded but, still fails to run. What a bummer, because now I am unable to finish reading \\"The Art of War\\" by Sun Tsu. My wife has the 3G Kindle and has not had a single problem with it, and she loves it. My neighbor feels the same way about his Kindle Fire. Looks like that my be what is in store for me next. Do I have too many books in que? I only have 6 books downloaded to my kindle app for android, with a 32 gig card in my tablet. I am at a loss. Is it the app or my tablet? The other reader that came loaded on my tablet has just as many books and is working fine. But I can't load books from Amazon to it even though I see it available it the Amazon App Store. I would like to get it back running again, because I'm happy with my tablet and Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finished this series faster than any other series.  I thought it was great.  Totally what I needed for a summer reading.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am a young adult that never grew out of Disney; and I absolutely love this movie. It has some underlying adult humor though not as apparent in some films. Great for people of all ages!
B007STXHTM|4.0|The item came in promptly and with no problems after ordering. Putting the product through its paces right now, seeing if it is as good on land as underwater. So far so good, highly recommend the seller for any future transaction and purchases.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|best game so far I have ever downloaded. It is fun, challenging and addictive. there are add ons you can buy but I have not bought any (keeps the game challenging trying to do things the hard way)
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This a great car speakerphone!  I looked at plenty of these speakerphones here on Amazon and I decided to purchase this one.  Buy it, you will be very pleased with the hands free conversations that are much safer.  The sound quality is very good during the calls, a little less however during the beginning of the calls for some reason.  No big deal.  As you can see I gave this product 5 stars because this company deserves it!  I don't work for Amazon or Buddy, just a very satisfied customer.
1741798981|5.0|Lonely Planet produces some of my favorites guidebooks. I think they have the perfect balance between economy while making sure there's enough fluff for those that enjoy to splurge.<br /><br />And it is no different in this edition of the London guidebook.<br /><br />I now live in West Sussex and use this extensively to plan my day trips to London. An invaluable resource.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I have this on my Kindle app on my phone and have been reading it while on the go.  This book is one you don't want to put down.  Makes you feel your one of the characters. When I read it I feel like I am Rose and going through the pain and happiness she goes through.  Glad part 2 Twenty-Nine and a Half Reason has come out and excited to read that when done with part one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished this series in its entirety over the course of 6 hours. I know this is a cliche...but I literally couldn't put it down! I was absolutely astonished by the emotions and physical sensations I felt while reading this book. I don't want to spoil anything, but there were several moments of absolute shock and heart pounding suspense, claustrophobia, complete despair. It is nothing short of amazing and my favorite thing I've read this year.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Never read Sherlock Holmes?  Then pick up this great collection of short stories.  You won't be disappointed.  These stories left me wanting more.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging, smart, and perfect for a quick round while waiting in line. Fantastic music too! I would highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I normally don't get a chance to read and when I do, I want a book that is hard to put down. WELL, this one DEFINITELY was tough to put down. I spent one night reading it till' 2 a.m.!!!! This book is for every woman out there who wants a erotic tease!!!! I must say, this book is a keeper!!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Because I'm Using a Kindle Fire to play this, finding things can be difficult.  At times when using the hint button,  I can't see the highlight indicator especially if what I'm looking for is near the border.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've used many keyboards for my android phone. Once I discovered swiftkey x I ditched the rest. Now they have refined it after much customer suggestions...  Swiftkey 3! I see this being preinstalled in future ROMs. Ty Touchtype Ltd.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|After reading a series of \\"serious and thought provoking\\" books, I was longing for a feel good weekend read. I picked up Jojo Moyes' Me before You just by looking at the cover. It had all the tell tale signs of a good leisurely girly book. Stars in the sky, enough pink on the cover and the word romantic used in most reviews. Bought with one click. And then I learnt, do not judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />The book starts off quite predictably, a loveable, quirky and believable lead called Clark. Though irritating and quite naïve at times, one tends to be drawn to the whole eclectic Clark Family. The plot too is quite simple in itself. A lost and naïve girl, a formerly \\"talk of the town\\" but now disabled boy- Will. Fate somehow brings them together. Like every legendary couple, they too get off on the wrong foot but despite the circumstances, they soon mean the world to each other. She is the reason he wants to wake up every morning, he is the reason she finally comes into her own. Predictable? WRONG. Not when the author beautifully weaves in the subject of euthanasia.<br /><br />The author draws in the weekend readers into a bubbly-cute novel with a deeper undertone. Without being too heavy and preachy, the story takes a dark twist. The reactions of the characters are so believable that everyone would find someone to relate with. The ending however, left me a little disappointed and would have been best without the author's personal views on the subject.<br /><br />Over all review:<br />Great book if you either want a light book with some good humour or something to think about for a few days after you have read it. A little predictable in the beginning but picks up pace pretty soon. Over all 3 stars out of 5!
B007PS0X0W|1.0|The only reason I finished watching this horrible movie is because I've watched and enjoyed the other Underworld movies and I heard there will be another movie.  It was nothing more than a rickety bridge to a hopefully better sequel.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I haven't been around quite as long as some, but I've been around a good bit longer than many others.  I feel pretty well qualified to write this review in terms of tenure.  My first Rush show was in 1986.  (And there have been many since then.)  Man, that was a long time ago.  Let's put it this way.  Alex, Neil & Geddy were a good bit younger that night in 1986 than I am now.  The point is that I've been around these guys for quite a while.  I'm not new on the scene and I'm intimately familiar with everything they've ever done.  Pretty clearly, I love this band.  I love & respect their work on multiple levels, for numerous reasons.  I own everything they've ever released.  Studio albums, live albums, solo records, video releases, literary offerings, you name it.  I have to say, right out of the gate though, that this record is different & special.<br /><br />First, let's put this album into the proper perspective.  These guys have been writing, recording & performing for well over 35 years.  That feat alone leaves most would-be competitors in the dust.  Consider, though, the following two additional factors.  First, with only one very old, nearly insignificant, and very asterisked exception, this band has never undergone any significant changes in membership.  On top of that, they've managed to survive a series of personal tragedies the likes of which have reduced the careers of many other artists to piles of fiery rubble.<br /><br />And remember, this is their 20th studio effort.  No small feat by any measure.  Suffice it to say that, in reality, they've really got nothing left to prove.  In a sense, they've done it all already.  The ground-breaking early works, the continuing explorations into new & uncharted territory, the numerous live records showcasing the different eras, the reinventions of the band's sound, and the eventual returning to roots.  They've amassed one hell of a catalog.  And they've made a lot of very, very good records.  In point of fact, I absolutely love the lion's share of their works.<br /><br />Having said that, make no mistake.  I'm no fanboy.  They've made musical mistakes, and I've never been afraid to call them out for what I perceived as disappointing efforts.  Truth be told, they've released exactly two studio records which I thought, after a number of critical listens, were fit for one place alone - the garbage can.  Yes, I actually cast each of those cd's into the trash.  And I stand firmly behind those editorial judgments to this day.  (If you must know, they were \\"Roll The Bones\\" & \\"Counterparts\\".  Just dreadful records, the both of them.)  The point is that I'm perfectly capable and willing to be objective and critical when it comes to reviewing a given studio album, even when it's released by three guys I've idolized for decades.<br /><br />Their two most recent efforts?  \\"Vapor Trails\\" and \\"Snakes & Arrows.\\"  Both of these records are good, even very good.  They each even offer moments of majesty, but considered as complete works, I don't believe that either one is necessarily \\"great.\\"  Such labels and terminology are subjective and relative, to be sure, however.  I must be completely honest though, and say that I very much wanted to like \\"Clockwork Angels\\" much more than I wound up liking either one of those releases.  Those two records though, for good or ill, had a lot to do with the preparation and adjustment of my expectations for this newest album.  I was optimistic, but at first, perhaps cautiously so.  As time went on, however, and I began to hear more of the rumors and speculation surrounding the forthcoming record, I began to get a very good & funny feeling about it in my gut.  Simply on an intuitive level, based upon rumor and conjecture, as well as a number of insightful & revealing comments on the writing & recording of the album from the guys themselves.  My gut ended up telling that me that this was going to be one for the books, so to speak.  I had a feeling for a long time that it was going to be special, and now I believe that I was very much correct.<br /><br />And without sounding like a complete & total sycophantic fanboy, I'd like to say that this newest album, this landmark 20th studio recording, is quite simply phenomenal.  It really is a fantastic record.  Quite possibly a 5-out-of-5.  Full marks, as it were.  It's this good on multiple levels, for a variety of reasons.  I'll start by saying that the scale & scope of this album is grander than, and quite unlike anything they've done before.  Ever.  Yes, they've dabbled in the concept album genre before, yielding boundary-pushing and genre-defining efforts such as \\"2112\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\".  (Both of which, by the way, I absolutely love.)  But all their concept efforts have heretofore been relegated to just one side of a two-sided record.  A 50% proposition at best, if you will.  Not so with this new monster.<br /><br />This record is a continuous, contiguous, coherent concept piece from top to bottom, beginning to end.  And, truth be told, it's not simply a concept piece, it's a story.  Which makes it all the more wonderfully accessible and meaningful, because while not everyone will identify with a given concept, everyone can pick up on a story.  And it's not just a story, but a biography, a life's journey, if you will.  It's a tale to which I immediately began to relate on a personal, intellectual, philosophical, emotional & spiritual level.  And, while I've never gallivanted across an alchemical, steampunk fantasy land, I've absolutely been down the roads this guy's traveling, and I've experienced many of the things he's relating & expressing.  Yes, I've always made connections to much of the music I've grown to love, but once again, this one is different & special.  Certainly I love \\"Tommy\\" and \\"The Wall\\", but I don't connect or identify with either of them on such a personal and emotional level.  But I've made that connection with this guy, on this record.  And it happened nearly immediately.  I must say that, for me, this is one of the most unique & remarkable aspects of this amazing album.<br /><br />Next on the list is the musicianship & technical proficiency they bring to the table.  I don't wish to belabor a subject that's been hammered home so many times, by so many other people, in so many other reviews.  So I'm not going to make a big fuss over musicianship & performance levels here.  As was said earlier, albeit in a different context, these guys have nothing left to prove.  Suffice it to say that each of them is generally regarded as a virtuoso in his own right, and rightly so.  From a technical standpoint, they've always brought the heat, and they sure don't disappoint in this case.  But this is nearly a given before we begin.  With these guys, ability & proficiency are never at issue.  I knew I didn't have to worry about these elements, as critical & fundamental as they are to the musical foundation necessary for a successful record of any kind.  I, on the other hand, was much more concerned with lyrical & thematic content, the caliber of songwriting, production value, and finally spontaneity, or the x-factor as we'll discuss much more later.<br /><br />From a strict songwriting standpoint, I don't believe we've seen anything nearly this strong from these guys in quite a number of years.  I'll admit that, about two weeks into it now, there's still one track about which I'm not entirely sure, but for the most part, this record is about as strong a body of songwriting as they've ever offered.  And I know.  That's saying a hell of a lot.  Trust me, it's that good.  The desired riffs & hooks are all there in this case.  The songs are relatively accessible even upon the first listen, but are obviously multifaceted and filled with everlasting value.<br /><br />Next subject on the report card is production value.  And God dammit, not enough emphasis is placed on this area in today's world.  With all the wonders digital technology continues to give us, it seems as though we might actually be regressing in terms of musical production value lately.  Most things these days sound as though they've been recorded to sound as processed & artificial as possible.  As if that sort of sonic quality is actually the goal.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  The loudness war.  The songs have no headroom, there's no air space, no breathing room between the notes.  All the sounds are pressed up against each other, resulting in a sound that's as dynamic & and organic as latex or formica.  I don't know about you, but that stuff is enough to give me a headache.  And you know what?  Ironically, there's a relatively recent Rush record that strikes me as being a particularly nasty offender.  \\"Vapor Trails.\\"  Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" is another infamous example of this total lack of sonic integrity.  I'm not a musical engineer, so I admit that I am not in command of the proper terminology or nomenclature, but there are moments on those records that make me feel as though I can't breathe, and that my ears are cracking up.  Sounds become needlessly distorted at high levels resulting in an insufferable hiss.  It's just intolerable.  And while I expect it from the next nu-metal Johnny-come-lately, I most certainly do not expect it, or accept it, from these three guys.  There's just no excuse.<br /><br />They know better, and with \\"Clockwork Angels\\", they DID better.  God help me, I'm not exactly sure of what happened, but I believe it's got something to do with the producer they first worked with on \\"Snakes & Arrows\\", and ultimately retained for this record.  Suffice it to say that this guy knows what the hell he's doing in a studio with regard to sound quality & sonic integrity.  Because this record absolutely shines.  It gleams.  It literally leaps out of my Klipsch towers and Sony studio monitor headphones.  There's a crystal clarity, a shimmering brightness and an almost golden quality to this entire record that must be experienced to be appreciated.  It simply sounds wonderful, even at blistering levels.<br /><br />And now we get down to the really subjective, hard-to-define qualities that make the record the real gem that it is.  For perhaps the very first time, these guys let themselves go just a little bit.  They've finally loosened the reins, ever so slightly, in terms of their approach to their instruments and the musical dynamic existing between the three of them.  They're normally bound by rigid musical structure, and sometimes it can come off as sounding starched & stiff.  Almost too polished.  This time they allow improvisation and feel to cast their magical shadows over everything that's going on.  And the resulting sound, produced by the three who become one, is simply phenomenal.  So organic, so natural, so relaxed, so comfortable.  And perhaps somewhat paradoxically, so incredibly powerful.  These three have actually got a mean groove going on here.  They're actually copping a jam, and it sounds incredible.  It's obvious that they had fun recording & performing this material.  To be sure, this is something that's quite difficult to capture here in prose, but when you hear it, it's immediately evident & unmistakable.<br /><br />Finally, there's an openness, an honesty, a sincerity that just exudes from this record that's quite hard to describe, but once again, immediately evident & audible on the semiconscious level.  It has something to do with what I mentioned earlier in terms of the connection with the lyrical & thematic content.  This material is coming straight from the heart.  That was readily apparent to me upon the first listen, the maiden voyage.  Again, another amorphous & ethereal quality that came across the bandwidth without any effort whatsoever.  Hopefully, you understand what it is that I'm driving at here.  If not, I'm sure the fog will lift during your first listen.  Have no fear.<br /><br />All these last subjective & magical qualities converge into a gigantic x-factor that's very hard to put a finger on verbally, and as such I may not have done it any justice here, unfortunately.  But ultimately, it's these elusive, ethereal qualities that help to elevate this new album high above not just the works of other would-be imitators & competitors, but above even much of their own work up to this point.  They've outdone themselves.  After 35 years, 19 other studio records, and God knows how many shows, they've managed to create a record that is, without question, one of their finest efforts, ever.  Some are saying that they believe it will also be their last.  Sadly, I must admit that my gut has suggested the very same thing to me, though I don't wish to believe it.  Let's all hope we're wrong.<br /><br />Judging from the quality of \\"Clockwork Angels\\", it's painfully obvious that these guys are a very long way from running out of fuel.  Amazingly, it seems as if they're actually becoming better on each & every level as they're getting older.  Simply incredible, gentlemen.  Congratulations.  You've really outdone yourselves with this one.

B000002ADT|5.0|20 words minimum.  Let's start by saying I still own the original LP and thankfully did not wear it out so today I still spin it now and then and remastered it to CD.  I have this same CD from a few years ago and will buy this one too.  Legendary and have seen almost all of those recording on this live at some point in time in the past.  Clearly this is timeless and should be in anyone's music collection no matter what genres may be their favorite.  It's like owning a copy of the Mona Lisa - it's unmistakably a masterpiece.  jus' sayin'
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Our narrator, Hazel meets Augustus in a cancer support group. her lungs have been ravaged by the disease and her constant companion is the oxygen tank she wheels along beside her. Augustus is a cancer survivor, and former basketball player who lost the lower half of one of legs to the disease. These are bright, inquisitive kids, full of the smart quippy dialogue that seemed to be muttered by actresses like Emma Stone, or to date myself Janeane Garofalo. Yet I think what makes the book so poignant is in this current culture of social media, and instant celebrity, faced with ones own mortality, the question is asked, How will I leave a mark, how will I be remembered? Did my life, however long or short, matter?

Disney did a piss poor job of marketing it!<br /><br />From the shortened generic title to not doing a big promo campaign to clarify what the movie was about and most of all what history it has.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people saw it and simply thought it was a knock-off of every famous sci-fi movie of the 20th/21st century instead of realizing that this is THE literary series that all those other movies take from. If not for this story Star Wars would have been a reality T.V. show about Hollywood actors fighting over who's the best talent.

B004WOJ6XC|4.0|(If you don't have your Rhapsody [of Fire] chronology straight, do yourself a favor and skip to the end of this review for a detailed briefing.  I placed it at the end so all of the ones who already are familiar with it all can just read on - not stop and say \\"here's another idiot who thinks writing a review is only about providing a history lesson.\\")<br /><br />I've just seen the band live on their From Chaos to Eternity world tour (my second time seeing them).  I had no idea what to expect when going to see them - a bunch of From Chaos to Eternity songs, or perhaps exclusively Dark Secret Saga songs?  I was afraid to dream of seeing all the old classics.  But that's exactly what they did.  (I committed all but one song of the setlist to memory and reproduced it after the chronology at the end of the review.)  This confused me.  Because I read in an interview with Fabio Lione a little over a year ago (just before the release of From Chaos to Eternity, if memory serves) that the band was going to be done with writing about fantasy concepts after this album.  This may be so, but the band sure went out with a bang.  It's Luca Turilli who appears to be continuing the fantasy theme with his new band, \\"Luca Turilli's Rhapsody\\" and the \\"Ascending to Infinity\\" album release.<br /><br />Now onto discussing this album specifically.<br /><br />This album is the \\"Power of the Dragonflame of the Dark Secret Saga,\\" if you will, as it concludes the saga.  Unlike the Emerald Sword Saga, the albums in Rhapsody of Fire's second saga show the band rapidly changing their approach.  Long-time fans are used to hearing Christopher Lee as narrator, an orchestra doing the majority of the job that was done by keyboards during the Emerald Sword Saga, and an increase in progressive approach (beginning with Symphony of Enchanted Lands Part II and its dual ten-minute songs).  Triumph or Agony turned me off big-time to this band, and then I was very afraid when I saw they had signed with NuclearBlast for the saga's 3rd album, The Frozen Tears of Angels.  There was also the biggest gap between albums - 4 years - between ToA and TFToA.  But the band returned to fast songs (Triumph or Agony was an orchestral/progressive ballad-fest), thankfully-subdued orchestration (and even a return of keyboards, ex. On the Way to Ainor solo), and an old-school epic.  What's different is Luca Turilli's guitars - the trademark slide is... traded in for casual riffing?  Hm...<br /><br />So we arrive at From Chaos to Eternity.  Suddenly, there is a new guitarist, Tom Hess, playing alongside Luca Turilli.  In some ways, Rhapsody of Fire returns to the glorious form of the Emerald Sword Saga with lots of baroque-inspired fast songs, and simultaneously moves in a new direction with the new guitar approach.<br /><br />The song, I Belong To the Stars is a major red flag.  Check out the artwork on that page if you already have the album - it's very outer-space-ish - much more like an Ayreon or Star One sci-fi album, rather than a fantasy album.  The song shares nothing in common with the style found on, for instance, Dawn of Victory.  Avantasia, Labyrinth, or Edenbridge could have produced this song.  I've been listening to Rhapsody since 2002; they were the 5th metal band I was ever introduced to.  And I'd be willing to bet that this song is our sign of the sound that is to come on the next Rhapsody of Fire album.<br /><br />That's a lot of information to take in.  Ultimately, the question you want me to help you answer is \\"Should I buy the album, or not?\\"  Well, let's try this:<br /><br />If you're a long-time Rhapsody fan, buy it.<br /><br />If you're an epic metal or Italian power metal fan, buy it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of symphonies or native languages present in your metal, buy it.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Helloween, Gamma Ray, Freedom Call, Domine, an Drakkar, but NOT Primal Fear, Grave Digger, Running Wild, or Rage, buy it.<br /><br />If you're [the reverse of the previous criterion), DON'T buy it.<br /><br />If you enjoy Rhapsody but hated Triumph or Agony, buy it.<br /><br />If you enjoy innovative music in general, buy it.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that will have such a diversity of fans, and along with that will come a huge range of opinions.  When Rhapsody released Legendary Tales in 1997, they were just another power metal band, but epic in scope and composition.  Since then, the Thy Majesties, Hamkas, Skylarks, Secret Spheres, and even Ancient Bards have added their idea of epic metal.  From Chaos to Eternity is the 8th full-length album by the first band to do this (excepting Domine who to this day hardly depends on keyboards for their fantasy atmosphere), and now they're competing against all of these bands who were inspired by their own Legendary Tales and other early material.  Whether you're a fan young or old, Rhapsody of Fire \\"still has it.\\"<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Here is the chronology:<br /><br />1997-1999 - Rhapsody released its first albums with songwriters Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli and vocalist Fabio Lione.  Legendary Tales and Symphony of Enchanted Lands comprised the first half (two albums) of the Emerald Sword Saga.<br />1999 - the first time any members did any Rhapsody-related material without all of the members.  Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli worked with vocalist Olaf Hayer (Dionysus, now Magic Kingdom) to create King of the Nordic Twilight, the first album of the two-part Dark Comet Saga (an offshoot of the Emerald Sword Saga).<br />1999-2002 - Rhapsody finished the Emerald Sword Saga with Dawn of Victory, the Rain of a Thousand Flames EP, and Power of the Dragonflame.<br />later 2002 - Luca Turilli (alongside Alex Staropoli) released Prophet of the Last Eclipse, the second and final album of the Dark Comet Saga.<br />2003-2004 - no activity from either band<br />2004 - a beginning of a new era for Rhapsody begins with the release of The Dark Secret [EP] which came with a DVD featuring interviews.  We learned that Christopher Lee joined the band and that there was to be a symphony with 80 pieces (a big deal in 2004, because very few metal bands were working with orchestras yet).  Symphony of Enchanted Lands Part II kicked off the Dark Secret Saga.<br />2006 - Rhapsody became Rhapsody of Fire and signed onto the same label as Manowar, then toured the United States for their first time in support of Manowar.  The album released in 2006 was a dramatic departure from the metal-grounded song elements found all throughout the Emerald Sword Saga.  Also in 2006, Luca Turilli released his 3rd solo album, and people gave the smell of dead fish more praise than The Infinite Wonders of Creation.  I ++wanted++ to love this album, but it has more dust than the top of my bookshelf.<br />2007-2008 - no activity from the band.  I, for one, grew fearful that Rhapsody [of Fire] would never again come near the glory they had in the Emerald Sword Saga (or Dark Comet Saga, for that matter).<br />2009 - released that the band signed with Nuclear Blast.  At this point, I REALLY freaked after seeing what happened (and continues to happen) with so many bands who sign with such an international label.<br />2010 - The Frozen Tears of Angels, the Nuclear Blast debut, is released and wows the crap out of Rhapsody of Fire bands worldwide.  The orchestra was toned down big-time after the Triumph or Agony flop and Luca Turilli's guitars... just listen to the On the Way to Ainor solo.  You might need two or three days to get through the whole thing.<br />2011 - ...a new... guitarist???  I was stunned.  From Chaos to Eternity comes out.<br />2011 - Luca Turilli leaves Rhapsody of Fire ++before++ the world tour (sob sob sob).  the remaining members find a replacement (so there are still two guitarists where there had been one from 1993-2010).<br />2012 - This month, \\"Luca Turilli's Rhapsody\\" releases its first album, Ascending to Infinity.  The vocalist(not Olaf Hayer) sounds almost identical to Fabio Lione and the style more-or-less picks up where Power of the Dragonflame left off.  Also released on Nuclear Blast Records.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />And here's the setlist:  (numbers after the song title represent which album the song is from, 1 being Legendary Tales and 8 being From Chaos to Eternity.  The carrots indicate songs I am positive of the order in which they were played.  No carrot means I'm iffy about the order.  Since they didn't play Rain of a Thousand Flames (boo hoo), I didn't have any EP trouble.)<br /><br />> From Chaos to Eternity  8<br />> Triumph or Agony  6<br />> Village of Dwarves  3<br />> Unholy Warcry  5<br />> Lamento Eroico  4<br />Land of Immortals  1<br />March of the Swordmaster  4<br />Dawn of Victory  3<br />Magic of the Wizard's Dream  5<br />Holy Thunderforce  3<br />Knightrider of Doom  4<br />> Reign of Terror  7<br />> Emerald Sword  2<br />> ???<br />> Heroes of the Waterfalls' Kingdom  8

B008BYXQJY|2.0|This album was a TOTAL departure from their style from the past three albums.  The hip style and smooth lyrics from their first albums were good to great.  This album left their fan base behind in the dust.  I used to be able to see that I liked all of Maroon 5's music, but now I most certainly cannot say that.  This album is a desperate attempt to try to mooch off the success of dance music, and the entire album sounds for the most part the same, with one or two depressing exceptions.  Goodbye.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swiftkey has been my keyboard choice since I first installed it.  I used it for awhile, switched back to Swype, then quickly switched back to Swiftkey.  It's predictive skills are too good to live without.  The recent version update has radically changed the look of the keyboard but it's function remains solid. The new keys seems to reduce typos and the combination of several punctuation marks on a single key on the main keyboard have eliminated erroneous the question marks I continually appended to every statement. Free, on sale, or full price, this app is worth the price.
0345803485|1.0|It really amazes me that women would really appreciate a book like this which objectifies and degrades women in one fell swoop. Garbage in = Garbage out.
0345525558|4.0|If you're looking for a quick and easy read, this is it.  The connection of flowers to the main character gives the book more depth and gives the reader insight into how she approaches the world. It was perfect for a recent long plane ride.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like the game but the slow progression is a little annoying. I also wish the lot expansions were better. They aren't worth the money.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Pre shred : 5'4, 120 lbs., size 4. Post shred: 5'4, 119 lbs, size 2/4.....I lost 1 lb., and definitely burned fat and gained muscle.  My body shape is much improved: my arms & legs are toned, my abs are looking swimsuit ready! I completed the 30-day shred in about 35 days (I had to take the occasional day off to do yoga). Now, I am totally addicted to these fast, effective workouts. Just ordered the Ripped in 30 DVD.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've continued to do other workout DVDs from Jillian 5 days a week (Extreme Shed & Shred, Killer Abs, Ripped in 30) for the past 8 months.  I currently weigh 113.5 lbs, still around a size 2. My body shape continues to look trim and thin--with definition. I'm totally addicted.
0062073494|5.0|Though the books are somewhat dated, it is remarkable how Agatha Christie's book still have the ability to captivate an audience. It can be frustrating when everything is so obvious to Hercule Poirot as the reader is disadvantaged by being in the world of non-fiction. The disadvantage makes the book no less entertaining.<br /><br />Clearly borrowed from the story of the Lindbergh baby, the plot of this novel sees the kidnapper get what he has coming. On the run after murdering a child that he kidnapped, Ratchett is aware that his days are numbered. On the Orient Express, he continues his attempt to flee, even seeking the assistance of Hercule Poirot. When the train becomes stalled in a snow embankment, Ratchett is murdered.  While there exists no clear line to the killer, many seem to have some loose connection to the family of the deceased child. Noting the fine details, Poirot makes a stunning revelation in the end. And while the ending may be known to contemporary audiences, watching the plot unravel makes it more remarkable.<br /><br />\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is one the better known works of Christie because she is at her best. Veterans of Christie novels may see the ending coming more easily, but will certainly find reading enjoyable.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|good game, nice graphics and works well on the kindle fire. no serious problems so u should get it Cuz its a ton of fun

B000F4RHB6|2.0|I attempted to add this CD to my windows media player, and when I loaded it to my computer, all the song titles appeared in some foreign language. I'm not sure if the titles are in Arabic or some Asian alphabet, but they are certainly not english or any European language. All the music is in English, but it is very confusing.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is absolutely wonderful. Truly a fantastic buy and lots of fun to watch. There are three episodes per season with each episode being over an hour long. Very different than the typical thirty min, twenty eight episodes per season that Americans are used to. However, with Sherlock it works, never a dull moment! Highly recommend!
B005LAIH54|1.0|This movie was made.  The writers were paid, crews were hired.... actors were hired.  Good actors.  Good actors who must've gotten caught up in some studio contract a long time ago and couldn't say no.  But yeah, this happened.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever see.  It's all over the place.  Nothing tracks or makes sense... it's just a studio produced story.  A complete waste of time, including everyone who worked on it and probably got paid.
B008133MDK|4.0|I really loved season 1 and looked forward with great anticipation to season 2. I have been disappointed. the beginning of Episode one felt flat and anti-climactic. The story progressively improved, however I had trouble following it. Episode two \\"hounds of baskerville\\" was very disappointing. I knew immediately that drugs were involved. I thought Sherlock was sloppy and not up to his usual self in solving this crime. I figured it out in the first few minutes. I've yet to watch episode 3.
B006ZZANG0|4.0|I didn't get to listen to Out of the Game because it was out of order... The first copy of the CD i received would not play so I sent it back. The replacement copy was received and it would not play. so I sent it back - anyone else have this problem? :-(

B004MC8CA2|5.0|i like being able to download the bible text onto my kindle fire so i can still use it when i dont have wifi access. i also love having access to so many different versions, being able to highlight and make notes.  i think its cool to have the option to share verses on facebook. My only complaint is when i decided to hit the upgrade button and hated the changes.  there are a lot tiny icons throughout the text called translation notes in the NKJV and i cant switch back to the original i had that was plain with just the verse numbers.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Super Stickman Golf is good fun - part brain-teaser and part physics game. Sometimes easy; sometimes maddening.<br /><br />The game has a money component to it where you can purchase special, powered-up balls. This annoys some gamers BUT there are plenty of opportunities to earn \\"money\\" through game play; money-making challenges completed in practice mode (where special balls are free) still count; and there don't appear to be any game situations that absolutely require power ups.<br /><br />Super Stickman Golf runs smooth, sounds good, the physics engine is solid, and the different courses have a definite visual appeal. At first glance, they look pretty simple, but look closer and there is a striking amount of detail and beauty there, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|4.0|Seriously!  People are saying that the game sucks, but it doesn't!  The game itself is great,  just because it lags doesn't mean it's not!  Honestly,  the game does perform better on apple products,  but saying that its a bad game is untrue! People should be able to judge the game for themselves!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very entertaining and the writing was just addictive! I wish there were 3 more books about Ana and Christian! If you like the sample for the first book, just go ahead and buy the 3 book bundle, you won't regret it!
B004EPYZQC|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />\\"Fast Five,\\" so named because it is the fifth entry in the highly lucrative \\"Fast and Furious\\" franchise, finds our intrepid band of car-racing criminals, played by Vin Diesel , Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster, masterminding a heist against a South American crime lord played by Joaquim de Almeida .  Wayne Johnson joins the cast as an American Secret Service agent hot on the trio's trail.<br /><br />Replete with wafer-thin characters, corny one-liners, substandard acting and muddled moral messaging, the movie culminates in a spectacular, though really rather ludicrous, car chase through the streets of Rio de Janeiro.  Strictly for aficionados of vroom-vroom storytelling.

B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I'll keep this short, so as to waste less of my life on this execrable album.<br /><br />Reviewers such as Pitchfork have praised this album for it's 'creativeness'. Apparently creativeness involves:<br /><br />1. Minimalistic instrumentation<br />2. Apparent absence of anything that could be described as a melody<br />3. Horrid singing in which the artist tries to show off her protean 'range'.<br /><br />That's three strikes. Lest you doubt the album deserves this abuse, give it a listen. Even the new Regina Spektor album is better. Yes that's right, REGINA F'IN SPEKTOR.

B007Y6OZE0|5.0|To me, this is one of, or maybe the best Offspring album - not only because every song is extremely well written, but also because Bob Rock makes the material sound fantastic. Never before has an Offspring album sounded so good, and there truly is no filler material here.

0385342063|3.0|I adore Sophie Kinsella. She writes wacky, adorable and funny chick-lit books. Her stories are also so very British since they're always set in England. I've Got Your Number may just be the wackiest story Sophie has written to date. Poppy Wyatt has lost her engagement ring. This ring is a priceless family heirloom from her fianc&eacute;, Magnus. Since Magnus' parents aren't too keen on Poppy, she's up a creak without a paddle. Plus her cell phone gets stolen. But she has some luck on side when she finds a cell phone in a garbage can. She'll claim this phone so the hotel can call her when they find her missing ring.<br /><br />The phone Poppy has is a business phone that Sam Roxton's personal assistant used to answer his emails and phone calls. He wants it back but Poppy needs it. Soon through text messages and phone calls, they're going back and forth where Poppy is forced to be Sam's assistant in a way. Because Sam is very cut and dry in his email responses, Poppy takes it upon herself when she replies to Sam's emails from work associates and others she pretends to be him and her replies are friendlier and soon misconstrued. Poppy is now living a double life of sorts. She helps Sam with his work and finding a thief in his company, as well as lying to Magnus and his parents about her missing engagement ring. Soon everything comes crashing down on Poppy's head, but Sam is there to give her advice and possibly something more she finds lacking with Magnus.<br /><br />Total loopiness is how to describe I've Got Your Number. There are so many implausible things that occur in this book, but I didn't care because it was such a fun read. Poppy is laugh out loud hilarious from her reactions to things and her thoughts. Watching her drive Sam crazy was a bonus, but the way Poppy does it is in all good fun. She has a good heart and wants everyone around her to be happy.<br /><br />I've Got Your Number will have you in stitches, and even though I found the ending a bit ho hum and underwhelming, overall this was another Sophia Kinsella read that really brightened my day.<br /><br />Katiebabsrwhelming, overall this was another Sophia Kinsella read that really brightened my day.<br /><br />Katiebabs

B00881VLCE|5.0|I am using this app on a kindle fire. The puzzles graphics are crisp and clear. You can select how many pieces you want to have. It saves your progress at each setting so my kids and I can work the same puzzle. Hundreds of free puzzles in dozen of categories. One of my favorite apps so far.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was on my dad's iphone and he was playing tempel run I fell in love with it! So I ran up to my room grabbed my Kindle and it was not on the app store! I checked everyday still no tempel run. Then on day I checked and there it was!! I play it for hours now! once you get this you will love it! But if your having trouble don't give up keep on going! this game is wonderfull!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come to kindle fire!!!! All of my friends have it on their ipod or iphone and now I finally have it. It runs smoothly except for a few pauses now and then but I don't mind it!!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|its was ok cause some time they give the wrong answer. so give it a 4 or5 so that's how much I think
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Well I think the graphics of blu ray,the plot, the bad guy were all done excellently. However the story was very sad, (spoil alert!), captain america loses his best friend and later wakes up to find he was asleep seventy years but his foe was sucked into the deep dark voids of space only to return at the end of the avengers movie. Under normal circumstances i would give this three stars but since it was a \\"Army film\\" it really captured the sadness and loss war causes. Overall a good buy and the blu ray is well worth the excess money.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|it is easy to figure out but also confusing once u get more completed. the more elements u have the harder it is though. overall pretty good game
B005G4TJI4|4.0|See I haven't watched the other transformers films yet i fully understood this one which was a proof its a simple story line just done well. I thought the plot was good, the blu ray was well worth the money and i like the average DVD in case my TV is taken i can watch it on my lap top. I would give this five stars except it was a predictable film (similar to super hero movies excluding Thor which was very unpredictable). Overall i enjoyed the movie and I have no regrets about buying it.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|Just recently discovered Kevin Hearne with this book and I have already read the next three and can't wait for the next one! I really like the modernism mixed with the old world fantasy.  My favorite character (besides the main) is Oberon ....love him!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|While this series has been tagged as \\"mommy porn\\" by some critics, there is ALOT more to this story than sex. I am not a fan of BDSM so I was very unsure about reading this series. However, the book is NOT about BDSM. It's about a man falling for a woman and being made into a new person. And it's about a woman standing up for who she is while exploring new and exciting endeavors sexually. Excellent books!!! MORE please!! =)
B0087DFIYA|5.0|I've watched most of his movies, and as the years passed, he simply climbed that ladder higher-and-higher to Success! This movie is no exception. Another terrific action-packed thriller with lots of intense suspense as Gibson aims to please. Acting Performance Excellent, gritty, exciting and entertaining. Of course, there's the usual charm, wit and humor. A lively, thrilling motion picture worth every moment. A must-see and Highly Recommended!
B00846REIS|2.0|After reading Shades of Grey this book pales in comparison. The main character, Eva, acts like a spoiled brat. Her boyfriend, Gideon, has no depth whatsoever. Their shaded pasts are never fully revealed and tied into the storyline. I thought this book would have alot more complexity. Boring. Mundane.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I wish I could read all of my news like this.  Easy pleasant interface, text and images formatted to actually read, and of course the fun little flipper mechanism.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this news reader is too stupid to remember what you are reading.  Imagine that you are happily reading some neatly-formatted article, and you get an email.  Oh look, my friend sent me a cat video.  I think I will stop reading this article containing 12 photography tips and watch the video.  OK, that was cute, now I will continue reading... BAM!  Flipboard has reset itself to the home page.<br /><br />Flipboard will remember your location only for as long as it remains actively running.  If it has to start up, everything is lost.  Unlike Opera Mini (browser) and Pulse (similar to Flipboard), Flipboard does not keep track of your current position to recall it when you open it again.  You can bookmark pages, save them, or open them in a real browser, but you would have to manually save or bookmark everything you are reading, and then clean up your bookmarks later so your bookmark list does get cluttered.<br /><br />That one failure makes Flipboard nothing more than an amusing way to kill leisure time, though it could have been a serious main news reader for people who actually like to read entire articles.
B0063IH60K|5.0|In particular, I really enjoy the winning animations.  The variety of animations is superb.  This game has turned out to be very, very stable (no crashes on either my Samsung Vibrant, nor my Asus Transformer Prime.)  Very highly recommended.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Without question, this was the best biography I have ever read.  Isaacson honestly portrayed Jobs with all his greatness and fundamental flaws.

B006AX6ONI|4.0|Mark Cuban's book How to Win is a short, solid read that I'd recommend to any young entrepreneur. In it, Cuban talks about how detailed focus as a young man is a silly pursuit (a varied look on life ultimately gives you maximum exposure to opportunities at a young age) and how effort is the only thing someone can control - and is one of the most important factors in life.<br /><br />As a getting-older-all-the-time entrepreneur myself, I find that the limited success I have had in my life has come because of following the \\"Cuban Rules\\" Mark outlines in his book. Success in business requires obsession, and to discover that obsession, you have to jump from place to place until you find your life's calling.<br /><br />Overall, a great read, and I would also encourage any reader of this book to follow up and read his blog over at [...], where he semi-regularly updates with humorous anecdotes about the Mavericks, business, stock exchange, and life.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games by FAR is the best book I have ever read. I read this when I was in 5th grade, and my mom wouldn't let me read it till she'd read it first. Many people hate this book before they even read it, it's NOT. THAT.BAD. The book, yes, is framed around the factor 'kids killing kids'. Thats not the point, their forced to do it. They're doing it to survive, and in the book most of those kids don't even WANT to kill. The first time I read this I couldn't put it down, it's a very very very very good book. Well written and perfect for a Book Report(Trust me, A+ Experience ;) ).<br />However the context is very graphic and gory, and I wouldn't recommend it to any kid under the age of 12, or in 4th grade or younger. Once you get into the book it's hard to get out, as the series progresses it gets more gruesome. So I strongly suggest you  make a descion if you/ or your child should read this. Many of my friends say they are two 'scared' to read it because it will give them nightmares. This IS partly true. There are 3 times in the book were it DOES get very detailed in gore, which alone gave me nightmares. However if your not bothered by this then, by all means! Go ahead! But parents, I'm a Christian, and I don't agree with all of this. However this book has many good point of views. So make your choice before you read it please!

B00004TR2G|4.0|The movie scared me to death when I saw it in high school and still, to this day, it never fails to enthrall me. A large part of that is due to Williams' exquisite soundtrack.  It is simple and complex at the same time, underscoring the feelings and mood of the characters with sublime power.<br /><br />This is a wonderful cd package with many extra cuts that the album version just couldn't accomodate. I love the extra tracks.<br /><br />What, in my mind, differentiates good movie and tv score composers from the great ones is the great use subtile sound images that do not take your attention from the screen.<br /><br />Williams' is a master at that.  Though some of his later works is repetitious, his early work still shines -- it is great MUSIC as well as soundtrack. You just cannot find a more stunning opening note to a movie than that first drawn string of the shark's theme.
B0086700CM|5.0|Not a hard game...but it is very relaxing to me. Good graphics and controls are accurate about 97% of the time. Awesome faotd!!
B0059XTUB8|3.0|I've seen most of Marilyn's movies and think she was underrated as an actress during her lifetime, possibly due to her reputation for being difficult.  She's almost revered now, not just as a sex symbol but as a fine comedic and dramatic actress.  Bus Stop, Some Like It Hot, Niagara, even The Misfits -- they all show her range and power and most of all, her presence.  This is where My Week With Marilyn falls down.  Michelle Williams does a fine job imagining Marilyn, but it's impossible for any actress to convey Marilyn's presence.  From a distance, I could almost believe I was watching Marilyn.  Up close, something was missing.  But I can't fault Williams -- nobody could have done it better.  The question is whether it should have been attempted at all.  We didn't learn anything about Marilyn that we didn't already know.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie mostly for the behind the scenes look at filming The Prince and the Showgirl, and the best parts of that were when Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndyke took up for Marilyn, defended her, tried to help build her confidence.  I'd like to know if Thorndyke really thought MM was a \\"great actress\\" -- I'm skeptical about that.<br /><br />I thought the movie also did a good job showing the effect on Marilyn of the public's adulation, being mobbed wherever she went, sometimes seeming to enjoy it, even seek it out, but at other times wanting to hide. The characterization left me with the impression that Marilyn recognized that people adored her because she was Marilyn Monroe, and not because of who she really was.  The thing is, did she even know who she was?  We'll probably never know.<br /><br />Like other reviewers here, it was hard to buy into Colin's story of their relationship, but since I have no evidence to the contrary, I'm not going to call him a liar.
B0086700CM|5.0|the long wait for temple run was well worth it. very addicting and quick game to play. fun to kill even just 5 minutes. love it!
B003EYVXVY|4.0|It's hard to believe that such a CGI masterpiece would have such a poorly designed entrance.  The \\"PLAY-SCENES\\" icons are nearly impossible to interpret from a normal distance.  When you select PLAY the small text inside the icon changes from medium blue to light blue.  You have to take off the 3D glasses and move close to the screen to see the change; confirmation that the selection was made.  I almost returned the DVD before I discovered the change.  (5 stars for the movie, less 1 star for the entrance.)
B0000640VM|5.0|Oliver & Company is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on November 18, 1988. This would be the last Disney movie to be around seventy minutes or less; all future movies would be eighty to ninety minutes or even longer. Oliver & Company tell the story of a young kitty cat named Oliver who is abandoned in New York City and is taken in by a group of dogs who leader is named Dodger; the dogs owner is Fagin who is a petty thief and not a good one at that. Fagin takes in Oliver as part of the gang. Later on in the movie Fagin kidnaps Oliver after he is taken in by a girl named Jenny. Fagin does this so he can get ransom money from her to pay off his debts to Sykes. The plan backfires and Sykes kidnaps Penny. Fagin, Dodger, Oliver, and the rest of the dogs go after Sykes to rescue Jenny. Jenny is saved and is reunited with Oliver once again. This is mainly the cliff note version of the movie. I mainly want to write about some of the facts and trivia about the movie itself.<br /><br />Oliver & Company was a box office smash, but mainly received negative reviews. This was Disney's first musical animated movie in eight years since they released the Fox and the Hound and the last movie before the Little Mermaid kicked of the Disney Renaissance. Just like the Lady and the Tramp, 101 Dalmatians, and the Aristocats, they made this movie from a cat\dog's point of view and the animators shot photos eighteen inches off the ground from the streets of New York City. Oliver & Company was to be a sequel to the Rescuers and have given the character of Penny more development, but the producers scrapped the idea because they thought it would not sell. Two final pieces of information about this movie are: Peg and Jock from Lady and the Tramp and Bongo from 101 Dalmatians make a cameo appetence in Oliver & Company in the only names used from the Oliver Twist story are Dodger, Fagin, Oliver, and Sykes.<br /><br />Now a few words about the DVD, in my opinion some of theextras in the Bonus Features could have been left out or included more information and a good example is the Making of Oliver & Company. The Making of Oliver & Company is a short segment that gives you a cliff note version for the making of this film and should have more information. The same goes with Disney's Animated Animals was a joke in itself; too little information. The two shorts: Lend  A Paw and Puss Café are enjoyable to watch.

B00701QVVY|4.0|Old school metal just the way I like it.  Let me just say, for the past couple of years, I've been looking for some new groups to listen to so I could mix it in with the old standards (Metallica, Ozzy, Megadth, Van Halen, etc) that I always listen to.  In my quest to find something \\"new\\", I have discovered some awesome groups: Motorhead, Dio, Sepultura, Iced Earth, King Diamond, and now...OVERKILL!!!  As you can see, when it comes to finding \\"new\\" music, the groups that I like best are old school 80's/early 90's groups that I somehow missed out on back in the day..  It's not that I intend it to be that way, just when listening for that sound that I like, old school is where I find it.  I'll be listening to my first Testament album when they come out with their new one in August.<br /><br />Anyway, on to this album.  Right off the bat, \\"The Electric Age\\" brings the old school thrash with Come and Get It.  It's tight, heavy, fast and, damn it's good!  The 'blitz' (pun intended) continues with Electric Rattlesnake (the best song, imo)  and doesn't let up until the very end with the closing lyrics, \\"Good Night.\\"  This is grab you by the nads and don't let go head banging metal from beginning to end.  There's nothing ground-breaking here, but there really doesn't need to be.  There are enough other groups out there trying to reinvent the wheel (and usually failing, in the opinion of my ears), it's good to hear that there are still some groups out there that just play it loud and heavy.  Don't get me wrong, these songs have rhythm and even some sprinkling of melody (all the great bands do), but on the whole, it's thrash, plain and simple.<br /><br />I've read some reviews where people criticized guitarist Dave Linsk, but I didn't have any problem whatsoever with any of the guitar playing on here...sounded great to me.  The only other note I would make is that the lead singer, Blitz, sounds a lot like the singer from Jackyl, imo, which isn't a bad thing since I like them,too.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this disc to fans of heavy metal and/or thrash and I can't wait to start going back into Overkill's catalogue for more.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|She wrote it for the money...of course. She knew the constant sex and the fighting and making up would<br />make her a lot of money.  It is a literary blight, a piece of crap...and I did not get past the middle of the second book<br />Ana is only 21 and a virgin, oh the fantasy gets better, and what does she know about men, and her hormones are raging, and<br />he is gorgeous and rich and has great taste and is brilliant, and oh so damaged<br /><br />.OK i get it, escape is good but there are better books, there has to be better books ~ smile~

1451608659|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Dominique provides you with an inside look into the sport and what really went on in the Karoliy Ranch. Her story is amazing, from the gym to her inspiring sister Jen. As a fan since the 90s, I was amazed at all that she's experienced in her life. With this book, you'll not only learn about her gymnastics story, but also her personal life and struggles. A must-read!
0345803485|5.0|I loved this series, I could not put this book down, it kept me on the edge of my sit waiting to see what happen next. Loved the whole series!!! A series well written.
0060558121|4.0|It's not news to anyone that this is an amazing. It was nearly a decade ago when my car broke down on a long stretch of highway, and friendly trucker helped me push it off the road. He lifted me to nearest truck stop, where I ordered a tow for my car, called my brother to come get from across the state, and tried to figure out how I was going to kill the 5 hours it would take him to reach me.<br /><br />Browsing the books on the paperback rack, I was pleasantly surprised to see Neil Gaiman's name. I had read the Sandman and loved it. I'd read Stardust and been very impressed. I ordered a bought the book and a burger and the next five hours passed quicker than I could ever have imagined. I devoured the book. I didn't finish it that night, but I read as much as I could, and when I finally did finish it I flipped back to the front and read it again.<br /><br />Since then, I've read the book several times. I'm giving it four stars instead of five, because I could only give five to a book that I would recommend without reservations. Gaiman isn't a perfect writer, and there phrases and ideas in this book that are repeated enough to become an annoyance. Especially on rereads. With that being said, this book is perfect for anyone who gets shivers when passing a carnival at night, or thinks abandoned hunting lodges are beautiful, or is drawn to dilapidated shopping malls. It takes place in an America that is aging, cracking, and falling apart, but in those special places where you get a shiver or feel like you're being watched or check your watch only to find it's the same time it was five minutes ago, a little bit of magic is hiding.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This will definitely keep you entertained for hours.  The reward is worth the challenge.  My coworkers and I do these while on break and find that time flies.  If you are not careful, it becomes addictive and before you know it all of your freetime is gone.

B005LAIHXQ|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" recycles a lot of material from the Alien franchise: monsters bursting out of people, flying squids with whip-like tentacles, even the Alien creature itself. There is also an android crew member and a determined heroine, just like the other Alien movies.<br /><br />The plot centers on a team of scientists who land on a planet thought to be inhabited by extraterrestrial beings. One of the scientists thinks the beings created humans, but there is no evidence of this. Later on, a specimen is recovered and its DNA sequence is found to match human DNA. All this proves is that we are related to the beings, not that they bioengineered us from scratch. We could have been deposited here by another intelligence and left to evolve before the beings discovered us.<br /><br />If the beings did create us, did they create us in our present state, or did they create earlier homo species? If they created earlier homo species, they would have to have created chimpanzees. The reductio leads to the conclusion that they created all life on the planet. It is too much of a leap to say they created us.<br /><br />The crew thinks the beings (the \\"Engineers\\" as they call them) are using the planet ruins as a biowarfare lab to exterminate humans. Eventually, one of the Engineers is awakened from a stasis chamber and tries to kill the expedition team. So, clearly there are signs that the beings are hostile. But at the end, Noomi Rapace announces that she wants the android to fly her to the Engineer home world. If they want to exterminate humans, why would she want to go near them? And how would they sneak in there? They'd be intercepted and killed before they could touch down.<br /><br />Like most science fiction films, the extraterrestrials say nothing interesting. There is no indication that the beings are intelligent aside from their technology. The film makers need to do more than show us the interior of their spaceship to demonstrate their eminence. After all, the awakened Engineer behaves like an uncaged brute. Instead of exuding a god-like aura, it acts like a humanoid version of the Giger alien.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, but how about giving audiences something new? Give us extraterrestrials who say intelligent things, not brutes with advanced technology. We've seen the Giger aliens enough already.
0345803485|1.0|50 shade of grey, this is the most stupid book ever, i'm sorry for the people who like it, i can see the sexual frustration in them, sorry for you but this is not fun, this writher turn a virgin to a nynph, this writher is so frustrate sexually, give some viagra to you husband, it my last 4 hours if you lucky, american, what are u riding? she do not even know cars, saab in out, she has no class, is is illiterate, i have an excuse, english is not my 1 language but never published a book , at least not so stupid and i speak 4 languages.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|HBO's great but much too short series in a boxed set.  What more could you ask for?  The complete series on 11 discs with an informative booklet takes you from start to finish with \\"Rome\\".
0345803485|2.0|I recently bought my mother a e-reader and because we share an account this book popped up on my e-reader too.  First thing that I said to my mom was \\"You do know this is a dirty book right?\\" and she replied \\"Yeah, its SUPPOSED to be S&M but its not.\\"  I should have known that if it didn't even garner a minor reaction from my mom, it probably wouldn't live up to all the hype.  It was bad and the amount of gushing praise that it has received is astounding.  My thinking is that most of the people who were so impressed with it, probably find true erotica a little too much.  For me it was anemic and unrealistic - and nowhere near imaginative enough to qualify as a fantasy.  I'm annoyed that so much praise is being heaped on this book when there are much better erotic books out there. I admire anyone who has the courage to publish anything, but I'm saddened that this is what qualifies as \\"hot and steamy.\\"

B007V2UGPE|5.0|Even though this app requires money to buy some of the bigger things, it's still a great game. Amazing graphics, and some pretty easy controls.
0756655307|2.0|They left a lot of heroes out.  Why put the wraiths that Rom fought in the book and then don't mention Rom himself?!  A huge write up on Rick Jones but nothing on A-bomb?  Whoever put this together had no clue what they were doing.  Thanos got this little paragraph and black widow got a full page.  I was very disappointed in this book.  Do not buy this book if you think they are going to have all of the heroes because they are not even close.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I just finished formatting my first novel for publishing on Amazon.  The next step I needed to take was to produce a cover design for the book.  I don't have Photo Shop and don't want to buy it, but yesterday when I checked the Kindle Fire Store for photo editing apps I found this one . . . for free!  It does everything the Product Details says it does. The only disappointment for me is that there are only three choices for text fonts, actually two, as the other one is cursive.  I have been able to upload photos from my Photo Gallery and edit them and then save them back to the Gallery (or, to and form my PC), and even e-mail them to the publisher to use as my book's cover.  They look very professional and it's relatively easy to do.    I wrote the above about a year ago. Just recently I purchased the new, 5th Generation Kindle Fire 10 and when all of my Apps were moved form the old Kindle Fire 8 to the 10, this App was not among them. Apparently it has not been modified for the new Kindle. There is a version for the Kindle 10 that is called PicShop Lite but the primary functions for editing photos is blocked.  I hope that will be remedied in the near future because I just finshed my second book and I need the old App to do a cover for it.  Help!  MOD

1603427244|4.0|I'm a knitting geek.  I collect techniques and always like learning new ways to cast-on or bind-off my work.  There's much to like about this book -- it has several of my favorite cast-ons and bind-offs, and a few that I haven't seen before.  It's useful to have them in one place, in an easy to carry format.<br /><br />I do have a couple of quibbles, although neither one is huge or terrible or detracts from the overall usefulness of the book. 1) Judy's Magic Cast-On is so much more than just a cast on for toe-up socks -- ever since I learned it in a class with Wendy Johnson, it's become my go-to provisional cast-on (no waste yarn needed, and no picking up stitches, just turn over your knitting and go) and my favorite tubular cast-on.  I also use JMCO when doing a garter tab start for a shawl -- it's absolutely elegant. JMCO is filled with awesome.  2) It would be nice if there had been a little bit of discussion of alternate kitchener stitch methods, such as for garter stitch and even reverse stockinette.  I've kitchenered a shawl together that had stockinette, reverse stockinette and garter stitch sections, and there IS a difference when you're working on garter or reverse stockinette.  There are references and tutorials available out there (Wooly Wormhead has one) but it would be nice in a technique driven-book like this to address these differences.<br /><br />However, beyond those two quibbles, I'm glad that I purchsed the book.  :)
B000LYF2X0|5.0|For a while I had the Japan mono metal mastered version that I held up as the gold standard for this album. While it is a truly great pressing this one wins hands down. Yea,  it's out of print & copies sell for crazy expensive but in this one instance it's justified. The definition & clarity in unreal. It's almost like I've never heard this album. It's that good. I really hate promoting profiteering but you've never heard With The Beatles till you've heard this. I don't care how high the price goes I'll never part with mine till they pry it from my cold dead hands!!!!!
B008B1W3V4|3.0|Yes, this is the clean version.  Edited songs are Payphone, Tickets, and Wasted Years.  The explicit version shows [Explicit] in the album title.
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl isn't perfect, but the unusual style, depth of descriptions (sometimes overdone), and clever-but-not-coy writing make it a very worthwhile read.<br /><br />The writer does a spot-on job chronicling what has happened to many semi-affluent (weren't they once related to yuppies?) couples who have experienced the stress of our economic times and emerged not so sweetly.  Bringing them to a middle class town, now a shell thanks to the housing bust and recession, adds another contrast between self-satisfied big city folk and their heart of America counterparts.<br /><br />Here is where the author is best at irony: the couple is there because of the recession and changes in technology (i.e., computers/Internet over paper media) and the townies are in decline over the same thing (blue book manufacturing companies no longer needed).<br /><br />I thought the verbal shorthand between Nick and Amy  to be totally believable and what made the ending understandable.<br /><br />People call it a thriller, but I found that not entirely so.  Granted, there were cops, clues, plot twists, a few tense scenes, and  plenty of red herrings, but that wasn't the soul of the story for me. I would recommend this book to those who savor good writing and a cast of detailed and methodically drawn characters.<br /><br />So, what should you do?<br /> A. Put this title on your dusty books-I-Should Read List<br /> B. See if you can filch it from a friend's bookshelf<br />C.  Be the ideal husband: immediately get it for your wife and have it gift wrapped in her favorite color paper<br />D. Buy it at full price and never loan it out, sweetly mentioning that  authors should be supported or we will lose them<br /><br />Dancing Monkeys will answer C.  Amazing Amys will KNOW D. is the perfect thing to do....

0763644765|5.0|The words are simple, the pictures are captivating, and the story is easy to follow for toddlers (in preparation for, during, and after potty training).  My son just turned two and he requests this book before bedtime more than any other book. I often add in my own words to explain more, but if you read the words given, it's still gripping enough to hold the attention of a small child. This is a great book to use when attempting to spark good, fun feelings about using the potty! Highly recommended!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|When you read a book it is supposed to educate you in some ways, make you laugh, make you cry, make you want spice things up in your romance...this book captures the essence of love, lust, trust, real human fear and doubt etc. Yes the book features  very intense erotic scenes but I wouldn't have it any other way. It was tastefully written. This book has a certain type of reader but if it's not for you move along but don't hate because a book doesn't become a Times bestseller for consecutive weeks for nothing. I loved the whole trilogy and I would recommend the books to any mature adult reader looking for a more mainstream, sexy, romantic read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I don't know where I'd be without both my Kindle and my new Kindle Fire!  I bought my first Kindle when I had my shoulder op. Wow,  how have I ever managed without it? But be WARNED,  if you start a library,  make sure you keep your old email address and password if you decide to change your email address to a new one.  Libraries are not transferable.  I DID NOT KNOW THAT!  Now I have two libraries. Something Amazon needs to work on. Just sayin'

B007P6VLRS|1.0|i was the biggest sp fan. but billy must have died at some point while recording machina. he was then replaced with some clone that can't write music or sing. the clone of billy corgan trys to sing like the real corgan did but can't hit the same notes, etc. the clone's writing style of music is horrible and lacks any kind of substance. and the personality and spiritual direction of the corgan clone is confused at best. super disappointed in this album just like i was when the clone of billy corgan released zwan, zeitgiest, and now this piece of garbage. so disheartening. the worst part is knowing how talented the real billy corgan used to be before he died and was replaced with the billy corgan clone.

0061726834|5.0|One thing Lauren Oliver will never suffer from is a sophomore slump.  Her second book amazingly outshines her first book, and I thought that would be really hard to do!<br />Oliver has written a dystopian world that is not that far from our world.  Love has been eradicated with a cure that takes place once you've turned 18.  Girls and boy prior to this have been segregated so as not to create any feelings between the two sexes.  This is all they know.<br /><br />DELIRIUM starts with Lena obsessing over her evaluation that takes place before the 'cure' is administered.  With the help of her aunt, she has her answers down pat.  Lena wants the cure because she doesn't want to be reminded of her mother who's 'cure' never took and ended up committing suicide because she couldn't deal without having love in her life.<br /><br />During the evaluation, Lena is choking miserably and she is afraid that she will not get the life that she has worked hard for.  But luckily for her, a stampede of cows interrupts her evaluation.  Unluckily for her, she's caught the eye of a guy.<br /><br />This story sang to me.  My heart swelled and I fell in love all over again with the characters in this book.  I was gripped and literally holding on to the book for dear life.  The book left me breathless and wanting more, more, more.  Lauren Oliver tells a damn good story and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.  I have been forcing this book on co-workers, friends, anyone who will read it.  I loved it that much.<br /><br />I know that it doesn't come out for a while, but I encourage everyone who read and loved BEFORE I FALL to go out and buy this book.  You will all have a brand new favorite author.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this is a great hidden object game. the story line is a little cheesy, but it is easy to skip the dialogue.  the different mini games add a nice change so you dont get board with just one style of games.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I love all Crichton's books, could not wait till the next. I had not got around to this one. I have just finish, a little far out there, still very good. I could tell when Preston took over. I think he lost track near the end. Crichton may have outlined the whole story but Preston changed it to his style. I may be wrong but there was a caharacter that was killed off and I don't think Crichton would have wrote he/she out or the way it happen. I have gave it four stars only because Crichton didn't finish. If you want a good set down with time on your hands to be transported to a place that you would never even dream of with danger at every turn right till the last word, this book is for you.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Been a Yes fan for years, and had or had heard all the other YES albums, but not this one.<br />Was only familiar with \\"Soon\\".  Researched this album and listened to \\"Gates of Delirium\\" in full form.<br />WOW !!  Blown Away.<br /><br />Steve and Jon are fantastic, again, on this album.  Rick Wakeman isn't here, but Patrick Moraz does a fine job and really fills his part.<br />A must for any YES fan (how did I miss this one?)
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was one of those books that I felt forced to plod through.  The beginning wasn't bad but it really started to slow later on.  Yes she was a sociopath but they didn't give that the edge it deserved. If you read other suspense books this will not seem fresh in comparison. I agree with the other reviews that the ending made this book that much worse and I felt I wanted my money back.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|Craig Ferguson is a man who knows what he wants.<br /><br />He wanted to be American.<br /><br />He wanted to be Sober.<br /><br />He wanted to make you Laugh.<br /><br />With his new book, American on Purpose, he accomplished all three.<br /><br />When I read about someone, I often choose the books of the people I most admire and are influenced by. My wife recommended Craig Ferguson's book to me. She said she couldn't put it down. I agree.<br /><br />I covered the last 165 pages in one sitting. Yes, it is that good!<br /><br />But it's not an all-out laugh-a-thon as you would expect. This book shows that the American dream is not dead. As a Scottish boy living in Glasgow, Craig learned quickly that he liked experimenting with life. When that experimenting lead to punk bands, drugs and alcohol, his life took a turn for the worse. It wasn't until he almost committed suicide that Criag re-evaluated his life, enough to turn his life around and seek help. He found many friends and many loves along the way to conquering the addiction of alcohol. But one of his loves was old U.S. OF A. In Glasgow he built up a reputation as an off-the-wall personality comic under the stage name of, get this, Bing Hitler. He found out many things about himself. He was funnier sober, loved to make people laugh and shows that anyone can live a dream. But you have to love that dream. He did both. Today, he hosts the Late Late show on CBS, which my wife and I watch frequently. One thing I love is how random he is. And, despite the other late night talk show hosts, Craig looks like he's genuinely enjoying himself and just full of joy. Which is infectious. It just turns the whole room around the way he can make an audience bust out laughing.<br /><br />This is more than just an autobiography. It's a great guide to quitting habits, living life to the fullest and starting over.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Ok so long story short, I bought this headset around two years ago. Typically when you see 2 years ago, you  tend to hear \\"THIS STINKS!\\" or \\"IT BROKE\\". Now I will tell you a bit about this headset and my story.<br /><br />So yes, my headset did have an issue around year 1. However, I called up Logitech Support. And they offered to mail me a new one straight up not questions asked, I just have to mail my old one. They even offered me a discount code of 20% off their store for an apology! That is customer support, which frankly most companies have forgotten...<br /><br />The buttons on the side are amazing. Customization and a quick push to talk are cool. I use these headsets all day and they are my primary sound output. Most people think the 7.1 surround sound is a gimmick...No...it's not...The bass is so booming and crisp that when I play movies it feels like an Imax experience sometimes.<br /><br />Enough talking lets break down the numbers:<br /><br />Look and Feel 9/10<br />-\\"fake\\" leather ear cups can be a hassle sometimes on a hot summer day, but are comfy enough that I am not constanly taking them off every 10 minutes. The cups fit over my ears to make a snug and comfortable fit as well. The slick gloss and matte finish mix is just drop dead gorgeous. Top that off with red accents make it a perfect fit.<br /><br />Sound Quality 10/10<br />-There was an issue that Logitech addressed with some sound quality issues. In about 2 weeks after purchase, they corrected the issue and provided a proper patch. Since then, the sound has never been better. My voice is said to be \\"realistic\\" at times, and as mentioned the sound from the cans is crystal. They also include a side app to modify your voice into a troll, robot, etc. That always makes vent conversations fun =).<br /><br />Wireless 9/10<br />-I went down three floors in my apartment and outside and still had intermittent signal. Enough said. This will reach anywhere reasonably near your computer dongle.<br /><br />Battery 9/10<br />-YOU CAN CHARGE AND PLAY! Amazing feature, and issue of many other headsets. When I am in the middle of a dungeon or game I am not knocked off commission. Just wire them down and we are good to go. The cable is roughly 10-15 FT as well so if you have a issue getting to the box hopefully that eliminates it. Battery lasts for about 9-10 hours without a charge but I have experienced longer times when I don't have much sound or talking. Device also alerts you of low battery so you can prepare yourself. Battery is also replaceable, you can order new ones from Logitech.com<br /><br />Customer Support 10/10<br />- US based customer support, friendly reps. Understand my concerns and helped me. They are an amazing company and from now on I am a logitech freak. The fact they gave me a apology discount is even better!<br /><br />Overall 10/10<br />Price is not an issue, yes it costs more but you get what you pay for. I bought these at FULL retail, and I would do it again. By far the best headsets I have ever have. Thanks logitech for such an amazing product. Buy these, you will not regret it.Battery 9/10<br />-YOU CAN CHARGE AND PLAY! Amazing feature, and issue of many other headsets.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|I saw this movie and it was great! It also reminded me about the Hunger Games. I'm not saying theres some contest to the death, just because merida uses a bow like Katniss. in this movie merida doesn't like how her mom is kind of \\" in charge of her entire life\\" as it says in the movie. She goes to this witch who gives her a cake to change her mom. What Merida doesn't know is that it would turn her mom into a bear! merida's Brothers adventually find the cake and eat the remainings of it and get turned into bears themselves. And pretty much Merida has to change the 4 bears back to normal within 48 hours or the spell becomes permadent. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil anything.<br />P.S. It doesn't say in the movie, \\" If you had a chance to change your fate, would you?\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for this app too come on the kindle fire so happy but i cant wait till the temple run brave comes on kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't understand all the hype. This book has a horrible storyline. The writing is terrible. I struggled to get through it because I was complete bored out of my mind. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B008578PMU|5.0|This movie is a great war flick.  The visuals are amazing and the story is wonderful.  Based on the real story of real americans it can be a bit gritty and not necessarily good for little ones.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will leave you begging for more. More Christian, more Anastasia, more of the RRoP, and *sigh*, yeah, just more! Just as luck would have it -there are two more in the series! I've read them all now and it IS a journey worth embarking on!<br />This is NOT a YA reader, nor would I let anyone under 18 anywhere near this book due to intense adult content.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I got this on the app of the day and am having fun adding text to the photos for upload. It has a lot of nice features. Runs nicely on my tablet and for a beginner like me is easy to use. Photography suites get quite complex and as a beginner I just don't need nor understand all that. This is an app that functions as it says and does what it aims to do. 5 freebie stars for all the text I can put in photos.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game and good graphics but I am dying because I really want the brave temple run verison you should get it.
0691126658|5.0|I bought \\"Birds of East Africa\\" and \\"Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania\\" (which focuses on the same region) in anticipation of an upcoming trip. Both books are much larger and heavier than I expected, especially for the price, but that just reflects the wealth of knowledge and page after page of color plates.<br /><br />Because both are so heavy, now I need to decide which of the two to take. Because \\"Birds of East Africa\\" has range maps printed opposite the color plates, I think it will be the more useful book to have in the field.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it. would love it more if it gave a choice of level. it can be very addicting but frustrating because it goes to fast for me.
B004AYCWY4|4.0|This is generally an exceptionally clear and cogent presentation of the arguments that evolution does occur, and that it goes far towards explaining animal and human history.<br /><br />Where it frustrates is that the book preaches to the choir.  I would love to be able to present this book to an intelligent person who is on the fence re creation vs evolution, but Dawkins insults and demeaning of opposing beliefs (starting in the prefix) would generally dissuade such a person from advancing to chapter 1.<br /><br />Would love to see a version of this book with the science retained but the us_against_them polemics edited out.
0435123432|1.0|I was very disappointed in the product quality of this book.  Amazon stated this was a Hardcover Book.  When I received the book, it is the size of a paperback.  The print is very small!!  And the cover is \\"cardboard\\" quality, it has no book jacket!  Amazon should have been clearer on the type of book that this was.<br />(I do love the story. - It is just the product.)
B001ED7C58|4.0|I still have not watched any of the Twilight films (laughs). But I do have friends who have repeatedly watched them plenty of times to cover me. Anyway, I somehow heard good things about this soundtrack album, and on listening through, I really like, maybe love it. There is a very moody, dark feel to the sequence of songs, but in an enchanting rather than sinister way. It's like a terrific instant playlist. I love Collective Soul, and had some familiarity with MuteMath, Paramore and Linkin Park. Most of the other tracks were pleasant surprises, in particular \\"Full Moon\\" by the Black Ghosts and \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" by Iron & Wine. The former is one of the most unusually cool things I've heard in a while, very fetching rhythm, while the latter has to be one of the prettiest songs ever recorded. The only reason that I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I flat out do not like the Perry Farrell and Blue Foundation tracks. But otherwise, this is a great album regardless of whether you care for (or have even seen) the movie.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]  first and loved it. Did \\"Sharp Objects\\" make the cut as Flynn's first novel?<br /><br />Well, I felt a lot of sympathy for Camille Parker, the main character in \\"Sharp Objects.\\" I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" because of its smart characters even though they were unsympathetically twisted. Here Camille arouses more sympathy, even if cutting never occurred to you.<br /><br />I also like \\"Gone Girl\\" because of its clever language. \\"Sharp Objects\\" does not come up to that witty standard. But both novels are character based and pull you in with either the characters' wit or your empathy (yes, plenty of room for empathy in \\"Sharp Objects\\").<br /><br />Regarding empathy for such a haunted (figuratively) main character: I believe that many of us live decent lives while horror and evil exist around us. Consider the homeless and the poor. Consider abused kids. I have taught school, and reported child abuse by parents to authorities. I have seen many homeless children. Stronger people (adults, bullies or an uncaring society) frequently hurt the vulnerable (\\"different,\\" children, marginalized, disabled or emotionally vulnerable). While most people are not as awful as those in Wind Gap (the town in \\"Sharp Objects\\"), there are enough bullies, narcissists, sadists and sociopaths in our world to horrify most people with decency.<br /><br />\\"Sharp Objects\\" highlights this disturbing fact, and so will be uncomfortable to those that would rather ignore the pain of others. This theme runs through Stephen King's stories and much literary fiction. The best stories that deal with the horror in our midst pulls the reader in with prose that evokes emotion. Gillian Flynn builds considerable feeling in a caring reader.<br /><br />Some people do not want to view this dark side of humanity. They will hate this novel.<br /><br />Regarding some reviewers' point that \\"Sharp Objects\\" has elements of literary fiction, and thus is not \\"pure mystery.\\" I say, who cares? I care about stories and characters, not purity of genre.<br /><br />Finally, the book keeps the reader turning pages, filled with suspense not just about how the \\"mystery\\" will turn out, but, more importantly, how the characters will resolve their story.es?

B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game for free and works great.  Ads pop up regularly but are easy to click out of quickly.  Fun when you have a free minute or waiting for something.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Excellent game if you like &quot;where's waldo&quot; type puzzles. Beautiful graphics and easy game play on relaxed mode. Highly recommend.
0887081770|4.0|The story is cute...I just didn't like how a lot of the pages stuck together and almost ripped the first several times of reading.  Also, the pages are not cut evenly so appearance isn't all that.
B00000478B|4.0|In a sense, I can't believe I'm giving this 10-CD set just four stars instead of five. Charlie Parker was one of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, ranking with Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Duke Ellington when it comes to performance, innovation and influence. Plus, I love the pure sound of his playing. Like Coltrane on soprano sax, and for that matter Sonny Rollins on tenor and Gerry Mulligan on baritone, Parker helped define the instrument, which in his case was mostly alto. When you hear one of these guys play, you KNOW who it is.<br /><br />For the most part, I agree with everything the other reviewers here say about this set and its great value. So why do I withhold one star while the others give it five? Because I'm mean. No, because I believe quite firmly that this set could have been organized slightly differently: In short, I would have separated the fragmentary takes from the rest of the material here. I know that would have compromised chronology and continuity, but it also would have made for more of a LISTENING experience instead of a historical one.<br /><br />That said, I have spent many, many hours with this incredible collection of music. My favorite of all the discs is No. 8, which consists of four long songs on which Parker and his friends stretch out, beginning with the exuberant power of \\"Jam Blues,\\" my most beloved track on the album. Folks, if you've heard this, you've heard the sound of jazz at its best.<br /><br />This is an incredible box set, one of the true cornerstones of my music collection. I simply can't imagine life without it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A huge improvement over the stock keypads you're used to. One of the few apps I've paid for and never regretted. Take the time to open the program from the app Drawer to customize it. While there is not an overwhelming number of choices, they make a difference!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this app because it is very fun and entertaining. Its interesting with all the elements you can create.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|If you enjoy looking for hidden objects and ghosts and other things paranormal, this app is for you.  There are hints available which I found helpful. I really liked the graphics and pictures.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I seriously love this game. Every second of downtime in my life is spent playing this game. I can't fathom that there are people who don't like it. Just fantastic!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|this is a great hidden object game.  the objects are different, the graphics good, and the story line is fun and unique.  so far I am loving it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Its not just about sex its about a beautiful love story between two people one innocent and one traumatized the bond together through very odd obstacles that most relationships do not have.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes, the book is poorly written. Yes, there is repetition. Yes, it is graphic.  However, this book has an incredible story line! You will not want to put this book down. The entire trilogy is a fast read. This book is popular for a reason- it's good!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game. just beginning this grand adventure. seems to keep you glued to it. very nice look too. I hope everyone will try it.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I knew this was going to be a good album! I like this album better than their last album to be fairly honest. There are only about two songs that are slow but that doesn't mean that they aren't good! Just pick it up, you will not be sorry!
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|I was hopeful, but not necessarily set on this movie being like the classic Disney blockbusters from back when I was a kid. I was completely blown away by the entire thing! The script is great, the story line and characters are enchanting, and the songs are top notch! I am glad to see Disney putting their heart back into great storytelling. Note to caregivers: The movie, like all great Disney cartoons, has its dark spots. The \\"bad guy\\" is truly bad, and his solo song is creepy for little kids. My kids watch it all the time now, but it was a little much at first. That being said, I would still buy it again and again!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is very good when you are bored and I am bored a lot so I use it a lot I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! It is so amazing!
B00000272N|5.0|When I can listen to an entire album from start to finish and be well satisfied with it, that is a clear 5 star rating.  Over 20 years after recording, this cd is still fresh.  This is one of the stronger debuts from a well known band.  It is sad that they couldn't put out more recordings with the original vocalist in the 1990's.
0345803507|5.0|50 Shades Freed is the best book of all three books. Loved the Trilogy. Now I am waiting on the movie to see who can fill the shoes of Christian and Anastasia.

159413586X|5.0|I was intrigued by Collins' serpentine plot<br />Turns but since I was 27th in line to read her 3rd book in the series at our local library, I bought it in large print. Not only did it arrive quickly but I loved reading it in large print. My eyesight is fine but since i take out contacts before going to bed I found the large print version easy to read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a good calculator for everyday tasks.  The buttons are big and easy to see.  I like using it.
B007549W62|2.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />This movie centers around despairing situations and how a group of people face these challenges. It sounds really good on paper to me, but this movie was too depressing for me. There was some sort of plot, but it did not flow or connect together, which really left me unsatisfied at the end of the movie. It's just scenes and scenes of depressing material that I could have done without. I'm not against gore, horror, suspense, and depressing human conditions, but I really did not need to watch two hours of it and end up getting nothing from this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't usually read romance, my co-workers were talking some much about it. I thought that I would give it a try. I am so glad that I did, I was hooked at the first page. I was up the first night until after 4 am reading. I love the characters, I found that I related a lot to Ana. I found my self bitting my own lip as I was reading .. I would not get enough of Christian. I was sad to see it end...<br /><br />I recommend giving this book a chance it aweseome read. I think that this book and character will stay with me for along time. I look forward to re-read this book again and again.
0345803485|1.0|I am heartily sorry that I paid for this novel to be loaded onto my Kindle.  Several women recommended this book highly - even my gastroenterologist!  I honestly don't understand the allure that this book has for so many readers.  I found myself gritting my teeth at the turn of every page, asking myself repeatedly why the plot is even the slightest bit believable: even willing suspension of disbelief can't coax me into embracing the idea that a shy, recent college graduate would attract the attention of a \\"super hot\\" multi-billionaire, and I will refrain from any comments on the juvenile writing style of this author. If I may:  \\". . . my voice is husky, too low, and full of need.\\"  Another example:  \\"Oh my... he wants me.  Christian Grey, Greek god, wants me, and I want him.. .\\" Honestly, this isn't even good escapist literature. I wish I could get a refund!
0553801473|3.0|This was purchased for a gift for my wife. She is not as enthused about this book as the other 4.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Take a chance a dive into a story that is thrilling, romantic, erotic and dark.  A true love story in the end.  Loved every moment of reading this book.  I cant wait for more!
B0011E9LBI|3.0|I can remember seeing this when I was younger and I don't remember it being so short. And it's hard to believe, at well under 90 minutes, it was such a pop phenomenon in it's day. And I really remember Will Smith's character being \\"cooler.\\"<br /><br />That said, it was ok. I really enjoyed MIB II more than this one but it set things up pretty well.<br /><br />And parents, be warned, a PG-13 back then was a lot different from a PG-13 now. I showed it to my son (10 years old) in preparation for seeing MIB III and was shocked at all the foul language that was in the movie. In comparison, MIB II had just one scene that included 2 curse words.<br /><br />For nostalgia or to refresh for MIB III, skip to MIB II.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this with my tablet for school. It is really helpful and makes it possible for me to get things done quicker. I really like it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a very long time since I had actual tears running down my face at the close of a novel (_Wool_), but I was completely absorbed all the way through this series, and sincerely distraught that I'd finished it (and equally delighted to find Part 6 available).  This is my first review, also, of any novel not belonging to a friend.<br /><br />My husband had read _Wool_ before me, and while he found it terrific, he also had to put it down frequently because it felt so claustrophobic to him to read! I consider that a testament to the skill of the writer and the world he's created down in the silos. But I found it captured something elemental to my own character and the encapsulation of the story within the silo surrounded me only with characters that mattered to me and a world I recognized--the machinists and the astronomer.<br /><br />What I most appreciated--and what caused me to urge it as a must-read upon my middle daughter (15) is the character of Juliette as such a powerful force carrying the narrative.<br /><br />I'm eager to read all the Howey Hugh I can get my hands on. Really a fine, resonant story.<br /><br />--Cindy BS

I have just recently listened to the sounds of Rammstein and I purchased this for a friend.  Now I wish that I had ordered 2 of these.  You have the concert to enjoy as well as the CD to listen to in the car.  This collection is awsome.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been checking to see if the kindle fire had this and now they finaly do! Even though the download takes forever it is so worth it!
0451197968|3.0|I've never read Stephen King, but I like his movie adaptations, other pulp novels, dystopic fiction, and reading in general. I was very excited to receive this book. Even though it is well written, it is fairly vulgar for no particular reason. The plot is simple, boring, and the ending unsatisfying. I wouldn't recommend this book except to Stephen King fans who want to read his entire collection.
B00884GR0W|5.0|i love this rpg minecraft twist just as much as minecraft if you read the website it admits this is like minecraft and minecraft pe can be ran on kindle marcuss aka notch just hasnt done it yet

B007X16GFC|4.0|I didnt expect to really like this movie. One of my friends told me it was good, but you never know. Although we do have very similar taste in movies. But with that aside, I ordered it on instant stream in HD, the price was pretty good, and it was the perfect crowd pleaser during a BBQ with both families. The movie was solid the stream was great. I love amazon instant, even though it costs a bit more then redbox, it is easier and I dont have they always have what I want.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|When I bought this game I expected it to be a different game. Eventhough it is fun its very repetitive which is very annoying. sorry to say but I wasn't surprised:/.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I had heard this band on the radio a couple times. So when I started to listen to the CD I expect the radio song to be with the top 2 or 3 songs. To my surprise it didnt show up until close to the end of the CD and everything before that song was even more amazing then the first song. I have a special place in my heart for girl singers in alternative bands and this does not disappoint. I even suggested it for a friend of mine and he loved them.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game. easy enough for my five year old with a little help. you can't beat free. great game.
B00845PV16|1.0|no, just no. the first movie was interesting with some fun parts, but far from the best movie.  this, well this was just crap. no better way to describe it.  the plot was sensless, the way the \\"rider\\" moved around and acted was stupid. I couldn't finish it.  glad i only redboxed it.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|it is a very very fun game and spooky it is so very much like I spy kind of well that's my opinion
B000JCSPG0|5.0|I love the entire Stargate Saga... all of the series, all of the TV movies, and of course the original movie.
B0086213XW|5.0|I loved this film, so real and fragile. The characters showed a spark that is not glimpsed often. Play is so important in life. It is what makes us happy. Why can't we see this. I loved the connecting but it is hard to do for some of us. Openness and realness is hard for many of us, because of the walls built with such fortitude. Aloneness is harder but many of us don't grasp that. I loved the freeness. I loved the ending. She was herself and yes she was alone but she was alone with spirit. That is different than being alone without that special vibe. She was herself, and was comfortable without a mask, comfortable being weird, comfortable being wordy and philosophical, real and true. I loved the chicken cook and the togetherness of the couple.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is great but it can be very touchy. all that aside it's really fun<br />g g g g g y y y

0062183591|4.0|After reading this book, you have no reason to believe my review. Dan Ariely goes through many of the psychology and economics experiments that show how we lie to other people and lie to ourselves, even if we think those lies are harmless. As it turns out, we are all liars. Dan doesn't take a moral stance on that. He's only interested in the why and when of it, often sharing examples of cheating that he's done. After you're done reading this book, you should learn more about why and when you lie, to others or yourself, and maybe even recognize the external factors that prime you to do that. He does this is a light style that doesn't clobber the reader with jargon and technical detail. If you liked [[ASIN:0060731338 Freakonomics]], you'll like this book too.<br /><br />Several experiments show how priming a person can influence their behavior. Give them high end, brand name fashion to wear, an exclusive mug that gets them free coffee, or even just the mention that a particular company has sponsored an activity. Maybe a bookstore gives a reviewer a free book, like the Amazon Vine program sent me this book for free. These don't necessarily mean we act maliciously, but that we merely unconsciously favor one side.<br /><br />He also goes through the situations were we cheat because we evaluate the possible consequences and probability of getting caught. If I puff-up this review, who's likely to notice and what would happen to me if I get caught? That's probably what the publisher was priming me to think with the letter they left in the book noting how \\"excited\\" they were to share this wonderful book. I'm already biased to like them since I received the see gift and the nice note, so what's the harm in really liking this book?<br /><br />But, I already like Dan Ariely. I like his stories on various public radio shows. Before I read this book I figure I'm already going to like it, but what if I don't? Dan has a nice voice and I've liked his other stuff, so what's the harmin fudging the review a little. It helps Dan, it has no negative consequences for me (Dan will probably not refuse a dinner with me if I don't give him a scathing review), and I'm not likely to get caught anyway. I don't have incentive to cheat, but I don't have a disincentive either.<br /><br />Maybe I never read the book? How would you know? I've heard his stories on the radio, and maybe I've read the other reviews. He notes several stories about people priming future answers in quizzes (like the sort you'll find in puzzle magazines) by checking the answer for the question they just answered then peeking ahead. I could have done this for this review by cribbing from other reviews. I can tell you that I didn't, but how would you catch me if I did?<br /><br />Amazon might head off any cheating on my side by putting a glaring notice on my review page making me attest to the accuracy of my review, that's it's my own opinion, and that I actually read the book. He shows how simple notice, even given to good people, frame their interactions and keep them honest, even if they were mostly honest people before.<br /><br />And, there is an entire chapter on cheating in golf. Apparently it's the only second to tax returns in cheating.<br /><br />So there it is. You'll have to read the book yourself to see if I lied in my review.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Interesting book, a fast read. I enjoyed it,but not sure it was worth all the hype. Somewhat predictable, and you will like the details about the city of Seattle.
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Although I hated Minutes to Midnight with a flaming passion, I'm one of the few who loved A Thousand Suns as much as I loved their classics, Hybrid Theory and Meteora (yeah haters, I loved A Thousand Suns. There. I said it. Go ahead and thumbs down this review or whatever it is haters do). Sure, A Thousand Suns wasn't a return to their roots, but most of it was full of intense and emotional energy coated with a dense layer of electronica polish. In my humble opinion at least, it was a near perfect effort that had coherency of theme with a balanced variety of sounds and influences.<br /><br />So when it was announced that Living Things was going to be mixture of every style that Linkin Park had explored so far, I felt excited and couldn't wait to hear it myself. I waited eagerly for their single \\"Burn It Down\\", and immediately I was hooked from my first listen. Everything about it fit the bands description to a tee. I could hear the guitars reminiscent of their nu metal days. The synths from A Thousand Suns. Even though it didn't scream Hybrid Theory or Meteora loud and clear, it certainly sounded like a song that was structured similarly to their classic material from those albums. Later, Linkin Park revealed \\"Lies Greed Misery\\". Although it was a little too short, it too kept my expectations soaring high. As the new album's release date approached ever closer, I was ready to embrace Living Things as Hybrid Theory reincarnated. It looked like a hybrid of their new and old material would be a dream come true after all...<br /><br />Now that I have given Living Things a thorough four listens from beginning to end, I can confidently say that this album is the biggest musical disappointment I've experienced since Minutes to Midnight.<br /><br />I have woke up. And let me tell you, it wasn't pleasant.<br /><br />It starts out with a promising opener, \\"Lost in the Echo\\", which begins with a brilliant keyboard hook. Mike comes in rapping and Chester takes care of the chorus, singing in his familiar raspy vocal style that graced most of  Hybrid Theory and Meteora. Although I feel like it would have been better without the dubstep-esque beats, its a great track that reminds me of the same energy Meteora kicked off with on \\"Don't Stay\\".<br /><br />Too bad that Living Things doesn't keep up with that blazing energy throughout like Meteora did. After \\"Lies Greed Misery\\", Living Things goes from good to mediocre, and after \\"Victimized\\", Linkin Park takes a turn for worst in Minutes to Midnight fashion with terrible numbers like \\"Roads Untraveled\\" and \\"Skin to Bone\\". These songs find the band awkwardly attempting to infuse influences from folk music in with their electronic textured rock music. Not only does it not work, but it completely ruins whatever consistency was left before \\"Victimized\\". And when Mike raps again on \\"Until It Breaks\\", it comes off sounding like a poor man's \\"Wretches and Kings\\" and is then thoroughly ruined with Chester and even their guitarist Brad adding soft vocals that simply don't contribute to the rest of the song. Even the album's bare boned instrumental, \\"Tinfoil\\", (supposedly following the tradition of Linkin Park's first two albums with \\"Cure for the Itch\\" and \\"Session\\") fails to garner any sort of replay value due to what little happens during its short time in the spotlight. It leads into the last track, \\"Powerless\\", which appropriately closes the new album with a feeling thats the complete opposite of \\"Lost in the Echo\\"<br /><br />There are so many problems with this album. Its a rushed, inconsistent, awkward mess of an album that disappoints far more than it impresses. Unlike Meteora, which was a short 30-minute burst packed with high energy tracks that had plenty replay value, Living Things squanders its short duration with a track list of songs that feel so out of place that it could easily have been a collection of B-sides and unfinished demos. If I had known the album as a whole was going to be sucha trainwreck, I wouldn't have bothered pre-ordering it for $20+ and spent my hard earned money some albums that deserved it.<br /><br />Two or three years from now when Linkin Park releases their sixth album, I'll approach it with a little more skepticism and look into it further before I go head over heels preordering. Here's hoping Linkin Park can recover again from their disgrace.a trainwreck, I wouldn't have bothered pre-ordering it for $20+ and spent my hard earned money some albums that deserved it.<br /><br />Two or three years from now when Linkin Park releases their sixth album, I'll approach it with a little more skepticism and look into it further before I go head over heels preordering.

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Scandinavian writing par excellence. Devoured all three novels in short order. Dialogue is real, descriptions are totally descriptive, and the plot(s) are convoluted, detailed and very clever. Wish there were more!
B006PAZMMK|3.0|Sonny Moore had been writing new material as Skrillex for a while after he had left From First to Last, releasing some indie material and the fresh EP My Name Is Skrillex, but fame of epic proportions didn't slap him in his half shaved emo haired face until he dropped the juggernaut of a hit, Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. Call him the Justin Bieber of Dubstep if you wish, but I myself couldn't help but to love his euphoric adrenaline rush music, even if it did trigger a wave of bandwagon jumpers eager to fuse some dubstep into their own music.<br /><br />Fast-forward one year later, and Skrillex puts out -- tadaaaa! -- the Bangarang EP! Tracks like \\"Right In\\" and the title track itself may be entertaining to listen to, but I can't help but to feel like Sonny is merely using this new release as a vehicle to relive the fame of Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites all over again. Its good music, but you wouldn't be missing out on anything if you've already thoroughly enjoyed Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites. I love the little dude's tunes as much as the next guy, but Skrillex is going to need to learn some new tricks if he's going to get any more purchases from this dubstepper.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|This app provides a simple way to quickly sketch ideas or overlay text and graphics on a photo/image.<br />It does a pretty good job of being a graphics program that's tightly integrated with Evernote.<br />I'd like to see better selection tools, more colors to draw with, and other unexpected new features.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it its so fun its like a mini arcade it has so many games my favorite would be the sushi one
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first Heard about the book I thought people must be crazy to get into a book like this . My sister finally  wore me down and told me to READ it .I did and I could not put it down . It was funny ,sad ,and erotic.I read all three books in three days . It was so good that I reread it again! I even bought the book for several of my friends!
B0085776BG|5.0|Exceptional story, very well written and presented.  The special effects were exceptional.  Definitely worth viewing.  The storyline was easy to follow and this was highlighted by the interaction of the characters.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|love all the options. thanks keep up the good work.bla. bla. bla . bla. bla. bla. bla. bla. bla. bla. bla.
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|The much anticipated followup to Rise and Fall Rage and Grace its here. Days Go By might not be the record I was expecting but it sure proves to be a solid, exciting album. If you are a long time fan you'll recognize some familiar signature sounds of the offspring (aside from the obvious re-release of Dirty Magic, which is great!).<br />For what this album might lack in fast paced punk songs it makes up in clever,deep lyrics and katy perry-like melodies :p. I must say I was expecting something more agressive I don't mind this new display of \\"maturity\\" in their sound. Very enjoyable, make sure to go get it.
0670022950|5.0|This book offers an extraordinarily persuasive description of the decline of all forms of violence and a host of other social ills.  But what's really interesting about it is the explanations it offers for why the decline occurred and - here's the real beauty part - why we can expect it to continue (though no guarantees, of course).  In an extraordinary feat of scholarship, Pinker draws together research from history, psychology, political science, sociology, statistics and other fields to make his case.  And the whole thing is amazingly readable.  OK, I admit I skipped over some of the lengthy statistical explanations - but mostly I just kept on reading and reading.  This is one of those really long books that could have been even longer, as almost every page contained something new and fascinating.  It's a wonderful antidote to the kind of cynicism and resignation about the state of the world that lead people to give up on making it better still.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Love the kindle!  It's easy to use and has great instructions for<br />any problems you might encounter.  The size is compact yet large<br />enough to see well.  Also like the case.  Both are well worth the<br />price.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this app! Sooo much fun to play! its very addictive and once I start playing I can not stop playing.
1439110123|5.0|Although I agree with the complaints from the three star reviews, and would add my own, there is no other volume that covers the subject so completely.  I wanted to know more about the specific agreements between exporters and importers of oil given the fungibility of the product today but that would have made the book even longer.  Yergin's book deserves 5 stars because it does what no other volume does:  tells the tale from start to finish (well, 1991).  Sadly, 800 pages is not enough for everything we want to know.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Its a cool (and fairly inexpensive) app, BUT for some reason it won't &quot;convert&quot; certain pictures from my gallery. You get the processing bar but instead of the image being converted when the bar is complete it just opens up to the camera. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to which images in the gallery it won't work with either.<br />If this issue didn't occur it would be a great app instead of just good.
B003Y5H5B0|1.0|The movie was great, but stay away from this ultraviolet crap! Its a sony scam to get you to put more of their spyware on your computer. Just stay away.
0345803485|3.0|The book was good, NOT great like everyone made it out to be. Yes, it was erotic. Yes, we all sorta want a Christian Grey (minus the dark side). But it started to get annoying when the author had a lot of grammatical errors and kept repeating certain words/phrases. Am i the only one who noticed it? because it bothered me. Book one is super erotic. Book 2 is romantic. and Book 3 is a waste of time that isn't worth reading. Not really worth losing sleep over.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This was a horrible waste of time.  Bad plot. Like a bad horror movie where you're just waiting for everyone to die.  And the way it ends left me very upset that I didn't look for reviews before I rented this movie.<br />I was thinking it was more like the movie \\"alive\\" from some time ago. Nothing like it.  One star is gracious.
B0013HA838|5.0|An excellent production of Mozart's greatest opera.  I greatly enjoyed this work, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates Mozart.<br /><br />BBennett<br />Ph.D. Music
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I have been a fan of linkin park from the very beginning. I'm happy to say LIVING THINGS is there best one yet. It takes me back to the first time I ever listen to them. Well done. A must have.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome and it lets you buy stuff with coins that you in the game it cost no mouney. its the best game ever.
B006VYFB1C|4.0|I just watched the movie MONEY BALL. I really liked it. Although I'm a baseball fan, it was more about 'behind the scenes' than the game itself. I bought the 3 disc blu-ray package. Maybe someone can tell me what the second disc is for. It seems to be another copy of the movie. So, why do they have two copies? I also watched the interview in Studio 42 with Bob Costas. Help, please.
B0007939NO|5.0|I loved it. This is the very first Gene Kelly movie that I ever watched all the way through. I fave are the Fred Astaire musicals. I just loved the scenery and the Scotty theme of this film. However, that just might be my Scottish roots talking. I loved how they incorporated ballet in to the second dancing scene. The ending was wonderful. I think that it would of been dreamer if they kissed at the end. If you have any questions just ask me.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Puzzles are fun to do.  Dialog is pretty cheesy and kind of lame.  Reminds me of Ispy books as a kid.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|well neil finally let the horse out of the barn after 9 years( crazy horse that is) and came up with a masterpiece out of camp fire songs,and old american tunes.he truly is a genisus.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game does lag a bit but not a lot people play this to pass time beat high scores if you don't like temple run I don't know who you are! by the way it still lag on the iphone and ipad too
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Much more than I expected in any app,  especially the &quot;free app of the day&quot;. It's easy to use and the results are great. I haven' t tried printing yet; it's on my list! I will tell my Kindle Fire owner friends about it.
B004GYY714|4.0|Very good app/easy to navigate and great number of stations/presets work very well and I also like the EWTN archived programs

B0086700CM|5.0|i think you should get it it is for all ages i play it for a our a dont stop to eat or take a batroom break
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I have read all of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and loved them.  AND, I love these adaptations.  There is so much to absorb in one scene, so you may need to pause and resume a lot. Nevertheless, it is profoundly unique in its presentation, with thorough visual effects and nuances possibly even aimed at the viewer's subconscious experience.  The train scene was wonderful, and fantastical, even.  It is not intended to be realistic, but to entertain, to keep you on the edge of your seat, to make you laugh.  All in all a wonderful movie with a lot of talent poured into it!
B0086700CM|5.0|one of the most addicting games i have ever played. in my books it is more addicting than angry birds
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Reminded me on the college boys writing of their fantasies to the Penthouse Magazine Forum in the 1960's. If I had to read \\"murmur\\" one more time, I believe  I would have screamed. The reviewer that thought it might have been written by high schooler gave it way too much credit. Have to hand to Christian (not a pun), quickest recovery time I've ever heard of- 3 times in about 10-15 minutes. Wow!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this app a LOT! I play it ALL THE TIME! I love how you have neighbors and how u can make the food and design your restaurant. The only things I DON'T like about it is that your food takes REAL TIME to make, the gems cost REAL MONEY, and it force-closes ALL THE TIME! But over all, a very, very, very, fun and enjoyable app! :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is soo fun!!!!  thers always somethin fun and crazy to do,  and the possibilities never end!!  I suggest this game to little kids,  adults,  teens,  or even aged members.  but still!!  this game deserves 6 stars not 4 1/2!! &lt;3
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOOOOOO AWESOME! It works so gr8 on the kindle fire! the other people don't know what they're talking about! it's AWESOME! I love how you can get powers and boosts from the beginning and you can get different characters and things like that! I'm soooooo happy they got this game on the kindle fire!!! :)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a RUSH fan since 1976. I was 12 years old and my older brother came home with the LIVE \\"All The Worlds A Stage\\" double LP. Around 1987 I drifted to other artists for a very short time as \\"favorites\\" somewhat bemused by the direction that much of \\"Hold Your Fire\\" and the more synth laden sound had developed into.  Then swiftly with the \\"Presto\\" album and first hearing the song, \\"Show Don't Tell\\" on the our local radio station. My opinion and my heartfelt passion for RUSH was then refreshed and renewed. I can say today that I have enjoyed every aspect of RUSH's long career of musical diversity and musicianship. Sure, certainly scratched my head in confusion along the way.  But RUSH is the most consistent rock band (prog or other) ever. EVER.<br /><br />With Snakes & Arrows and the tour that followed, I was thrilled by how great they had continued to be, LIVE in concert. I first saw them in 1979.<br />Again, being appe-teased by the new songs, \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\". Something I didn't really feel or recall them doing since putting \\"Subdivisions\\" into their \\"Moving Pictures Tour set list before \\"Signals\\" came out. Please correct me if I'm wrong about that. Ahhh, radio. The great long lost and greatly confused and misused media outlet. It has sorely dismissed some of the amazing 1980's RUSH \\"singles\\", Distant Early Warning\\", \\"Time Stands Still\\", \\"Big Money\\", etc. I feel that radio, once much of the radio stations were bought up by \\"big money\\" corporations. Such socio-politcal statements had to be curtailed by previously lauded works. Placing RUSH and so many other bands that continue to put out new music to the category of classic rock. They are classic. But...anyway, I know you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />I felt with the Snakes & Arrows, albeit, a fine, fine work, they needed to next make a really powerful complete RUSH album. Tighten up the loose ends, jams and instrumentals and make a solid reflective, though modern, sonic record. Front to back, complete.<br /><br />I feel with \\"Clockwork Angels\\" it is done.<br />They have created a work that at this stage of the trio's career, is a true masterwork. That will hold up and be considered one of their best and most cohesive.<br />With 20 albums, endless tours and life journey distractions. From tragedy to success. Personally and professionally. They still make incredibly poignant and groundbreaking music.<br />This might possibly be the best RUSH album of \\"songs\\". A single body of work. An \\"album\\" per se. Of a combination of longer pieces and shorter songs. With no wasted space. They are on fire and on the mark on every track. I like that \\"Caravan\\" opens the record. It is stunning and desperately deserves to be on the radio everyday, everywhere. Same with \\"The Garden\\", \\" The Wreckers\\", \\"Headlong Flight\\". They are outstanding performances.<br />By the time you, the listener gets to the song \\"The Anarchist\\". Your head is spinning at power thrust. Each song has a development of  the featured story but doesn't overkill the point and ruin any kind of individual statement made by each song on its own terms. It is a work of brilliant genius and the musicianship is on every level simply fantastic. The music taps into impressions made from each stage of RUSH's catalog. Neil's drumming is as always a beyond impression of elegance, intensity and intelligent execution.. He is simplly the best rock drummer of the past 30 years. Geddy Lee's unimaginable abiliy to sing while covering many bases and triggers is a focused precision in the same mindset. Alex Lifeson is in my opinion; One of the most, though very highly rated, underrated guitarists. His nuances are within the songs and never in the way of the complete message.<br />I really enjoy where Geddy's voice has developed and grown. Emotional, Harmonic, Melodic and completely a singing \\"vocal\\".<br /><br />I trust RUSH. I trust them to make intelligent musical decisions and I don't question their creative voices and process.<br />They are painters. Each with individual brush strokes. Creating works of art when they work truly together in unity. As the friends that they are. Deeply respectful of each other's minds and instincts and never compromising the fact that they are indeed a rock band. In my obvious and not unbiased personal opinion, a great, great band of originality and pride in the music that they make, the lives that they live and the influence that they have on their fans lives. Good work.ss.<br />They are painters. Each with individual brush strokes. Creating works of art when they work truly together in unity. As the friends that they are.

B004T2QZL8|4.0|This is one bad a** game but every time I finish about 6 elements this add pops up about upgrading it and it wont leave for like an hour!!! I wish I could update it but I cant right now. But still very good game!!!
B000FUF6QS|1.0|We enjoyed the Wicker man remake with Nicholas Cage better than this original... despite the reviews. This was a typical 60's like flower child 'hippy' song and dance act with a lot of very slow evil lurking in the back ground that never seemed to develop. This could have been beter as an afternoon soap opera series like the original 'DARK SHADOWS'...very slow, never really getting to the point. Poor acting, poor script..not worth a dollar even if you find it at your local \\"GOODWILL\\" store.
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever I love it. it is so addicting like for real I cant stop playing it. it never gets old and I love how you can get sick wallpapers too! this is the best game ever made!!!!
0307341550|3.0|I selected this novel carefully because I read a lot and I don't like to waste my time on poorly written or thinly plotted books.  I was impressed by all the strong positive reviews and I was excited to have discovered a new series to keep me entertained for several books in a row.<br /><br />About halfway through Sharp Objects, I will not finish it.  I knew it was about murder but it is so dark that I'm starting to feel suicidal myself.  Most of the characters in the book are female and they are all mean, self-centered, and psychologically damaged.  I'm surprised that a female author would have such an unremittingly negative view of women.  The men don't come off much better, though they are not shown in much depth.<br /><br />Of course there are traits like those in real people.  But even if it is unrealistic to have characters who are caring, reasonable, and open, at least there could be some complexity where someone has both strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />The quality of the writing is good enough to draw the reader in and keep the story moving.  This is not a book to read for pleasure.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|I wont go into a detailed track by track review like some others have done here other to say that this is their best and most consistent album for over a long time..<br />It's got everything a fan could want, rockers, a ballad and a couple of catchy singles. One last thing, i can't understand the hysteria about Cruising In California, Offspring always have at least one catchy joke song on their albums and this one is as good and catchy as any of the others.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is the best game ever. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #1 app! can I ever stop playing it??? no! this game should be rated 999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 stars. !!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this is a cute app. A lot of the games are a little cheesey but are harder than you think. I like that you have to earn points to unlock the other games. with 125 games you will no doubt find a few that you like and for a free app it's a great way to kill some time!
B00785P2QC|3.0|the game is fun but gets boring after a while it does need to be updated and hopefully it gets fun
0385344228|2.0|This was my first William Landay read and I will not be inclined to seek out any of his other works. I found the entire book to be long-winded and drawn out. Typically, where the author could say something in 2 words - he used 20.
B002QE3CTY|2.0|Reading this series reminded me of reading Stephen King's Dark Tower series--there was far too much effort and far too little reward involved.  Dashner didn't seem to have a goal in mind, other than to pile on as much suffering as possible.  This just doesn't work, especially in a young adult series.
B004SIP9RO|4.0|After dating my current girlfriend for several weeks we reminisced about how serendipitous our relationship turned out to be.  She continued by explaining the plot to the movie Serendipity with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale - I had know idea what she was talking about so I just had to check it out myself.  Immediately thereafter I logged onto Amazon and purchased the movie.  Great movie for a romantic night in.
0307951529|5.0|I finished this book in two days, despite a hefty workload, both at home and at the office.<br />Chris does a great job of giving example after example of people who persevered and made small businesses work for them.<br />As a full-time working mom, I appreciate the low overhead examples, as I don't really have any cash to invest in a startup, but I am yearning to break free and work for myself.<br />This is a great little book as much for its inspirational tone as well as for its general startup advice.  Other, more specific nuts and bolts steps can usually be found at your local small biz development center.
B007WR32XG|5.0|A bunch of people had the opportunity to see the band in a studio, close like they were in your own home. The recording of the show in the studio have probably has to do the excellent DTS sound of this concert. The picture is in high definition. There is no visuals, but who cares when you see and hear this legendary band in a small venue.<br /><br />The band have decided to move forward by playing most of the material from 2005 to \\"The Grounding Numbers's\\" CD. Only 3 old songs are played. I always been seduced by the unique voice of Peter Hammill and the sounds of the keyboards of Hugh Banton. Banton complex playing is the perfect fit to go with the simplicity of the piano and guitar playing of Peter Hammill. Vander Graaf music while very well structured allow for some almost improvise segments where the music is getting loose with extended piano and guitar passages. The old song \\"Lemmings\\" is a illustration of this, with the guitar intro of Peter Hammill, who looks like a musician that is learning to play, and when the legendary guitar riffs kicks in with the rest of the band to join him, it all seems to connect harmonically.<br /><br />Like it's the case in most of Live recordings, the songs are all very good here, but my favorites were \\"Nutter Alert\\", \\"Childlike Faith\\" and \\"Over the Hill\\", the last two containing some nice tempos changes and different atmosphere, and finally the old classic \\"Man-Erg\\" that offers some nice heavy and dark moments.<br /><br />So this DVD/2CD package is a improvement from the latest but still good \\"Paradisio\\" DVD. I would recommended both, but the DTS sound and the picture quality of this one, make it more enjoyable. And i was happy to hear some new songs, showing that this band is still capable after many years to make beautiful music.<br /><br />Also in the DVD, some interesting and recent interview with all three members of the band.

B008578PRK|3.0|Though there was not much laughing or dancing there was some candles.  Yes, that was a Cher reference.  The movie however was suspenseful and entertaining.  The overall darkness lent to the overall feel of the film.  I thoroughly enjoyed it... the surprise ending was a nice touch.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for quite sometime. It is my husbands favorite. It came quickly. Was in a closed package like a new one would. It was at an awesome price. That's why I continue to shop at amazon.

0061692042|3.0|In CANADA, Dell Parsons, the 65-year old narrator of this carefully calibrated novel, recounts the stories of two serious crimes. The first, a bank robbery, was committed by Dell's parents when he was 15 years old and lived in Great Falls, Montana. The second, which shall remain unnamed, occurs in a tiny Canadian town a mere six weeks later. In Dell's opinion, each of these crimes--the first naïve and amateurish and the second ruthless and unnecessary--emerges from the material of ordinary life.  Observes Dell: \\"... I'm intrigued by how ordinary behavior exists so close to its opposite.\\" Or: \\"I already knew, of course, from my own life... that implausible often became plausible...\\" And: \\"The prelude to very bad things can be ridiculous... but can also casual and unremarkable.\\"<br /><br />In telling the story of these two crimes, Richard Ford uses two very different approaches. When telling the story of the bank robbery, he uses 38 careful chapters, most discussing a single aspect of the crime or its aftermath, to build his narrative incrementally. In contrast, the narrative about the brutal crime in Canada, which starts like a coming-of-age story, depends on one cranky character, the hunting guide Charley, to set the stage. While the 29 chapters devoted to Dell's life in Canada and this crime are eventually involving, they basically are the denouement of events, neatly summarized by Charley, that occurred 15 years before. Overall, these very different approaches to crime narrative show that Ford has masterful range. But Part 2 of CANADA also reads like Ford realized his coming-of-age story wasn't working and so he decided to concoct another crime for Dell to witness.<br /><br />In his Acknowledgements, which concludes CANADA, Ford observes that: \\"William Maxwell's presence will be obvious to any reader.\\" Here, he is certainly referring to SO LONG, SEE YOU TOMORROW, where Maxwell's sixtyish narrator delves into what appears to be an inexplicable explosion of violence in a small town fifty years before. Here, I'd say that Maxwell ultimately does explain why this character-driven violence occurred. But fundamental to CANADA is Dell's belief that the big events in life, which can erupt from mundanity, don't have to happen and are therefore arbitrary. Observes the character Mildred: \\"We don't always go to places... sometimes we just end up there.\\"<br /><br />I have read and enjoyed the three outstanding Bascombe novels. There, Ford has created and maintained the amazing Frank Bascombe, whose voice is a rich and fully modern stew of dread, guilt, wariness, and inner turmoil. In contrast, the voice of Dell is, at its best, merely subtle. In fact, Dull, I mean Dell, reads as if Ford was tired of the character Frank and wanted to explore his talent at a lower altitude. Near the conclusion of CANADA, Dell explains his voice. He says: \\"I believe in what you see being most of what there is.\\" Nonetheless, there may be others out there who, like me, miss the conflicted and elegant Frank.<br /><br />IMHO, CANADA is basically a four-star read, since its truths seem more literate--that is, true to the text--than real. Regardless, I deduct another star for two reasons. The first is what I shall euphemistically call THE CEMENT GARDEN moment. Certainly, this captures the theme of the implausible emerging from the plausible. But, Richard, this incident is not plausible. Second, I question whether an author, who isn't trapped in a literary machine, would allow a certain important statement by Dell to stand unchallenged. That statement--\\"Some things you just don't tell\\"--makes the novel work. But, Dell, you're wrong. These things you do tell.e in a small town fifty years before.

B00846REIS|3.0|Bared to You by Silvia Day is an intensely emotional and highly sensual romance. Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross are two incredibly damaged people who cannot resist their sizzling hot attraction for one another. Will their tenuous relationship withstand the various unresolved issues from their respective pasts?<br /><br />While I initially liked both Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross, immaturity from both characters and lack of character development soon took its toll. In the beginning, Eva is a self-assured young woman who knows what she wants and does not hesitate to stand up for herself. The daughter of a working class cop father and a wealthy mother, Eva eschews the family money, opting instead find a job on her own and without assistance from her wealthy stepfather. But it quickly becomes apparent Eva is not as self-sufficient as we are initially led to believe. She is living in an apartment her mother and stepfather purchased for her. Her mother also pays for very expensive clothing for her, treats her to exclusive and luxurious spa treatments and Eva takes full advantage of the family chauffeur. She quickly gives into Gideon's advances and then dissolves into a dithering mess. Eva certainly appears to be self-aware and fully cognizant of her knee-jerk reactions to certain situations, but it seems she is powerless when it comes to changing how she deals with her insecurities.<br /><br />Gideon takes the strong, silent persona to a whole new level. An alpha male, he is domineering and demanding while giving nothing (except sexual satisfaction) in return. He is obsessive, controlling and much of his behavior toward Eva borders on stalking. While we know he has suffered some horribly traumatic event in his past, Gideon gives up so little about himself that he comes across as superficial with very little  substance.<br /><br />The relationship between Eva and Gideon develops in a short amount of time with most of the emphasis on sex. In every conceivable position and place. Make no mistake, the sex is exquisitely erotic and occurs with amazing frequency. But the emotional distance and misunderstandings between them make it difficult to believe they can actually fall in love in a matter of weeks.<br /><br />There were a few supporting characters that I fell in love with. Eva's best friend and roommate Cary Taylor is just as damaged as Eva and Gideon and he too is on a self-destructive path. But he always there to catch Eva when she falters and his honesty with her is quite refreshing. Eva's boss Mark and his partner Steven are remarkably normal and I enjoyed their scenes immensely.<br /><br />Bared to You is full of drama, dysfunction and troubled characters. Silvia Day is a gifted storyteller and she certainly weaves a fascinating and compelling story. I am fully invested in Gideon and Eva's relationship, and I am eagerly awaiting the next installment in the mesmerizing Crossfire series.<br /><br />Review copy obtained from publisher through NetGalley.e.

0307592731|5.0|I wasn't sure what this book was about after I noticed that it was on Oprah's booklist  -- so I took a chance and ordered it.<br /><br />I was just so darn pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />This is a one woman journey on a trek traveling alone on the Pacific Crest Trail in California.<br /><br />What I would have wanted to know before I bought it, was that Cheryl is an amaaaaazing writer, funny, heart felt, and extremely courageous.  Would I hike this trail alone like she did?  No.  Did I enjoy reading about it?  Absolutely!  She did the trek alone and then wrote about it.<br /><br />Doing one of those things might have been enough for me, and so while I was reading the intense detail of her journey, I kept thinking \\"Ok, she did this trek, how the hell did she remember all the details to write about it??\\"  But she does and it is a great, great book.<br /><br />This book is deep, truthful and very heartfelt.  You really get that Cheryl has gone through a lot in her life and has gathered some wisdom to share, while also being vulnerable enough to show us that she is also very human.  Thank you for that Cheryl.  Thank you for the honest journey Cheryl.  You rock!
0375703764|5.0|This is the only truly scary book that I have ever read. I honestly can't even explain why this book is so haunting, it just is. It gets inside your head, I had nightmares the entire time I read this book. To this day, I still get chills when I see it. The one friend I talked into reading it said that he will never again look into anything that disturbed me. You will not be the same after reading this book.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love this movie.  I do think the story was worth only 3.5 stars but the visual quality only left me not wanting the movie to end.  I could watch this movie countless times just to watch the beautiful effects.  If you have a new TV and you want to show your friends how awesome the picture is, just pop this movie in.<br /><br />I found the story to be predictable though.  There weren't many parts that made me think, I didn't expect that!  No matter though, it's still an outstanding film.  I was locked in for the duration.  Emotional attachment is one of the deciding factors in how much I enjoy a movie.  This movie doesn't disappoint in that regard.  I, like Jake Sully, found myself wanting to become a Na'vi.  This movie is worth watching multiple times.<br /><br />There isn't much more I can say about Avatar that you probably haven't heard or figured out for yourself by now so I'll spare you further reading. AT LEAST WATCH THIS FILM! =)
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot. Great for a quick break. All the power ups you can get with coins are a fun motivator.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Frankly, although I possess the Stars Die: Delerium Years by Porcupine Tree, I wouldn't consinder myself very knowledgable about Steve Wilson's music.  I AM, however, pretty familiar with his work engineering the surround sound editions of the recent King Crimson reissues, and they are wonderful.  Also, I purchased this as my first Blu Ray audio disc.  I really really like this disc.  The music is right up my alley.  If you are a progressive rock fan who is feeling something of a gap which you'd like to fill then this record is for you.  In parts, it's reminiscent of King Crimson without appearing to be a wanna-be or a clone.  I love to settle down on the weekend and listen to this disc on my system.  Very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I tried to read it but couldn't make it very far. It's strictly a \\"chick book\\". I thought that considering its popularity it would have a broader appeal.
B003M13XBM|5.0|I heard an abbreviated version of this recording and immediately had to own it.  Sachio Fujioka conducting Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra did a great job.  My 10 year-old daughter loves the trumpets.  It's a good recording of a faithful recreation of the original.  A worthy addition to your progressive-rock collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so happy this is out on the Kindle Fire. Definitely one of my favourite games. No glitches that I can see, and very addictive.
034580404X|5.0|I read, laughed, cried, got my heart racing during the course of the Fifty Shades.  I hope EL James comes out with more. I agree with comments of repetition and was left with questions. Some parts I wish were elaborated on more. But all in all I am a Huge fan of the Fifty Shades story,  Thanks to the author EL James. Looking forward to her next book.

B004QL7K6G|4.0|I'm a Jennifer Aniston fan so I watched it only for her. I didn't expected anything because it was a box office failure or because of the bad critiques, but I'm happy I watched it. I expected a dumb non-sense film because of the bad promotion it had, but the movie is nothing like the trailer tries to show it. It has an amazing script, funny jokes, and a refreshing plot (nowadays, Comedy Films are about stupid jokes and dumb plots), but Wanderlust manages to balance comedy and drama when it has to without any effort. Jennifer and Paul make great chemistry, and it's amazing to see them back since the ending of \\"Friends\\".<br /><br />Watch it if you're looking for feel-good movies. You won't regret
B004EPZ034|5.0|The DVD  was in excellent condition as stated.  My kids watched and there were no problems.  Besides, the price was good.  Thank you.

0345803485|4.0|Just like others have said - the writing is... bad.  If I had to read the line \\"my breath hitched\\" one more time I thought I would be ill.  At multiple points in the story I wanted to slap one or more characters, and I often had to skim over parts that were just too repetitive/contrived/hokey/etc.  In spite of the obvious flaws, this book was addictive.  I couldn't put it down and just had to know why Christian was so messed up and what would happen between the two of them.  It was edgy and hot, even though there were a few times I thought it might be over the line for me.  But if you keep reading, things play out in a less totally messed up way.
0345803507|2.0|I started this trilogy because of all the hype, and finished because I'm not a quitter.  But oh, I wish I was!  This is by far the worst of the three - James Bond, happily-married, incredibly rich, saving everyone in sight Anastasia...yet able and willing to indulge in kinky stuff while running a company and churning out perfect children...  I could go on and on, but I think I'm feeling nauseous.
1466401885|4.0|Okay - so this book needs some serious editing and contains what I would consider to be mediocre writing.  The characters were somewhat unrealistic and the main characters relationship was definitely unrealistic.  That being said, I devoured this book in two days.  I love the strong hot tortured guy that falls for the sweet pure girl-with-a-secret type story and this was a great one.  A few more rounds with a good editor would have made a big difference, but either way, I read it, loved it, and will probably read it again.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was ok, but Fifty Shades Darker and Freed were great! After I read the first book, I was like \\"I am not touching the other two.\\" But the characters and storyline stuck in my head, and I finally gave in and read the FSD and loved it. Now I just wish there was ANOTHER, and ANOTHER!
B0017ZM3S4|5.0|This account of a child taken away to a hard labor camp when he was only 10 years old (or 9 if you count in the Korean way) is quite extraordinary.  The depth to which a person will sink in order to survive as well as the barbarism of the North Korean soldiers is something I will not soon forget.  After all that we in the U.S. have read about political prisoners in China and human rights abuses there, a stark reality of North Korean under Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and now, his son is drawn when the author of this book escapes to China and feels all this amazing freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom to go to clubs, etc.  I still cannot get out of my head that things like salamanders and worms were eaten for nourishment, not to mention rats being a major source of meat.  In any case, this is a book that every South Korean and American should read.  It certainly opened my eyes and convinced me that we really need to bring far more pressure on the North Korean regime because hundreds of thousands of people are dying as a result of the barbaric communist regime there.  The closest parallels that I can imagine for the portrait drawn in this book are the Soviet Union under Stalin and Germany under Hitler.  Ironically, the author had started out in North Korea in a fairly comfortable fashion with his grandparents being connected to the North Korean communist party and his grandfather tied into a position that enabled his family to have more of everything than others around them, not to mention the original wealth of his grandfather.
1466401885|5.0|I fell in love with this couple from the very beginning.I loved the fight scenes, it was very exciting and original story lines.
B003Y5H5B0|2.0|A lot of slapstick humor that the under 12s would appreciate. A lot of sexual, drug; language humor that the over 16s would appreciate, that is if they were still mentally stuck at under 12. The spoofs of action and chase films were nicely scripted e.g. which trucks are going to catch fire or explode and is turns out it's the truck with the chickens; the apartment drug exchange shoot out with the customary unlimited ammo. Acting was pretty much just act stupid and read your line with exception of Ice Cube who gave his character a bit of personality. A favorite foil for Hollywood script writers are school personnel and they didn't hold back for this fictitious school and to their credit created a couple of interesting portrayals but also had the usual stereotypes.<br /><br />A mindless tolerable entertainment for 99 minutes if nothing else is happening in life (like sleeping) but a more productive entertainment if ff to about half that time.
0425263908|5.0|I love how these two characters develop. It was beautiful to see them open up to one another and share their deepest thoughts and fears. Their trust for one another helped them to become closer.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan game might sound a bit nerdy. And after being shown on Big Bang theory, I knew that this would have a stereotype. But honestly, the game is fun for all those that are looking for a game like risk, with less time commitment and more fun to be had by all.<br /><br />Pros --<br /><br />Great for adults and teenagers<br />Good family game, but also fun for friends<br />Can be super competitive or mildly. Up to the players.<br /><br />Cons--<br /><br />There are a number of rules, and the rule book can be a bit difficult to figure out.<br />I wish the pieces fit together a little bit better and weren't so easy to break.<br /><br />If you are looking for a new board game for college students or to have around the home, this game is certainly worth the price.
1451648537|4.0|This book reads like a thrilling novel. A well-written biography of one of the most influential people of our generation it is fascinating to learn about him. I thought the photos were too scarce and that such a modern business and media star should have had more pictures to go with a great biography.<br /><br />Basically this spoiled, misfit, anti-social, mal-adjusted hippie overcame many personality disorders to produce some of the most amazing products in modern times. He was a lousy supervisor, friend, husband, father, son and generally negative member of society yet he rose above it all to advance our Nation and soiciety in general with brilliant advances in electronics and marketing.<br /><br />This is a great read, even if you are usually bored by long biographies.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|There are 40 or 50 five star reviews, the totality of which more than describes this album. I see no purpose in rehashing the same thing. So, just let me say that this voice is a rarity. The first time I heard that contralto voice belt out the words \\"hold on\\", I was hooked and had to hear more. Brittany Howard and Alabama Shakes are so good to listen to. What a great combination of Blues and Rock.
0545265355|5.0|After first hearing about The Hunger Games (once the third book was already out) I decided to check the books out at the library.  So, I waited a couple weeks until the first book was finally available and in my hands.  Then...I devoured it in about 24 hours.  I wanted to read the next two immediately but I realized I'd have to wait weeks to get them from the library and there was no way I would last.  So...I bought this boxset.  The first book is still the best in my opinion, but the second is great and the third, despite what some people say, offers a very satisfying conclusion to the series.  Money well spent.  Like so many others, I love these books.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|it has duplicate items when playing making you press the same object over and over resulting to time loss. for a 4$ app the Q.A. on this should have been stricter. but nevertheless is a good game
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I wanted to start with \\"Rarely, if ever...\\" but quite a few of the books I've read lately do a very good job of explicating the science & tie it to specific actions we can take in the light of that science. And this book is no less rewarding if such is your expectation.<br /><br />In my mind, the greatest value of this book, to start with, is in the mere recognition of willpower problems. For example, during my long (Ok, longish...) runs, I've often given in to a 30 to 60 sec temptation of walking a little. I'd never have thought that this was a willpower challnge & always thought of this as \\"not pushing too hard, should a injury happen\\" but this book made me realize if there was cash prize at the end, I could easily push myself to do it. So the question was never really about fatigue, it was about motivation. Similarly, in recognizing the continuous challenges of willpower - from that of indulging while feeling bad or while feeling good, to the futile chases after \\"happiness\\", or our mistaken notion of happiness - lies the many tactical takeaways for its readers.<br /><br />Its made better by the science behind. At least, for those of us that are interested. I'd say here that if you're pursuing a good general & holistic appreciation of the brain's working, this is not the best book (for example, there is no content on memory & how cortisol overdose can lead to chronic stress) but the science is just enough to understand isolated concepts pertaining to the willpower challenge at hand. So if that kind of thing interests you, then you can dig deeper for the actual neurological workings (this book has a great bibliography) after understanding the basics from reading this.<br /><br />And thirdly, just the plain & simple knowledge of the case studies is empowering. It is a great help to know that these challenges have been isoloated, experimented with & eventually overcome by deploying certain strategies. Just the knowledge of something is \\"do-able\\" was very empowering for me.<br /><br />McGonigal writes with clarity & plentiful humour. The book is structured very well, & the chapter summaries help a lot in quick refreshes - I'd say this book was one of my best science reads this year.<br /><br />@souvikstweetsor me.<br /><br />McGonigal writes with clarity & plentiful humour.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I purchased this mounting arm to orient my second monitor ([[ASIN:B007SIC6KY LG IPS235T 23-Inch Monitor]]) in portrait mode; the monitor's stand does not rotate like that.  I was very impressed with how solid this arm is.  It was easy to position the arm exactly how I wanted and to lock down the arm with the included wrenches.  Attaching the monitor was easy with the thumbscrews - I didn't need a second person to hold the monitor while I used a screwdriver.<br /><br />The arm mounts to a desk or shelf several different ways.  This arm isn't limited to clamping on the edge of a desk; the clamp comes apart so the arm can be secured through a hole in the desk (such as a hole to route wiring through).  I'm impressed with the thought that went into the design of this arm.<br /><br />The instructions are reasonably clear, though it took me a minute to figure out how to get the arm to pivot up and down (press the joint itself).<br /><br />This is a very sturdy arm - I would buy this product again.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|While the erotic portions of all 3 of these books can't be overlooked, what can be overlooked is the psychological aspects of the storyline. How one woman's love, acceptance and understanding of how a man's childhood upbringing can damage him, yet also shape him into the man he is and the man he can become is a a great overarching storyline. It's not just about the sex scenes between Christian and Ana, it about his coming to terms with his past and her coming into her own sexually and intimately as a woman.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this series enough to mature people who can handle the sexual situations depicted enough to appreciate the rest of the story.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Challenging and entertaining game! I like that you can earn hints and that you can figure out more than one solution to many puzzles.
1612933068|5.0|A friend lent me this book, a copy published in 1964. I just gave it back and bought a new copy tonight on Amazon. If you search for this book you will find many versions sold on Amazon. The new versions are dumbed down. I was comparing whole paragraphs. Endings of sentences are omitted, \\"big\\" words are dumbed down, as if it was edited to speak to a 3rd grader. While the info is essentially the same, Murphy was an educated man, with a great writing style. That is lost in the new versions. They don't even mention that it's edited.<br /><br />If you want to actually read this man's words, and not a politically-correct-pronoun-altered, and otherwise $%@*ed with version, search for this:<br /><br />The Power of Your Subconscious Mind: Complete and Unabridged<br /><br />Aside from that, this is THE book on the law of attraction, stated in ways that really spoke to me. I'm not into the current new-age mumbo-jumbo like, \\"when you decided to come forth in this physical vehicle to experience the delicious contrast, blah-blah-blah...\\"<br /><br />This is a great book!

The only way a book can do that to me is if it addresses a burning question that I have.  A story can take hold of your curiosity and not let go.  Something Wicked This Way Comes does exactly that.  Moreover, it is also a great story.<br /><br />This book addresses the question of evil.  I realize that's saying a lot because the question of evil is really many questions: what is it?  where does it come from?  what is it for?  And for me, most importantly, how do you deal with it?  I won't give away the books answer to this question, which I will say was very surprising.  Just as surprisingly, it will make sense once you think about it.<br /><br />Even if, in the end, the bad guy gets away, you deal with him the same way when he comes around again because he won't really have any new tricks.  He only has old tricks and old ways that he can't give up.

B007SGM084|4.0|Although I found the entire trilogy to be intriguing and delectable. I found myself getting bored with the sex scenes and with the author. I found the author to be very mundane and boring. She made every sex scene the EXACT same except for a few little details and locations. I hate repetitiveness and that is how I felt reading this. Though I love Mr. Grey and Ana and the obstacles they encountered in their turbulent relationship, I feel like with a different author the over all story would be better.<br /> I have just finished a book called Bared to you: A Crossfire Novel which is very similar to Fifty Shades but this author does not scare away from using the word vagina or other anatomically correct words. Bared to you is a great alternative to Fifty Shades.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I tho't this last book of the three was the best.  They were all three, pick me up, can't put me down books, but this was my favorite.  I love getting books on my kindle, as have them right away and it is so easy to carry the Kindle with  me everywhere.
0345803485|4.0|I have just finished Book 1.  I bought it because I had a discount, and only paid for the shipping.  The book is okay, but I don't see what all the hype is about it.  It's easy reading, and I feel for the girl in the story, since she was a virgin when she met \\"Mr. Grey\\". I am now on Book 2.
0553381407|3.0|I liked the book...maybe a bit draggy. Good to know certain things and put into better perspective but this book didn't help me! I been on a tough road and learned the hard way and took things into my own hands and the majority played out in the book was already instilled in me and/or I took the same steps but this book might help others in need. Good to have.
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put the books down and stayed up all hours of the night reading. They are awesome!!! The actions are very detailed, but the story is Great. Truly loved the Trilogy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I don't post reviews very often, but I have to praise this DVD. I have a love-hate relationship with it. I love that it is 20 minutes. I hate the burning in my arms and thighs during it. I love that I have lost 2 inches from my waist in just 14 days. I hate squatting! Jillian is a very motivational trainer and that really helps me get through the DVD. It also helps to repeat \\"It's only 20 minutes\\" in your head over and over when you absolutely want to quit. I started this 2 weeks ago and it is already working when nothing else did. I had a baby less than a year ago and am still wearing my belly band in order to wear pre-preggo pants, I am about one inch away from being able to wear them regularly again. Can't wait for the day!
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|Don't waste your money purchasing this film on blu-ray like I did. Restoration is needed for this film, and it should never have been released in the blu-ray format. Be cautious when buying those old favorite films in blu-ray. If the packaging doesn't make any mention of the films restoration then don't buy it.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Seriously...I'm Kidding, was just okay.  I chuckled a couple times and it was an okay read.  Okay, if your looking for something to read and not have to think too hard ( well, not have to think at all).  Okay, if you are in middle school.  Okay, if you love and completely adore Ellen because she's Ellen. There is nothing deep to think about, nothing relevant is even discussed at all. Eh, it was just Okay.
B0083F5J7S|2.0|Even  with their generally excellent previous album [[ASIN:B003MZ0I84 Hands All Over]],one of the things about Maroon 5 I've noticed almost constantly is a mild sense of incosistancy. They have a direction that works well for them. But there's a side,and I don't know if it's Adam Levine or not that wants to be popular and well liked by a mass audience. Which can be difficult if audience tastes are...shall we say less than musically informed. Believe me it works both ways. It's the music that's offered them that causes it more than anything. And Maroon 5 have the ability to offer music of substance and high soul and groove levels. So...why this?<br /><br />  I say that because basically the high key electronic funk grooves of \\"Ladykiller\\" and \\"Doin' Dirt\\" are the only songs on the album that seem very powerful. There's a change of direction here.  And not exactly for the best as the band embrace a very heavy dose of hip-hop on \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Payphone\\" with Wiz Khalifa,both full of the genres' modern cliches right down to the obnoxious uses of profanity,earning this their first tipper sticker. Other songs such as \\"Day Light\\",\\"Lucky Strike\\",Love 4Some Body\\" and \\"Tickets\\" embrace electropop basically. But the lyrics are all bitter diatribes about an apparently bad breakup,similar to Madonna's latest album. And there's little joy to be found. Also,even with the best songs on the album,the production is overly processed with a type of distortion that's again common for this day and age. But rather obnoxious to many ears after a time.<br /><br />  With what I heard of Maroon 5,I saw some growing pains there but when they grooved they did so tight and hard. Which is why this album,which I found impossible to preview or stream online (my usual policy for new music) is extremely disappointing to me. It is definitely looking to go into a more contemporary sound. And there are actually a lot of great new contemporary pop/soul/funk/rock hybrids that are emerging all the time. But for some reason they chose to go with ones that are already showing signs of either sinking into mediocrity or are plain old going away. It's hard to maintain a consistant career in the pop world by chasing dying trends. Always better to be on top of it and be a trend setter. I hope in the future,that'll be better realized.ime.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked the book. It was a good story. Some people keep saying a twenty something year old wont speak the way they do in this book but I know several that do. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I do dislike how it ends and starts right back in the same exact spot in the next book.. I mean I don't see why they didn't just make it one big book if thats how it was going to continue. The grammar isn't the best but I can overlook it unlike others because I'm not the best with grammar myself. Over all though I like the story. If you like the BDSM lifestyle then it's a good read. One review went on to say he only likes to abuse her and while I know people not understanding that life might think that its completely untrue. He's falling fast for Ana and changing his life to more suit the life she wants. Love happens and it's cute.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|One of the reasons I passed over this album again and again is,based on hearing the songs on it I began to realize that Maroon 5 seemed to lack a musical focus. I feel Adam Levine is a somewhat underappreciated talent. And that diversive quality present on their debut [[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]] was more than appropriate. But after a second album that showed growth and a heavy delve into funkiness,why keep in that unfocused limbo? It might have to do with some of the negative criticism I hear this band get a lot of the time.  Anything this is their third album. And again, a lot happening here.<br /><br />  The first two songs \\"Misery\\" and the stripped down \\"Give A Little More\\" are examples of the best qualities in the bands sound:rhytmic pop/funk high on melodic songcraft and emphasizing strong bass/guitar interaction. \\"Get Back Into Life\\" is in the same type of vein. If the album had spun off from there it would've been a near masterpiece since their influences are obviously based in soul andf funk. On \\"Stuuer\\",\\"Don't Know Nothing\\",\\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" and \\"I Can't Lie\\" there's more attempts at a big pop sound. It's not too bad but doesn't fully lend itself to the bands gifts. The rocked up title song is another example of this.<br /><br />  \\"Just A Feeling\\" is a very well composed ballad actually. And the instrumentation goes well with that. With it's mild country flavor,obvious as it features Lady Antebellum \\"Out Of Goodbyes\\" is another well done composition. The bonus cuts \\"Last Chance\\" and \\"No Curtain Call\\" are also excellent examples of this compositional strength. On the acoustic version of \\"Misery\\" you hear a great new direction,layered acoustic funk,reeering it's head for them. The final bonus is a wonderfully done version of Alicia Keys \\"If I Ain't Got You\\". Even if this album is uneven somewhat for a bands third release,the pluses far outweight the minuses. And there's a feeling the weaker cuts may reveal more of themselves in time as well.l.
0307959856|2.0|This book is trying to be a mystery based on the Jane Austen characters, Elizabeth and Darcy.  But it is a tedious mess. There is little action. The characters spend their time explaining the plot to one another.  P. D. James has done far better work with her mystery series.  She should have resisted the temptation to try to write like Austen.  Don't waste your time or money.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Its a good little tool but if your looking for something to really sharpen your knifes to a fine edge then get a sharpening stone. Plus this little tool has the ceramic blades for damaged edges but it doesnt work that great. I mean if your looking to for something short term like a quick camping trip this will do but if looking for something for long term usage or survivalism this isnt the tool for you.
030758836X|3.0|The good - I finished it in one sitting, and enjoyed it until almost the end.  There were some really sharp insights into male-female relationships, and a well-crafted plot, almost until the end.  The bad - a disappointing, unbelievable ending. I can't go into details without spoiling the plot, but a combination of hugely improbable events with impossible to accept behavior ruined the book for me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard out there by far. Word predictions are always spot on and the new space predictions are great as well
B006FE83U4|5.0|I just want to say that the transfer for this movie is amazing. I love a studio who respects their classics and Universal certainly got the job done with this title. It looks like it was filmed yesterday with great contrast and luminosity. I didn't see a scratch during all the viewing. The sound was also wonderful on my home theatre, you could hear a lot of subtilities with the 5.1 DTS soundtrack that you could'nt with the soundtrack on my copy on DVD. It's a very pleasant experience to enjoy a classic like this in your home, I felt like I was somewhere in a movie theatre in 1962. Also, they're not cheap with the extras, there's more than the original DVD which was pretty full also. I like the featurette showing how they restore the Universal classics, very informative. I loved the movie experience so much that I bought The Deer hunter also from that 100th anniversary of Universal studios. Same thing, the picture was amazing,very colorful and rich. The sound was not perfect but I'm sure they did whatever they could for the best possible result.So, Universal, two thumbs way way up for To kill a mockingbird on B-Ray, I highly recommand it!
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Surprisingly, this movie was hilarious. The previews looked really lame, but it succeeds in being funny, clever, self-deprecating.<br /><br />The tipoff is when Ice Cube tells the two officers they're \\"reviving an old program from the 80's\\" because the powers-that-be can't think of anything original.<br /><br />The first funny theme is their expectations of what's \\"cool\\" in school is somewhat outdated since the days they were in school. Today it's all about eco-sensitivity instead of beating up classmates. The second is when things get really messed up when they forget their identities and thereafter have to reverse roles (track star jock vs. geek).<br /><br />There is a love interest or two, complications arising from the initial drug bust and a run-in with a chatty family friend, and subplots involving Peter Pan and nerdiness.<br /><br />So it's really funny, and actually kind of sweet as well, as the two get to gel more as the plot progresses.<br /><br />Be warned, there is constant vulgarity, especially regarding sex acts; there is a brief depiction of a high school student three-way; and slight vomiting. Oh, and someone gets his, ah, junk shot off, and has to grab it with his mouth.<br /><br />But it's still funny.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Woody Allen at his best.<br />Most entertaining and the seamless movement between periods in the past and present is almost believable!!<br />Visually brilliant , you almost think that one is back in Paris on an exotic sight seeing tour.<br />It is a five star film in every respect.<br />Most enjoyable.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|played this game on the big computer.  it is a lot of fun. I really like hidden objects game. this is a good one
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was really hyped up.  I was very disappointed and it was not cheap either.  The story was mediocre at best.  Would not waste my time or money buying the other books.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I've read the negative reviews on this book, and I see where they are coming from. This is a dysfunctional romance, but is it an entertaining book, yes.<br /><br />I guess I enjoy reading a book for the entertainment and not for the life lesson it's supposed to teach me. Now, I am already an adult, and don't look to books to solve my \\"life's problems\\" but even when I was a teenager I didn't either. Though I'm not sure what lessons you'd learn from a Christopher Pike or R.L. Stine Fear Street book.<br /><br />So here's my suggestion to future readers (or non-readers) of Beautiful Disaster: If you are looking to read a book that is going to give you an example of the guy you should be dating, how your relationship should be, and other answer's to your love life...don't read this book.<br /><br />Now, if you are looking for a book that's entertaining, quirky and not your normal (read- boring) romance novel..then read it.<br /><br />Would I let my daughter read this? Maybe when she's older, I don't think 10 is an appropriate age, but I will have also reiterated the difference between fiction and non-fiction. Girls who read this and think they want to find their very own Travis are probably the same girls walking around with one shoe because they keeping leaving one behind hoping Prince Charming will come with their missing shoe.

B007KAJG3K|5.0|I don't know anything about the UltraViolet, but the Blu-Ray was really fun to watch.  Robert Downey Jr. is masterful as always, and Jude Law was also great in this one.  (He actually reminded me of more traditional Watson actors too!)  The pace was nearly relentless, plot was engrossing, suspense kept pace, editing was tight, script was keen and even very funny at times, sets were spot-on, and the bonus features (thanks for hosting, Robert!) were worth re-watching the movie!  I rented but might have to buy this one for the collection so I can re-watch.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is an excellent puzzle game. Fun and challenging. Highly recommend! Logic similar to sudoku, but this is better.<br />I'm addicted!
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|Lots of hilarious comedy and action, some touching bromance and romance moments, even suspense.  I watched it earlier tonight as a rental and am back here to buy it on Blu-Ray, 'cause I know it will be a good one to re-watch and watch with guests!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome series!!!!  Please read all 5,  it's well worth it.  I'm an addict reader,  get sucked in to a good storie and this story had me hooked!!!  I look forward reading more in this series and more from the author.
0307887960|5.0|This is the 2nd time I'm purchasing this book. The first book I ended up giving to a friend. This diet is just awesome, and it worked very well for me. You just have to follow it, exactly the way the author describes. And the best part is that you're never hungry.
B005LAIH5O|5.0|Todd movie successfully follow Clash Of The Titans. Grove plot, great acting. A lot of action with its moments of comedy. A must watch.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Read all three in this series, wanting to see how it turned out. It turned out well.  I hope most of the women who read this will find a new freedom in relaxing and enjoying sex in its various expressions. But NOT, hopefully, the painful nonsense; these characters outgrew it, and others should never start that. But if it help many to see how great a truly intimate, intense, uninhibited and personal sex life can be, then wonderful! Read on!
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|I'll give this album a 3.75 star review if possible. I like it.  While I never like a band to live in the past and reproduce the same material, it would be nice if LP made up their minds about what they want to be. They go from one extreme to another, which I guess is their niche but for that very reason I find the album has no real flow. When I have to skip around too much while listening, I feel this takes away from the whole experience.  This album is solid, but it seems like they went back to Hybrid Theory to sort of \\"find themselves\\".  IMO this album would have been great, if it immediately followed Minutes to Midnight. However I really liked their last work, as they branched out and discovered new sounds and the whole album as a result, had a serious passion to it.  You could feel it when  you put it in.  It was a mood changer, good or bad.<br /><br />True LP fans will enjoy this album either way, but this is far from a masterpiece IMO.  I think they need to find the middle ground between experimentation and what they do well, but again..this is only how I feel.  Highlights for me are In My Remains, I'll be Gone, and Powerless.  Castle of Glass and Lies Greed Misery get honorable mentions.  Tinfoil into Powerless feels like it could have been on A Thounsand Suns, which for me is why it's my favorite.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I loved this book ! It was so well written and completely riviting. If you are looking for escapism this book is for you. Christian has so many qualities rolled into one that all women lust after. He is the ultimate male lead. well written , fast paced and gritty.  I was a little inspired after reading this book blush :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have tried a number of weather apps and always kept this one. It works great on the Kindle Fire.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I liked it , but didnt love it. Its not as riviting or as explosive as the first book. I did like the romance that the author introduced, but Im not sure why this is a sequel. I think it could have ended in the first book. Its intresting to see the male lead in a more romantic softer light. I did enjoy it and it is worth a read. But I feel the author has lost the momentem and really wonder i fteh 3rd book will be any better
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good way go kill time riding in the car<br />lots of options to keep trying a game if you don't win at firdt
B007KOYEOC|3.0|This story did not have potential to be a trilogy.It became very Mills and Boons in the end. 50 shades of grey was riveting, explosive and gritty. The third book just became self indulgent and weakened the character of Anastasia and Christian<br />Too much was rushed to have a happy ending. it made the story less believable that she met and fell in love and got married and fell pregnant in just a short 8-10 months ? the plot was very weak and in some parts just not going anywhere. The story also became very repetitive i.e. they fight they make up etc. I think the author had an explosive concept but just didnt know how to end it. All in all though it was a riviting,mordern love story that still resonates with me weeks after reading it. I really liked the end perspective given from Christian Grey on their first meeting. That was gerat and worthwhile reading the whole 3rd book for.

1594744769|5.0|I'm not exactly sure what I had been expecting when I opened \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Childeren, but all I can say is that it was one of the most enjoyable reads I have had in a long long time.<br /><br />Riggs expertly weaves the vintage photos into the story so that there is a pleasant surprise in every chapter. The story moves at just the right pace and the characters, though one dimensional, are enjoyable to get to know.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for those who are looking for a read that will capture your imagination with action, adventure, romance, and fun.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the sequel!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|A game of thrones. A song of ice and fire, book 1.<br /> Brilliant,  brilliant,  brilliant.  The book is a little different to the current series but still a very good read. I like the way the book details each character so you get to know who everyone is and how they relate to each Other. Im absolutely hooked and cant wait to start reading book two. Hope you think the same.
0679805273|5.0|I just graduated high school and I needed some motivation to continue to have passion for a higher education (college) so I decided to buy this book for myself. This book has done wonders for me and its definitely not just for kids. Dr. Seuss found a way to simply encourage people that they can do the things they set their minds to and even if they fall, they have the strength to get back up. I cherish this book and it's something I'm definitely willing to share with other people :)

0099579936|2.0|I heard a lot about the book and was pretty excited to start reading it. I did read reviews on it before I spent the money just to see if it was worth it, but then came to the conclusion that everyone's perspectives are different. So I splurged and started reading.<br /><br />I only finished the book (and I'm pretty sure I'll read the next two) because I was intrigued by the plot and characters. But I would have to agree with everyone that the writing it HORRIBLE. I'm pretty sure the author has no idea what a thesaurus is or has any comprehension in how to \\"change it up\\". Because of all the useless repetition and adolescent writing I got a little frustrated with reading it but kept going.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any girl who is bored and looking for something to read and would be able to join the conversation, but defiantly not a book to read if your looking for something more \\"adult like\\" in the writing style. But the book is defiantly \\"adult like\\" in the erotic sense. Again, I agree with everyone who says that this book sounds like it was written by two teenage girls.
0061692042|5.0|The first two sentences of Richard Ford's Canada are, I suspect, destined to be among the most quoted of 2012.  Even so, I cannot resist using them here, too, because they are the perfect opening for the book:<br /><br /> \\"First, I'll tell you about the robbery our parents committed.  Then about the murders, which happened later.\\"<br /><br />These words are spoken by 65-year-old Dell Parsons, the book's narrator, as he considers the fifteen-year old boy he was in 1960 just before his parents made the stupid decision that would almost destroy him and Berner, his twin sister.  The Parsons had been transferred to Montana by the U.S. Air Force, but now Dell's father is a civilian, and having decided that Great Falls is a good place to raise his family, Bev Parsons is struggling to find a job that will allow him to do that.  To young Dell, nothing is more important than the fast-approaching start of his freshman year in the town's public high school.  Up to now, the twins have been encouraged not to develop ties to the places they pass through with the Air Force, so Dell is eager to transform Great Falls into the hometown he has never known.<br /><br />But when Dell's parents are arrested for a North Dakota bank robbery, his hopes of finally settling down and making long term friends are destroyed before he can even set foot in his new school.  Dell and Berner are surprised to find themselves, at least temporarily, forgotten by the legal system that has both their parents locked tight in the city jail.  After Berner, the worldly twin, strikes out on her own, his mother's only friend agrees to deliver Dell to her brother in the remote prairies of Saskatchewan in order to keep him from falling into the hands of Montana juvenile authorities.<br /><br />There, still a very naïve child at fifteen, Dell falls under the control and influence of two men who will further destroy his sense of who he is.  Charlie Quarters, the Leonard Hotel's strange, half-breed hunting guide into whose charge Dell is delivered, will use him as an extra pair of hands.  Arthur Remlinger, an American hiding out in Canada for reasons of his own, is the hotel's owner.  Unfortunately for Dell, Remlinger, a sociopath of sorts, will never be the father figure he needs so badly, and will, instead, almost finish the job of destroying his life.<br /><br />Canada is a character-driven novel with the plot of a crime thriller, a literary novel that will keep the reader turning pages.  Throughout his narrative, Dell Parsons gives intriguing little hints that all is not as it seems and that he should have figured things out sooner than he did.  Ford's characters are so well developed that even their most bizarre actions are believable in the context of who the reader knows them to be.  With perhaps one exception (Charlie Quarters), there are no black and white characters in Canada.  Each has a distinct set of strengths, weaknesses, and motivations that allows them to be sucked into whatever happens around them.<br /><br />Canada is about borders - literal ones and symbolic ones - and what they really mean.  The lesson for Dell Parsons is that once some borders are crossed, they are crossed forever.  There is no going back.whose charge Dell is delivered, will use him as an extra pair of hands.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|It's an OK CD and obviously Beach Boys but the it's just not quite what I was expecting. A little slow, a little too quiet for me but still, a nice, mellow walk down the beach. I'd say 3.5 is a better choice but that's not an option so I gave them the better of the 2
B005DOKL3E|4.0|Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve, works fine would be good to have a small pocket for identification card should the Kindle be accidentally left or forgotten. Action on keyboard is too active. Requires very careful use.
0374275637|5.0|Many concepts were amazing for me, and they are discussed in-depth and how the book criticizes other books in terms of their correctness and soundness. There are many new and surprising knowledge from this book. The content is interesting for me and I could not even put the book down until I almost finish it.<br /><br />I remember quite clearly about how the anchor system works, how people get fooled over the Law of Small Numbers, how their intuitive system works and trick themselves. It invokes many emotions and beliefs in me, and it clearly explains many of my doubts about different people's reactions in an irrational way
B005HJWWW8|5.0|It also has more sound volume for more demanding  headphones. It recharges quickly with the supplied cable. It is tiny so well suited for mobile use.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|I loved this film for its quirky originality.  Just need to add that if you did like this film you might also want to check out \\"Norwegian Ninja\\".
B004EPYZV2|5.0|But, don't be fooled by the big slash-off price. This NEVER cost $45, not even at a Kmart. Heck, $15 is average now. Still worth it, but just don't get it for the \\"deal\\".<br />The movie itself was pretty good, a thorough continuation and probably better than the trilogy before. Tom Cruise isn't exactly great, but with addition of Jeremy Renner, the all-around acting in the movie is pretty flush.

B000KE1P8M|2.0|I was so disappointed in the television series of Jane Eyre.  Timothy Dalton is known as a great actor, but you would not be able to discern that from watching this. Jane Eyre is a book that I have read, reread, and read some more.  The actors cast in this series were not the actors for the job. They turned one of the biggest romances of all time into something that I am not sure I recognized as Jane Eyre.

All of us has a friend or relative that we should wish to resolve into such an acceptable distance from our own lives.
B0040HQ3X2|5.0|If you like British period shows, this one is the one you want to see. You will not stop at one episode or one season. The story surrounds the postmistress who lives in the town where the more well-to-do people live. Outside of the town is a hamlet called Larkrise and there is a constant struggle just to survive. How the rich and the poor intermingle is fascinating and will give you a glimpse into what life was like for both groups.

B0043URV5U|4.0|I saw an interview quoting Bob Seger saying he's refused record company requests to issue more best-of collections outside of 1979's THE BOB SEGER COLLECTION, 1994's GREATEST HITS, 2003's GREATEST HITS TWO, and now ULTIMATE HITS: ROCK & ROLL NEVER FORGETS. Compare Bob Seger to, say, the Eagles, another huge act.  The Eagles put out more hits albums than studio albums. You have to respect Seger for turning down some easy paydays, releasing only four best-of titles over a recording career that started in 1969.<br /><br />Seger's consuming success spans the album rock radio era, so a number of songs we heard regularly on rock stations in the 1970s and '80s are not included. For example, &#34;Till it Shines&#34; from STRANGER IN TOWN was never issued as a single but I heard it so often on the radio back then, it surprised me to see it did not make it to ULTIMATE HITS.  One option would have been doing with STRANGER IN TOWN what Carole King did on her A NATURAL WOMAN: THE ODE COLLECTION set, which includes all the songs from her mega-hit album TAPESTRY.  Seger could have done that with STRANGER IN TOWN, as six of its nine selections were radio mainstays.  As it is, four STRANGER IN TOWN tracks are on ULTIMATE HITS.<br /><br />The song listing on the cover of ULTIMATE HITS does not denote that &#34;Turn the Page&#34; is a concert album track, not the studio L.P. version of the song.<br /><br />While I'd like ULTIMATE HITS to include &#34;Even Now,&#34; &#34;Get Out of Denver&#34; and &#34;American Storm&#34; instead of a few of the numbers that made the cut, I'll take this package just the way it is.  Bob Seger could easily have released twice as many hits collections as he has, but as he hasn't. That's cool, Bob.  If ULTIMATE HITS is as ultimate as it's gonna get, I'd rather have it than not.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Well, it's 2012 and RAM's brilliance is just undeniable. This album shows exactly how talented Paul McCartney is, what a genius! Following the release of his first solo album, the lovely home-made \\"McCartney\\" in 1970, RAM was released 13 months later in May 1971. A mere year after The Beatles was no more.<br /><br />Although the album brings three other musicians into the fold, guitar players Hugh McCracken and David Spinozza and drummer Denny Seiwell, along with the lovely Linda on backing vocals and constant breastfeeding, this is still very much a product of Paul's mind and playing which served to signal he was alive and well and would be just fine on his own too, even though his previous band's weight would never lose a pound, so to speak.<br /><br />The timeless music on RAM is beautifully touching and, at the same time, loads of fun. Paul knows how to celebrate his craft like no one. Piss off cake.<br /><br />Also, these archive collection reissues are totally outstanding. They truly live up to high expectations with remastering and packaging flawlessly thought of and skillfully executed. No complaints here. It's reissues like these which are worth waiting for.

0470474874|1.0|This is the definitive text on Excel 2010. It is both lucid and thorough in its coverage of the world's leading PC spreadsheet software.  Unfortunately, the publisher and Amazon have chosen to penalize the user for buying the Kindle edition.  I bought an iPad primarily to be able to use ebooks instead of having to lug around heavy texts such as this one.  Hence, I was ready to buy the Kindle edition until I realized that it didn't include the contents of the CD that accompanies the printed edition.  The CD includes numerous examples, formulas, and VB programs that are referred to extensively in the text.  It also includes a searchable PDF file of the entire text, which you can load on your PC and/or iPad.  Amazon cleverly hides this information by requiring you to click on a Show More link at the bottom of the book description section.  So, if you buy the Kindle edition, you miss critical accompanying information and you don't get the PDF, which would be very useful when you're working at your PC.  Moreover, since the PDF can be loaded on your iPad, you in effect get both the printed book and the electronic book for just $1.22 more than the price of the Kindle edition.  When I asked Amazon's customer service representative why Amazon doesn't fix this, he said it's the publisher's fault and that Amazon can't do anything about it except transmit customers' negative feedback.  As it turns out, there are a number of instances where books that include a CD with the printed edition don't include the CD contents with the Kindle Edition, and not just from this publisher.    There is another issue that somewhat compromises the quality of the text - namely, the quality of the PDF file.  There are numerous graphics in the text that show what appears on the screen when using Excel.  Most, if not all, of them are difficult or impossible to read in the PDF version; the graphics in the text are readable, though they would be easier to read if they were larger.  Still, the printededition is a much better value than the Kindle edition.  If, like me, you decide to buy the printed edition because of the better value but would much rather have the electronic edition, please at least let Amazon and the publisher know that this is not acceptable and will likely jeopardize the wide acceptance of electronic books.    *** UPDATE 07/09/2012 ***    It turns out that buyers of the Kindle edition can get the CD files that accompany the printed edition.  I contacted the publisher (Wiley) to complain about not providing the CD files with the Kindle edition and they told me I could download them from their website via a link they would provide, once I had sent them a copy of my purchase confirmation from Amazon.  Just go to [...] click on the Ask A Question tab, and tell them what you want.  I told Amazon that they need to edit their book description to make sure customers know this.

1609611543|1.0|The author goes on throughout the whole book explaining what wheat and wheat gluten do to your body.  I am thinking okay, I will cut out wheat products and finally lose the weight.  WRONG, in order to lose weight we have to cut out ALL grains including all types of  rice, potatoes, yams,  bananas, limit your fresh fruit, limit your intake of beans and legumes to 1/2 cup or less, limit your intake of dairy and soy, and  don't eat gluten free products.  Are you kidding me!  I was on the Atkins diet for year and never got near my goal weight.  If weight loss is your goal, go to Weight Watchers and don't waste your money on this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I kept hearing about this book and wanted to find out myself what the hoopla was all about.  I downloaded this book into my kindle and took it on vacation with me.  I started to read it and I was amazed, shocked, intrigued, and disturbed; however wanting more.  The book reminded me of a previous relationship (without the S&M), and I completely can relate to Anastasia. Just downloaded the 2nd book and cant wait to read it as well, now that I'm captivated.  Thanks EL James!!!
B007KW55VK|3.0|This is a pleasant album. Pleasantly played. Pleasantly sung. But you have to wonder, what's the point of getting this when there are so many great Dusty Springfield albums out there? Also, does Rumer (or her followers) have any idea who PF Sloan is? Does she own any of his albums (they can be found, if you look). Or was it just a nice Jimmy Webb song that someone told her would be good idea to record? This album actually says a lot more about where we are now in our culture than it probably intends: no new real ideas, just a less-inspired replay of what has come before. In other words, the perfect album for the American Idol Generation.
B000026OHN|4.0|Very nice sound and clarity for the music. The cd was as advertised and the music is true in tone and clarity.
B007P4OTHO|5.0|I won't even try to explain what a brilliant and important recording this is. Previous reviews have done that. I write simply as a heads up about the manufacturing quality of the record its self. Amazon is very sensitive about their shipment of records and developed that swell shipping box. It works great. I think the two albums I've had in the last week were bad before they ever got packed. The first record was visibly bowed before I cut the shrink wrap. The record was the same shape. It would not sit on the turntable. OK, back to Amazon. Record two looked good from the outside. It sat nicely on the turntable. Side one was glorious. Side two skipped on the first band. Not an up and down bump but a side to side one. With every revolution the needle was shaken side ways. So, again, back it goes. This is the first bad record I've gotten here so no hard feelings but this is an album I have to have. I'll wait a month and maybe they'll get a new batch.
0143123173|5.0|I just gave up on a Deaver series about Kathryn Dance, a kinesics expert, because I was so bored with pages of straight exposition (unlike his Lincoln Rhyme series). This book showed me how right I was, that good exposition doesn't have to wear a sign saying \\"here's background you need to understand what's happening\\". Craig Johnson slides it in so as to make you think: has he changed the topic, where does this fit, what's he trying to tell me without telling me? I love spending time reading this book and learning  his characters and setting. I'm not halfway through this book yet, but I've ordered the next one. This is my new favorite author and series, and I'm looking forward to reading all his books.

B007MLDC2I|4.0|Steven Zaillian wrote a superb screenplay and David Fincher did a great job of directing this improvement over the original English dubbed, Swedish film adaptation of the TV series.  Unlike the Swedish film, this was much easier to watch and understand as the story followed the book more closley and was allowed to flow more effortlessly. Daniel Criag looked comfortable and credible as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara gave a powerful and moving interpretation of Lisbeth Salander. Rooney had big shoes to fill after the incredible performance by Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version of this movie, but she certainly proved herself to be up to the task.  I have this uncomfortable feeling, after watching the Swedish film, that Noomi Rapace is, in fact, Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />If you love this story, and the book, as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to see both of the movie interpretations.  They are very different and show the characters differently, so boredom is not a likely consequence.  I loved both films, but, all in all, the David Fincher film was my favorite.
B00013F38K|5.0|This is one of those shows I really enjoyed catching on re-runs as a child. It's funny, but at first I didn't understand why Cain was always being called a \\"Chinaman\\" when he looked mostly Caucasian to me. It wasn't until later that I realized that he was supposed to be of mixed heritage.<br /><br />The writing and story development for this show is top-notch and Carradine plays Cain with a nice amount of tenderness and depthness. The scenes at the temple are always enjoyable to watch with young Kwai-Chang as the \\"grasshopper\\" along with the masters always having something important to teach him.<br /><br />This DVD set of season 1 also contains a couple of extra features that are fun to watch and also informative. It would've been nice to have Carradine do commentary on a few episodes, he is an interesting individual with a unique perspective.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Since the 2003 debut, \\"Leave a Whisper\\", Shinedown has established their signature sound, which features hard hitting guitars, catchy hooks, and the easily recognizable vocal growl of Brent Smith. While \\"Leave a Whisper\\" served as a quality debut, leading into the sophomore \\"Us and Them\\", \\"The Sound of Madness\\" seemed to put Shinedown at the top. With no where to go but up, Shinedown attacked the mainstream rock charts with \\"Sound of Madness\\", \\"Second Chance\\", \\"Call Me\\", and \\"The Crow and the Butterfly.\\" Following up an album as colossally successful as \\"The Sound of Madness\\" would be no easy task for any band, but with \\"Amaryllis\\", Shinedown proves up to task.<br /><br />From the beginning of the album, Shinedown comes out swinging with the fist pumping, excitement igniting opener, \\"Adrenaline\\". Listening to \\"Adrenaline\\" it's easy to imagine Brent Smith's stern face belting out the words \\"I need a shot again, that sweet adrenaline...\\" in front of a large crowd at the beginning of a late night show. The rest of \\"Amaryllis\\" stays true to the typical Shinedown form, and for fans of their music, that isn't at all a bad thing. Songs like the hit single, \\"Bully\\" raise the fists of the defeated and down trodden everywhere, while songs like \\"Enemies\\" show a lyrical snarl and a lot of attitude from the Jacksonville natives.<br /><br />The tempo of \\"Amaryllis\\" is constantly shifted, a technique which worked well for \\"The Sound of Madness\\" and works equally well in this outing. \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Through the Ghost\\" bring the listener the musically softer, yet no less lyrically potent, side of Shinedown that we have seen in previous songs like \\"Call Me\\" and \\"The Crow and the Butterfly.\\" \\"For My Sake\\" and \\"My Name (Wearing me out)\\", will get much appreciation from fans, but perhaps not mainstream radio. Smith growls out angry lyrics that creates the general feel of a tortured soul leaving a long standing relationship.<br /><br />\\"Bully\\" and \\"Unity\\" will steal away much of the attention from the rest of 2012's, \\"Amaryllis\\", but when it is all said and done, this is a Shinedown record, and that is a great thing for listeners. Settle in, and allow the madness and the methods to manifest themselves in your mind, you will be glad you did. For fans of the band, music, and of hard/modern rock in general, \\"Amaryllis\\" will be one of the year's best.

It gets pretty graphic sometimes and involves some sexual content. Also, if you are someone who likes a book to have one main characters point of view, this book will probably be too complex for you. There are so many main characters and stories. It is really hard to pick who you support in the book and that is why the book is so fun!

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Bravo in this case to Amazon reviewers.  \\"John Carter\\" was low on my list of must-see movies after the critics panned it, but a quick look at Amazon's reviews changed my mind, and I wasn't disappointed.  It's hard to imagine what the critics' problem was with the movie.  The show had excellent special effects, more than a whiff of humor and laughs, a dash of mysticism, and entertainingly lifelike strange critters.  You can't help but think a good deal of Star Wars was cribbed from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars books, and why not?  Imitate the best, as they say.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell is that of a former confederate soldier, sick of war, getting accidentally whisked to Mars and ending up in a three-way war that involves two sets of  humanoids and a rougher, cruder culture of tall, four-armed desert dwellers.  The humanoids (I suppose from the Martians' point of view the human Carter would be a Martianoid) are indistinguishable from each other save for the color of their clothing, and the fact that one side is an evil aggressor.  A mysterious group of powerful beings is intervening on the bad guys' behalf, and the battles are on.  Of course, the princess of Mars is on the good side.  She's not only gorgeous, naturally, but has the build of a football linebacker.  I wish I had her broad shoulders.  Carter is sort of like a low-grade Superman, made powerful by Mars's different environment and his earth physiology.<br /><br />That power leads to a couple of inconsistent scenes, in which he gets into trouble that his strength in other scenes easily gets him out of.  Well, all the suspense would be gone if he were unbeatable, I suppose.  Not quite clear too is his teleportation between worlds (potential spoiler here, though I don't think it is): The Carter on Mars is a copy of his body on earth, meaning that his earth body is lifeless but doesn't spoil while his Mars body holds his spirit, soul, whatever.  This datum leads to logical complications and a little confusion, at least for me.<br /><br />I still can't believe this movie wasn't a box office success.  It's not a ponderous, \\"serious\\" movie but a rollicking, fairly light science fiction fest that's a pleasure to watch.  Could Disney have possibly handled publicity for this movie any worse?  I'm not the most plugged-in grape on the grapevine, but it's unusual even for me to not hear of a huge potential blockbuster of a movie until the very day it hits the theaters.  A little \\"Battleship\\" hyping might have gone a long way for \\"John Carter.\\"<br /><br />Still, it's not too late to enjoy this movie.  You might be surprised.<br /><br />A tangent that has nothing to do with the movie:  I rented \\"Carter\\" and again, as is so often the case, the DVD was scratched and dirty with one part of it unwatchable.  For pete's sake whoever's doing this, stop handling DVDs that are not your own with greasy, barbecue sauce-stained and peanut buttery fingers and picking them up with what appear to be claw hammers.  It's enough to make me pine for videotapes, which morons can't touch.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|It was really no surprise when \\"The Sting\\" won the Academy Award for best picture of 1973.  A great story with a wonderful twist ending and an unbeatable cast: Charles During, Ray Walton, Eileen Brennan, Harold Gould and headed by Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Robert Shaw.  Most of all we have a film that accurately reproduces the atmosphere of the times in which  it is set -- the Depression of the 1930s.<br />This is certainly one of the great films to come out of Hollywood.<br /><br />Now we have this classic movie available in the Blu-ray format with great picture and sound.  Being an audiophile of many years, I tend to notice the improvements in the audio first.  Here, the title music has been remixed in stereo to provide a great improvement.  The piano introduces the original Joplin theme and then the small orchestra comes in with great presence and power.  The rhythmic nature of the music is notably enhanced by the power of the tuba, traditionally used in popular music of that time, although it is necessary to point out that ragtime music used exclusively in this film had long gone out of style by the 1930s.  No matter -- it works perfectly here. The film uses sound stage interiors and sets, and beautiful sets they are depicting the Chicago Loop  and buildings true to the time of the film and beautifully reproduced in Blu-ray clarity.  For the sake of the one or two people in the world who haven't seen this movie, I won't go into the finish.<br /><br />My favorite scene in this, and probably any other movie, is the conclusion of the poker game between Newman and Shaw on board the train to Chicago.  Shaw has managed to sneak in a stacked deck ultimately dealing himself four nines and Newman four treys.  He raises Newman's bet by $10,000 and, a little hesitant and slightly frowning, Newman sees the raise.  Smiling, Shaw lays down his nines certain that he has won.  Newman pauses for a second or two and then lays down his hand smiling and saying, \\"Four Jacks.  You own me $10,000, pal.\\"  When I first saw this film in a theater, the audience was quiet for a few seconds until they realized what had happened.  Then they began to howl with laughter.  It's still the best played scene I've ever seen in a film.  The expression on Shaw's face as he looks down at Newman's cards is unforgettable.<br /><br />I doesn't matter how many times I've bought this movie in various formats, the Blu-ray is worth it --  I know I'll be watching it again.You own me $10,000, pal.\\"  When I first saw this film in a theater, the audience was quiet for a few seconds until they realized what had happened.

0307279189|1.0|I have purchased and enjoyed books which impart knowledge while having the quality of being wrapped up in an engaging story. I thought that what I was purchasing when I bought this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately not, I have spent a good amount of time up to page 35 and skimming over to page 50 with no such luck. All I am seeing is initial medical problem that the author had and then spends the next chunk of the book written as a novel for most part.<br /><br />Huge waste of time for someone like me looking for tips/ knowledge with a base storyline. This is mostly a story line with very few tips.<br /><br />You are better off googling for tips based on this books title as save yourself 5+ hours reading a story if you are seeking the story.
B006AN78XS|3.0|here we find the usual neurotic artsy character Adrien Brody,doing  a great Woody Allen turn in this fantasy about art and romance versus the status quo thinkers.(Hollywood snobs)<br />Unfortunately the acting is monotone and mannered just like the cliched script.The movie has it's cinematic charm,even though the characters are weak and superficial.Cathy Bates does a really foolish turn as Gertrude Stein,and Hemingway is even worse.<br />This movie  proves that Allen can make money by presenting a thin movie with status quo actors and make people believe it is special.I am an artist and this movie was not special to me.I mostly found it contrived..but mildly entertaining.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Upon finishing Gone Girl, the newest psychological thriller by established author Gillian Flynn, I had to ask myself, \\"are all of Gillian Flynn's books like this?\\". If they are, I can tell you now that I am going to be a huge fan. In short, I loved this book. I loved the way the author crafted the characters. I loved the way that she doled out the story, keeping you guessing about what was really going on. I loved the way that she threw out so many inconsistent details that you weren't really sure what was real, if any of it. Or who was lying to whom. Or ultimately, who were the good guys and who were the bad guys.<br /><br />One thing I really enjoy about reading thrillers is that they are like puzzles. I love trying to figure out where the author is going with a story before they reveal their twists in the plot. That said, I especially love when an author hits me over the head with a plot twist that I didn't even see coming. This book had all of the above. It started out pretty good, but normal for a psychological thriller, then just when I thought I had figured out what was going on, another detail would come out that had me doubting myself. Best of all, though, the author was able to reveal certain plot points that were total surprises to me. Things that I had not even considered, at least not seriously. Here I was, formulating all sorts of theories, which I love to do, and trying to keep track of all of the things that didn't seem to make sense and the story would hit me with an HOLY CRAP moment. At that point, I was hooked.<br /><br />I thought the characters in the book were great, also. I thought she did an exceptionally good job with Nick and Amy, making them both who they seemed, and someone else entirely. The layers to their personalities and relationship was riveting. And even the supporting characters were crafted with so many layers that they were constantly surprising me with there behavior.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps me from giving this book a flat out 5 star rating was the ultimate ending. For some reason, the ending just set me on edge. It's not that it wasn't believable, because it was. It's not that it wasn't appropriate to the story, because it certainly was. It is just that I didn't like where it ended. I can't say more than that without giving it away.<br /><br />So again, I say, I hope all of Gillian Flynn's books are this twisted, dark, and riveting. I am poised to be a major fan! A 4.5 star MUST READ for thriller lovers.

0345803485|3.0|After all the rage over this book, I was pretty disappointed. In fact, I'm only half finished and have put it aside. The sex part is the big attraction,of course, but I felt the woman telling the story came across as pretty much a ditz. It almost sounds like it was written by a 16 year old instead of a grown woman. When she finally said, \\"Holy crap!\\" about the 75th time, I just had to put the book down. I'm sure Grey will turn out to be a complicated and interesting character by the end of the book, but I'm afraid I just didn't feel like waiting that long.

I did not regret my purchase! The only downfall was that the epilogue could have been better... it should have been more in the future.
B000MUK3HI|4.0|This was a patchwork job after the Fabs split.<br /><br />A bunch of singles that had never been put out on an album.<br /><br />How can you argue with Hey Jude and Revolution.<br /><br />But this was the start of the Beatles as a marketing entity and no longer a creative force.
1400031524|5.0|As I've written above, this is a great summer read--it's very readable, entertaining, and even suspenseful towards the end.  Inspector Wallander is a very well-developed character, but what I especially enjoyed about this particular novel is how Henning Mankell does a great job of painting what life was like in Riga during the time when the Iron Curtain came crashing down.  He also does a great job of hinting what life was like in Latvia during the Communist era.  This is the second Inspector Wallander book I've read, the first being his debut, Faceless Killers, and I must say that I enjoyed this second book much more than the first book!  The book is suspenseful, and I found myself wondering how it would all end.  I look forward to reading the third book, The White Lioness, later this year or sometime next year.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|so far so good at least it hasn'trolled back progress.... either way its a whole lot of fun!<br />I like the fact that its short and sweet nolong term quests!

0061692042|5.0|This is the first book by Richard Ford that I have read.  Even with four hundred pages, I usually finish a book in no more than two or three days at the most, but this book took me about a week to read.  Each sentence had to be savored.<br /><br />Ford's writing impressed me with its seemingly simple and clean style.  The characters grew from the beginning and by the end of the book I knew everything I needed to know about them, with no questions unanswered.  It's a bittersweet story, told in first person fifty years into the future by Dell Parsons, thinking back on his life after going to Canada at age 15 as a result of his and his twin sister's parents' robbery of a bank in North Dakota and subsequently going to jail.  Father, Bev Parsons, and mother, Neeva found robbing the bank the only way to get the money needed to settle a bad, and illegal, business deal that Bev was involved in. Bev and Neeva's marriage was in the process of falling apart when the bad decision to rob a bank was made.  Neeva was a scholarly, quiet woman as opposed to her husband who was a more boisterous Air Force career personality.<br /><br />Dell's twin sister, Berner, ran away before she had a chance to be sent to Canada with her brother, but Dell was sent via a plan that his mother had drawn up before going to prison.  As Dell looks back on his childhood, it is not with bitterness, but with much insight into his own experiences with unsavory people who didn't really care about him and acceptance of what was asked of him.  He went from loving his time at school in Great Falls, Montana to the prairies in Saskatchewan where men went to hunt geese in the 1960s.<br /><br />I thought the book was very sad overall.  Florence is the most positive and cheerful character, genuinely caring about Dell.  I found all of the characters very interesting, though, whether good or bad.  They all had their stories and reasons for what they did, but Arthur Remlinger was not my favorite character.<br /><br />\\"Canada\\" was a very good reading experience.  I'd like to read another of Richard Ford's books after reading reviews written by people who are familiar with his other works.  I definitely recommend this to readers who like literary fiction and coming-of-age stories.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|There was nothing really wrong with the book, per se, but it took me 2 months to finish it because I used it as a \\"few pages before bed\\" book. Like other reviewers, when I finally got into the last 20% (I have a Kindle) of the book, I did read it with more interest than in the beginning; however, like other readers, I was extremely confused/disappointed by the ending. With over 500 pages of text, I would hope to get to an ending point that would at least put the proverbial bow on the package to tie it up nicely. It didn't. It didn't end it with a heart-thumping 'what will happen next? ... I must be the sequel ASAP!' moment, either. It just ... ended.
B005VCL4PW|5.0|delivered as promised, looking forward to the movie.  exciting read, gives more as it's read. makes you want to root for the cullens and bell against the italian vamps
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Good storyline.  You can skip it if you want to just get to the games. Challenging but not difficult.  Fun for all ages.
B0086700CM|4.0|One of the most enjoyable apps I've ever had but there's an downside to this app on the kindle fire. A little uncontrollable
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I highly recommend this toy. It is quality all wood and not cheapo plastic. It is sturdy and after owning it for more than a year now, my 5 year old still plays with it a lot.<br />You have to put it together yourself but my son did a lot of the work and we enjoyed doing it together, it was definitely part of the experience and not too difficult.<br />I recommend gluing the ramps on, otherwise they could get lost and the unit would be useless. I used gorilla wood glue and they remain securely intact.<br />If the elevator does not go up and down correctly after putting it together, rotate the support beams to other locations. This fixed that problem for us.<br />Really happy we bought this, more toys should be made like this.
0345803507|1.0|Poorly written.  Repetitive as the first book in fact it is basically the same story as 50 Shades of Grey. I think i must have rolled my eyes about a million times it was so bad.  Had to stop reading it because it was so pathetic.<br />Perfect man, perfect woman, perfect world - Totally unrealistic.  I started to speed read through the sex scenes in the first book so i didn't even bother with them in this book.  YAWN!!  How these books made the best seller category literally amazes me?<br />Will not be reader 50 Shades Freed.  Hell no!
B00498VS9G|5.0|Overall, this is a great show, just too short. Only 5 episodes leaves you wanting more. Acting and special effects are very good. I would highly recommend it.
1466401885|1.0|There were many times I almost deleted this book from my Kindle, but I decided to write a review on it, and thus, save someone else time and money.  Beautiful Disaster is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Spoilers follow, so be aware.<br />So, Abby Abernathy, 18 y/o freshman (she turns 19 in one chapter) arrives at college with best friend America..\\"Mare\\".  For reasons I can't really understand, she goes with Mare and Mare's boyfriend Shepley to an underground fight, where she meets Shepley's roommate, Travis.  Travis is a male slut, but for some unknown reason, virgin Abby decides she's going to play mind games with him.  At another fight she \\"loses the bet\\"-the bet being whether or not Travis will get hit.  Evidently, Travis is some super God who never gets hurt in these fights.  Travis does not get hurt, soooooo, Abby has to stay a month with Travis.  But, it's okay, because she doesn't have sex with him and sets about taming this \\"wild\\" guy.  Of course, the very last night, they do have sex and happiness abounds.  But Travis is just too jealous, too irrational-ladies, he is emotionally and verbally abusive.  He is a rageaholic, but I guess the author thinks that's okay, since he doesn't hit girls.  Gee.  But don't feel too sorry for Abby, or \\"Pidgeon\\" which is what Travis calls her.  Abby is the product of a drunk mother and a poker playing Dad who taught Abby everything he knows.  Doesn't drink?  Doesn't swear?  Who wrote that copy for Amazon?  Abby drinks like a sailor, which she proves in a 19-shot \\"game\\" at her 19th b-day.  (She actually drinks only 15...Travis drinks 5...ah, true love, indeed.)  Of course Abby and Travis break up and spread unhappiness to everyone around them.  To make a long story short-after saving \\"Pidge\\" from a fire from yet another illegal fight (and almost causing the death of his brother-never mind all those other kids that died) Abby asks Travis to marry her, and off they go to Las Vegas to marry.  (I won't bore you with their first trip to Vegas which involves a mobster and Abby's loser Father.)  I can't even begin to think what the author was thinking to write such a negative role model for young women-Abby isn't strong.  She's an idiot who drinks quite a bit, gets involved with an abusive boyfriend (but he's not abusive-physically-to her)and oh, by the way, skips classes at her college everytime she can't handle it.  The \\"college\\" is more of a high school, or a very, very small college.  I noticed the publisher and wondered if this was a self-published book.  But, now you know the story.  I have never disliked a story this badly, but now that I've warned you, I can scrub it from my mind.

B005MVF65G|5.0|The movie starts with the assassination of President Lincoln and moves quickly to the trial. This was done so the audience would get a feel about how rushed the trial had become. James McAvoy plays Frederick Aiken, the Union officer forced to defend Mary. He believes she is guilty. Mary (Robin Wright) is a quiet woman who is a solid block of courage. She is a rebel sympathizer. The conspiracy meetings took place at her boarding house. The movie shows her face during the trial with occasional outbursts. This was not the case. Her face was veiled during most of the trial and during the testimony of her daughter Anna. However, no woman in Hollywood wants to play that role, so they had her unveiled.<br /><br />Robin Wright looked very much like the depiction we have of Mary Surratt. Noticed how the Secretary of Defense took charge of the situation after the assassination and would allow the VP to take over when he said so. The acting was good and the historical dress and background characters seemed to be accurate down to the straw hats worn by the hangmen.<br /><br />Robert Redford just doesn't choose movies to direct because he thinks they would make good movies. The movies are selected in order to make comparisons to our world today. The question of the legality of the military court for the conspirators is the same legal question that exists today for those at Guantanamo. Just substitute 9-11 for the assassination, and Muslims for confederates. There were threats of biological warfare and \\"the world has forever changed.\\" Mr. Aiken claims how his prisoner is mistreated. It is countered by \\"How you forgotten how our people are treated by the rebels?\\" Mary is \\"Catholic.\\" She wears black from head to toe. She is said to spit on every Union soldier and wears a bone from a Union soldier around her neck. They demonize and dehumanize her. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Great historical drama.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great.. very addictive ...will be very sorry to run out of room and animals...can't wait to get up in morning to turn on...thanks
B007R0Y7VO|3.0|This is kind of a simplistic flick, but its not bad. I found myself wondering how this was done as a stageplay.
B003Y393HQ|5.0|I have one in every color. Absolutely love them. Sooooo comfortable,easy to clean. You may need in the first couple of wears to apply a friction block across where the straps will touch the skin, but other than that you are good to go. The back strap adds additional support. Can't recommend enough!!
B0050G3NWG|5.0|A fictional adaptation of the life of William Randolph Hearst.  It's a good story, though it has a sort of futile quality to it.  I saw it first in a film class.  It is a classic, well worth watching.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is one of the best games I've played in a while . me and my daughter. play it all the time we never turn it off. please send out more updates so you can keep the game at a 5 star review.
0345803507|3.0|Book 3 lacked what books 1 and 2 delivered on, and the ending was blah, but overall, the entire series was AMAZING!  I've never been more addicted to a book series EVER.  Read all 3 books in a week and a half.
B005I547ZG|4.0|A nice addition on what I knew of Bosch. Nice quick solutions like not every case is a deep mystery but each case etches Bosch character.
B007JRU4N0|4.0|It's a winner and a good movie. I don't like CLooney, but he does a good job in this flick.
0143112589|4.0|This is the best book I have read so far by John Mortimer about the very individualistic junior ( but not in age!) barrister in London.<br /><br />The book is very well written and is not easy to put down. The fact that chapters are quite short makes it easy to move from one episode to another. A very interesting insight is given in the life of Horace Rumpole by extracts from his wife's memoirs, mainly focusing on him.<br /><br />John Mortimer can be very witty. For instance,  on p 28 of the paperback edition, we read that Rumpole \\" was relieved of a lever arch file which would eventually contain my notes of the conference with Mahmood Khan. The file was examined with deep suspicion by the (prison) authorities who apparently thought it could be used by my client to tunnel his way out of custody, or at least become a weapon of mass destruction.\\"<br /><br />On p. 74 of the paperback edition we read that Rumpole said \\" I might develop judgeitis\\".  He goes on top explain that by that term he meant \\"A ridiculous inflation of  self-importance, with increased intolerance, a fatal tendency to suck up to juries, to interfere with the cross-examinations by defending counsel; and doing your best to find all the customers in the dock guilty.\\"<br />It is Motrtimer's ability to show both sides any theme such as terrorism or  legal bureaucracy that makes this book worth reading.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Frank Capra didn't make any money off this movie, so he let the copyright expire, which meant the TV studios picked it up, and showed it, because they didn't have to pay royalties.  I saw it before it came out on TV.  It is a classic, one of Capra's best.  It is also maudlin, yet very inspiring.  Well worth seeing.  My wife has this with Spanish subtitles, Spanish speaking people really resonate to this film, also.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Best you tube download app you can get, use it all the time to download videos to watch later. Would like to have no ads, but its still great.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|This is the link to the review on my blog [...]<br /><br />Meet Hazel, diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 12 and ready to die.<br />While reading the beginning of the book I felt a \\"click\\" with the story that ended when Hazel met Gus at Cancer Support Group (apparently people who suffer cancer have a massive vocabulary, especially teenagers).<br /><br />Are you supposed to like a book just because it is about cancer and dying teenagers? Some readers loved this book so much that they get offended if you don't. Others practically call you an idiot if you don't get the story, break down and cry, and others simply hate you if you don't worship it!<br /><br />Well, I feel the book says a lot and nothing at the same time. The characters are not believable and the plot seems forced. We know someone (or all of them?) is going to die, so Green threw in some little mystery about a fictional book to keep the story together.<br /><br />Sadly, the story didn't work for me. I did not enjoy the story within the story of the book (the writer, the fictional book...). I feel it was too fast paced. I mean, not that the book had to be only about sickness and that, but I didn't get this \\"An Imperial Affection\\" mystery/conflict.<br /><br />I did feel sad and almost cried at one point or two, but that wasn't enough to make like the book. The illness of the characters is pictured in a very subliminal, commercial way: to appeal to your emotions and make you like the story because Hazel is walking around with her oxygen tank. Sorry, not enough to get my empathy. It still felt empty; and I still know it's fiction.<br /><br />I skipped all the pages that had to do with that or the trip to Amsterdam or... well, I guess I am the first one to give just one star for this book but...C'est la Vie!
B00723NWJE|5.0|Okay...not going to lie...I originally only bought this because it was on Complex magazine's list of 50 top albums of 2012 (so far). I'm finally getting a chance to listen to the whole thing and all I can say is wow. It's not your typical corny predictable break up album. This whole cd just flows...I never felt the need to skip any of the songs. One thing I must say is \\"Miriam\\" will get stuck in your head. Anyone who has ever been through something like this will totally relate to this song. Don't get me wrong...the whole album is great....but that song....man...if you only get one track get that one.
0345525558|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Enjoyed that things came together at the end, which may have been a realistic stretch, but it was nice.
0345803485|5.0|It's kind of disheartening to see all the negative reviews for this series.  You know what it's about gals (or the few men out there who had their interest piqued).  Those with a \\"prudish\\" personality \\"need not apply\\".  The series was very well-written in my opinion.  The leaders from the author made it hard to put the books down (I finished the series in a week).  I've been searching for new reading material ever since having read Gabriel's Inferno and its sequel Gabriel's Rapture.  Both were fabulous...but not Fifty.  I also read \\"A Beautiful Disaster\\"...which was just that.  I didn't like it at all.  I'd definitely recommend the Fifty Shades series.  However, if you're not interested at all in BDSM I'd recommend you skip it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Hollywoodized, of course.  This is a classic story.  I saw it on the big screen, and yes, when I was in Austria, I paid too much money for the \\"Sound of Music\\" tour, in Salzburg.  They used the back of one house, and the front of another house, for the Trapp house.  I saw the glass house where they sing \\"I am 16\\".  It was a pilgrimage, of a sort.  The tour guide mourned the loss of Jews, because they were really good businessmen, and he felt goods were overpriced.  I think it was genuine.  He also said that Maria was too happy to be in a nunnery of the time, and the nuns were trying to find a way to move this highborn woman off to where she wouldn't upset the nuns.  You can still see the nunnery, from a distance of course.  The first scene is shown 20 miles from the nunnery, so she must have had better hearing than a kit fox, to hear the bells there.  That part of Austria looks just like the movie, even the church where they got married is still there.  The story itself is well known.  This is of course telescoped, the real story is rather longer.  The Nazi sequence is a bit scary for young children, but the story touches hearts.  As long as movies are around, this one will be shown.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are lots of choices of games and they are reasonable in difficulty for beginners.  even my young daughter could find games to play
0345803485|1.0|Please, please, please, do not believe the hype. Especially if you have any interest in actually understanding more about the fascinating world of BDSM and dominant/submissive relationships. The book opens with a bunch of shoe-horned-in BDSM references, 'cunningly' disguised in the context of the main character brushing her hair, utterly unsubtle and so clumsily executed as to actually make the reader cringe from embarrassment.<br /><br />There is a reason this book is only £3.99 in the supermarkets. If you would like something amusing to read, you are infinitely better off having a giggle at Cassandra Parkin's wordpress blog about the first fifty things which annoyed her about Fifty Shades of Grey.<br /><br />Never mind the mystery surrounding how such a load of talentless drivel could possibly become a massive pulp-fiction hit... I simply can't understand how this book was published at all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this series from a friend and jumped on Amazon to see what the hype was all about! Needless to say, I am SO glad I did! All 3 books are some of the best books I have ever read! Someone said that they were life changing...I have to agree! They were intense, sexy & keeps you on the edge of your seat til the very end!!!! I have all 3 on my Kindle and I will definitely be reading them again someday!!!

I felt myself falling short on my Bible studies very quickly after my youngest was born. But now with this app I have found a study plan that helps me stay focused on my reading. Because I can listen to the audio, in the time it takes me to cook a meal I can finish listening to the days scriptures. The only flaw so far,  is that I cannot find a way to change the readers voice. Other than that. it's a great app. :) -Kindle Fire
B007X04N7G|3.0|I seriously wish there were more songs from \\"Bombshell\\" the musical. I can't get enough of Megan Hilty's voice, and there are so many great songs written for the musical in the show. I want to hear the rest of the songs featuredon the show. That is all.
B00005QCUD|5.0|I absolutely Love this CD!  I think it is one of MJ's best EVER!!  In fact, I want to buy another just to have, in case my first one should ever get lost!  Word is, that this CD didn't sell all to well, because Sony just would not promote it as they should have for Michael Jackson...and truthfully, in my opinion, that must be true.  Because had this CD been given much exposure, I think that sales would have been OFF THE CHARTS!  This CD makes me either ROCK OUT or CRY with just about every song! EXCELLENT!
B007JUWM64|4.0|I thought this was a great movie. With all the great actors I dont know why this slipped by. While the ending was predictable, the action sequences (which there are plenty of) and sword fighting look great. Definitely buying this on blu ray.

B001794FOK|4.0|This is a fun action movie.  It moves pretty quickly.  Once I saw it, I went and got the novels, which are well-crafted gems.  A movie can't do what a novel can do, still, this is a fun movie.  It follows Joseph Campbell's monomyth, of course, as do most movies, and is a nice embodiment of that.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|For the past 15 years I have been a web marketer, book designer, writer, editor and the wife of a bestselling author. John Locke understands how web marketing works, particularly for writers. It's what David Meerman Scott preaches about in his web marketing books: Give the right product to the right person at the right time.<br /><br />Locke's book is full of sound ideas that are known to work in the web space. Some people have criticized this book as being too self-promotional, but even though it does have that type of feel, I think it's intentional and necessary. It illustrates what writers can do to connect to their target market and keep them happy. It takes work, people. There's no easy magic bullet. I wish there were!<br /><br />My husband has published 21 books, most with big publishing houses and I can tell you from experience that traditional publishing ain't what it used to be. Enter self-publishing. Until recently it was a nasty word, but now more and more big names are opting to self-publish instead of using a traditional publisher. Why? Because unless you're John Grisham or Stephen King, publishers will publish your book and leave the marketing to you. That's right, YOU are responsible for marketing your work, creating a buzz and building loyal fans. Publishers won't do that for you (or they do very little). It's one of the reasons self-publishing is so appealing. In addition to that, you can write exactly the book you want to write without compromising.<br /><br />I hope to self-publish my novels some day. And I will definitely be using the tools that John Locke writes about in this book.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the book is geared for fiction writers, but it touches very little on non-fiction writers.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|one of my favorite albums. The tone stays about the same throughout the whole thing, but often times the mood changes dramatically. I feel like this is one of the best albums of the 2000's to now. For me, its up with DSOTM or even Abbey Road. The writing is great and there are a lot of different sounds that go into one song, but I never felt like things were chaotic or cluttered. Even if you are not normally appealed by music like this, its good to give it a try. Defiantly an album that should be heard and remembered.
B003D8KH9A|2.0|This pool covering was completely useless.  First, the box contained only 2 things:  A huge plastic tarp, and a very long rope.  No instructions, no photos on the box, nothing at all to explain how the two were supposed to fit together.  After much creative experimentation, we settled on a particular configuration of intertwining the rope in and out of the multiple holes that were pre-punched in the tarp.<br /><br />When we put the cover onto the pool and secured the ropes underneath, it actually looked like it might be functional after all....until the rope tore through the holes in the tarp in more than one spot.  Even before that happened, I was disappointed to see that the cover sagged in the middle instead of being taut on top.  Thus, any time it rained, water and leaves would pool and have to be cleaned up before taking the cover off.<br /><br />This pool covering lasted all of one day.  I definitely would not recommend it.  In fact, the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it technically fits the size and shape of this particular Intex pool, and I'm not sure it would be easy to find another one with the proper dimensions.  But seriously, think hard before you buy it.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|I purchased the UK version specifically on the advice of those reviews in here and I couldn't be more pleased!  The discs are all in perfect condition and the quality of the picture can't be beat.  I'm a fan of movies, but not obsessively so, so unfortunately I can't confirm the tiny little insignificant audio distortions that some people are claiming to hear.  My product works perfectly and I highly recommend it to all who desire this set.<br /><br />Again, purchase the UK version though.  I don't know what it is about the UK versions of movies, but they clearly care more about the quality than they do in the USA.  I have 3 movie collections from the UK and they are all perfect and packaged professionally.
0307951529|4.0|The author uses a series of interesting case studies to prove out his theory that anyone can start a business and be his own boss by creating a micro-business- employing one.  He did it himself. Full of \\"motivating \\" phrases the book does a reasonable job of proving his point that there are countless ways of becoming an entrepreneur.  This is not a book for those who want to build the next Facebook or build a big manufacturing concern, but it is very realistic in its goals and delivers on them. I appreciated that there are many nuggets of guerrilla promotion and good sense buried in this  text.
0789208547|2.0|OK for leisurely viewing but not for study. I do not recommend this to art students who are looking for high quality reproductions of the original paintings. The images seem to be SCANS OF THE PRINTS from the publications that Norman illustrated for. They have poor color and contrast, and some are poorly cut (to remove the magazine title, I'm assuming). It would have looked much better untouched.<br /><br />I've seen better reproductions. I should have read all of the customer reviews before buying.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  While the writing really is not very good, I found it to be an addicting summer read.  I was quickly caught up in the characters and plot.  I didn't feel that the \\"steamy\\" sections were offensive or really even all that graphic, compared to other romance novels I have read.  The \\"kinky\\" nature was not that extreme, though it was alluded to.  I was very eager to read books 2 and 3, and disappointed when I finished them!  I've started over on this book for round two!
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I love all the albums Beach House has made but I feel this one is there most developed. They have a great sound that they have created, really original. None of the songs bore me, it can be repetitive at times, but its something I have come to expect from them. Victoria Legrand's vocals are a lot stronger than they are in previous albums. Although, they still don't appeal to everyone I think she has a style of singing that works for her. I think the writing has improved and is a little more entertaining than other albums. Great CD.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game! So far it's  been pretty easy, but I like to feel successful while being a little challenged. Life is challenging enough, I don't  want to be very frustrated while relaxing and playing a game.
0439023483|5.0|Great book, plot, nice action. Didn't like Peta too much. The main character made it all worth it for me. Especially liked the intricacy of the \\"games.\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|One touch moves cards. No &quot;dragging&quot; required. I play while doing the stairs at the gym on the stairs. Ads can be by-passed so no wait time.
B003YBNREI|5.0|This album is a masterpiece in that it really stands on it's own.  Yes, it does contain a couple of older songs, but they are NEWLY recorded, fresh and different versions of those songs.  This, combined with the new material, make this a \\"must have\\" album for any hard core Doobie Brothers fan, and even for those who are not necessarily \\"Doobies\\" fans.  What is really amazing is that Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons are both in thier early 60's, and yet the vocal work on this effort sounds just like it did in the 1970's when the band was brand new............perhaps even better now. What will really amaze you, however, is the acoustic versions of \\"Black Water\\" and \\"Nobody\\".....both recorded live at the Acoustic Cafe' in Big Sky, MT.  Absolutely AWESOME and joy to the ears.  BUY this album......you will not be sorry!
0345803485|1.0|I wanted to like these books. There had been a lot of buzz, which should have warned me, as they say, don't believe the hype. Sadly I think it says something about our society that they deem this as quality, but these are also the people that like Twilight so opinions should be taken with a boulder of salt! So a quick list of why I hate all things Grey!<br /><br />1) Writing- juvenille, repetative, poorly executed, down right boring, and most importantly unbelievable. Really. a 21 year old that graduated from college in 2011 never had her own email? I graduated from college over a decade ago and they were issued by the university, to add to the one I already had years and years before that.<br />2) Characters- There are so many reasons to hate Ana but here are my favorite ones; painfully and riduculously insecure, obnoxious, more naive than a sheltered Amish 12 year old, inconsistant, and above all immature. Also all the repeating of her favorite words...\\"oh my, inner goddess, oh crap, he's so hot, oh holy crap, etc etc\\" I wanted to punch her and her goddess in the face. Also, here's a little tip I hope a 21 year would know...if someone was abused as a child, the best thing to do is NOT constantly prod them for information and chastise them for not telling you, and getting mad at them about how f*-ed up they are. People who are abused usually don't like to get bullied and emotionally blackmailed by people they just met. Christian, ok you had a rough start in life, it's ok you're broken you're working on that, but I don't see why a 27 year old, college drop out billionaire, yeah BILLIONAIRE , can do everything from pick a fine wine to fly a glider/plane/helicopter, would waste his time on this bland and horrid woman.<br />The only interesting characters are never given any time. Kate has been gone the entire second book and Elena has rarely popped up.<br />3) I was promised some freaky diky sex scenes, not once was I impressed. Granted I have only read the first 2 books, but he brought her into his red room of pain once, and then he spanked her hard once and she cried like a child. She was warned so many times and did the research but the one time he hits her harder than a slap on the butt she runs off crying and calls him a monster. Really?!?! Also the shear number of times they get down with the get down is riduculous. Going from virgin to sex maniac is silly, call Dr. Drew I think someone was diddled by daddy to be so insatiable. Also he is ready to go 7 times a day, he's 27, he's not Superman. Any man you ask about 7 times a day will just laugh. I am actually bored by the sex now after the second book, even after imagining sexy Ryan Gosseling as Christian I still skip pages. I know exactly how it's going to happen, he's going to give her a look that excites her, she will bite her lip, and they both will finish at the same time...yeah right, come on!<br />4) Such a tired cliche of a broken man being fixed by the innocent maiden...YAWN! All you need is love, all you need is love, love, love is all you need!<br /><br />Finally, 5) There is no plot, plain and simple, sex, fight, pout, bad writing, rinse and repeat. I have one more book to read and although I don't want to read it, I paid for it and momma didn't raise no quitter, so I will plow through it begrudingly just so I can say confidently, if anymore brings it up, how bad 50 Shades is!oks, but he brought her into his red room of pain once, and then he spanked her hard once and she cried like a child.

B004AUNSX2|2.0|The focus of this review is the technical aspects of my movie rental experience, i.e., as opposed to a review of the movie itself. Given this preamble, you are correct if you think I have reservations. First of all, I was unable to download the movie I selected to view (Iron Lady). I therefore contacted Amazon technical support, who was unable to rectify the problem, and therefore gave me a $5 credit. We then selected a different movie to view, which was suppose to be in High Definition. It was not in high definition, and the sound track was two channel stereo. The quality of the picture was not good; blurry, smeared, pixalated. The sound was similarly disappointing.  Subsequently (following night), we were able to download Iron lady, and were once again treated to poor video and poor quality two channel audio. This, in spite of the fact that it was supposed to be HD. Note that I have good quality equipment, so I cannot think that the fault is at my end. My impression is that Amazon has a lot of work to do before I will download another movie from them.
034580404X|5.0|A wonderful, fantastic read. The trilogy was read in record time,and alas, at the end of the third book, I too was left with a void. Now what ? Quite a few reviews say the writing is elementary at best. I however didn't care, I loved her writing and the characters she makes us close to. My sex life ? Fully charged! I would love to see Channing Tatum or Brad Pitt as Christian, with Michele Pheifer (sp) as the Mrs. Robinson. The female lead ? Haven't a clue.
0312360266|3.0|Good story and plot but the characters seemed a little sappy. Worth the time for a quick read. Some of the books are better than other but overall a good way to kill time.
B00782O7NE|5.0|Michael Hazanavicius's THE ARTIST dares to be something that adult films these days just don't: it's charming, utterly charming, and it feels no guilt about it.  The plot centers around silent film star George Valentin, who finds his fame and fortune crumbling away with the rise of talkies.  To make matters worse, he's smitten with the new era's fastest rising starlet, Peppy Miller.<br /><br />It's a romance.  It's a drama.  It's an homage to the glory days of Hollywood.  But it's also a solid film in its own right; dare I say, a classic in the making?  As the lead, Jean Dujardin brings a sort of charisma we don't see much of these days; his physicality is reminiscent of Peter Sellers (I'm stealing the comparison from the \\"making of\\" featurette, because it's so dead-on), and in a silent film, most of the acting is physical in nature.  But a fantastic lead performance would be wasted without stellar support, and we get that in Berenice Bejo; her and Dujardin's scenes together are as close to perfect as I've scene lately, and their charisma is undeniable.  The rest of the cast is equally delightful: Malcom McDowell, Missi Pyle, Penelope Ann Miller, and especially James Crowmell and John Goodman are fantastic.<br /><br />The two stars here aren't people, however.  The cinematography is astounding; there is no other word for it.  And the film's script (also by Hazanavicius) is smart.  Yes, it's charming, and yes, it's highly emotional (I was brought close to tears at times; kudos for the amazing score as well), but it's also smart.  That's rare in romantic films; we all know the character arc by this point, so how can you put a new twist on it?  Everything leads up to one of the best film endings of all time, and when the credits role, your journey is completed, and you are thoroughly satisfied.  THE ARTIST is never short of beautiful and captivating; at times, it's even a flat-out cinematic delight.  What more could you want from a film?
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book contained alot of useful information and is a easy read. The author insures you have a basic understanding of commonly used terms to help you to be able to grasp the concepts and explanations discussed in the book. I have already been steadily for about a year and a half, have had nice results, and I've been researching ideas to get me stronger and yield more results. Through the use of the information, I'm going to change my routine up a bit and see how this fairs out for me. It doesn't matter whether you're bulking or cutting, the book has got you covered. The author is also very helpful. I actually emailed a few questions I had and not only did he respond, he responded the same day within hours with lengthy and detailed information. In conclusion, I do recommend this book especially if you're a newb or if you've been training for some time without any noticeable results.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|so far, i'm liking this game, very user-friendly, and fun! graphics are good, and I love the matching games. Got this game for free as Amazon's free app of the day, but after playing it, I would definitely recommend buying this game
B002ZG97LK|2.0|Loved the original movie way back when with Kevin Bacon- so thought I might like this one. A friend who hadn't seen the original watched it with me.<br />A fourth of the way through we were already wanting it to be over. I guess the acting is OK- but this movie is really for teenagers.<br />I'm assuming all these raving reviews are from that age group.<br />This is not a movie your kids should be watching. At least 13 and up in my opinion.<br />Sometimes Holywood should leave well enough alone. Oh- and my friend who hadn't seen the original hated this one.<br />Wish I could get that almost 2 hours of my life back!
0385732554|5.0|I read this as required reading when I was in middle school and it's even better the second time. Great mystery as to knowing what is going to happen to the main character. A really unique story...
B007IXWKUK|1.0|save your money.  so repetative its ridicous.  first book was decent second book a joke.  will NOT be purchasing the third book.
0062119044|4.0|I'm adding my review to the hundreds already on here because I finished this book a few weeks ago and it has continued to stay with me. I read a ton of fiction but rarely write commentary on it, so here goes.<br /><br />As a mother myself, I found Eva's character fascinating.  She's a critical and self-centered woman whose ambivalent journey into motherhood gives rise to a monstrous version of herself - her sociopathic son Kevin.  I really enjoyed considering the interplay between nature and nurture - to what extent did bad genes cause Kevin's temperament, to what extent did Eva's reactions to Kevin cause it, and to what extent did Eva and Kevin play off one another with disastrous results?<br /><br />I also appreciated the threads of nihilism that ran through the book.  Pointing a lens on a society where the middle and upper classes have every basic need met, the book deftly portrays Kevin's psychological distress at the glaring pointlessness of everyday life.  Kevin's worldview provides as reasonable an answer to the \\"why\\" behind his murderous rampage as any.<br /><br />Unlike some reviewers, I did not mind the letter-writing format, or the writing style/language. Shriver is so talented that in my mind, she deserves only praise here. In fact, the perfection of her prose made me want to overlook the book's flaws.<br /><br />I did object to the characterization of Eva's husband Franklin. I liked the idea of Franklin wanting so desperately to be the perfect All-American father that he was reluctant to acknowledge Kevin's faults, but the depth of his denial and stupidity crossed the believability line for me.  Also, at a certain point it was very unrealistic that no one tried to seek professional help for this child - as unambiguously evil as Kevin's behavior was.<br /><br />I too saw the twist coming, and I have mixed feelings about it.  Shriver executed it with skill and power, but she may have gone a little too far - tiptoing into the realm of traditional horror as opposed to psychological horror.<br /><br />Finally, and this is a minor thing: the number of conversations this family has about school shootings was irritating.  I can see one mention, since it was in the news a lot that year, but the constant references were contrived and unnecessary. It was almost as if the characters knew they were in a book about a school shooting.<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific book with a lot of intriguing insights about modern American society and how we raise our children.  It is absolutely worth reading and forming your own opinion.opposed to psychological horror.<br /><br />Finally, and this is a minor thing: the number of conversations this family has about school shootings was irritating.

B007ZD17XO|4.0|I am new to the whole game genre so found this game entertaining. If only I had the time to really speed through !
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is the book I have been waiting for since I started reading self-published stuff on my Kindle. When I buy a book for $2.99, I don't expect it to be the pinnacle of English-language literature. I just want something mostly free of spelling and grammatical errors that tells an engaging story. Blood Song does that and more. The writing is compelling and lucid, the characters interesting and with their own personalities, and the plot well-conceived and woven. The book doesn't exactly break new ground, but it avoids cliche, and will be highly enjoyable to anyone who is a fan of modern fantasy. If it weren't for the abysmal cover, this book would be completely indistinguishable from the top fantasy being published by traditional publishing houses, and at $2.99 is an incredible bargain. And it's one that might not last forever...I see on his blog that the author has signed a contract with a publishing house, so buy this for cheap while you still can!
1442419814|4.0|This book is a book one in a three book series but the books get better and better with the next installments. Worth the time, good read. Interesting futuristic story.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD for years.  I remember my sister and I watching it together.  The movie and the music is totally awesome.  Go out and get the DVD.

B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|Seriously, I think DJ Hahn and Mike have had a terrible infleunce on this bands when it comes to the music they primarily like. Rap/electronic music. The first two albums had a nice blend between the guitars and some electronic music mostly djing and piano. I find it ridiculous that they keep going into this weird direction of electronic, pop, rap music rather than staying to their true roots. I have no idea when people defend their new music saying they need to change, they changed, they matured etc. There is a difference between tweaking your sound and basically doing a 180 which they have done. They basically changed their style, genre, etc. The majority of their music just sounds bland. Hardly any guitars. Heck why don't they just go as a three piece of mike, hahm and chester. Who needs drums? the beats are electronic. I can't hear guitars who needs that. You can make a bass line electronically too without the bass player who i can't even hear since it sounds more electronically made from hahn. They should have just changed the name of the band rather than going on what made them famous. Boring pop electronic music instead of the hard hitting guitar driven riffs... and people actually defend this change lol.
B004QL7K70|1.0|This movie was so freakin' bad!!!<br />Unless you're a 14 year old boy don't waste your time.<br />It seriously is like Superbad, but not even remotely funny.  I didn't laugh once.  A bunch of teenagers at a party and nothing really happens.<br />I know they were going for the home filmed look, but the camera is SO shakey it makes you nauseous trying to focus.<br />I really wish I turned this off right away, I just kept waiting for it to get good or something to happen.<br />This just might be the worst move I have ever seen!
030758836X|3.0|I like Flynn's writing style and the first section of the story was quite compelling. The latter part of the book had too many implausible events for my taste and, the main drawback for me was there was not one single character who was at all likable, except perhaps Go. Yikes, what a bunch of dysfunctional people. Although it was ultimately quite a page-turner, it left me feeling as if I had been involved with a lot of very icky people.
B002E01MHY|1.0|both the early 2000's anchor bay print and all versions of the blu-underground print have two scenes out of place.<br />get an all region dvd player and go to sinerama2 and get it from them ask for trevor. theirs is fully restored.<br />in is a region 2 format. and a much better print.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down! It had my attention from the very beginning. It's a great idea, and there is not a single boring moment. Characters are relatable, plot is exciting. This book will have you hooked from the very first word.
