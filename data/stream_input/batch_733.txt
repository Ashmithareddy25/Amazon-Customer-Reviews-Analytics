1400079276|4.0|I went in having had no previous experience with Murakami, so I would recommend this novel to others the same. If you check out the negative reviews you'll see that some people really hate this book! I can understand why, and I do agree on some points. (It can get obvious and pretentious in parts, but to me the whole /was/ greater than the sum of its parts.)    I enjoyed the characters, the tension, the scenery. Oshima in particular is a really well-crafted character - one of my favourite characters from recent literature. I won't go into plot details and character relationships, but I will say that I enjoyed this book enough to go back and re-read it a few months later. (And I love cats, so that was a bit of effort.)    Regarding other people's complaints - soft porn, pointless violence, meaningless entertainment, shallow philosophy - quite honestly, I enjoy a bit of those sometimes! It's perfect if you're looking for something to pick up and escape into. The loose threads that most Murakami readers hate just don't bother me here. Having said that, I've only read Kafka and the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (which I didn't enjoy as much).    To finish off this roundabout review, I'll only say that I enjoyed it and it's worth a read! The protagonist is easy to get along with, the split narrative style kept me turning the pages and the whole thing was generally a good read. It's not light reading but it won't drag you to the edges of emotion either. Recommended.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|While not exactly the very first vampire film ever made, this 1922 silent horror classic definitely made the mould and set the standard for all vampire and horror movies to follow.  Loosely based on the famous Dracula novel by Bram Stoker, \\"Nosferatu\\" has all the elements of the classic horror genre together with style and intelligence which are often sadly lacking in modern horror movies.  Famous German director F.W. Murnau and his colleagues changed the names and places from the Stoker novel to suit German audiences, but the essence of the story remains the same:  a sinister Count in an eerie castle in Transylvania bites necks to feed on his victim's blood during the night and sleeps in his coffin during daylight hours.  On a relatively small budget, Murnau managed to capture the creepiness of both the Count and his castle, and with just some grotesque make-up and long fake fingernails, actor Max Schreck successfully creates the dreadful horror of the supernatural vampire with his stance and slow, determined movements and gestures.  Every scene with Schreck is gripping and quite unforgettable, and it is easy to see why \\"Nosferatu\\" has gone down in history as a classic silent film and masterpiece of the genre.  As such, it is appropriate that Kino Video has put together this ultimate DVD edition with many extra features, but above all, this is a newly restored version taken from various sources to present the best possible picture quality, together with the orchestral score which was originally written for the film.  I thought my first DVD of \\"Nosferatu\\" on the Eureka label was a good print, but I was impressed to see how clear and fresh this digitally restored picture looks, and together with beautiful classical music, \\"Nosferatu\\" has risen to new heights as a stylish and classic film.<br /><br />For the more serious enthusiast, the 1-hour documentary on F.W. Murnau which focuses on the making of \\"Nosferatu\\" is particularly interesting as it carefully traces the steps taken by Murnau and his crew, going to the various locations where filming took place.  I was surprised and fascinated to see that many buildings and even the eerie castle seen in the film still exist today, some hardly changed in 85 years.  And for the real purists or Germans, the second disc in this set has all the original German intertitles to give us a good idea of how German audiences first experienced \\"Nosferatu\\" at its release in 1922. With all this additional background information, as well as interesting stills and artwork for the film and excerpts from other Murnau films, this set is invaluable for not only silent film collectors, but also for fans of the horror genre and Dracula and vampire stories in particular.taken by Murnau and his crew, going to the various locations where filming took place.

B000VFH5Z2|5.0|Every year, Pixar deliver a film that tops the previous one, and this time was not the exception. Rattatouille is a true masterpiece, both technically and story telling wise. The colorful views of Paris and the attention to the details in the kitchen scenes are fantastic. I'm not very skillful in the cooking arts, but the film truly inspired me, if a rat can cook so can I.This dvd is hardly a collector's item, if we talk about special features, but in the video and audio presentation categories it have 5 stars, the transfer is excellent, with very good definition and only a little posterization in the dark areas. The mix in 5.1 DolbyDigitalEx (English and Spanish)delivers the goods. It's highly recommended as part of any animation fan dvd collection.

0452286751|4.0|In a world that is quickly degenerating, Ayn Rand paints a vivid portrait of a man who struggles against all odds to stand for himself. Howard Roark is a brilliant architect, who refuses to sacrifice his ideals and beliefs in return for monetary gain, popularity, or any of the other rewards that the people around him are so greedily willing to trade their values for. Unbending and noble, Howard fights to bring the world honesty by using his skills in architecture to create startlingly unique buildings. Criticized by the world for his unusual and functional buildings, that lacked the splendor and ornamental uselessness that had become so popular, Howard fights an uphill battle, while everything he holds dear hangs precariously in balance: his life, his work, and the woman he loves.    This book is a clear illustration of Ayn Rand's philosophy of rational selfishness. Howard embodies the perfect man, who gives nothing of himself, and would never allow his values crumble. He embodies selfishness, in a balanced, reasonable way. Roark lives in the world, but not of it. He lives by his own standard, does his own work, and relies upon himself, never stealing another's work, or looking for his own gain. Integrity guides his actions, while he ignores the opinions and criticism of others. While Howard is the clear protagonist, the other characters vary in standing; some represent the evil of the world: of men that have failed, of men that could have never succeeded, of men with potential that discarded it for the dishonesty of the world.   Peter Keating represents one of these men: the man who would never succeed. He aspires and plots; using men to achieve what he cannot by himself. He is weak and easily manipulated, and led away from the things he truly wishes to do with his life, preying on the weak to hide his own insecurity and lack of talent. He is easily corrupted, and lives his life only for the fickle and false approval of the world, which does not last. As he bases his personal value and happiness on this shaky foundation, he finds himself father and farther from the things he really desires, and in the end, alone, as a failure.   Another man that represents the evil of the world: Ellsworth Toohey. A columnist for a widely read newspaper, Toohey shapes the public to his own diabolical whim. By highly praising those with little true talent, he takes the standard of man and lows the bar significantly, making mediocrity the highest aspiration, and turning the public against men such as Howard, who have true ability to succeed. Throughout the book men such as these represent the lowest humanity could fall to, thus causing Howard to be an intellectual giant amongst greedy, lazy, inept men. He is criticized for being \\"selfish\\" and \\"egotistical\\" though his only offense was to unyieldingly defend his values.   Dominique Francon is another character that exemplifies greatness. Passionate, yet deeply afraid to love anything, only to see it taken away, Dominique lives only a half-life until she meets Roark. Howard's only love, and brilliant in her own right, Dominique fights fiercely against the world, hating them for what they do to Howard.  Roark helps her to find that the world really doesn't matter, and she finally finds a way to discard what others think, and live her life fully and proudly, as Howard does.    Gail Wynand is another man who Howard changed. Despite living in poverty as a child, he rose to become a great newspaper owner, with his newspapers influencing and shaping the way the public thinks and feels. He becomes good friends with Howard, who sees Gail for his genius and ability, and respects his talent of gaining personally. But Gail's success and love of life is only based on his ability to shape public opinion, so when his power fails, he fails as well.    As the story goes on, Rand's antagonists constantly try to thwart Howard, including Dominique for a brief period of time. She marries Peter, trying to hurt Howard,to break him, so he stops offering the world his beauty and perfection that they will, in the end, only reject. So caught on what others thought, Dominique believed that the world didn't deserve Howard, and worked frantically to destroy his work. She begins to see as Howard does eventually, leaving the world behind and standing beside Howard to defend him and aid him in surviving obstacles. Her fear dissolves when she sees how untouchable Howard is, and how nothing can destroy him because of the confidence and knowledge he possesses.  He has a difficult time getting commissions, and refuses some, only building the way he saw fit; refusing to compromise his integrity to build something he was not inspired to do. In doing so, he invoked the hatred of the people who would never understand or appreciate Howard's magnificent talent. As Toohey brought the public against Howard, Peter worked to use Roark's genius as his own, taking credit for Howard's work. The climax of the book occurs at Howard's trial, after he was arrested for destroying a building which he had designed, but had been secretly defiled.  he delivers a speech about his ideals, trying to correct the corruption the world has fallen into, and explain how true happiness can come only from integrity, hard work, and self respect.      The storyline is elaborately and skillfully weaved, the point comes across both bluntly and subtly; with enough imagination and fictional drama to hook the reader, and enough reality and philosophy to engage the reader, to invite thought and consideration about the world as it is today. Sometimes the plot seems a bit outlandish, but a touch of surrealness only adds to the entertaining aspects of the book.   The characters in this book are vivid, though unrealistic. The heroes are vastly superior to those cast in a less desirable light. Nonetheless, Rand gets her point across. By making her \\"perfect man\\" so stunningly righteous and decent, by comparison everyone else is seen as dirty and low.  They are too perfect, or too imperfect, and none of them really have much \\"humanity\\" to them--emotion remains unexpressed, there is no laughter, and few tears. The characters sometimes seem to be made of stone. Despite this, the symbolism behind each of the characters is very well done. The text can sometimes seem a bit thick--in subject matter and length. Some of Howard's monologues are overkill, but still, the point is there, without flourish or disguise. Rand places her point in front of the reader, presented by the glorious protagonist, and to disagree would put the reader into the same category as Peter Keating, and Toohey: not only in the wrong, but as a being that is working to destroy human progress; the embodiment of pure evil. The characters draw the reader in, and before they know it, Howard has won them over, and so has Rand with her philosophy of rational selfishness, and the theory that \\"A man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.\\"

B000GFLAI0|5.0|In concerts these days (and, at age 65, he plays 130 of them each year), with his William Powell moustache and Stetson hat, he hunches over an electric piano like a hobo by a trashcan fire.  His band, LOUD and tight, blazes through a hodgepodge of mostly lesser-nebula songs.  The singer never looks at or speaks to the audience.  His voice is a ferocious rasp--a chain saw going on and off.  Not a word is intelligible and the songs are arranged and performed so differently from their \\"original\\" versions that even the singer's oldest fans are left guessing at the set list.  It is more Kabuki than concert, more Beckett than Broadway.     31 studio albums into his career, Bob Dylan is still in active collaboration with his inimitable muse.  His latest album--his first in five years--is Modern Times.  Moving through much of the same territory as his last two albums, this record continues to advance the Dylan dialectic:  he suggests who he might be by oblique reference to what he might not be.    Within, between and behind the enigmatic gamesmanship, everything a Dylan fan might want is here.  In fact, it's all here in the very first song.  The driving boogie \\"Thunder on the Mountain\\" is a murky flood of, by turns, romantic yearning, comic bluster, and vaguely sinister sentiments (\\"I was thinkin' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying,\\" \\"I've been studying the art of love . . . I want some real good woman [apparently Ms. Keys] to do just what I say,\\" \\"I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows,\\" \\"I got the pork chops, she got the pie,\\" \\"I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams,\\" \\"the hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf\\")  Never far from view, either, is Dylan's religion (\\"Some sweet day I'll stand beside my King.\\").  Like so many great Dylan songs, it is revelatory and exhilarating precisely because one can't quite pin down just what it reveals.    Of all of Dylan's albums, this new record arguably shares most with the sprawling bootlegged \\"Basement Tapes\\" Dylan recorded with The Band in Woodstock after his motorcycle crash in 1966.  It reveals that, as much as he is a poet and a mystic, Dylan is a music fan:  he is as fascinated with the music of the 1920's and 1930's as he is by Chicago blues, Songcatcher ballads, Jimmie Rogers' country yodels, 50's crooner tunes, and countless other artists and genres.  And he shares much of it with us here.  Not unlike Elvis Presley, Dylan wavers between an anti-establishment rock-and-roll self and a would-be crooner self.    For those who prefer Dylan's political songs, there is the excellent labor balled \\"Workingman's Blues #2.\\"  \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" is a conscious nod to Robert Johnson.  \\"Spirit on the Water\\" and \\"Beyond the Horizon\\" sound like swing ballads pulled from the first half of the last century--like songs you'd hear behind Jack Nicholson in the bar scene from The Shining.  \\"When The Deal Goes Down\\" is a slow country waltz that would have fit well in a Grateful Dead set, \\"Nettie Moore\\" a languid, lovely ballad as beautiful as anything Dylan has ever written.  \\"Ain't Talkin'\\" is a dirge as evocative of Dylan acolyte Townes Van Zandt's \\"Waitin' Around To Die\\" as of Dylan's own \\"One More Cup of Coffee.\\"    Modern Times is Dylan at his best--which means it is Dylan as we find him.  Five years from now, if we're lucky enough to get another album from him, he will still be showing us another side.
0525950079|4.0|My favorite book of all times is \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", so I had to read this new one \\"World Without End\\". The long awaited sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was entertaining and captivating. Ken Follett's character descriptions form great mental pictures of the cast, but his newfound obsession with promiscuity and adultery, in this book, turned me off. I have read his first book twice, but I think I'll pass on a second reading of this one.

1400049628|5.0|First off, this book takes itself very seriously.  It doesn't, but it presents itself that way so much that it becomes a really brilliant piece of meta-humor.      If you like having quirky offbeat dry humor around, look no further.  There is no better book I can think of to have lying in your bathroom.  Every guest I've ever had over has commented on the book and LOVES it.  Really great piece of conversation and it really surprises me how people of all backgrounds seem to come out of my bathroom and have a story about a zombie movie or a nightmare or something along those lines they just laugh about having seen the book.      Kudos to the author for one of the most entertaining pieces of encyclopedic humor I've eve seen!
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Well it seems that IE is content with 2 albums per decade... if the Glorious Burden were anywhere near as well made and powerful as Framing Armageddon I'd say this works.  Ultimately, I was 1 album from giving up on the band after the Glorious History Lesson but am definitely hopeful for future releases based on Framing Armageddon.    Iced Earth has graduated.  I'm a big fan of the older albums (NotSR, BO) and even thought that Horrow Show was a great album, however, it seemed at times like the band was simply rewriting old material.    Now a lot of people are thinking \\"what are you talking about? this is album is a rewrite of the Something Wicked trilogy.  It's a rewrite!\\"  Well yes and no.  Compare the original recordings of the Prophecy, Birth of the Wicked and the Coming Curse to those released on the Ten Thousand Strong Single \\"Ovreture of the Wicked\\".  It almost feels like the band was practicing on the '98 release for this album.    Tim Owens has figured out how to integrate with the sound of IE and this gives the album a large portion of its power.  This album is big sound.  Lots of layered and alternating vocals add to the atmosphere that this album has - an atmosphere that now that we hear it makes us wonder where it is on the original Something Wicked Album.    Another difference on this album is the use of guitars.  Yes this is metal and it is Iced Earth so there are the characteristic crazy right hand speed and palm muting that we all love, however, the guitar sound is completely upgraded.  If feels like Schaffer has learned that the darkness in the music has less to do with guitar tone then it does with songwriting.  The guitars on this album, were they playing a different style of music would actually sound bright and punchy, however, the sound is dark and crisp due to the songwriting.    Finally, content.  Schaffer for a while has shown a desire to produce thematic albums.  Got it right with this one.  When I listen to the album I can almost imaginethe scenes of a movie that would make complete sense with the musical production.    There have been IE albums in the past that I had to listen to a few times in order to truly appreciate.  This is not one of them.  It hits you immediately.  Now we can only hope that more material like this is forthcoming from IE before Schaffer gets any grayer...
B000UNYJV8|4.0|Shane Meadows' semi-autobiographical story of a dejected pubescent boy's transformation into a skinhead in recession-wracked England of 1983 earned \\"This Is England\\" top honors at the 2006 British Independent Film Awards. Shaun (Thomas Turgoose) is a defiant and cocksure 12-year-old who recently lost his father in the Falklands War. Surrounded by unemployment, malaise, and picked on at school, he finds companionship and an outlet for his frustrations among a group of skinheads whose leader, Woody (Joe Gilgun), takes the boy under his wing. This seems harmless until violent, insecure Combo (Stephen Graham) rejoins his fellow skins after a 3-year stint in prison, shattering the group's camaraderie with racism and crime.<br /><br />\\"This Is England\\" dives into the skinhead counterculture that gave working-class young people a place to belong and share their dissatisfaction. Unemployment and a poor economy made them susceptible to the inflammatory rhetoric of the National Front, causing skinheads to be associated with racism and violence in the popular consciousness. The two stand-out performances are, not surprisingly, the most emotionally charged characters. Thomas Turgoose is completely natural as a foul-mouthed, moody youngster -who looks closer to 9 than 12. Stephen Graham makes Combo's instability and insecurity menacing, always in danger of erupting. I found the poor quality DV out of place in the period setting and less than this film deserves. But the fine performances are worthwhile. The only bonus feature on the IFC DVD (2007) is a theatrical trailer. No subtitles.

Instead of kevin costner, you get Paul Walker & that guy from 300. You can tell they spent most of the money for this movie on the end sequence which is utterly amazing and I won't spoil it for you here. All the costuming is perfect. This movie suffers from poor editing, but I could care less because the plot is amazing. People who don't like this movie probably aren't fans of time travel or adventure or can't comprehend the storyline...and guess what, if you don't like this movie, your not cool.

B00005JMYI|1.0|Some films are so bad they're good and their perpetrators usually excuse themselves by explaining that originality was the furthest thing from their minds. And occasionally we feel affection for them because, if nothing else, they evoke feelings of nostalgia for a supposed `golden age' when imagination and creativity were almost commonplace and the bottom line. However, don't be fooled into thinking that because you found Dodgeball, Meet the Fockers, Happy Gilmour, etc. funny you'll respond similarly to this.<br /><br />Having dutifully sat through ninety minutes (it was a gift) of utter cringe-inducing garbage I can't help but wonder whether Ferrell will ever be trusted with money again. There is supposed to be a joke hiding somewhere in this film but obviously I blinked at the wrong time. If you have the sense of humour of an emotionally retarded orang-utan you might just enjoy it but be sure not to blink!<br /><br />The one remotely saving feature is the performance of Christina Applegate as Ferrell's `love interest' who, at least, tries to invest her role with some degree of integrity. Oh, and you might derive some `enjoyment' along the way by trying to guess from which superior efforts this travesty has stolen; The Day Today, and 1987's Switching Channels, being merely the most obvious.<br /><br />My idea of hell – being forced to watch this vomit-inducing trash over and over again!

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|V FOR VENDETTA is a cross between The Man in the Iron Mask and Phantom of the Opera. While it purposes to take a serious political tone, it's message of \\"It's our differences that make us strong\\" seems silly by the end.<br /><br />Democracy has its price. It is the least efficient form of government and is unfair and unjust at times. Free markets are not fair. A market economy is unjust to the disenfranchised. Still, totalitarianism is pure evil and who can suffer it?<br /><br />Not England, according to Vendetta. She finally rebels against the heavy-handed government and its minions. Led by a Quixote-type character in \\"V\\", the rebel makes good on its suicidal promise to start from scratch. Such is liberty.<br /><br />The larger theme of VENDETTA is hope. Hope gives faith aim. On this point, the message is truly eternal, like love.
B00005JPNW|3.0|There's a lot to like in this movie, so let's start there. The CGI is outstanding, for example. The technology keeps getting better every year, and this movie rides the wave. The bears are about as convincing as anything I've seen, down to the rippling of their thick hides when two crash together in combat. The adventure never stops, keeping a solid pace from one scene to the next, right to the very end.<br /><br />That's where the not-to-like part of the movie comes in. It seems to end about two chapters before where the book ended. That omission cut out one of the most dramatic sequences in the book, albeit an obvious cliff-hanger and sequel bait - maybe those scenes really do belong at the start of the inevitable next movie rather than the end of this one. One other scene translated badly to movie form, too: finding the \\"cut\\" child and what followed. The book's version was much darker, maybe a bit much for the film's intended audience. Those were probably the two most crucial scenes in the book. I'd say the movie got pretty much everything right except for those two scenes - the two that really mattered. Oh, and the scene where she discovers her parentage, that suffered badly in translation to the big screen, too.<br /><br />Like the plot elements, the characters were bleached to pale, bland ghosts of their book form. It's probably just as well. If Lyra had much of a real personality about her, it might have been hard to swallow her effortless skipping from one dramatic victory against crushing odds to the next. A real girl might have had a case of the nerves in single-handedly facing down hundreds of sword-bearing warriors and wolves, or in other of her dramatic moments. Just a little, at least. Not our Lyra - something as credible as a bit of fear or doubt would have smudged the Barbie-like slickness of our little heroine's image.<br /><br />It's fair adventure and fantasy, with lots for the eyes to enjoy. Not much gets past the optic nerve and into the thinking mind, though.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdredweird
1594489505|3.0|There's been alot of favorable buzz over this book, so I was eagerly looking forward to reading it.  It was an entertaining book, but nothing that, in my opinion, warranted the acclaim it's received.  The story has a soap-box tenor about it---both poignant and hokey at the same time.  I have the vague feeling that I've previously seen, or read, a similar plot, the main difference being that this story takes place in a rather exotic locale--Afghanistan.  It was certainly interesting learning about the customs/mores and rituals in that country but, again, that knowledge doesn't compensate for an overall so-so novel.
3822856282|3.0|The concept is a good one: let the model choose pose herself and work the camera, as Andre Rival did with [[ASIN:3905514451 Self-Images]]. Given Ommer's past work, including [[ASIN:3822832057 Black Ladies]], I had the highest hopes for a this new collection of figure photography.<br /><br />Rather than use the controlled environment of his studio, Ommer tracked his lovely subjects to their lairs, to show them in their native environments. Ideally, the home and its content should have framed the model and exposed more of her personality. Instead, the backgrounds came across as cluttered and distracting. Even if the models controlled the camera and poses themselves, I counted on Ommer and his artist's eye to select those few snapshots that truly rose above the ordinary. Instead, the collection conveys an amateurish look.<br /><br />I hoped for better, and he's done better. I hope he does better again in the future.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B000MR9D5E|5.0|There aren't enough words to adequately describe how wonderful this series is! It is beautifully filmed and fascinating. Everyone in our house watched with rapt attention ages 7-40. It is definitely a must see.

B000TFINY6|5.0|This was by far my fav season of LOST. It didn't fair as well when being aired on TV, but when you watch them at your own pace, the the flow of the show makes it that much better.    The Blu Ray set is well worth the money. The picture is very sharp as is the sound. I have to agree with the creators of the show, this is the WAY Lost is supposed to be seen.  The island/beaches just jump out at you. It's simply stunning.    Don't be deterred from some of the negative reviews on here, they are just complaining that LOST isn't on the HD DVD format. What that has to do with THIS product, is beyond me.    You can't beat the price either, so by it NOW while it's on sale. Most TV DVD sets are $50 when not on sale, so for $10 more, you get the whole show  in HD. Also consider that you are getting 24+ hours worth of content. When the average 2 hour movie is $19 on DVD...well, do the math.    This is well worth it. 5/5 stars easily.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and years as most people do.  I purchased this copy for a friend whose video has finally given out.  They will love all the versions on this set.
B0000027I6|4.0|This is Roger's best solo work to date. This is my third cd of \\"Amused to Death\\". I've played them to death.   The last three tracks are worth the cost of the CD.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Springsteen should have combined \\"Rising\\", \\"Working on a Dream\\" and \\"Magic\\" into one CD, which would have been a great one instead of three average CD's.     Magic has two really good songs \\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"Girls in Summer ____\\" and a couple of average songs that will entice a dedicated Springsteen fan but not a casual listener.    \\"Working on a Dream\\" also has three very good songs coupled with average material and ditto for \\"The Rising\\".
1582701709|5.0|excellent book...everyone should read this as thoughts ARE things and how we think and what we think is what we attract to ourselves be it negative or positive.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|First things first. This DVD starts with adverts that you can't jump through or fast forward. To me that is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.    Other than that it's a very good movie, Bourne has returned to being a secret agent who really knows what he's doing. The previous experiment in the troubled uncertain Bourne was a total mistake.    Gone also is the filmed-on-a-cell-phone 'action' style of the second film.     That's all I wanted to say, if you are in to action movies you should buy this.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Ok...I wasn't a big Die Hard fan before this movie. But...this movie RULES. I love the plot. Makes you believe it could really happen someday. Especially since everything is runned by computers even cars. Bruce Willis still has the stuff that actors dream off. Great action scenes. Great movie.
140130916X|1.0|I read this book when it came out and, recently, a friend of mine asked if the book was good (after seeing a preview for the new movie coming out).<br /><br />My instant response: Watch the movie, if you'd like, but the book is un-readable.<br /><br />As other reviewers have stated, this book was written by a woman who writes at the level of an elementary school student. Very little interesting dialogue. While the premise is a great one for a \\"chick-lit\\" book (or even, as we are seeing, a chick-flick movie), there is little follow through in fleshing out the characters and their interactions. It's boring. This proves that, unfortunately, a good premise does not equal a great novel.<br /><br />So, my advice to anyone who is fooled by the success this novel has garnered - please get it from a library or borrow it from someone. Don't waste money buying it.<br /><br />If you are really looking for a great \\"chick-lit\\" book by a novelist who knows how to write great characters, interesting dialogue and creates an amazing story, read any book by Elizabeth Young. Around the same time I tried to read this book, I picked up \\"Asking for Trouble\\" by Elizabeth Young and I devoured that book in one sitting. This book, though? I put it away after 3 chapters and wondered how the woman managed to find a publisher for this drivel.<br /><br />Bottom line: Poorly written with under-developed characters & a weak plot.
B000W9DTG6|3.0|Great Box Set. VERY THICK BOX. Take's up a lot of shelve space but it's worth it since all three movies are included. I can see why blu-ray is becoming popular.    The movie itself, Ocean's Thirteen, was alright. Not the greatest Ocean's movie. In my opinion the second one was a lot better. Al Pacino plays a mild role not a great role. I had a lot of good expectations for this movie but in the end it didn't live up to them. A great movie to sit and relax to over a break.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|Bought this for my mom for Christmas at her request.  Could not beat the price for such a great set!!!!!  I know she will love it!  Thanks for passing along your savings to the customer!!!
0446615625|2.0|David Baldacci is an entertaining writer, but his plots border on the absurd in many cases.  THE CAMEL CLUB isn't terrible, but the plot is so overblown and silly that I ultimately didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.  In the end, the reader is expected to swallow too many silly events and coincidences that would never happen in real life.<br /><br />Another problem with THE CAMEL CLUB is that it begins too slowly, and has too many characters to keep track of.  The first 200 pages really consist of little more than Baldacci introducing his large cast of players.  Things improve considerably after the first 200 pages, however, once the story gets moving.  The last part of this book is quite fast-paced and exciting, if you can tolerate its sheer level of absurdity.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have commented, Baldacci has an agenda in THE CAMEL CLUB, and he's not subtle in how he expresses it.  He's very critical of US foreign policy, and American ignorance of foreign affairs in general.  Many of the Americans in this book are caricatured as narrow-minded buffoons.  While I don't necessarily disagree with some of Baldacci's political points, I was turned off by the heavy-handed way he expressed them in this book.<br /><br />In short, THE CAMEL CLUB is a subpar effort from Baldacci.  If you've never tried his work, I recommend ABSOLUTE POWER as a superior alternative.
0525457585|1.0|The first 100 pages were good, original, and well written.  Once Bastian enters Fantastica, the book goes downhill.  It seems that all of the events with Bastian were drawn from a hat at random.  The story doesn't develop anything for the rest of the book, and I could care less about anything in the story other than finishing it, and stopping the torture of reading this awful piece of literature.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I'm so blown away by this album as well as Global A Go-Go. I could see that he was going somewhere early on, but with these albums he has most obviously arrived. I don't know if I can think of better, more brilliant rock-n-roll/cross-genre albums ever made. Can't stop listening. Thanks, Joe, for leaving me with something that I'll never put away.
B00008CLOA|5.0|If you could own 1 album in 5.1 this is the one to own. The futuristic space sounds of Pink Floyd make this album a perfect fit. The 5.1 sound and 4.7 gigs of memory make this CD blow away the sound of a regular CD. There is no comparison whatsoever. It even more like it came from another planet. You cannot imagine how great this sounds until you hear it for yourself. It is like the future tomorrow in your living room. Individual sounds coming out of each of the 5 speakers will make the room shake and make you feel like you are really there with Pink Floyd making the recording. I bought a 5.1 system for this reason only and never want to go back to buying regular CDs. Unfortunately that is all that is available for the most part. Hybrid CDs are scarce in #. But least this one exists. All worth it! The Pink Floyd Pulse DVD is recommended also.    Not only great sound but the visuals of the concert will blow you away and you hear DSOTM live also in 5.1!  If you have a 5.1 sound system you have no possible sane reason to complain.  For those of you that don't stop your bloody whining because this CD is for 5.1 only so don't you dare say anything negative and go buy a 5.1 or get out!
0345494997|5.0|I was especially interested in Frank Llyod Wright's time spent in Fiesole, Italy as we know the house that he stayed in.  By all accounts this book  accurately describes Mr.Wright's nature and his artistic integrety and energy.
B000UFAURI|5.0|This album reminds of when the Beatles put out an album:  Every single song is Great!  I love these guys and think they have surpassed their previous work, as well as other bands in this genre, in lyrics, melodies, instrumentation and production on this album.
B000000WA4|3.0|Holy cow, was Siamese Dream a masterpiece.  Which makes this nonsensically titled wad of bloat a complete letdown and a half.    What happened to Billy's voice?  Why does it sound like he's singing from a Lay-z-Boy with new beer-fueled layers of neck fat choking his trachea, producing this new sound, this throttled, screeching goose honk?  He never used to sound like that!    And where did the songs go?  This tatwaddle from a guy who crafted \\"Drown\\" and \\"Obscured\\" and \\"Quiet\\"?  And when did you start taking yourself too seriously, Billy?  What did we do to deserve lines like \\"I'll never be the shine in your spit\\"?     Oh Billy, what happened?    There are a handful of great tunes on here, but a handful does not a double album make.  Billy, Billy.  Did you really have to take out a full page ad in the Chicago Tribune to tell us your solo album was a pile of poop?  We KNEW it was, pal.      Word to the wise: relax.  Don't go publishing any more books of poetry.  Don't wear black leather smocks, and for god's sake, pack up that Zero t-shirt.  You made some great songs there for awhile, and that's something to be proud of.  There are even some classic ones on Adore, and one or two on Machina II, but that's as far as I go.      And for you SP fans who stuck with them 'til the end, I've gotta hand it to you.  You're a better fan than I am, apparently.
1594489505|4.0|I found this book to be very well written.  It gives us some insight on how women were treated in Pakistan.
0439882826|5.0|I got this for my brother who is an avid Star Wars fan from the 70's.  He was sooo impressed with how this book was put together and how pop-ups had pop-ups.  It is really impressive and worth buying!!
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|Cover albums are usually a joke. There might be one or two interesting ones on there, some of which even out-do the originals, but mostly they tend to be uninspired. But being as this is a soundtrack to a truly inspired film, and given the utter strength of the roster, it's safe to say something else is going on here. It pretty much blows the doors off of all but a few notable Dylan covers from the past. The sound is timeless as well. When I heard Georgia Hubley singing 4th Time Around on WFMU, it took a while for me to realise it was her. I was thrown off by how much it sounded like a 1960's Dylan recording.  Anyways, perfect holiday gift for any Dylan-loving dad. I know I'm getting it for mine.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Really enjoy the send up of the military mind-set and the concept of service guarantees Citizenship (if you survive). Plenty of humor and tounge-in-cheek moments. The set up is over the top! Kill the Bugs !!!<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching Starship Troopers 2 as it is pathetic.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|At first, I was angry at The White Stripes.  I was boycotting them due to their cancelling of an appearance in August at the Austin City Limits Music Festival.  So... I was hesitant to support them through buying their new album.  In fact, I had staged a boycott... in my head at least.  I have to say that I don't regret biting the bullet.  This CD is my new favorite CD.  I can't get enough of it!  There is such an array of genres carefully intermingled so as to delight each and every sense.  If you were, are or plan to be a White Stripes fan at any point, then this album is a must-have.  There is one song where Jack and Meg are talking.  If you can get over Meg's whiny, cutesy voice, then you will be addicted to this compilation.  RAWK!
B000XJSL9U|5.0|Great movie, and a nice way to add a fourth movie to the Die Hard Series.  As the poster previous to me rated the movies thinking that this was the 3rd, I will do so again, but this time including all 4 movies.  The first one of course is a classic, and although the second was also good, the third really made me fall in love with the die hard series again.  The fourth is jam packed with action, and only because i have a speacial place for the first movie, I will rank them in this order (best -> not as good....) 1,4,3,2

The only thing in common is a person . Harrison Ford ,Indiana Jones . good trilogy because Sean Connery was his father . basta ! and the director's wife was Smokin' Kate capshaw . Woof ! Ridley Scott never rehashes his movies . Originality is the key . remember the New Coca-cola   be satisfied with one good movie and leave it at that ! Mister Scott is an original , America wants more of the same over and over and over,boring , stupid , un-original and that's movies not politics i wouldn't go there . Please wake up Superbad was better than jar-jar Binks . they had the force or strength to be a little different . i'm waiting for one of the scott bros to make a movie with Eddie Murphy , Brett Ratner eat my shorts and kiss Jackie Chan on the butt . your talent lies with your gift of gabb , Blah,blah,blah,bland !

Billy Bob Thorton for president Hmmm ! Hmmm ! You have all sold out and we followed like sheep . Beeeh !
B0000009OP|5.0|I love these guys - this is one of their best. There's nothing I can think of to compare it to. I can only say that this music makes me love the sax when normally i don't. Vocals are smoky and wonderful. Lyrics are great too. Check out the samples. If they spark your interest, you will love the whole thing.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This film always makes me cry. I love it. It's one of my favorites. This edition is a very good one and should be picked up by any fan of the film. I do love and value my life, just like George does at the end of the film.<br /><br />I also hope my neighbors bring me a bucket of money, should I ever need one.<br /><br />:)
0380804557|4.0|I wish my mom would have read this to me as a child and summarized it for bedtime stories.  This is beautifully told and a love story in the end.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I have the DVD of this film and HAD to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  This movie was an instant Pixar classic from the moment the first bit was proceesed.  The CG animation is fantastic and the storyline will keep adults and children glued to their 103\\" plasmas (or 56\\" DLP in my case) from start to end. Action, adventure, emotion and kick a** hi-def... it's all packed into this must have Blu-Ray disc for you to enjoy, and to show off your high tech AV toys to your friends.  If you don't have it in HD, order it now.<br /><br />You're welcome. :)
0440238609|4.0|The story was wonderfully exciting with fantasy that thrilled my mind and kept me wanting more and wondering what was going to happen next.  The characters were interesting, the plot lovely.  However it is contraversial to those of us who are christian, however it is a wonderful story.
0380789035|5.0|This book is extremely well written. Shadow is an incredible complex and interesting protagonist. I'm only about halfway through it, but I really love it. Every character has an astounding fullness and personality... there isn't one character you don't get a firm sense of, no matter how short their appearance is. This is a MUST read for anyone who loves a good read.
0375703764|5.0|If you like reading, and thinking, and expanding your vocabulary, (and, I should probably add, expanding your mind) then House of Leaves is a book you want to read.  Most of the negative reviews I read here said either House of Leaves \\"had nothing to say,\\" or \\"the story is boring.\\"    To claim that House of Leaves has nothing to say is to spit in the face of art.  All art is interpretive; House of Leaves will show you things about yourself that maybe you didn't want to think about.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but it was the case for me.  Danielewski went to great lengths to make sure the narrative was fractured and disjointed, so if people don't understand it, it is either because they didn't want to put in the effort, or because they don't possess the capacity to see the fascinating overlapping and interweaving of metaphors, symbols, and allegories (not to mention characters, events, and times).    This book really does everything extraordinarily.  I think many people who were disappointed by House of Leaves' plot were horror fans looking for a little mindless death.  Serious, thinking people will be intrigued by the expanding house, the descent of Johnny, Navidson's perspective and motivations, and Zampano's brilliant and insane interludes.  The bizarre, dark plot matches the tone - and, somehow, even the symbolism - perfectly.    If you usually read John Grisham, Sue Grafton, J. K. Rowling, James Patterson, Stephen King, Dan Brown, etc. this book may not be for you.  These authors are great, but provide little more to the reader than television; they are the literary equivalent of a \\"popcorn movie.\\"  Enjoyment of this novel takes time and energy.  But I would advise anyone to give it a try.  The fruits of your labor may be worth more than you can imagine.
B0000019PA|5.0|\\"Magnificent.\\"  I cannot think of a better word or a better use for that word.  Aeroplane is crazy, inspired and transcendent.  It is an exercise in reorientation, an alien voice from an all-too real world.  At first your ears and your head will reel from the carnivalesque dissonance that seems at once intimate and threatening, and that denies you any comfortable point of reference ro repose.  And there you are, adrift in a sea of sounds foreign and familiar, and you have no choice but to float and puzzle your way out of the din of sound and poetry...and when you do, when you finally feel the edges of this album's space you can only cry...and smile.  And that is what I do each and every time I listen to this masterpiece.
B000V9KFLY|4.0|I like the CD.  Celine is nice and mellow for Christmas.  I didn't know there was also a DVD included.  I was surprised to see that there are different songs on the DVD.  They are not the same ones as on the Christmas CD.
B000LYSFV6|5.0|As if the title couldn't tell you that, this is big, bombastic, and arty. It is also the ultimate test of endurance for Pumpkins fandom. Do you think you can sit through over two hours of Pumpkins? That's right, two hours. That's a lot of Billy. And let's be fair, a couple of these tracks really fade to the background. There's nothing wrong per se with \\"In the Arms of Sleep\\", but it's kind of forgettable and unfortunately comes in between my two favorite songs on the entire album: the New Wave-influenced smash \\"1979\\", one of the best singles in history; and the gorgeous \\"Thirty-Three\\", one of the few subtle songs in the Pumpkins catalogue. Just a couple keyboards, vocals, and maybe a bass if you listen closely enough. But hey, that's all it needs, right? Right. Or at least to convey what was supposed to be conveyed here. God, I love \\"Thirty-Three\\"! And \\"Galapagos\\", which is a lot like \\"Thirty-Three\\" and has a sweet guitar figure! So yeah, more to it than that, though. I can assure you that if you liked \\"Thirty-Three\\", the calming \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" (with vocals from the entire band) will be right down your alley too. And you'll definitely like \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", one of their graceful, poetic, big, in-your-face, orchestrated ballads in the grand tradition of \\"Disarm\\". Complete with the huge climax. \\"Cupid De Locke\\" is more or less its little brother - not as good of a song, but hey, I like it regardless. Can't forget the piano instrumental title track, either, one of the most beautiful songs in history. On the other hand, if tastes favor the loud, angry, distorted, ragin', rockin' Pumpkins, there is a whole ton of that. You probably know the raging \\"Zero\\" (an epic condensed into three minutes - \\"I'm in love with my sadness\\" and all that) and the era-defining \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" (though I find the lyric \\"Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage!\\" embarrassing self-parody - even then, it sure is catchy), with powerful dynamics and a shocking coda. But of course hard rock is just an integral part of the Pumpkins sound, and no Pumpkins album would be complete without a dollop of it (except for Adore). \\"X.Y.U.\\" is seven minutes of that, randomly flipping between slow industrial grind and scorching thrash, all with Billy's cookie-monster vocals and excessively profane lyrics. I think it's a cool song, though, even though the a capella scream is ludicrous - the grinding industrial segment has one solid riff, and the thrash part has a lot of emotional thrust to it. Still, if you're the kind of casual fan who only bought this for \\"1979\\", you might want to skip over it. Other excellent rockers include the innocuously titled \\"Fudge (Only I didn't say fudge!) You (An Ode to No One)\\"; the blazing, near-poetic \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\"; the fantastic angst of \\"Bodies\\"; the disturbingly enthusiastic \\"Here is No Why\\", and \\"Jellybelly\\", which uses odd guitar tones to its advantage. But this is no mere two-dimensional album! Oh no. Not at all. You see, there comes a time in every band's life when they branch out, and the Pumpkins did so here. You have two out-and-out, full-blown, unahashed progressive rockers (\\"Porcelina of Oceans Vast\\"; \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\") with titles that names like \\"Epitaph (including March for No Reason, Tomorrow and Tomorrow, and King Crimson's first album is really really good even though I'm mocking it)\\" seem humble and charming. \\"Porcelina\\" is really catchy, has a great structure, and amazingly it's actually subtle prog (*gasps* *backs up against the wall* *eats food*); and \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\" has a really great buildup and ends up something completely different from what it started as. I won't tell you what, because you have to listen to that song if you like the group at all. It's simple. And some of the experimenting is not progressive at all! They also do music hall twice, and not only do they not embarrass themselves on \\"Lily (My One and Only)\\" and \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\", those are two of my favorite songs on the album! They also pull \\"Beautiful\\" out of left field. It's a precursor to \\"Adore\\" - very electronic, almost (though not quite) techno. Again, I love that one. \\"You're beautiful, like the sun...\\". \\"By Starlight\\" is the only favorite left unmentioned, thanks to its buildup (ballad to loud rocker) - there are a couple of other nice songs here too, like \\"To Forgive\\" and \\"Stumbeleine\\", but you'd be insane to discuss all 28 tracks in any amount of depth. Though I think it's cool how the quiet, unpretentious \\"Stumbeleine\\" comes right after \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\" and right before \\"X.Y.U.\\". The lone bomb is \\"Tales of Scorched Earth\\", which in fact sucks ruthlessly. Feedback and anger do not mix. It sounds awful. And it's right between \\"1979\\" and \\"Ruby\\". That really blows. But twenty-seven good songs of twenty-eight, twenty-four of them fantastic and twenty-two of them amongst my absolute favorite Pumpkins songs? (with \\"Bullet\\", \\"Thirty-Three\\", \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" and \\"1979\\" all being in the top ten?), and five of the decade's best singles? That is pretty good!hose are two of my favorite songs on the album! They also pull \\"Beautiful\\" out of left field.

B000K7VHPU|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this movie. It is one of those movies, that had enough attraction to keep me in the seat and watch it, but afterwards I felt somewhat flat, as it didn't give anything deeper to ponder. Edward Norton from Fightclub played well, though his character in the movie was much of an enigma.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Although no true Gilmore Girls lover wanted it to ever end, it is a most enjoyable season.  You can tell the difference in writers, however, the characters are as endearing as ever.  Go on the roller-coaster ride that previously enthralled you for the past six seasons.  Cannot wait until the family reunion/Rory marriage and baby or Christmas special for the Gilmore Girls.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a great album.  I wish Linkin Park's most recent album would be more this style of music.  Plus, the entire album is good.  It's not like one of those you get for just 1 or 2 songs.  Every single song is awesome.

B000ULQV0W|4.0|This album is amazing. It's what you'd expect to hear from Vedder, when he is free from the stress of his fast paced day job. I've heard all there is to hear from pearl jam and was pleasantly surprised upon giving this album a first listen. The music, which is beautiful in its utter simplicity, is deep, contemplative, and insightful. After all my years and years of listening to pearl jam, suddenly, I feel I now know Vedder better than I ever have. He obviously poured a lot of himself into these songs. He made this album not to rock us in the traditional pearl jam sense, but to evoke thought and feeling. This music was intended to take us all away from our busy lives for a few moments of simplicity and peacefulness. Close your eyes when you listen to this CD and pretend that you are far away from society somewhere untouched and beautiful. This music will take you there.
B0000CAXID|5.0|Dave Grohl's entrance into the next phase of his career (following Nirvana's untimely demise) is a wonderfully eclectic and melodic collection of alt tracks that pioneered the genre.  Testament not only to Grohl's vision but his unparalleled talents, this album was fast-tracked and multi-tasked by the Man in a few short days (in which he played each instrument and provided vocals himself).  The genius of the album is in the rich melodies of pieces like X-Static, Exhausted, Alone + Easy Target, I'll Stick Around, et al that take a moment to process but that form a cohesive train of notes you'll find bellowing from your pipes over and over again.  It's not often (quite rare indeed) that you find eclecticism to this extent working in a mainstream arena and being this catchy; that's what makes this Dave Grohl's tome and an amazing work in modern popular music.    Big Me - 60s gumball/do-wop-type goodness  Floaty - Just as the name describes, airy, light-hearted meandering.  This is a Call - Great opener, anthemic \\"call\\" to a new era in alt/punk moshing  Exhausted - I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this song...such a great introspective tune with a melody that wanders but comes back full circle and takes you on a fulfilling journey.
0805079831|4.0|**FYI** Please note to the best of my knowledge I am NOT related to Naomi Klein.**<br /><br />If you wonder what happened to the middle class, why poverty is on the rise and what the economies in a democracracy, dictatorship and \\"communism\\" have in common, you'll find lots of food for thought in Naomi Klein's THE SHOCK DOCTRINE. Tracing the rise of the \\"Chicago Boys\\" laissez-faire economic beliefs, their impact on South America, China, Russia, Poland and South Africa and how it impacted their form of government, Klein makes a compelling argument for the flaws in Milton Friedman's economic science.<br /><br />Naomi Klein's book looks at the conflict between Milton Friedman's \\"laissez-faire\\" approach to business and government where business is largely unregulated running itself and government is little more than a bare bones system. According to Klein, Friedman believed that the economic theories he espoused would be perfect and that any problems with it would be due to outside forces interferring with his free market world. His approach was in complete contrast to Keynes who believed that the prime mission of politicians and economists was to prevent unemployment and avoid a depression or recession by regulating the market place. People like John Kenneth Galbraith (heir to Keynes' mantle)believed part of the purpose of economic regulation was to keep our captalist system fair and prevent a small group of businesses from dominating the market. Galbraith also believed in bills like the Glass-Steagall act which created a firewall between Wall Street and various banking institutions (which former President Clinton helped to eliminate). The net result would be to prevent recreating disasters like the Great Depression and 1929 stock market crash (the current version of which contributed to part of the economic mess we're in today).<br /><br />It's the conflict between these two economic philosphies that allows our economic world to thrive. You'll have to decide for yourself how accurately she reflects each man's philosphy based on what you know about each respective philosphy but I found, for the most part, that the book gave a pretty accurate summation of the benefits and issues at the core of each, as well as which classes benefit the most.<br /><br />Klein suggests that \\"disaster capitalism\\", i.e., introducing radical changes in terms of economic and government policy when a country is in \\"shock\\" (taking advantage of the fact that massed resistence is unlikely to that change), is allowing the rise of unchecked multi-national corporations that take advantage of and damage our society in the process. She suggests that Friedman's beliefs that the market will manage itself and that free market capitalism undermined the Soviet Union is an idealized and naive belief. The impact for good and bad is that a business functions like a plant. If it receives too much sunlight and water, it will overgrow and strangle out everything else in the economic ecosystem. The net result would cause the system to become unbalanced with human suffering and economic disaster as the result if left unchecked. She traces a parallel path between the rise of Friedman's economic philosphy and the rise of human rights violations, rise and fall of various governments throughout the world and the opportunism of the business world to exploit it.<br /><br />She ties all of this together looking at the economic policies and beliefs that are reshaping American society--for good and bad--into a different society where the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to expand and one where the free market society is being radically retooled. The result is a society where the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer. The pressured middle class continues to shrink. This undermines the foundation of our economic growth. This book will probably divide those along the more extreme political lines but has the ring of truth nevertheless.<br /><br />Klein crafts a fascinating book. Although some of her observations might be a bit of a stretch and her arguments occasionally flawed, she provides compelling evidence to support her thesis and connects the dots of events that might otherwise appear to be unrelated. Whether or not you agree with Klein or are outraged by her evidence, you'll find plenty of food for thought in her book.ng book.

0805079831|5.0|Naomi Klein demonstrates that in totally unconstrained capitalism, the richest and least scrupulous do best.  Why?  They are able to eliminate government restraints and taxes and establish monopolies by pushing aside those with fewer resources and more self-restraint to make huge profits from charging everyone more and paying poor people less.  This result has occurred consistently in Latin America, Asia, and now Iraq whenever a country needs an international loan from the United States or the international agencies that it dominates.<br /><br />As demonstrated in this book, the policy of the U.S. government has been to provide such an economic environment wherever possible.  This result is often accomplished by subverting democratic governments to put military dictators in power, supporting the dictatorships with the latest military toys and training in torture, and making the economic changes be permanent so that later democracies cannot change them.<br /><br />With the Bush administration, the policy has been accelerated to include direct invasions such as occurred in Iraq.  The effect of these policies has been worsened by the Bush doctrine of outsourcing as many military and government functions as possible to high-priced private firms without holding them accountable for results.<br /><br />The effect has been to subject nation after nation to widespread murder and abuse of citizens who don't agree with the economic policies, sale of valuable businesses and resources at way below market rates to rich companies and people, and to reduce economic activity levels by depression-standard amounts for 10-20 years.<br /><br />Only recently have people interested in placing democratic interests above those who wealthy companies and people begun to strike back by refusing to accept U.S. policy when it comes to requiring unfettered capitalism.<br /><br />The latest application of this U.S. policy is to use natural disasters to produce similar results as we observed after the Asian tsunami and hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.<br /><br />The intellectual fig leaf for this doctrine belongs to Milton Friedman and his academic heirs from the University of Chicago and the University of California at Berkeley.  The economic analysis behind these ideas seems to have never considered the way to implement the ideas.  Instead with each new powerless country or group, the limits of rapid change are pushed harder.  Why?  It's really a class war of the ultra rich who can buy politicians and put them in office who need something to tell everyone else about why it's all a good idea.  Naive economists make good front men for this effort.<br /><br />When democracies work well, there's pendulum of public opinion that eventually swings well away from any extreme.  Well, we are at such an extreme now in favor of letting the powerful grab whatever they want . . . as demonstrated in this fine book.  I hope the pendulum swing will begin soon!<br /><br />The main weakness of this book is in repeating its arguments a little too much without providing enough new evidence each time.  The evidence is there, but the better stories are actually in the second half.  If you feel in the beginning that Milton Friedman is being run down too much, wait.  You'll eventually be convinced that Friedman's ideas had all of the appropriateness of Marx's on how to run a country to create a healthy society for all.

0399150331|1.0|Most of the major writers of crime fiction get away with sloppy plotlines and mailed-in characterizations just as long as their base readership gets to see the same characters as in the book before. The Last Precinct is no exception. I was so bored that I simply could not slog through the whole thing. Too bad; if this one has even  been remotely readable I might have moved on to Cornwell's other work. If you want to read a thriller with a little heart, pick up any of Michael Connelly's work, or one of relative newcomer Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novels. You owe it to yourself not to support lazy writing.

0380788624|4.0|This large, sprawling book was a pleasure to read for all 900+ pages.  That said, some editing could have tightened the story, eliminated some needless scenes, and otherwise improved this reader's experience.  However, there are numerous scenes that will forever be a part of my literary mosaic.  When Bobby Shaftoe, one of several principle characters, is interviewed as a war hero by Ronald Reagan, I dare you not to audibly betray your amusement.  Likewise, the death scene of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto is a classic.    While some other reviewers appear to be put off by some of the discussion of crypanalysis, I was not.  The discussions were not overly taxing and, generally, were part of the appeal of the book, to mention nothing of their assistance in understanding key plot points.  The technical discussions are emphatically not parts of the book that should have been edited down.    Of course, if you do not find both interesting and humorous a character's attempt to divide the property of the recently deceased via a mathematically sound, complex, and fair method (involving more complex math than was fully explained or than I could comprehend if it had been), then perhaps this is not your cup of tea.  Similarly, if you found Catch-22's Yossarian boring and do not like Vonnegut's humor, then, again, this may not be the book for you.  I found the book uproarously funny.    The biggest quibble I have with this book is the ending.  Generally, the last hundred pages or so were not as engaging as the previous 800.  The end itself was, in my opinion, quite weak and contained a few plot holes.  Major questions remain unanswered and the resolution of those that are answered was less denouement than deflation.  Stephenson seems to have hit a point where he had to wrap things up or write another several hundred pages.  He wisely chose the former, but failed to create an ending as enjoyable and original as the rest of the book.    In all, there are extremely memorable characters,a number of highly original, funny, and entertaining scenes, and bucket loads of geeky facts and plot points.  The book is a classic of the genre, if, indeed, it has not created or defined a new genre.    I highly recommend this book.
1582701709|1.0|Hello all,     My name is Caroline; I'm with a media production company in Baltimore.  I think folks who are interested in The Secret's core concepts, but feel that the book falls short will be interested in our project.    The Euphoria Stream is a video blog made by Lee Boot, who asks the question: In a country built for the pursuit of happiness, is it working? Are you happy?  It's an \\"art-documentary\\" about what makes you (personally) happy.  Positive thinking lies at the core of the films, however we believe that the concept is complex and action-based, and need not be limited to personal gain.  Backing up theories with neuroscience and biological knowledge doesn't hurt either!  The Euphoria Stream is a new sort of media, and we hope it's thought provoking and meaningful.  Anyway, if you have a minute, check out The Euphoria Stream (and if you are feeling so inspired, it would be great if you would leave a comment on the site telling us what you think!)

B0000009SG|5.0|For nearly as long as I can remember, I have known of Frank Zappa and his trademark facial hair. I had seen his face and heard of him, although nobody ever really reccomended a specific album to start on. One day during college, a friend of mine bought me the \\"Baby Snakes\\" DVD, which is focused on \\"people that do things that aren't normal\\". I attempted to watch the DVD and after about an hour, turned it off very confused. The DVD would then follow me for two years, with only one more attempted viewing just to show a friend how far out it was.    Two years later and I was a junior in college. I was talking about music with my roomate and mentioned how I had heard great things about Frank Zappa, although was never able to find that album to make me a fan. He mentioned he had one Zappa CD, Overnite Sensation, and that it had \\"Zombie Woof\\" on it. (A song we had both heard covered by a band called Pork Tornado, with Phish guitarist Jon Fishman) He put in the CD and I was a fan of two songs. Dinah-Moe Hum and Zombie Woof. I purchased the CD at a used record store, listened to it a few times, and put it into my CD case.    A few more months go by & I continue to occasionally play this CD. Slowly I begin to absorb more of the tracks and realize the complex compositions of each song. Gradually over the course of three years, this became one of my top listened to albums. Soon I fell in love with every track (Especially Montana) & became increasingly interested in Zappa. I have since re-watched Baby Snakes and found it very amusing now that I understand more about Zappa and his humor. (Poodles?)    I am in the process of building up my collection of Zappa albums, and mkany of them take the same approach as Over-Nite Sensation. I will get the album, be confused, like a song or two, and re-listen to it until I can wrap my head around the complex composition of the notes and the trademark Zappa humor.    Zappa has a lot of albums that are all very different. Many of his albums also have songs that are completely different from one another. He can be a difficult artist to \\"get into\\". It took me nearly five years to realize \\"Hey, I'm a huge Zappa fan and need to hear as much of his music as possible!\\". If you start at the wrong place (like Baby Snakes) you may be turned off by his strangeness. If you start at the right place, you may (eventually) be amazed by his genius.    Buy this album, listen to Zombie Woof & Camarillo, then slowly explore the other tracks on the albums. I'm really glad I took Zappa 101 during my Junior year in college.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This movie has long been a favorite of mine because of its charm, its simplicity and sweetness, and its message that sometimes the comforts of the conventional need some shaking up.  With gentle humor, engaging characters, and some truly lovely scenes, the movie strives to show that breaking out of the mold isn't always a bad thing.    Babe longs to be a sheepdog and his quest makes for an excellent metaphor about following one's dreams and being true to one's self regardless of the opposition.  Perhaps the most wonderful thing about the movie is that Babe triumphs not because of his ambition or his ruthlessness but because of his sweetness and his genuinely nice nature.  It is his politeness and his considerateness that helps him to emerge victorious in the end and when couldn't the world use a little more kindness?  This is an ageless and wonderful message that is well worth sharing with children.    James Cromwell is simply wonderful in this movie.  Though a man of few words, he expresses so much just by the look on his face.  One of the best scenes in the film, though, occurs when the farmer dances a jig to try to cheer up his little pig.  It's wonderful to see the tenderness he develops for his little pig and their devotion to one another says a lot about the nature of true friendship.  There are mishaps and misunderstandings but, in the end, the two succeed because they remain faithful and loyal to one another.      All in all, this is one of those rare family films that both children and adults can enjoy.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|This classic motion picture returns, 25 years later, looking better and sounding better too.  Remastered, this DVD has better audio and video than what was seen on the silver screen when it was first released. They did not have 5.1 surround sound back then.  To top it off, the DVD comes in a classic jacket, and I do mean jacket, leather with metal zippers and snaps with \\"T\\" Birds painted on the back. The kids of today even enjoy this timeless picture. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John bring out the best in each other in this musical full of fun, nostalgia and great song and dance.

B000002UB2|5.0|Numerous other reviews indicated that the second side of this record was one of the best pieces of recorded music in Rock history. I agree. The medley which smoothly transitions from one song to the next, including reprise themes throughout, demonstrates the band's writing and arrangement ability.   All four members have a vocal solo on the first side of the record, and the various song styles present a dynamic musical contribution to Rock music.    Listening to the record, fine little details are more audible than on the CD edition of this album. The large artwork and the effort required to maintain the vinyl provide a more personal experience with the music for the listener.  I find it more likely to listen to an album on vinyl in its entirety than I would if it were in a digital format, where shuffling and other \\"features\\" obscure the original artist's presentation.

B000021XS0|2.0|This may be the most overrated prog album of all time -- presumably because of DT's international popularity and the title reference to an incredible track off of the band's masterful second album.  Formulaic and uninspired, four listens of Metropolis is all I could stomach, each time fighting yawns and torpor.  There are a couple of very good tracks (none of which would make it onto my DT Best of), but as a whole, this CD serves as a dust collector in my music collection.  Labrie's vocals and histrionics are strained, irritating, and unconvincing throughout.  The plot is sophomoric, Portnoy's percussion is predictable (as usual), and even the fabulous Petrucci doesn't manage to deliver significant crunch or his usual stupefying riffs and leads.  I'd say the highlight is the contribution by Jordan Rudess.  The Dream Theater catalog features some of the great releases in prog metal (including arguably the most influential of all time in \\"Images and Words\\").  This is not one of them.  Ignore the conformist hype and seek some interesting and innovative metal instead.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I find this film to be inspiring.  Here we have a man, whom most of us had never heard of, following his ideals of making a better society despite a very long struggle and countless setbacks.  The actors, on the whole, give very good performances with small bits of comic relief being supplied by Rufus Sewell as Thomas Clarkson and the actor (whose name escapes me) who portrayed Wilberforce's butler.  Despite the heavy subject matter, the film manages to give us an historical snapshot of a situation we generally know little about, without being depressing or overly preachy.  In illustrating the impact that one person can have, the film gives cause for hope.  The film is both informative and inspirational.

But, I suppose it's 'standard coin purse size', so I don't mind that much. Overall, I love mine and use it all the time!<br />:)

B0000CDL93|4.0|Once Donald Sutherland starts talking he goes on and on. And the first hour of the movie could use a little more action. But the cast is great and the main points are convincingly made. If you choose to believe Oswald acted alone, then the question is why? Just the incoherent act of a madman? Whatever. The bigger question is what happened to the age of assasination? It was over relatively quickly. Could it be because the people responsible finally got the kind of country they wanted? A country where no one gets elected without the backing of big corporate money and Washington acts at the behest of big corporate money or it doesn't act at all.

The movie focuses specifically on the days that followed Diana's death.  A surprisingly compact film that gives one a relatively intimate look at the royal family without delving too deeply into the emotions.  Prince Philip and the Queen Mother are presented as the most callous figures in this film, while Prince Charles agonizes over the impact Diana's death will have on the family, particularly \\"the boys,\\" which are seen only from the back and not mentioned by name.  Meanwhile, the Queen is torn between protocol and what appear to be her own emotions regarding Diana's death.<br /><br />Your opinion of the monarchy after the tragedy of Diana won't be swayed much one way or the other by this movie as Stephen Frears plays it pretty close to the hip.  About the only thing new is the apparent feelings of Tony Blair in regard to the monarchy, doing his best to advise the royal family of the impact the death of Diana was having on the British people at the time, and getting them to come out of their sequestered Balmoral estate, where most of the action takes place.  Michael Sheen offers an uncanny performance as Blair, capturing his character to a tee.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I think this album is great. I'm not shocked though. Britney always do great stuff for us fans. This album is filled with dance songs. The beats are amazing. Personally, 'Gimme More' is the best song in that album. I'm so addicted to this album I can't stop listening to it. You really should get it.
0930289234|5.0|This is the book that got me into graphic novels. Never before did I think a graphic novel was capable of something like this, but Watchmen achieves something that would only be possible in the graphic novel format. My expectations were absurdly high when I first started reading it, and somehow they were exceeded. Bravo to Alan Moore for creating such a perfect piece of fiction.
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|yeah, there were a couple of gimmicky scenes that kindof worked (casino evasion, diner) that others have detailed.    the end product, though, was a mish-mash of all kinds of unrealized potential followed by a completely non-sensical ending.    THINK ABOUT THIS:  frank was only able to see into the future of the terrorist plot because the terrorists involved Jessica Biel's character in their plans as a hostage (what was her character's name again?  who cares?).  the whole rewind plot-twist at the end has Cage taking Jessica Biel out of the equation in the \\"re-do\\" scenario, which would short-circuit his ability to see into the terror plot's future.  i guess L.A. is gonna be bummed...    VERY UNSATISFYING.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Seriously, I can't remember ever liking a show as much as I did this one. Some people might seem repulsed by the idea of this show, and think they could never symmpathize with a serial killer, but after about half of the episodes in this season, you will absolutely love Dexter. He may be a killer, but he is a hero. The ending left my jaw dropped(literaly), and I am hardly ever shocked by anything I see on tv. If you're looking for a well written, well acted, ridiculusly entertaining show, then you've found. Do yourself a favor and go out and buy this dvd. You will not regret it. Trust me.
0765348276|5.0|What a great idea and what a great book.  I devoured it in one day.  It has great science, fast action, likable characters and has become one of my favorite books of all time.  This is a 'must read' for any fiction fan.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|First off. I loved Unhallowed, I thought that was a great metal album. It was just pretty straight up quasi-death metal. Unfortunately I did not like Miasma for the exception of the title track. I felt that it just was not very metal. I felt like they wrote this album as if they were a hardcore band looking for some laughs. Similarly the music was just kind of chugging along and nothing really stood out.    Then came Nocturnal. Right from the get go this album has some amazingly diverse riffs. The only song I do not care for is Virally Yours. I feel this  could have been on miasma because it is not too original and just kind of chugs along. Nocturnal and To a Breathless Oblivion are my two favorite tracks.     Alot of fanboys are getting pissed off because the album is too \\"metal\\". like 'oh god they are acting like behemoth or something ahhh pentagrams and songs about zombies and killing'. well for those true metal fans such as myself, this is a bonus and is what made me give BDM a second chance in the first place. Each song is truly metal and offers something original.     As for the song presentation itself. It is truly great. They really put forth a good effort on this album. Just listen to To a Breathless Oblivion and you will know what I am talking about. So Thank you BDM for this great album. Just 4 stars because i felt it was a little short. The album is kind of over before you know it. But that doesn't change the fact that the music and the vibe is incredible.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Definitely one of the top, if not even the best, release of 2007. Although it's a different style of music, 'Little Voice' had the same impact on me than the '93 Counting Crows Release '[[ASIN:B000003TAP August and Everything After]]' which so far has been my favorite album. Listening to it for the first time, you'll recognize the song that you already know from the radio ('Love Song'). The rest of the album then fades to the background of whatever you're doing when you're first listening to it. Listening to it the second time, you pick up on great tracks such as 'Gravity', 'Fairytale', 'City' or 'Between the Lines' and every time you listen to them, they become better and better - they still do after listening to them countless times on the way to and from work. I've been watching a couple of live-clips from Sara on the web and have to say, that I'm even more impressed with her ability to perform these songs on stage. Looking forward to seeing her live in early 2008 as part of the VH1 You Oughta Know Tour - You really ought to know Sara! :-)
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|I truly enjoy listening to this album. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. I wanted the edited version, and fortunately, explicit words have been muted out of the songs. The only downside is that a few words were left in the songs for a couple of tracks. Still, the CD is good, and I['m satisfied.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|Hi.  I purchased this DVD, and when I went to play it there was no sound. All throughout the video I can see everything clearly, but there was - no sound!  I thought perhaps it was my DVD player (even though it is an old DVD player, it plays other DVD well).  So I then purchased a brand new DVD player, and I slipped the disk in.  Still no sound.  I was not a happy camper.  I saw the refund requirement and saw no open DVD can be returned. And so here I am writing this letter.  I wrote to them about my concern the day this happen.  I haven't heard from them. I hope Amazon will see this on there review and contact me and try to help me with an exchange.  I hope none of you are having this problem... Nevertheless I am clueless in what to do next... perhaps \\"MySpace\\"

061891868X|5.0|Lee Smolin has written a thorough and readable book about the fact that string theory has dominated physics for more than twenty years without nailing down the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that we all anxiously await.<br />His conclusion: \\"There needs to be an honest evaluation of the wisdom of sticking to a research program that has failed after decades to find grounding in either experimental results or precise mathematical formulation.\\"<br /><br />String theory in its various permutations became a hot topic in academic physics from around the mid-1980s, but by the end of the 1990s it had been suggested that all the conjectured and constructed string theories might be unified in a deeper (and mysterious) theory called M-theory.<br /><br />According to Lee Smolin, the trouble with physics is not only that string theory may be wrong, but that its popularity has squelched innovative thinkers who wanted to take other directions within the field of physics. It became very hard for a physicist who was not interested in string theory to get a job. The academic and research communities simply did not provide jobs or grant money for physicists who disbelieved string theory or who wanted to pursue other avenues of research.<br /><br />Wading through the actual physics in Smolin's book was a bit of a chore for this English major, but the history he provides is interesting and his critique of academia is clear and convincing. His overall tone is positive and upbeat in spite of the profuse apologies he keeps making to his colleagues in string theory. He ends with suggestions as to how to move the study of physics forward in ways that are more intellectually diverse than they have been in the era of string theory.
0316666343|3.0|I am not sure why but this book fell flat for me pretty quickly. I didn't feel like I was there and I like to feel I am there when I read a story. From the look of the reviews it hit a nerve with a lot of people and I have to respect that. I just wasn't one of them. I also thought the concept was orgional and I like that in a story as well. All I can say is take a look and if you like it. Enjoy!
B000MG1ZFQ|3.0|Up to now the new remixes of the entire Doors catalogue has been an impressive success, with the first three albums coming back to life with great energy and sound quality. Now we come to what has always been considered The Doors' weakest album, \\"The Soft Parade,\\" which was produced when lead singer Jim Morrison was falling to his most depraved state, having just caused a nationwide controversy and even banning of the band, after \\"exposing himself\\" during a 1969 Miami concert. In a way this was one of the more anticipated remixes because it has always been despised by Doors fans for the original mix with horns and strings. As an album this is still a sappy, weak delivery that shows a band already exhausted of their original material and forced to write in the studio as limitations begin to show and the star, Morrison, is unreliable due to his consuming excesses. As a remix this is also the weakest of the new releases, only  a few songs comes across with a new, fresh air. The rest of the album sounds pretty standard, with better volume, but still nothing much else. \\"Tell All The People,\\" \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Shaman's Blues\\" all have better volume quality, but little improvement. The tracks that do stand out are \\"Wishful Sinful,\\" which now has more defined winds and strings and \\"The Soft Parade\\" which boasts some sharper sound effects, new vocals and impressive technical discoveries. One disappointment is \\"Wild Child,\\" the best cut in the album, which here sounds little different from previous releases. There is good skill in the playing, just not very good songs, or enough good songs. \\"Wild Child,\\" \\"Soft Parade\\" and even \\"Wishful Sinful\\" still stand strong, but a lot of the material comes across as just filler, which might explain why engineer Bruce Botnick had such a hard time finding an impressive mix here. This is the album the surviving Doors have always tride to vindicate, even the liner notes offer misleading lines about Morrison really liking the hit single \\"TouchMe,\\" eventhough every major biography points out that Morrison hated the overly sappy, bubble-gum pop tune. \\"Runnin' Blue\\" is bizarre country while \\"Tell All The People\\" sounds like revolution-light. There are moments such as \\"Do It\\" where Morrison's impressive skill for memorable words manages to somewhat transcend the glossy production values. The extras in the new remix album are also not too impressive. We get two songs that have already been released in earlier sets and worthless studio dialogue. \\"The Soft Parade\\" apparently just can't find a way to release itself from the distasteful position it has been embedded in since it was first released. Doors fans will want to still have this to complete the catalogue, but it remains a bad album with three notable contributions in its track list.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|This album is full of b-sides and rarities. There are some really cool songs on here! I'm very happy with this album.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|First off so called speed metal seems to favor continuous brain dead speedy guitar masturbation over actually creating songs that are in anyway memorable, interesting, or remotely good in any way. I think most listeners would agree that speed metal is generally unbearably boring after about 10 seconds. This album, however, is excellent throughout so it's obviously not speed metal. This album and Rust In Peace are the only two albums that I've heard by Megadeth that are worth a serious listen. I have not heard the remaster/remix versions of these albums, but this album is interesting enough to consider having both versions. One last thing, virtuoso players can not always be expected to subdue their amazing talents in the service of making a great song --- I get that --- but wouldn't be nice if they did it a little more often --- I mean, really, who in their right mind can listen to an entire Yngwie Malmsteen album straight through?
B00005JPRZ|5.0|This is the funniest movie I have ever seen!!!  Why isn't it on DVD yet?  It would make the perfect Christmas present for those who could use a good laugh.  I don't buy movies often, but this one is an exception.    There are plenty of reviews that tell what this movie was about, but I don't think the message is clear enough.  This movie made my husband and I laugh until our sides hurt and even after the credits rolled most of the people in the theatre just sat there, they didn't want to leave! I am confused by the world today where you enter a movie about fear, brutality and death (there are many examples) and the theatre is packed.  But yet a movie like this only had a handful of people and isn't out on DVD yet.      Bottom line, see it when you get the chance!
140120306X|3.0|I'll never forget when I first read The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  I knew Alan Moore was a god among men in the comic book world, but even I wasn't prepared for the majesty of his storytelling, the potency of his intelligence, or the power of his inspirational imagination.<br /><br />Thus, when news surfaced that a new League adventure called Black Dossier was in the works, I could not wait--COULD NOT WAIT--until its release.<br /><br />Finally, after more than a few delays, it was unbound, and while I won't say I'm disappointed in it, I don't love it as I did the other two League volumes.  That being said, I respect Moore all the ... more ... for Black Dossier.<br /><br />Alan Moore is not afraid to create art on his terms, and his terms alone.  While Black Dossier does not have the charismatic story or sheer excitement of its predecessors, it absolutely pushes the limits as to what has traditionally been accepted in comic books the last several decades.<br /><br />For example, Moore has said for quite a while he'd like to write a comic that made use of 3D glasses, and so Black Dossier does (no worries--glasses included).  There are postcards, comic strips (like in the newspapers), excerpts from single spaced files with handwritten notes upon them, unreleased editions of works written by popular authors or featuring well-known characters, and pamphlets.  Seventy-percent of this book literally duplicates the innards of a dossier.  I've never seen anything quite like it.<br /><br />Consequently, I feel I also must comment on the exorbitant amount of nudity in this book.  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen has always been a book for mature readers and on par with an R-rated movie.  Like every other aspect of Black Dossier, Moore and artist Kevin O'Neill challenge conventions, and I admire them for that.  However, even I found the level of nudity gratuitous.  For some characters, the nudity made perfect sense when looked upon in a historical light (of which Moore is an aficionado), but at times it seemed the nudity was thrown in for simple orneriness.  In other words, this is probably not a book you'll want your children to get hold of.  And if they're unfamiliar with Alan Moore and his rebellious inclinations, I also wouldn't expose it to your parents, husbands, wives, boyfriends, or girlfriends.<br /><br />Even so, because of the willingness of author Moore and artist O'Neill to put forth so much effort into an undeniable work of originality and fearlessness, they earned my unending respect.  However, I'd be lying if I said the nontraditional embellishments were enthralling.  True, they work in a roundabout way to complete the overall story, but in the end, taken as a whole, the story wasn't terribly interesting, and the accompaniments served as an impediment to an already deficient plot.  My disappointment originated from the impression that the plot served the concept, rather than the concept serving the plot.<br /><br />As an artist, I absolutely loved the boundaries Black Dossier annihilated and believe Moore and O'Neill should be looked upon as artistic liberators.  As a reader, though, I found Black Dossier dull and plodding.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:B000Z9VWI0 Dr. Nekros: The Tragedian (Volume I, Episode I)]]t seemed the nudity was thrown in for simple orneriness.

B000002UAU|5.0|Though I didn't grow up with the Beatles they are still one of my top 5 bands ever.  The breadth and variety of their music is amazing.  They could write their own music and sing it without the massive amount of studio editing that goes on these days.  This Album is one of their best though they are all good.  Sgt. Peppers is a more complete, polished, album than some of their earlier efforts and should be more generally accepted by today's audience than some of their earlier, but less sophisticated albums.
B000WCCUZO|3.0|These newbies are apparently striving for a new brand of rocktronica, mixing hardcore and technical metal with rave-style keyboards and sequencers. This might sound good on paper, but execution is another matter. Rather than forming a sound of their own, Enter Shikari have only created an awkward mash-up of incompatible styles. The rock side of the band is perfectly competent, with a strong backdrop of technical riffs, pummeling time shifts, high-flying doomy passages, and even some Cure-like trance balladry. But the problem is the band's electronic side, with very cheesy keyboard and synthesizer patterns that make the whole endeavor sound like overblown 80s arena metal, backed by a guy who can't stop playing with his electronic toys and delivered by a band that can't figure out how best to exercise its musical chops. This tendency is tragically apparent in misguided mini-epics like \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"Jonny Sniper,\\" while the four interludes are annoyingly undeveloped experiments in sequencing. The Enter Shikari sound would work better if the keyboard sound was more sinister and if the electronic beats were more integrated with what the human drummer is doing. They come close in \\"Mothership\\" and \\"Sorry, You're Not a Winner\\" but the sound just doesn't come together. Maybe this band will achieve life in the future, but so far they've only managed to force together incompatible components into a Frankenstein's monster that can't get up. [~doomsdayer520~]

B000MNP2KI|1.0|If the main character of this movie had been named anything else, it never would have been made--or if it had been, it would have lasted about a week in theaters and then disappeared.  While the acting is good, the actors have nothing to work with.  No plot, no worthwhile dialogue, nothing.  Someday, it would be interesting to see someone actually make a movie from the Ian Flemming books.  This movie borrows a Flemming title, two scenes (and a general idea of gambling though the particular card game has changed to \\"reflect modern sensibilities\\" I suppose).  The best part of this movie was the ending, but just because that meant it was over.
B000V2J5EY|3.0|I fail to see why Amazon can't package this collection better. On the record, \\"Who Do You Love's sections are not separated by silent spaces, but are segued together almost imperceptably, to make it one long piece of music. The way Amazon separates the sections is clumsy at best, and the breaks destroy the flow of the piece.   For those of us buying the album, at least, Mr. Bezos should provide the music as was originally presented.

0156030306|4.0|In \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", Keyes presents the story of Charlie Gordon, a mentally handicapped person who undergoes an operation to change him into a super-genius.  Throughout the novel, the story of Charlie's remarkable transformation is chronicled in a series of journal entries that Charlie pens himself, for as a test subject of this new experimental procedure, he is required to write down all his feelings and memories in a journal.  The architects of this groundbreaking operation, Nemur and Strauss, are affiliated with a prestigious college, Beekman.  As Charlie becomes more intelligent, we see the remarkable changes in him, not so much of the intellectual changes, but much more interestingly the emotional changes.    Keyes novel idea of presenting journal entries written by Charlie are unique and contribute to the mood of the novel.  In his earliest stages with an IQ of 68 we can read his entries as they are barely legible, with no punctuation, poor spelling, etc.  However, suddenly his writing improves and soon it has turned into poetic prose.  Through this unique style of writing, we are able to peer inside of Charlie's mind.  We are limited, of course, to what Charlie can see, but there are numerous flashbacks to his earlier life as the dimwitted Charlie.  Through these flashbacks, they eventually piece together a puzzle that answers some lingering questions that haunt the newly transformed Charlie.    The thing that struck me most about this novel was the contrast in Charlie's behavior and attitudes while he was mentally handicapped versus his role as a genius.  As a mentally handicapped young man, Charlie is likeable and friendly and has a boyish innocence about him (obviously, since he has the mental capacity of a seven year-old, at best).  Of course, he is taken advantage of by his supposed friends because of his ignorance, but Charlie seems happy and content.  However, as his intelligence increases, he soon sees these people for who they really are and becomes bitter.  Indeed, as Charlie reaches the apex of his intelligence, he becomes alienated and had no true friends.  His social interactions have become limited and he has become arrogant and self-centered.  True, he does find a sex partner, but his relationship with her is superficial and fleeting.  So the conclusion to be reached seems to be that a smiling, friendly, but mentally handicapped person is only that way because they are ignorant and don't know any better.  When that same person is given intelligence and all the burdens and stresses that go along with it, then the complex nature of rivalries and competition turns an otherwise likeable \\"moron\\" into an overbearing, unlikeable \\"genius.\\"     Overall, this is a fascinating book based on a hypothetical \\"what if\\".  True, the technology for this type of operation does not exist (and certainly did not exist in the 1960s when the novel was written), but this should not detract from the novel.  Indeed, Keyes has done a masterful job of portraying the human emotions and spirit of an individual as he goes through a startling transformation.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I passed on buying the individual episodes (or multiple episode) DVDs when they were first released, and then passed on buying the DVD sets that were released, but when this HD DVD set was released, I knew I was going to have a hard time passing.<br /><br />Cleaned up images, touched up (but not ruined or destroyed as Lucas did with Star Wars) special effects and prop images, and so many extras that a Trek fan could be busy for weeks watching all of the content on these discs.<br /><br />Besides the fairly high price tag (which isn't all that bad once you average the price out among the 10 Combo formatted - HD DVD on one side, DVD on the other - discs included in the set), my one real complaint is in the packaging, with a couple of nits to pick.<br /><br />First, since the discs are combo discs, there's no 'face' to the discs with episodes noted on that face.  Instead there's a set of plastic cards that fit into the neat-o Trek type case.  Ummm, ok.  I can buy that, but... the cards all came in one little sealed plastic package that was inside the bigger package.  I guess it is assumed that the cards will not slide around that way.  Buyer must open the set of plastic cards themselves and then insert back into the neat-o Trek type case.<br /><br />The discs themselves are kept in a book type clear plastic casing with a binding on one edge.  The plastic book that holds the disc folds open for access to the discs in the set.  Unfortunately there's no plastic cover over the top most disc (disc 1).  That means if you aren't careful, as you take the book type case out of the bigger package you'll be fingerprinting the DVD side of disc 1. D'oh!  The back of the inside plastic case does have a plastic cover so you won't be touching the HD DVD side of disc 10.  I wish that the 'pages' of the inside plastic case each had a copy of the plastic cards discussed above, or at least had some documentation about what is on the discs in those slots of the case.  Again, something that would be much bigger and more visible to show me what episodes are on which disc.<br /><br />One final nit -- while the menu system is fairly intuitive, I am somewhat disappointed that there's no written notes in the package that tell the buyer of the various extras and options that are available.  There are some fairly cool extras there, and I fear I might miss something I'd want to see just from not knowing it's there.  Poor job of marketing the final product for customers.<br /><br />On the actual images of the episodes on the HD DVD sides of these discs, beautiful.  Simply beautiful. Nice clean images that are bright and sharp.  Nice use of the pillar bar areas for showing icons noting extras that are available at various points while watching the episodes.  Nice picture and picture splits for showing commentary information alongside the original episodes.  About the only thing missing that I could speak of is the commercials that used to pop-up at the moments of maximum drama while watching these episodes.  Expensive HD DVD set, but well worth it for this Trek fan.isible to show me what episodes are on which disc.

B00000J7SS|5.0|What do we know for sure about Bitches Brew? It's history; who, when, how. It's legacy on the landscape of music. It's innovation: for the first time, a jazz album had been essentially \\"created\\" in the studio, in post-production editing. Bitches Brew is a lot of things. But when it comes to this primordial ooze, this music, the factual matters of its existence will only ever scratch its surface. If we know anything about Miles' demon child, its that its meaning continues to shape-shift in the collective consciousness of all those who hear.           Recorded in the days following Woodstock, quite literally before the smoke could settle, trumpeter Miles Davis, along with his conspirator, producer Teo Macero, were ready to change the world. They gathered the best musicians, known and unknown, all at the height of their creative powers, and then proceeded to summon monsters from the abyss out of them.              Along side Miles, to name a few, were Wayne Shorter on sax and Benny Maupin on bass clarinet. There was Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul and Larry Young on Bass. Look, there, it's Dave Holland, and he's playing the bass. There we some drummers too, Lenny White, Billy Cobham, and Jack DeJohnette. Oh yeah, and some freak of nature from the UK on guitar. His name's John McLaughlin. All of these people and more went into the recording studio with Miles on those long august nights, and yet none of them played on the album.  Not a note. Under Miles Davis' voodoo running spell, each one of them was transformed into something that bears almost no resemblance to how we would recognize them.          No one is really sure how, but Miles, in all his genius, created an album with some of the most talented artists ever assembled, and made them completely irrelevant. Each musician was allowed to walk through a door Davis had discovered; a path where atonality fuses with tonality, where form gives its modest shape to noise, where descriptions analysis are made irrelevant.And after stepping through this frightening door, the 'players' on the album cease to exist.            I use the word, \\"frightening,\\" with intent. You can hear the fear. Fear of being in a strange new world, almost in disbelief. These musicians had no choice but to surrender who they were. Through that surrender, came power, and ambition. They all saw something in that studio, they heard something being transmitted to them; and like gazebo music played under the bright sun of an alien home world, they jammed.         So what is it that I am going on about? Is any of what I say real? Does this have any merit in the realm of critique, where one is supposed to remain as an objective tool for discernment? Well, yes and no. This is only MY story, and for every person who experiences this album, they'll have theirs.  But, I tell you: as Benny Maupin squeals in the night for some sort of salvation, crying against the rough wind of two arguing demons on keyboard, all the while being taunted by a disturbed and sadistic John McLaughlin, and suddenly Wayne Shorter appears out of nowhere, 12 minutes into the \\"Pharaoh's Dance,\\" to stop the world in its misguided tracks- that, I tell you, is magic.           Bitches Brew has been called one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last half-century, in any artistic form. This statement, objectively, is true. For me, Bitches Brew has re-defined what \\"art\\" even is; anything that exists so powerfully, that can create and then build its own universe inside of you, no matter who you are, to then further propagate its own life. Bitches Brew is not art, it is alive.    J
0596009208|3.0|I am an English teacher by profession but I've always wanted to learn a programming language in order to be able to build simple interactive exercises for my students. I have a working knowledge in Visual Basic and JavaScript in which I've been working for the last couple of years. Not knowing where to start with Java, I picked this book based on the numerous positive comments and the fact that it is considered to be a beginner's book. However, my overall impression so far, I've covered the first five chapters, is that like some other programming books I've seen it teaches you about Java, but not Java. What I mean is that it gives you the description of the tools but it hardly tells you where, when and how to use these tools. Probably these are left to the reader to figure out. Now in my opionion this is too heavy a burden for a begginer who needs guidance all along. In my opinion, it's a bit like teaching foreign languages. Giving just grammar rules is never enough. Just as important, if not more, is to to provide situations where these rules are put to use.
630521610X|5.0|'Scream' is a fantastic horror film, which brought post-modern thought into movies about movies, to the masses. From the opening scene, you realise this film is going to go down in history as a classic. Well-written by Kevin Williamson (Dawson's Creek, I know what you did last summer), brilliantly directed by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm St, Red Eye) and acted beautifully (Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell) - any horror fan should love it.  The scariest thing about this film is that it puts you in the characters point of view, for example - the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore playing Casey Becker is breath-taking. Casey is aware of horror films, and is a horror fan, so when she is victimised by the Ghostface (the killer), she says what we're thinking, putting us in her shoes. The acting and script in this opening 15 mins is amazing, and given that Drew was offered the main role, and turned it down for this role, that alone should tell you how worthy it is of cinema masterpiece, plus it's truly terrifying.   The film then plays out as a thriller/horror with lots of comedic jokes and self referential themes thrown in. We then have the audience trying to decipher who the killer is. The characters are well written, and the film plays out perfectly. This was the movie that started the craze of ninties self referential horror movies, such as 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Teaching Mrs Tingle.'  Written by the then 'fresh talented' Kevin Williamson, who went one to be a teen horror talent, and directed by one of the greatest horror directors, Wes Craven, who brought us one of the most influential 80's horror franchises of all time, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' How can you go wrong?  A first grade film which deserved all the praise it got when it came out from critics and movie goers, look out for it if you like your movies fun, scary, witty and smart.  A*
0525950079|2.0|\\"Pillars\\" was and is one of my favorite books.  During the past 16 years, I've recommended it to others, given probably 20 copies to others, and read it three times -- most recently only about six months ago.  That said, \\"World Without End\\" is merely \\"Book Without End\\".  Plodding, predictable, even prurient (a surprise to me, but Follett cannot write about sex believably without prurience), the book is an almost complete rehash of \\"Pillars\\".  There's even another scene of confrontation and murder at the Priory quarry.  The characters seem merely pale revisitings of Jack, Aliena, and the rest; the villain Ralph is a pale imitation of William, without the decadence -- this guy's just stupid.  So is the book.  A huge disappointment.
B0000B1OFN|5.0|Definintley a grat movie that can not be forgotten.  I would recommend for a good comedy and twisty movie.  Also the scene with the Mini's is excellent.
0375847227|1.0|This book is a travesty. I had to throw it in the trash it was so offensive. It is about two children who are to begin the world and the Garden of Eden all over again, led by fallen angels and intent on killing \\"god\\" as he is depicted as a tyrant in the book. The Golden Compass, which is now a movie, is about the church being an evil bureaucracy and tearing the souls away from children. This book is marketed as a children's book, but is much too dark, and should not be ready by children. Actually, it should not be read by anyone.
0553815229|4.0|Overall I found this book a very good read. The structure and story are very well thought out. At some stages I questioned the evidence discussed and was dissapointed by the corresponding web site that has not been updated for quite some time. For a different perspective to I would recommend Edward L. Dreyer's \\"Zheng He: China and the Oceans in the Early Ming Dynasty, 1405-1433\\" as it shed's light on areas where Gavin Menzies skirts over.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLaughlan is amazing. If you are a fan, you'll love her Christmas album. It is gentle, melodic and beautiful. Perfect for anytime of year, but especially for listening next to a warm fire and family at Christmas.
0553383663|5.0|\\"The Google Story\\" offers a unique perspective on the story of Google (the company).  More than a business biography, this book does trace the rapid growth and historical arc of the Google story, but it also layers insightful observations and questions about the company's plans for the future into the book.<br /><br />While many widely read business biographies are written \\"after the fact\\", this book is real-time...it covers events associated with the company right up until the time at which the book was published.<br /><br />An interesting theme, from my point of view, that is played upon from time to time through the book is the role mathematics, and by extension, general problem-solving, plays in the success of Google's main product at this point in time...a search engine.  This theme adds another, deeper, dimension to this book as compared to many other business biographies.<br /><br />For readers with an interest in technology, entrepreneurship and business in today's changing world, this is a recommended read.
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Incubus is awesome. Light Grenades is awesome. It's a little more mellow than some of their other albums, but still super rocks. Incubus consistently puts out albums where every single song is amazing, and this is definitely one of those.
B000A1ENCU|2.0|If you're a sword-and-sandals movie fan, you don't need me to tell you about the movie's content. But the Korean pressing is, in quality, only so-so (I got better results, including better sound and deeper color, by DVD-recording off of Turner Classic Movies), but it does carry English subtitles, though laughingly attenuated. If this is your only access to Peter Ustinov as a bearded Nero and sylphid Deborah Kerr as the willowy damsel Lygia under chase by the black bull, then you can't do much worse than buy this copy. The original movie was pre-Cinema Scope so the ratio is 1:1.33 and you're not missing anything, widescreen-wise. Call it the poor man's tour of ancient Rome: fire, circuses, crucifixions, and all -- the stuff that makes your TV screen pant and sweat and earn its wattage.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought this particular one for my husband because he loves this album.  We have truly enjoyed it.  Was in top notch condition.  Your \\"quickness\\" in getting it to us was supberb!
B00005JLWN|5.0|My husband rented this and we loved it. So I bought a copy to send to a friend.  Set in the future and a bit violent so not for those who are squeamish.  But the gun kata is amazing, has several good twists that are unexpected and Christian Bales gives a knock-out performance as an assassin who decides to stop supressing his emotions.  Best surprise beyond the gun kata - the son's behavior during a police raid of the house, and Christian Bale's reaction to a dog he finds.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|It's a decent third movie, to the spiderman series,but like the usual sequels, it isn't as good as the first movie was or even the second.
B00003CWTI|5.0|If you are a conscious person, that is to say, walking with your eyes wide open, then this movie is a must,  must buy.   On the other hand, people who don't like this film just don't get \\"life\\". As a matter of fact, if all people really \\"understood\\" this film, that would be the beginning of peace on earth. Calling this film \\"awful\\" or a \\"waste of time\\" is just a small indicator of the bigger problem in the world. That's the irony: How do you tell a fish in water that it's wet? It is because most people are walking around begging to be told the obvious -- in a constant search for another cliche -- that they miss the profundity of this movie. This movie is a cinematic epiphany -- nothing less than that. If you don't get it you must ask yourself what you think \\"good\\" is. Then look around you at the rest of the herd of sheep you are in the middle of.   Wake Up.
B000002JAX|5.0|This is an early collection, full of old jazz standards - wonderful.  Can't help but sing along.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|True to Johnny Cash's style he gives his guests time to sing full versions of their songs. Unlike so many others that cut their guests to a couple verses with no instrumental part. Some songs the instrumental has a great deal to do with the songs success and Cash lets guests play full versions. Excellent Video and well worth the Cash
B0001AP12G|4.0|I like some of the skits but 4-5 is too much. Spaceship is an obvious highlight. It's about working at a dead end job not getting paid enough having big dreams and because of all of that walking the hell out of that mother____er!<br /><br />I like His style in that song. And the production is super-solid. The singer actually singing is great too. 5.5/5 ' 11/10 His lyrics are OK in places, shine on 2-3 tracks and are really lacking on some such as The Workout Plan which isn't a bad song by any means. But to put it plain and nicely You will only like this if You like Your Hip-Hop funny and shallow. It's OK for what it is I suppose. 3.5/5 ' 7/10<br /><br />Next, is Jesus Walks. It's solid but nothing great. It's religiously-themed which is OK, I suppose. But I'm basically an Atheist, that Believes sometimes. Agnostic Anyone? 3.75/5 ' We Don't Care is pretty solid. It's a serious subject, made funny and many people would NOT appreciate what Kanye did here. I'm one of the thousands that don't give a flying s*** about Him rapping about Kids selling drugs (*LOL*). Nice lyrics, relate-able even if You don't sell. 4.25/5 ' 8.5/10<br /><br />All Falls Down is a ballad(?) and it's very great and even more recognizable. The video is crazy good and features the beautiful Stacy Dash. 4.5/5 ' 9/10 Slow Jams is as solid as the fore-mentioned track All Falls Down. It's a slowed-down-sexy-groove-alicious treat for R&B junkies. Features the smooth-vocaled crooner Jamie \\"nice behind in The Replacements\\" Foxx and Twista \\"the \\"fastest\\" rapper alive\\" (which I DON'T Believe for a second! He ain't THAT fast.). 4.5/5 ' 9/10<br /><br />Never Let Me Down is decent. It featured Common I Believe. I like the Guy at the end Who gives off a powerful speech. I enjoyed that the most. The rest was OK and slightly forgettable. 4.5/5 * 9/10 The New Workout Plan is like the original but so much \\"funnier\\". LOL sure! 3.25/5 ' 6.5/10 Get Em High is with Ludacris(?). It's OK and far from solid. 3.825/5 ' 6.5/10 Breathe In Breath Out is strictly about weed and maybe sex. I like the latter, could care so much less about the former. 3/5 ' 6/10<br /><br />Family Business Through The Wire and Last Words are in the top 6 best songs here. Family Business touches on a barbecue setting where Kanye's family get to show Their personalities when socializing eating and dancing. Sometimes His \\"Aunt Sheila and Aunt (?) get heated at every house warming...\\" 10/10. Through The Wire definitely has trouble keeping up with that track. It's very catchy, has a nice Chaka Khan \\"Through The Fire\\" sample and has decent lyrics. Kanye's trademark song. 9/10 Lastly, Last Words Features simple and quick-look-it's-JayZ-on-the-track-oh-no-Hes-leaving! vocals on it. It talks about Kanye's troubles before He became a well known Rappin'-Producer.<br /><br />==> Love his swagger, attitude, big ego sometimes, his decent vocals, decent but over-bloated lyrics and his sign; Gemini, Gemini (The Twins)<br />==> Love most of the samples, namely Spaceship and Through The Wire<br />==> The guest appearances were gold<br />==> In my top 10 favorite rappers<br />==> The cover rocks; a cute yet sad, lonely, and maybe distraught bear - I kinda felt that way in 2004.

B000VECAEO|5.0|The final season not only doesn't let the ball drop but also leaves you thirsty for more! Jerry Seinfeld and team wrap Tv's all-time best sitcom with 24 episodes filled with the most amazing comic absurdities. Hard to choose a favourite story: hilarious 'backwards' \\"the betrayal\\" episode; \\"the voice\\"; \\"the reverse peephole\\";... Even the 'flashback' 2-part \\"The Chronicle\\" episode is so beautifully edited that you forget it's all about things you've already watched. The only shortcoming in this package was for me the too short \\"Scenes from the roundtable\\". The return of Larry deserved a longer exposure! Even so, this minor pitfall doesn't compromise the great value of the set. Definitely 2 thumbs up!
B00009NHC5|4.0|I've loved this movie since I was a kid and I'm a huge Audrey Hepburn fan in general, but I had forgotten that she won an Oscar for her performance in this film.  A thriller about a blind person, it's bound to be slightly less-action oriented than most scary movies--and there are a few slow moments, especially at the beginning.  But the plot still builds a lot of tension as a gang of criminals try to manipulate poor, naive Audrey into giving up a heroine-filled doll.    It's easy to see why Audrey won an Oscar--she's completely believable as a blind woman, and once she realizes that this gang of con-artist criminals will kill her for the doll, she takes the acting to a whole new level.  Even if you don't like Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, which is similarly set in one apartment for the majority of the film, I think this movie is more nerve-wracking.  Above all, Audrey's acting is definitely Oscar-worthy, so it's a must-see for fans.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|We have been watching this movie on demand lately.  When they finally took it off the list, we decided to buy it in blu-ray.  We were amazed at the quality difference between blu-ray and standard.  It sounds better, the colors are brighter and the images have so much more detail.  The closest to a 3D experience than I've had so far.  Highly recommended if you have the technology.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|This album is an exciting listen.  Most of the tracks are so inspiring even without listening to the lyrics, one is left feeling hyped and engaged.  I love the beatiful futuristic Kanye-esque sounds mixed with top-notch sampling and the end result is the future of Hip-hops greatness.  I think its Kanye's brilliant production that does it for me.  The songs are also great lyrically.  The one stand-out track was BIG BROTHER, a song dedicated to his mentor, Jay-Z.  Its very dear and real and thats why I like Kanye, he says what is in his mind and doesnt care about PR BS.  He is the voice of the everyday man but is more talented and rich then you and I.  I think that most who are \\"haters\\" of him are those offended by his realness.      This is a must have for your music collection!
B000VEA30W|5.0|The new Avenged Sevenfold CD is something I didn't expect, but I love it! Great lyrics, great guitar riffs and the process of making all documented on MVI DVD! Love the CD, love the MVI DVD and love them!  Plus the shipment was really fast!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|.. Then any more sugary pop tarts and their fakery attempts to stardom.  Kelly's talent is something worthy of my appreciation.  Her previous effort, \\"breakaway\\" was an absolutely great fun catchy pop record that showcased her strong potent voice.  This album enforces the ideaology that Kelly can sing but cannot surface to a pleasing area of astonishment.  Most of the songs are slow and tepid and somewhat depressing.  Never again is absolutely great but very memorable; Hole is tiring and not very catchy as are alot of the songs.. I have hope in her future effort's (lyrical) outcome since with this album, she was under extreme artistic and commercial pressure to deliver.
0060594888|5.0|This is an excellent book because it addresses finding your passions, creating your vision, and ultimatly breaking these down into action steps you can take immediately to begin the life of your dreams.  This book is more than just an uplifting, vague idea - It is a practical book for creating your road map to success.
B00000K3CM|3.0|We just watched the first movie last week, which after all these years, I still found to be enjoyable. This one is more of the same, but contains a certain mean spiritedness that wasn't present in the original. The villians are muderous this time, making it very clear that they intend to stangle 11-year-old Kevin and dispose of his corpse in the river. They are so confident that his life will end soon that they share their plans with him to rob a toy store as they're marching him toward the water. Funny... huh? The lads clever pranks cause serious head trauma, nails being driven into skulls and third degree burns. The parents in the movie go beyond being scatter brained and move straight into child neglect. CPS would be knocking on their door so fast! The biggest problem with this movie is that it just isn't all that funny. My daughter was howling through the first film and barely chuckled during this one.    I was disappointed to find that this is letterboxed and not in anamorphic format. In other words, you must enlarge it to fill your widescreen television.
B000TFINY6|5.0|If you call yourself a fan of Lost (or even the hot castaways) this blu-ray set is a MUST OWN! Do not spend $ renting each disc at Blockbuster, because once you see it, you'll know that you have to have it. The original ABC broadcasts aired in HD, which is only 720p, and it was gorgeous. Seeing it in full HD 1080p is just oh-my-gosh, un-freaking-believable, jaw droppingly aah-mazing!!!  If anyone remembers the teaser with the polar bear that aired before season 1 (also a bonus feature on season 1 box set), it was quite a joke when a viewer took the time to slow-mo and passed it around the 'net. People saw that the teaser for season 1 had a limp, stuffed polar bear catapulted into the air, with a result that was the polar opposite of scary. I bring this up now because we've come a LONG way, baby! The polar bear that Locke takes on is fierce, and the other effects are spot on. And hey, if polar bears don't do it for you, Benjamin Linus is still creepy as hell! But my favorite Other/Hostile to watch is by far Dr. Juliet Burke! You can see the look of sincere pity in her eyes, then she shoots our heroes with a taser or knocks 'em out with one punch. She works for the others, but isn't quite one of them, and kept us guessing 'til the end where her real loyalties lie.   Many fans were unsatisfied and frustrated with the first 6-episode arc, especially with Jack, Kate and Sawyer held prisoner, but there was some interesting storytelling in there. For the first time, we see the world of the others! We see where they live, where they work, and that they have shoes, names, TVs and sandwiches! Ben and Juliet's characters develop, as does Kates relationship with you-know-which-guy, but if you don't I won't spoil it. The conflict in the first 6-episodes was necessary, and the cast and crew pulled it off beautifully.  The rest of the season is more of what we're used to: exploring Dharma stations, Sawyer assigning new nicknames, Hurley constantly trying to keep everyones spiritsup, even while still grieving for Libby, Locke on the continual quest to communicate with the island (a fascinating character in itself), Charlie and Claire being too cute as the island's only quasi-nuclear family unit, and taking on the baddies while Rousseau blows stuff up...sweeeeet.  Answers: Claire's father (I knew it since mid-season 2), Dharma & the hostiles, Sun's baby's father, Kate's marriage, the con artist that makes James Ford call himself Sawyer, what happened after the sky turned purple, (one of) Jack's tattoos, why Locke was in a wheelchair, and more.  I won't get too into summarising the plot, because you've either watched and you know, or you haven't watched it yet and want to find out for yourself, sooo, on to the bonus features!  Of course it contains the standard bloopers and deleted scenes...the bloopers have some funny moments with Sawyer, Hurley, Charlie, and actors that aren't used to handling guns. The deleted flashbacks answer a question that was better left ambiguous, but it's interesting anyway. Of the 4 episodes with commentary, the one with Damon Lindelof is the best. There's an awesome sneak peek on the Lost PS3 game due in February, and the making of the Lost action figures...after all, no one knows how to merchandise quite like parent-company DISNEY. There's a feature on how any given day, cast and crew are working tirelessly on various stages of pre and post-production and a nice feature hosted by Evangeline Lily that put names and faces to the people that make the show we love so much. For die hard fans that read books featured in Lost there's The Lost Book Club (I'd join in a second!) but most of the titles are explored more in depth in Unlocking the Meaning of LOST: An Unauthorized Guide by Lynnette Porter and David Lavery. Another orientation video from the Orchid Station can be viewed as well. White rabbits are ALWAYS more than meets the eye on this island! Many more juicy extras you'll just have to watch, but trust me, it's worth every minute!  Now, what you've been waiting for: the blu-ray exclusive features! From the moment you open the box, you'll see a letter from Damon and Carlton that lets you know that this blu-ray is SPECIAL, as well as a video intro from them at the beginning of disc 1. Blu-prints takes you on a fun little tour, and having seamless menus and being able to watch a bonus feature and pick up where you left off is great, but what really makes it worth the blu-ray price over the DVD price is Access: Granted. Here, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse give definitive ANSWERS to a long list of mysteries, followed by further discussion by Jimmy Kimmel (his theories are out there and a bit silly) and writers from Lost Magazine, Entertainment Weekly(these 2 know what they're talking about), and a woman from the TV Guide channel plays Captain Obvious. Astute fans will have already figured out most of these, but there are still surprises, an EASTER EGG, and validation from Damon and Carlton that you were right all along.  If you're like me, you probably watch every minute of each Lost season's box set in less than a week...so cancel your plans, get comfortable, get snacks, and get LOST!!!
0844663662|5.0|Be prepared for a book that jumps around a lot but in the end is a fun and an easy read.  I found myself rethinking my thoughts on war and time/space, along with laughing at things that come out of nowhere.  I often felt sorry for Billy Pilgrim because of his bland personality.  He really wasn't one to have opinions on any subject.  He just let things happen no matter how unusual they were.  Billy's blandness was countered by the interesting characters he meets up with.  I love the names that Vonnegut picks for his characters.  They are like an extension of their personalities so that Vonnegut can introduce a character and we already know a lot about them.  Another author that I have to add to my list to read in the future.

B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This 2006 production of Jane Eyre pales in comparison to the 1983 production. While I like how this film handled Jane's early years, the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester is way off. Most unfortunate, in my opinion, is the degree to which the dialogue has been altered from the novel whereas other productions have been far more faithful. I try not to quibble too much about such alterations, but in this case the alterations were not at all for the better and often lost what had been the primary point of the conversation. Jane was robbed of some of her wittiest reparte, and Wilson overplayed her part to such a degree that Mr. Rochester's powers of observation lost much of their impact as well.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Wonderful! I have a wide range of musical interest - everything from ABC to ZZ Top, and these sirens of song add another dimention to my musical taste! I've seen them in concert twice, and have a great appreciation for what these women can do! Looking forward to the next CD!!!

I saw them play on Austin City Limits a few weeks back, and live they're amazing. You can hear what all the critical fuss is about, but I think a large part of the bands reputation is based on their live sets?

At first, it is odd hearing these recordings, imprinted on my mind over decades of listening, sounding the same only different, but the Anthology series and Live At The BBC set have already reminded us that the Beatles actually have a repertoire of songs in some recorded performances, and that they shouldn't be frozen in aspic.

B000GW8VTO|5.0|When viewing a biographical movie, such as this, it is always interesting to research the background of the story's main character. A simple Google of the name Hal Moore opened an enormous volume of information. Notably, for me at least, was the actual \\"after action report\\" prepared by Col. Moore himself which provided the blow by blow description of the battle of Ia Drang the focus of the movie. This is an astonishing tale of the type of military leadership that is so often overlooked in our great nation. There is much to be learned from men like Colonel Moore. I enjoyed the movie as a war story but more importantly I also learned the type of preparation a commanding officer like Colonel Moore puts into his assignment. As a civilian I could only assume that any commanding officer worth his salt would study the maps of the terrain he was about to assault. This man took it far deeper and studied the history of his enemy, its role in this location and most importantly the NVA leadership and tactics. His dedication to duty and to his men was inspiring.

068987751X|5.0|I bought this book for use with my primary students with Autism.  We use the book to facilitate a commenting activity, where my students put together picture symbols on a sentence strip, like \\"I see dog!\\" My students love the pop up animals, and the book is short enough to hold their limited attention spans.  We have to be very careful when handling the book though, as the pop up components are very delicate.  I have a thirteen month old son, and I am hesitant to purchase a copy for him because of that issue.  Maybe when he is a little older... One cool thing about the book is that it leaves out the animal names, for example, the author writes, \\"So they sent me a..\\" and then you lift the flap to reveal a pop up frog, but it does not state the word frog.  This serves my purposes well in the classroom, as I see that my students are not simply matching the words as they form their sentences, but they are picking the word that matches the picture -- a higher level skill.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle who, along with crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr), becomes obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer after he begins to send coded messages to the newspaper. The film opens with a brutal murder of two young lovers in 1969 and spans well into the 70's, as police detective David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and others join Graysmith and Avery in the search for the serial killer.    The first half of the film depicts a series of grisly murders committed by the Zodiac mixed in with some rather superfluous scenes, such as Graysmith's first date with the woman who later became his wife. Some of the crime scenes are intense and well put together. But overall I felt like this part of the movie lacked suspense and was basically just one murder after another with few opportunites for the viewer to play \\"amateur detective.\\"     I enjoyed the second half of the movie more, as Graysmith, Toschi and others began to investigate the evidence and check out possible suspects, including an ex-teacher, child molester named Arthur Leigh. I starting losing empathy for Graysmith towards the end as he gives up his wife and children in order to continue his obsessive search for the Zodiac. The fact that Graysmith did eventually achieve a certain degree of fame and fortune from writing his book on the Zodiac also makes me a little skeptical of his motives. But the movie really downplays that angle and makes Graysmith seem like an entirely altruistic figure.    The film trots out several names of potential suspects but leaves the viewer with a final impression that the despicable Artur Leigh was the likely killer. Of course, the case was never solved so we will likely never know for sure. This is a fairly entertaining movie with some good acting. But it was a bit overlong and could have benefitted from some better editing. Still worth a viewing, especially by those who enjoy crime films.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore has come a long way from his previous movies.  In this film he is able to show the sad state of healthcare today without the confrontation and condescension of his previous work.  Yet, he still manages to give some hope and humor.  The extra material adds even more to the overall picture Moore is trying to let viewers in on, particularly the extra places he visited and the longer interview with Tony Benn.  Definitely worth watching as well as educational.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|There are 12 minutes of deleted scenes including one in which we see the fallout from the film's conclusion for the characters working within the CIA. There is more footage of Paz, the assassin that Bourne repeatedly crosses paths with. Also, more with Simon Ross and we also see how Bourne found out about him.<br /><br />\\"Man on the Move: Jason Bourne\\" takes us through several of the countries that Bourne visits during the course of the film. We see how Berlin doubled for Moscow and get an idea of the work required to take a film crew all over Europe. Their goal was to immerse an audience in a city without resorting to showing the usual touristy landmarks.<br /><br />\\"Rooftop Pursuit\\" examines the exciting chase in Tangiers. We see the special cameras that were used to capture the action.<br /><br />\\"Planning the Punches\\" takes a look at how the fight in a small, Tangiers apartment was put together. A lot of planning and practicing was involved. It is fascinating to see how much was done to pull it all off.<br /><br />\\"Driving School\\" examines how Damon was trained to do some of the film's car stunts. He went through a series of moves under the guidance of an expert and we see him actually pull them off, albeit under safe conditions.<br /><br />\\"New York Chase\\" takes a look at how the New York City car chase was choreographed. Amazingly, they actually did it all on location with no CGI. This certainly makes you appreciate the final result all the more.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass. He says that he wanted to set a high tempo right from the first frame because that is what these films are all about. The director talks about the challenge of making a film that would appeal to fans of the series and also to those who hadn't seen any of them. Greengrass talks about pacing and moving the film along without losing the audience in the process. He delivers a solid, thoughtful track.

I will not add to the battle of HD vs Blu-Ray, but I will say stick to DVD's until BOTH formats and the companies that produce them sort out their issues. Why would you put a product on the market at the costs they are being marketed for that cannot be used for what it was purchased for? And yes other Blu-Ray disc titles have worked in the same drive. Good luck to you on your purchase.

0061122416|1.0|This is a terribly trite self-help book packaged as a novella. The title of this review essentially summarizes this work. While reading it, I couldn't shake the image of a church-basement bookclub discussion - but despite numerous direct and indirect spiritual and religious references, the message here is not one of love and brotherhood. Rather, it's best stated as \\"get yours\\". Of all the 'Personal Legends' (Alchemist's silly label for your life's goal) around which to center the story, the one chosen for the hero is 'find some buried treasure'. And how do we determine what OUR life's goal is? Well, in this case a 'king' magically appears to the hero to dictate it.     Simple, simple-minded, and utterly disappointing.

However, when people all around me kept pushing it on me, I finally got worn down.

The best, most fascinating book,'The Spy Who Came In From the Cold' written by John Le Carre and then made into a movie was about the life of a cold war spy. The best that is until Matt Damon became Jason Bourne. I will forever more think of Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. The series has been riveting, and 'The Bourne Ultimatum' the best of them all. The excitement and chase scenes and the violence had me covering my eyes. They were so well directed and acted.  I was there in Paris, Madrid, New York City, Germany and Morocco. The 'assets', the men who became killers for the CIA, were part of my team. The guys who wore black, like Albert Finney and  thought they were doing the right thing for the United States. But Joan Allen, aka Pamela Landry knew better, she understood that the CIA does not involve killing our own.<br />Brilliant all.<br /><br />Jason Bourne wanted to come in from the Cold. He could not remember where he came from, but knew what he had become and he could no longer live that life. Jason follows the leads from country to country, in and out of one scrape, into the next. And, throughout his travails, he remained focused and looking for the guys with the white hats.<br /><br />\\"Pamela Landy: Listen, people - do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

B000UWO8XS|5.0|\\"After the master of the Sharp Manufacturer saber factory abdicates and appoints On, his least popular worker, as his successor, On, unwilling to lead his surly colleagues, embarks on a quest of revenge to kill the evil, flying, tattooed kung fu master who killed his father\\"... that's the description of the DVD that Amazon provides above, I suppose it does a fairly good job of giving a brief synopsis of the film, except for one little tiny detail that they may have let slip through the cracks... our lead also loses his right arm to a group of unruly bandits early on.  Yeah, that kinda changes things a bit doesn't it?!  In 1995, hot off the heels of his final \\"Once Upon A Time In China\\" film (part 3), director Tsui Hark decided to take a classic Shaw Brothers film from 1967 entitled \\"The One-Armed Swordsman,\\" and remake it with his own personal style and flare.  The outcome is \\"The Blade,\\" which can only really be called a remake in spirit alone because ultimately it shares very few similarities with the original beyond the aspects of revenge (different reasons) and, of course, one-armed sword fighting (way different style).  Whereas the original masterpiece by Chang Cheh played out almost like a martial arts fairy tale, Hark's vision has more in common with the grime and harshness of a film like \\"The Taxi Driver\\" (you may feel like you need a shower after this one).  In fact, the first 3/4 of the movie is almost too depressing to enjoy as we follow our lead through nearly unsurmountable misfortune after misfortune (after misfortune!)... of course, this just helps to make the last 1/4 that much sweeter when Ding On does finally begin his bloody path to vengeance.  With plenty of interesting characters (even the bit characters pique a sense of intrigue), gritty action, and some of the best direction of Hark's career, \\"The Blade\\" provides the goods for more than just the martial art and action crowd, but rather anyone interested in an intense and edgy (albeit bleak)viewing experience.

B000UO338W|4.0|This album is billed as \\"their last studio album\\" and it's one of their best. It's a politically charged recording complete with carefully edited samples from political speakers. The cover of the Door's \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is just barely recognizable as it is completely immersed with Ministry style. It's a fluid album you can listen to from start to finish without skipping any tracks. The inclusion of Eisenhower's speech near the end on The End of Days II really makes you reflect on current political direction.<br /><br />With the addition of a members of Prong to the group on the last two records there is a heavy influence of their sound but it really adds to the music. While I do enjoy the record I wouldn't say it's the best Ministry work to date. The vocals are a bit too evenly mixed for my liking and sometimes blend with the distorted guitars too well. Knowing that this would be the last studio album and it was recorded in Texas I was really hoping to hear some guest vocals from Gibby Haynes (Butthole surfers). Burton C. Bell (Fear Factory) lends his talents which is just as good though.<br /><br />Overall this album is great and worth the purchase. I'm an extremely picky listener so I pick up on nuances most people might not give a second thought to and the things I described are really the only issues I had with the album. It won't disappoint.
B000002J6H|3.0|I have never written an Internet review before, but I just have to set the record straight.  The lead reviewer on the Stephen Stills page just has it all wrong when he says \\"He wasn't the most accomplished member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young--or even of Crosby, Stills &Nash, for that matter\\".  For the record - Stills played practically every instrument on Crosby, Stills & Nash.  With the exception of songwriting credits to the amazing Cros and Nash - this was a Stephen Stills album.  While making 1969's Crosby Stills and Nash, David Crosby and Graham Nash christened Stephen Stills \\"Captain Manyhands\\" for his prodigious gifts as a multi-instrumentalist and arranger.   Not the most accomplished?  Nah....that ain't it.

0553260111|1.0|&quot;I made a decision. It was the most difficult decision I've ever made in my life.  I think a person can only make a decision like that if he's nearly lost his life by an act of violence, his life saved by someone else.&quot;<br /><br />The above was said by Marie St. Jacques, Bourne's love interest throughout the novel, and illustrates Ludlum's total tone deafness in writing dialog.  A woman would have said: &quot;if she's nearly lost her life...her life saved by someone else.&quot;  It's actually much worse than that.  Ludlum writes the entire novel in a single voice, usually that of a third person speaking inside Bourne's head, but even the dialog sounds like that third person's voice.<br /><br />I finished the novel, even though I started to throw it in the trash several times, just to find out how it turned out.  It didn't.  Nothing was resolved.<br /><br />For the trivia types out there, Ludlum writes enough like a British writer, E. C. Tubb, that I thought they were the same person until I confirmed otherwise.

Mixed in with the style of 'Golden Years', the funky 'Stay' with its contagious chorus, the melancholy 'Wild is the Wind' and erratic 'TVC 15', this CD is great! He had a tight band at the time, vocal delivery is excellent and the whole thing comes together nicely. The re master sounds excellent as well. I love this stage of Bowie. Along with Low and Lodger, the late mid-late 70's were very creative for him<br /><br />Why 4 stars then? - I just hate the fact that there are only 6 tracks. Always have hated that. But all of them are quality.

The book tells the story of an outbreak of a disease that reanimates the dead and the world's response to the global crisis. The book deals very little with the zombies though. The book mainly focuses on the human reaction to the pandemic. The book is composed of interviews by the author with several dozen individuals from all over the world and they tell their stories about what they did or what happened to them during the Zombie War. Some of the interviewees are soldiers, mercenaries, or government officials and some are just common folk like the computer geek in Japan or the young girl who was part of the great exodus north into Canada where zombies aren't as common because they freeze in low temperatures.  It's not just a zombie story, it's the story of the world gripped in a global crisis and how some deal well or not so well with it.

0375842209|5.0|This is probably one of the most beautiful books I've ever read, and since I've read it and shared it with friends of mine that teach high school English, it has become a part of school curriculums and summer reading lists.  It is important to note that even though this book is listed under  young adult fiction, it is a book for everyone.  I have shared it with adult friends and every one feels that this book is life changing.  Although narrated by death, he is not happy about his job and he understands life and humanity in a way that no one else could.  Centered around the holocaust, the focus is not on pain and suffering, but rather how love, innocence, and a reaching spirit is the main cause for survival in devastating tragedy.  This is a book that everyone must read.  It is sad, but it also leaves the reader with an overwhelming sense of love for humanity.

B000AMJC2K|4.0|I have dual Samsung 19in 940BW (widescreens) and mounted them to my Matrix Glass desk with the clamps...install was short and easy, only about 15 min for each.  It def matched my desks silver scheme.  The screws / bolts were a bit too tight from the factory...I don't need to move my arms around much, but from what other reviews are saying, these are not meant for that function.  For $60 and free shipping (which was fast), these are def a good value!!!  I checked EVERYWHERE online and you won't find anything cheaper.  Ergotron is pretty reputable company..I worked for Morgan Stanley on the trading floor for IT and most of the Bloomberg stands were on Ergotron's.

B000021YQV|5.0|I completely avoided this thing when it first came out, but somehow it still ended up in my collection not long after it's release. AND while I am a moderate, but not entirely big fan of this band as a whole, I have to say that this album right here will be deemed one day as a classic, and I would say it is one of, if not THE best rock records to come out of this decade.<br />Although the album is politically driven, most of these songs can be used to mirror whatever is going on in your current mind (something that other lyrical geniuses of the past have accomplished for us) and really takes some serious issues for a wild spin (or a good old fashioned ride on the pogo stick!)<br />This album got me listening to the radio again in 2001 after being away for some years (I would soon leave again, as there wasn't really much shaking otherwise then either) But I played the hell out of this album when I first picked it up. There is a perfect bond here between ballads, sweet stringy melodies, and heavy in your face riffs and power chords. And vocals that aren't to far over the top that it hurts, but just enough to get you in touch with your mentally ill side.<br />I always just played this one from start to finish, and never asked questions. If you have not yet given this album a spin, you seriously should do so.

I really wish I didn't spend the money.  I don't like how they shot the concert, it looks like a novice did it.  The sound quality is ok, but not compariable to their other concert DVD's.  I would pass on this one and buy Trilogy, that one is Awesome!!

I bought this CD Book on July 30, 2007. After listening to this repeatedly for a week, I could, for the FIRST TIME, see exactly how I let everyone elses \\"BAGGAGE\\" drag me down and make ME feel bad about what was going on in my life. It taught me how to take control and KEEP IT!  I never remove these CD's from my car, and every time I am driving somewhere that takes longer than a short hop to the store, I turn on the CD's and listen AGAIN AND AGAIN>  I heard about this on Oprah Winfrey in March 2007. I am just sorry that I did not buy them at that time!  I am not on ANY anti-depressants... I STOPPED TAKING THEM ON AUGUST 6, 2007 and have not needed them, either. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERYONE, whether you are depressed or not. I liked this so much that I bought 12 COPIES of the CD-Book ($12.95 ea. because of the bulk purchase) and have given them to my loved ones as gifts... THIS ONE WILL GIVE BACK, both to me and to them!   BUY THIS PROGRAM!  YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT!!!

Even with that, it all builds from there.  \\"In the Colors\\"...superb.  \\"Needed You Tonight\\"...outstanding.  \\"Having Wings\\"...profound.  \\"Younger Than Today\\"...even more profound.  \\"Lifeline\\"...meaningful.

B000VNMMQ6|4.0|What is going on in our society when people are complaining that there aren't enough curse words in a movie?Seeing some of the reviews for the \\"finally\\" rated pg-13 Die Hard,has got my head spinning.You know,there are alot of people(including myself)who really don't like cussing,don't use it and aren't impressed by people who do.The best movies aim to reach the widest possible audience and most of the time,they're the most successful.I applaud the efforts to finally bring the adventures of John McClane to the many,instead of just those who enjoy swearing.I hope any success it's had has helped Hollywood rethink on what the tools for success are in action movies.I've heard too many times that profanity means that it's more realistic.In a way that's true as our society is,for some reason,becoming more accepting to vulgarity.But that doesn't somehow make it good,making it also good to glorify it in movies.I'm obviously not gonna get into reviewing the movie or the disc as others have seen fit to do that.My conviction here is to be the other side of the \\"not enough cussing\\",discussion for those who need to know that there are others who feel the same as well.Hope this helps someone.

I've never been a big fan of the Fantasy series genre, but Pratchet has really created something different in the disk world.  Diskworld is more a mirror of our own world than some far flung fantasy world. Every nuance in the Diskworld's ridiculous physics and geography and politics is based on a good solid joke poking fun at what we have gone through here on little old Earth.  Sarcasm and satire taken to it's highest level, the places and people you will meet are strikingly familiar at every turn. As with all good humor, the laughs are based on revelation and in site.  Great fiction with an alarming amount of truth.    ...and mostimportant, so FUN!

B000068FXX|5.0|Supertramp is great and out of all their albums, this is my favorite.  When most artists step up to the microphone, they are inspired. They see the world in a different way and share it so the listener can glimpse their viewpoint.  But somewhere along the road, they lose their way and pump out a couple of songs about phone numbers, and losing girls to their buddies to get their stuff on the shelves.  Crowds roar, music sells, but in the end, the fluff is forgotten (Except By Guitar Hero) and the real lives on. Supertramp is no exception.  They have their fluff songs, and I like them too. But, this album is that inspired step to the microphone,a work of art, a unique look at life  - from the studies of love in \\"Give a Little Bit\\" and \\"Lover Boy\\" to the unique angst and peace interplay in \\"Even In The Quietest Moments.\\"   Then \\"Downstream\\", \\"Babaji\\", and \\"From Now On\\", keep up that RUSH-like odd way of looking at life in a melodious melancholic way. Yes, I compared Supertramp to Rush.  My favorite, \\"Fools Overture\\" tells a story with instruments emphasizing the parts in a way I rarely hear from other artists. Good group, good album.

B000XPU5NY|3.0|I have been listening to Genesis for many years now and these guys are not too much older than me. To think what they have to go through to put on a live show of their particlular magnitude just astounds me! The recording is pristine and the musical productions are tight. The band, however, is showing their age I'm afraid as Phil's voice can not manage the higher register he once enjoyed and the other guys don't play with  the same fire (understandably) as they did say 25 years ago. Hell, I don't walk up a flight of stairs with the same gusto I used to 25 years ago. It happens! This CD is good for what it is. This is a very good piece of nostalgia for the fans who grew up with Genesis. I would not recommend this to new ears, but would steer new listeners to their original material when it was fresh and young. Still, these guys prove that they still can play damn good music at an age where others might be greeting you at Walmart! - Ciao

As an adult, I reconnect with that child's enthusiasm every time I see Mary Poppins, although the attraction I felt for Julie Andrews is better understood.  There are not enough adjectives to describe it but enchanting stands out.  Unforgettable and a touch of true magic from Disney.

Our team actually came up with several creative solutions to a couple of problems.<br /><br />It is also a valuable tool to use on one's own - sometimes it is fun just to pick a card and then use that as a basis for one's thinking for the day. This can be used in conjunction with the Innovators Whack Pack.
B00005OWEG|3.0|Some of the new stuff was just plain silly, including another encounter with the Playboy bunnies.

0765348276|2.0|I bought this book due the preponderance of good reviews and Hugo nomination.  I read it quickly - there's no question that this book is an \\"easy read\\" - but fairly early on it was clear to me that it's a comic book in prose.  There are places for this kind of book (on airplanes, at the beach, etc.), but for this reason alone the book's not worth of the level of praise it's received here.  But by the time I finished it I could only see it worthy of praise if it's a satire of American military conduct across the globe, and in that case half of the book should have been replaced by more amusing over-the-top antics.  In that case maybe three stars.    Whatever the intention, it's clear that most people aren't taking it as a satire, hence the two stars (maybe even one).  The main character is reprehensible, and the conduct of nearly every sentient being in the book is similarly reprehensible.  The only character at all interested in negotiating is a blowhard buffoon who receives his \\"just desserts\\" by being torn to shreds by hostile aliens.  (Of course, nearly all aliens are hostile.)  Otherwise it's kill, kill, kill, with gaping plot holes to give you something to think about aside from the brutality.  I was hoping from some redemption at the end (maybe the main character steps out of the shower, and it turns out the whole book had been a nightmare), but no dice - instead \\"the killing machines probably lived happily ever after\\".    Don't read this book.  There's better satire (if that's what it is), and far, far better science fiction out there.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Have seen this movie a couple times.  Don't take your eyes off the screen or you will miss something important.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|The creators of Lost definitely know what they're doing.  On my original viewing of season 3 I was worried that they may have been losing focus, as the the stories seemed less connected and relevant to the show than the first two seasons.  Some weeks would be really enjoyable and enthralling, while others, while still good, just didn't really impress me.  As the season reached a close I had some doubts as to how they would tie up everything while still leaving enough unanswered to draw me back in for season 4.    Then the season finale came, and everything made sense.  Viewed as a whole, season 3 really delivered.  Of all the shows I have watched this is definitely one where you have the judge each season after it's over because the creators definitely know what they're doing.  Each episode seemed different in hindsight because I could now see how everything was leading up to the end of the season.  As for the season finale, it delivered one of the biggest shocks I have ever gotten while watching a television program.    So, if you gave up during season 3 I strongly recommend you give it another chance.  There's still time to catch up before season 4 starts in February.
B000M341QE|5.0|This was bought to add to my own collection.  I had seen the movie in the theater and found it very intense and riveting adult movie.

I love the extra features about the making of the movie on the DVDs that my husband and I refer to as \\"surprises\\".

B000OLGCI4|5.0|Walt Disney's animated classic, \\"The Jungle Book,\\" gets the platinum treatment on its latest appearance on DVD.  This wonderful tale, fully restored with vibrant colors and excellent audio, tells the story of Mowgli, a man-cub, and his black panther father-figure, Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot), as the latter attempts to get the boy back to the man-village where he belongs before the wicked and mighty tiger, Shere Khan (George Sanders), can get his claws into him.  Along the way they meet up with the one and only jungle VIP, King Louie (wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima), Kaa the python (Sterling Holloway), everybody's favorite bear, Baloo (Phil Harris) and some wisecracking vultures.<br /><br />This platinum edition features an excellent digital restoration, a number of excellent documentaries, games, a visit with \\"Rocky the Rhino,\\" who found his way to the cutting room floor, and plenty of other extras.  There's also a passable Jonas Brothers cover of Louis Prima's \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" that's sure to attract the attention of pre-teen girls the world over.<br /><br />This particular DVD is also a Disney Movie Rewards disc, meaning that you can gain points for purchasing it.<br /><br />While some squabble over the aspect ratio of the film, I think that the story, music, and characters are far too valuable to pass up because of this.  If you don't own \\"The Jungle Book\\" and consider yourself a Disney fan, make sure you buy this disc before Disney takes it away again.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000EYK4GW|5.0|\\"When I See An Elephant Fly\\" is just one of a number of classic songs performed in the short and sweet Walt Disney classic, \\"Dumbo.\\"  This wonderfully touching film about a young elephant who doesn't fit in speaks volumes to viewers both young and old.  More than just a simple cartoon, this story shows how someone who's different deserves just as much respect as any other person.  Jumbo, Jr. (Dumbo's real name) is protected by his mother from bullies until she's punished for defending him in a chaotic tangle with other elephants.  He's befriended by the loyal Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy), who teaches him to keep his head up and be happy just as he is.<br /><br />This DVD features a number of extras including the obligatory passable music video, a cartoon short of \\"Elmer Elephant\\" and \\"The Flying Mouse,\\" sing along songs and an excellent read along storybook.<br /><br />Some have stated that this film is racist and/or unsuitable due to the crow characters.  To be honest, these characters are some of the most endearing in my opinion.  Their song, \\"When Elephants Fly,\\" is one of my personal Disney favorites.  Some even go so far as to say the the \\"drunk\\" scene goes too far for small children.  Guess what, folks, I'd much rather my child see a drunk mouse in a Disney feature than a drunk uncle on Christmas day!  This story teaches tolerance, forgiveness, and that bullies are the only ugly ones around.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tale to anyone who's a fan of Disney, anybody with children, and fans of animation as well.

B000H6SXMY|2.0|I love this show but I am returning this box set and decided to order the individual seasons separately for the following reasons:    1) Many of the DVDs are faulty and skip even when they are not physically scratched. I tested this with multiple DVD players which have never given me problems before. If you check other reviews this quality control issue is pretty common with the DVDs from this box set. From what I can tell the quality control on the original season sets is much better.    2) Disc 28 was missing and I got two copies of Disc 29 instead.    3) The corner of the collector's box was broken/damaged when i received it.    4) The discs are spread out through 6 scratch-prone cardboard-like  sleeves for each character instead of by Season. Cute, but i don't want to have to open up a damn episode guide and look up the episode number to figure out which season i'm about to watch, while worrying about scratching my DVDs when taking them in and out of the sleeves.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Incredible!  This is perfect writting and singing.

0446677450|4.0|This book has amazingly good points but it is very repetitive. Not only that but if everyone that read this book actually did what it said to do and were successful then the whole world would eventually be shooken up. As sad as it is society thrives on having a class system (Rich, Middle & Poor). If everyone was all of a sudden getting rich then no one would want to do the dirty jobs and as well if the author brought up social security, Medicare and retirement plans then he should have gone into why people should not rely on the government. This is an amazing book to get people to start thinking but only very few will ever be able to follow it's advice and be successful.

B000Y96EWK|3.0|The downloaded movie is jerky, during fast chasing scenes.  Almost blurred.  The plot is  rather thin, but good action.  It took a long time, for Borne to recapture his memory.    The whole movie was rather dark and badly lighted.  But, he gave good performance.
B000065U1N|5.0|I was attending North Georgia College when the events in Somalia happened.  Turns out I had a few former classmates over there.  And we couldn't believe the SNAFU the media was making out of this.  Loved the part when the camera crew met the SEALS as they came onto the beach and lit them up with lights (they're lucky they didn't get shot).  Then the book came out.  Then this movie.  It really was surprising how accurate the movie is and how true it stays to the book and the history.  I suppose it helps having the SOAR guys play themselves.  But I was very impressed with this film.  The action and drama are not-stop and for the most part realistic.  It really captures the esprit de corps of elite soldiers and the courage and bravery shown by our armed forces but often overlooked by some.
0553213105|5.0|Austen wrote PRIDE and PREJUDICE in the mid-1790's and it is definitely a reflection of it's times.  She speaks of an era where 'true' gentlemen did not engage in 'trade' (a term encompassing what today would include professions) and doing so would definitely lower not only him but his extended family's social status.  Women were considered educated if they could play the piano well, or sing, or draw or were skilled at decorative needlework.  The only acceptable occupation for a gentlewoman was marriage, an enterprise that her extended family was commited to helping her achieve for the alternative was spinsterhood as a dependent to some family member.<br /><br />PRIDE AND PREJUDICE centers on the Bennet family, a quiet country gentleman of modest means who lives with his wife and five daughters in southern England.  As the story begins his family is in an uproar over the news of an eligible gentleman moving to the neighborhood.  To the delight of Mrs. Bennet it quickly becomes apparent that Jane, the eldest daughter, has caught his eye.  This is of special importance, since at 22 Jane's prospects are beginning to fade.  The romance is not without obstacles which are further complicated by the romance of her next younger sister, the outspoken Elizabeth and the outrageous behavior of Lydia, the youngest daughter.  In the end though, love, or at least matrimony, conquers all.<br /><br />The story begins rather slowly but the descriptions of the characters alone make it worth pressing on to the finish.  Austen manages to bring them to life to the extent that the reader will probably be able to describe each in detail.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been called the first comic romance, and, although subtle by today's standards, some of the comic scenes are hysterical.<br /><br />If this novel were written by a 21st century author it would probably be about a third shorter, not a better novel but a more accessible one to a modern reader.  The 18th century style with it's long,complicated sentences filled with detail make for slow reading, frustrating for a reader who is anxious for some action.  It is also a bit difficult for a modern day reader to comprehend the culture that Austen is describing, one where a young woman walking alone is considered improper, where having a lawyer in the family is an embarrassment, where a wealthy country family could select the local minister.  For a reader unfamiliar with this time period, particularly for a younger reader, an annotated edition would probably be helpful.
B000O5AYCA|1.0|I will never understand others' love for this record; and despite all the great reviews it's gotten I have never personally met someone who actually likes it.  So let me insert a dissenting voice of caution:  listen to this before you buy it.  If you don't like it the first time, it is unlikely you will like it the 10th.  Or at least that was my experience.  Maybe it's a generational thing, but I just don't hear anything that connects emotionally (or sonically), or that is even interesting on this record; the playing is dull as mud, the lyrics pretentious.  It shares with James Taylor the rare ability to be both boring and annoying.

I have an older DVD player but also have several Godzilla DVD's that are over 10 years old that have taken at least 10 times the use and don't skip a wink. This Ratatouille DVD is no longer playable. I don't buy DVD's from Amazon anymore for this fact alone.  I get them at the local Walmart where I can take them back if they become defective too easily.  The manufacturer of the DVD appears to be different at Walmart as well, based on the case, but it still may be the same DVD manufacturer, just not sure. I have had the same problems with CARS and SHRECK DVD's.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is surprisingly accurate.  All the way to the type of weapons, gear,and uniforms used by both sides.  The battle is, for the most part, portrayed very accurately.  All of the actors turned in strong performances.  Even the Vietanmese translation was good (my mother is Vietnamese, she checked for me).  This is probably the most accurate and best movie showing the early part (or any part) of the Vietnam War.  Highly suggest this movie to war movie buffs and history buffs.  The book is also a good read and gives even more detail.
B00012QLQ4|1.0|[[ASIN:B00005MAM2 Akira (Special Edition)]]    I hate writing bad thing about classics's but theirs nothing classic about this DVD. Orion was the original owner of this film and now pioneer owns it. don't get me wrong even I as a business person would of seen that as great way to make money without think of what might come next.    I am a huge fan of the original Akira that Orion made back in the early 90's, but this re-master BS has no place on the market. They complete change the dialog and voices that most other fans loved it made the movie, but the thing that really makes me angry is the fact that the pronunciation of names was completely off, Its not Canada its Kanada with a K. Plus the famous bike everyone loves was destroyed by changing all the stickers no I'm not so keen on it. I pawned my special edition Akira that cost me almost $50 when it first came out on DVD I wish I would of rented it first... sigh... If your thinking about buying just flush your head down a toilet you get the same effect as you would with the re-master Akira DVD or you can spend a lot of money and find the original made by orion but be warned its not a DVD its a VHS.... btw the quality was much better on the VHS than the DVD sad really is.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|This was so totally new for me, and so wonderful. Since I first saw this film, I have seen every film Miyazaki made. What a change from Disney: so imaginative, the animations is exquisite, the story is so funny, and un-cliched. A film for adults as well as children - it gave me a whole new way to see animation.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched the movie Serenity, and I heard about this series through that movie.  I NEVER would have thought that you could combine Science Fiction and the Western genres and come out with such a wonderful product.  If you enjoy a healthy dose of cynicism from the captain of firefly, Mal.  And sci-fi or westerns, you should give this a try.    It's also fun to get caught up in the many online communities trying to get a second season of Firefly on the air.
0765357151|2.0|It's sad that they had to put Will Smith on the cover in order to generate interest. I'm pretty sure that the movie remake will be much different than this book. There will probably be more action and plot holes will be filled and expanded. And Smith doesn't seem like he could portray the same tortured soul from the book.<br /><br />Anyway, on with the book review - after all the hype I expected something better. This story has influenced a lot of authors and filmmakers so I wanted to like it. And Matheson is the guy who wrote Stir of Echoes which is one of my favorite movies. But I didn't enjoy reading this.<br /><br />The plot seemed to be lacking something and there were not really any characters I could relate to except maybe the dog. In fact, I might have enjoyed this better if it were from the dog's point of view rather than a misogynist drunk who somehow miraculously teaches himself bacteriology and solves the riddle of the plague all by himself.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie was an excellent presentation of Wilbur Wilberforce's passionate political struggle on behalf of ending slave trading.  Compelling and superbly executed!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|After the first two stunning Bourne instalments everyone wanted to know if the conclusion would be just as good.  Well it has surpassed my expectations and once again pushed the bar much higher in this genre.  Right from the start the pace is fast, as though you are carrying on watching the second film.<br /><br />The one criticism I have of the early part is the meeting at Langley between Pamela Landy and CIA Director Ezra Kramer discussing Jason Bourne.  Considering what happens later on in this film I felt that this should have been much more edgier.  I would have expected Kramer to put Landy on the back foot over Bourne and making it clear that she hadn't covered herself with glory over the affair. That would have made  Landy later in the film being shipped off to CIA Deputy Director Noah Vosen's shady operations much more understandable.  Similarly the DVD deleted scenes includes one where Kramer appears before a Senate Select Committee and this really should have been in the film to set out Kramer's character more fully.<br /><br />The confrontations Jason Bourne becomes involved with in this film are powerful though.  You get to understand just how good he is and why the CIA absolutely fear this man.  The Treadstone operation put every effort into the development of this asset and their constant nightmare was Bourne on the loose.  Men and women in the CIA who would normally take the tightest situations in their stride suffer uncharacteristic failures when Bourne's rampaging around the world.<br /><br />My favourite parts of this movie are the fight between Jason Bourne and Desh Bouksani, absolutely stunning.  The speed of these two is breathtaking and by the end you too will be breathless.  Also Jason Bournes distraction machinations against Vosen in New York is wonderful and inspired.  I know some feel that Paul Greengrass' in your face action scenes are overdone, but you really do feel that you're right there in the middle of the action and he has perfected this feeling for the viewer in Ultimatum.  Whereas the car chase in Moscow during Supremacy was too long and overdone, things are kept shorter and much better in Ultimatum.<br /><br />Is there room for more Bourne?  Absolutely! Don't take any notice of those who say that this ties things up nicely and the franchise should be left alone.  Bourne is hot property and he will be back.  The situation surrounding Nicky Parsons is still very much unresolved.  What is it that Jason Bourne doesn't remember?  Has everything rotten in the CIA been resolved now?  I very much doubt that.  I feel that the whole Treadstone/Blackbriar programme runs even deeper and the conspiracy could go much higher.  Has Pamela Landy now crossed those in very high places?  Will there be repercussions for all concerned? We shall see...<br /><br />I am really pleased with the DVD.  For once most of the deleted scenes, many of which seem to very out of place to the actual cut, don't leave you feeling that they should have been included.  There's a whole long list of features and if you are getting this for the holiday then you will be able to sit back and allow yourself to become completely immersed in the bonus features.<br /><br />Overall The Bourne Ultimatum is an outstanding film and this is a very pleasing DVD.  Following the release of The Bourne Supremacy other film makers in the action genre realised that they had to raise their game in the post Bourne movie world.  Now with the release of The Bourne Ultimatum those same movie makers must be scratching their heads and wondering if they can really compete in this Bourne again genre!viewer in Ultimatum.

B000TGCR3I|5.0|This movie shows the real potential of anime as an art form. The animation is beautifully detailed and composed and the editing in the action scenes is spectacular, with breathtaking sweeps of viewpoint and visual angle. The story is by turns exciting, tragic, and touching and all of this is backed up by a great musical score. One of my top 3 or 4 anime films.
0307237702|4.0|Senator Obama has put into print his ideas and experences in his time in Washington. What comes through is the man's optimistic vision of the future, both for America and the world. He brings a point of view shaped by a type of life few have experienced. And it's precisely this difference that allows him a perspective that few Americans share, but most would benefit from.     I wish all the best of success in his quest for the presidency.

B000BCE918|5.0|This was an excellent bargain. The packaging was great and I received it in record time. This was given as a gift and was greatly appreciated.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|{{POSSIBLE SPOILERS}}         I had my reservations for this film, highly muted by the anticipation of actually seeing it, but they were there nonetheless. The basic ideal of 'Alice Clones' made me pause and wonder if they were getting a little too close to the [[ASIN:B00012FXBI Alien - Resurrection]] subplot, but it works better in motion than what you believe (assume) it be in your head. The omission of Jill Valentine (and Angela Ashford) was a sore spot early on, but the Novel covers her absence and Claire more than makes up for her lack of appearance in the film. I also wondered why the plot concerning the US Government moving in to deal with Umbrella and the Alice-villain subplot were scrapped, but that was before I saw the teaser trailer and read the rough summary. While I can totally live with Alice not being the bad guy, I kinda wondered what the film would've been like if they taken one more step with the 'Project Alice' storyline. Oh well.     Unfortunately, I wasn't able to see it in the theaters, I watched it on YouTube and that's the part that really pisses me off. I wasn't able to see either the 1st and 2nd movies (I loved both) when they were in theaters, and when I finally get the opportunity to see it in the theaters this year, the chance is stolen from me. I am hopping mad that I had to go and watch it on the Internet! That aside, the movie was amazing. It really brought back the atmosphere of the first film which was a blend of horror and action, a focus on the characters whereas Apocalypse was an entirely action-oriented movie, which never bothered me, but it does get a little tiresome after watching it for the hundredth time.           The plot was a simple one; The T-Virus containment measure has failed. The T-Virus managed to escape Racoon City within months and spread across the world, reducing the earth to nothing but a barren wasteland. Survivors of the Apocalypse brought on by T-Virus, seek refuge in Alaska after Alice joins up with Claire Redfield's Convoy and tells them of the Journal she discovered. Meanwhile Dr. Issacs attempts to create a \\"cure\\" for the T-Virus, in a half-cocked plan to domesticate the Undead, in order for Umbrella to return to the surface, but to no avail. When he discovers the possible location of Alice, he goes against orders issued to him by Albert Wesker to capture her.      The atmosphere of the film does remind you of the [[ASIN:B00005R2IS Mad Max]] series, even throws in a couple crazy people into the mix, but that's where the resemblance stops. Extinction is its own movie and while its a little slow it getting started, the results are pleasing. Of course, the biggest complaint people will have against this film, is the fact that it moves the furthest away from the original settings of the dark and onimus atmosphere of the game series and the first two films, with its take on the word devesated by the T-Virus (The terrible \\"What If\\" that always lurked in the back of any character of RE's multiuniverse series). However, it never fails to deliver on the atmosphere of the game's main focus: Dark Corridors and Zombies (Crimson Heads included). As promised, the gore and violence are bought way above the level of the second and first film, which for the first time in my life, didn't bother me. It wasn't Gritutious violence and gore, but enough to give it the \\"R\\" Rating (that, and the ever popular Milla-Nudity). The zombies are brought back into the foreground of the storyline and aren't simply seen stumbling about in the background or jumping out of graves Thriller style. The introduction of the Crimson Heads from [[ASIN:B0000657SP RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE (2002)]] was excellent and helped the intesnity of the dire situation.     The performances of the actors are much better this time around. Despite the lack of knowledge Ali Larter ([[ASIN:B000QDLSR0 HEROES]]) had on CAPCOM's Resident Evil series, or the character herself, she managed to create a convincing portrayal of an older Claire Redfield, who's still looking for her brother [according to the novelization]. Milla Jovovich's Alice (the Human BioWeapon of Umbrella) is characterized with a little more humanity and personality as opposed to her character in \\"Apocalypse\\". Jovoich's acting abilities have improved greatly and it shows in her performance.     Ohed Fehr continues to charm as Carlos Oliveira, even if I never will get used to that haircut of his. Mike Epps returns as a less quirky and funny L.J, with a considerably smaller role but is a important part of the film's subplot conerning one of the main characters. Spencer Locke ([[ASIN:B000IFRT2Y Monster House]]), simlpy known as K-Mart [Girl], doesn't fail to impress with an interesting character who, thankfully, never falls into the \\"annoying horror movie kid\\" catageory. Ian Glenn's performance, however, is less than stellar and rather boring until the end of the movie. The rest of the supporting cast (good and evil) manages to be pleasing without becoming the unbearable cannon fodder you wish to see die, even if that is the fate of most of them. I couldn't complain about Ashanti's acting as Nurse Betty. Granted, her line deliveries were a bit on the bland side, as she was not in the film long enough for proper judging, but I can say her character was hardly charismatic.     The CGI for Resident Evil has once again improved on itself; Everything blends in seamlessly with the real-world environment and the stunts are much more grounded with reality. The kukhri knives are probably the coolest and dealiest weapon used in the film, and the action sequences their featured in are amazing. Milla Jovovich shows off her martial arts prowess, performing most of the stunts herself and never fails to impress. The score composed by Charlie Clouser is alright at times. Its not up the par with Marylin Manson or Jeff Danna's scores but its a decent electronic-orchestral themed score, even you can't hear it most of the time (FX kinda distractsyou).     All in all, I enjoyed Resident Evil: Extinction. Its by far one of the best Summer Movie \\"Finales\\" I've seen this year. Russell Mulcahy ([[ASIN:B00005RYL9 Highlander]]) manages to bring a charcter and beauty to the film, that was seriously lacking in Apocalypse under the helm of Rookie Director Alexander Witt. If they ever decide to make a fourth one and Anderson, Milla, Ali Larter, and Spencer Locke are on board with it, I would go and see it. But given that its simply speculation and rumors, I won't hold my breath. --- [a 5 out of 5]

0486236951|4.0|This books has good illustrations of the stitches used, and many good designs, though I was hoping to find more information about the history of the designs. I'm using them predominantly for Civil War reenacting, and wanted my embroidery to be authentic. The price was good -- as is true of most Dover publications, so I think this was well worth the price I paid, if not more so.    This would be a good book for beginners, especially if one looks at it as an open-ended guide that allows for individual creativity and use of colored threads.

B000RW3YYA|5.0|I think Stargate series are best sci-fi TV shows ever. It keeps developing itself and they have good budget for production. Scripts are well written and stories are succesfully evolving.<br />DVD case does not occupy much space in terms of storage, which is excellent if you have hundreds of DVDs. I strongly recommend.
B000TUXL2A|2.0|I love Mark Knopfler,especially his solo career stuff. However, this ones a bit boring at times, many songs sound the same,there are two cuts though that are some of his best works.Heart full of holes, and The fish and the bird\\" are both stunning in their own way.

0800141660|5.0|What is there not to like about this movie? If anyone likes Jane Austen, this is fairly true to the book, without being 5 hours long, not that being that long is a bad thing. Emma Thompson's screenplay is excellent. The character of Elinor properly displays the reticence of the Regency era, and Marianne embodies the new Romanticism that was beginning to emerge at that time. Their younger sister, Margaret, provided the much needed voice that stated the obvious when everyone else pretended it didn't exist. She really helped relieve the tension surrounding the social suppression of the times. The commentaries were excellent, too, and showed why it was so good for a man from Taiwan to have made a film about women in Regency England. You'll have to buy the DVD and listen to the commentaries to see what I mean. Hearing Emma Thompson's acceptance speech at the Golden Globe Awards was almost enough by itself.
1591396190|5.0|I spotted this book in the Harvard Business Review magazine a couple months ago. I took it out of my local library and after the first chapter stopped reading it returned it and immediately bought a copy. This is a book that requires a notepad, two or more highlighters, and those postit flags to mark the important things to remember.   I literally couldn't put it down. I have used their Strategy Canvas to help our company work on developing a strategic plan for an entire new product offering.  Incredible look at strategy, a must read for business owners, managers and certainly Strategic Planners.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I had been looking at starting to collect the dvd's for Gilmore Girls.  I knew it would be something I would love to watch for years.  It is hard to part with all the money at one time for all seven seasons, but once done I am glad that I have them all.  I don't have to wait to buy the next season, I have it already.  The extras are OK, but the real prize is the complete series.  So if you feel like you can part with the cash and you love the Gilmores, then this set is for you.
B000ULQV0W|3.0|This c.d. is better than I thought it would be, in that its a solo project and about a specific story line,which , by the way I havent seen.Its Vedder at his best however,there are a bunch of great tunes on it,a couple really rock as well, and some reflective tunes I.E. mellow etc.Some Pearl Jam Ive liked, some I havent,this is a strong outing for Eddie Vedder.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Loved this movie! I could watch it over and over! Great for adults and kids of all ages.
B0007P0LO8|3.0|If you're looking for a screen adaptation of Madama Butterfly, your best bet would be to choose Madame Butterfly made in 1995 starring Richard Troxell. This dvd version is barely above a filmed stage version, and perhaps a filmed stage version would have been better than the absolutely atrocious staging. If you are looking for a fantastic version of Madama Butterfly to listen to, then get the recording with Freni and Domingo. The acting in this dvd is definitely a reason to get it, if only for Mirella Freni and Christa Ludwig, who make this movie in the part of acting. Domingo has a great voice but the acting is so-so. If you can get past the complete lack of budget for this movie (Butterfly's 'kimono' doesn't even have the sleeves finished, if you notice, they're fraying because they were just cut) and past the fact that Pinkerton is in a t-shirt, then this is a decent dvd. Get this for the vocals alone, but get the newer version of a visual and aural experience that will be the only version of Madame Butterfly you'll ever need.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Classic Movie!!  Very intriguing!  Sound quality is not GREAT - but is ok.  I still couldn't stop watching until it was over!!  Definitely recommended if you are into the twisted, etc.
0316067598|5.0|This book is a heartbreaking, moving story of the last man to survive Operation Redwing, and the truth behind it. The book tells the story of navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and four others that made up the SEAL team #10 that carried out operation 'Redwing'. The area was named \\"Murphy's Ridge' after one of the Seals that lost his life that day, with Marcus being the 'Lone Survivor\\". Marcus was presented with the Purple Heart, the others were awarded it posthumously This book of courage and dedication to country is one that should be read by all Americans and should be required reading in the schools.
B000WCBPOG|4.0|As an eternal Beatles fan I was ready to hate this movie and the music.  I was pleasantly surprised that both a 51 and a 21 year old could equally enjoy both.  This set of CDs is a great deal considering the 1 CD set is a similar price and you miss out on several great songs.
0394818237|4.0|[[ASIN:0394818237 Richard Scarry's What Do People Do All Day]]    I bought this book reluctantly as it was a bit out of my price range.  However, according to Sonlight's preschool list I needed it.  I tend to pick and choose between the Sonlight books anyway...but I took the plunge and bought this one.    When I received it I admit I was disappointed - not in the book itself, but in that it was too old for my son.  Sonlight recommends it for a 2-3 year old.  Hmmmm.  It's more appropriate for a 4-5 year old if you ask me.    So it was just sitting on the table....and then my husband walked by.  Oh my GOSH!  I can't remember the last time I've seen him so animated about a book!  He grabbed it \\"I had this when I was a child!\\" he declared in thrilled tones, \\"I LOVED it!  It's BRILLIANT!  I would spend HOURS looking at the way all the things worked.\\"     He then proceeded to thumb through the book; it brought back many many happy memories for him.  =)    So my point is...my 2 year old is thoroughly uninterested in it, but in another couple of years I'll be very surprised if he doesn't adore this book as much as my husband does.  =D

B000OYC3J8|4.0|Like a lot of people, I was a little confused when Jack White formed the Raconteurs. While I never actually got the chance to hear any song off that album other than \\"Steady, As She Goes\\", I was relieved to learn that the White Stripes weren't breaking up after all, and then I rushed out to get their latest album.<br /><br />While I'm not sure what Icky Thump means, this is just as great an album as Get Behind Me Satan was (maybe even better). The title track (which also scored the duo their first pop hit) is quality, and there are plenty of other standouts to choose from, like \\"Little Cream Soda\\", \\"Effect and Cause\\" and \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\". And if you're looking for another spoken word selection, you should be pleased with \\"Rag and Bone\\".<br /><br />Another highlight is \\"300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues\\", although the guitar break after the second verse is a little disorganized. And on every White Stripes album, there's always one song that just doesn't seem to fit -- actually, it's two songs that blend into each other: \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\" and \\"St. Andrews (This Battle Is in the Air)\\", because they're so folksy that they sound out of place compared to the rest of the album. I also didn't care for their cover of Patti Page's \\"Conquest\\".<br /><br />I was surprised to find that there is no solo from Meg on here (but that's not a problem because she really isn't the greatest singer). But Icky Thump is an album that reminds me why the White Stripes are one of my favorite bands, so it's definitely worth buying.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0439882826|5.0|Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy--I can hardly wait for my 5-year old twin grandsons to open this for Christmas. It was on their wish list. It is much nicer than shown or described on Amazon. It is a fantastic book that has great pop-ups to keep the boys interest. Matthew Reinhart did an outstanding job illustrating the galaxy. I know this is a book they will pick up often. For a serious collector of Star War items, this would be a great addition to a collection.

B000VBJEEG|2.0|Based on the ads, I'd expected this film to focus on the rat character.  Instead, after a good start, it focused heavily on the 'human' characters, thereby losing much of its charm.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Is this movie flawed=yes, is it still an exciting and well made movie=heck yes!   Not sure how this film will translate when it goes to DVD (you are going to need to watch it on a big widescreen TV) but in the theatre it was beautiful to watch. The film makers stretched their limited budget and made a picture that has some amazing images.   The 1st and 2nd acts of this movie had me thinking \\"wow-this could be a classic\\" but the film does stumble in the 3rd act and what could have been a great film is turned into a good film. Yes, the film borrows/steals from the best but the images along with very good acting from the leads helps lift it above these weaknesses.   Watch it on as Big a Screen as you can and enjoy what I consider one of my favorite summer popcorn movie.   In Short - much better than most other so called \\"fun summer movies\\" that came out in 2007
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a wonderful family movie. I purchased it for my 5-year old twin grandsons. However, they soon lost interest in the movie and went on to play with other toys. If they were a couple years older, the movie would have held their attention; or if the entire family sat together and watched the movie so there could have been input from family members, I think the boys would have enjoyed the movie. I rated it as 5 stars because it is an excellent family movie. Just don't expect to put little ones in front of it to watch--they will probably lose interest also.

B0001CCXZW|3.0|This DVD was very beat up when I received it. The container was falling apart and the DVDs were very scratched I could barely watch them. The condition said \\"Used-Like New.\\"
B00005JPUN|4.0|If you ignore the original two versions of this storyline, you will find that this is a well-done movie.  The characters do things that require a stretch of the imagination to justify but that is what movies are for - to escape from reality.  Good movie.  Too bad the professional reviewers are so prejudice against any movie that is not about real life death or sorrow, or is an \\"artistic\\" model.
1558908382|5.0|John Cusack is great!  I love this movie, great comedy.  Sound track is great too.
0684830515|2.0|This title is way over rated. Written by Earnest Hemingway, it is basically a story about a group of misfit alcoholics jumping from drink to drink. It is written in a narrative style that reminds me of a grade school reader. It does spend a few pages on the bull fighting fiesta in Pamplona Spain.  Sorry, I cannot recommend this book at all.    If you want a good book go read Virginia Wolfe (To The Lighthouse), William Faulkner (Light in August) or Thomas Mann (The Magic Mountain).
0515141429|5.0|What's great about Lee Child is that he delivers suspense and action without cliche. His Jack Reacher is fully realized and his thriller writing is complex with layers of mystery and intrigue along with the violence and action. Killing Floor is the first book in the Jack Reacher series. The opening of this book alone is worth the price of admission. If you have any doubt, don't. Read Lee Child, you will not be disappointed!
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|A reference quality disc. Everyone knows the film, so I'm just going to address the quality of the Blu-Ray. If you want to know if it's worth upgrading, I give a resounding yes. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Blu-Ray looks razor sharp. I watched it in 1080i, because my HD TV can't do full 1080p, and in 1080i it looked absolutely incredible. I can only imagine how gorgeous it looks in 1080p.    The Quidditch match in particular looks stunning. The bright colors jump out like they did the first time I saw this on the big screen, and you can count individual blades of grass during the final close up of Harry's victorious smile. Cloaks and scarves and lanterns and many small things throughout the film have never looked this alive on standard DVD.     Sound is presented in PCM 5.1 or Dolby Digital 5.1 EX.    I can wholeheartedly recommend adding the Blu-Ray versions of the Potter films to your library if you've got the hardware. You won't be disappointed.
0786838655|5.0|When I first read Riordan's The Lightning Thief, I was thrilled to find a book that is not only a great story but one that brings mythology to life. When I read the book out loud with a class of ten year old boys, not only did they want to read the sequel, but they began to make all kinds of connections and challenged themselves to read, read, read! When The Titan's Curse came out in May, we took an impromptu field trip to celebrate their success and are anxiously awaiting the fourth installment.  Another wonderful feature is that Percy Jackson is dyslexic, ADHD, and an unlikely hero, not unlike Harry Potter or even Anakin Skywalker.
B000VECAEO|5.0|a lot of people talk about how season nine was dissapointing and not as good as previous seasons but i disagree entirely. There are some hilarious episodes including a few my favorites such as \\"The maid\\". The extras are great and the bloopers are unbelievable as they have been in every season. I now have the whole collection 1-9 and watch them all the time.
1580176941|5.0|As a dedicated cookie crafter, I am always on the look-out for books that focus on cookie decorating techniques. This is, hands down, the most thorough, detailed and clever book on the market. It is great for a beginner, because detailed pictures illustrate each technique. For the advanced decorator, the book offers some new ideas. A great, great resource.
B000I2J0W4|5.0|To be honest, when I first viewed this film in the early eighties, I thought that Stanley Kubrick had completely ruined Stephen King's best novel. But, now that i'm able to mentally segregate the film from the book, this is a classic horror film with a terrific DVD transfer that I saw last night. As for the movie, simply take a recovering alcoholic prone to visions and flashbacks (Nicholson), pair him with a son who's got many problems himself despite psychiatric reassurances(Lloyd) and bundle this up with a sane mother who looks insane(Duvall))and you've got all the ingredients for a winning tri-fecta at sea level. Add a secluded mountaintop hotel with a notorious past  that this trio will inhabit alone for the next six months, and you have all that you really need to know. Now, go buy a perfect stocking stuffer for the \\"King\\" residing in you.
0525950079|4.0|This is the third Ken Follett book read in the last two months...first I read A Dangerous Fortune, then Pillars Of The Earth, and I just completed World Without End this morning.  Maybe because of that, I've found Follett's historical novels to be very similar plot wise to each other.  In fact, it almost seems that his plot outline of 'Pillars' was kept on his desk for both Dangerous Fortune and WWOE and he referred to it and copied from it often while he wrote them.  For those who read these novels over a much longer period of time (which is probably most reading this), this may not be so glaringly obvious; however, at many times I felt frustrated, because a sense of deja vu hung over the book.  In fact, several times I had to remind myself in WWOE that I was reading about Merthin and Caris in the fourteenth century - not Jack and Ariana in the twelfth century.    ****spoiler warning****  It seems Folletts favorite plot device in each of these books, is to have  two of his main characters fall deeply in love with each other, and then keep them apart at least two-thirds of the book.  Oh, and did I mention that the woman has to have a strong feminist personality with a stubborn streak, and the guy has to be exceptionally intelligent in everything, but clueless in understanding women (when it furthers the plot anyway).  This makes great drama for one book, and maybe two, but by the time I read this, it felt so contrived to have Caris and Merthin torn apart so many times that I didn't even care much anymore for what happened between them in the latter half; I kept my feelings at a distance because I knew I was being emotionally manipulated.  Besides that sticking point, let me give what I feel to be the major pros and cons of this book:    PROS:  Follett is always a great storyteller, but his 'writing' seems to have gotten quite a bit better in the 18 years since POTE.  I say 'writing' because the latter half of Pillars seemed very rushed, had some loose ends left dangling, and was a general letdown to me compared with how excellent much of the first half of the book was.  WWOE is much better paced throughout, the ending more satisfying, and not as abrupt.  Follett also did much better this time at NOT endlessly retelling the first half of the book in the second half of the book as he did ad nauseum in POTE. All in all, very compelling reading that I sometimes found difficult to put down.    CONS:  Recycled characters and plot points from earlier books, overused plot 'twists', and the unnecessary explicit sex scenes - as usual. I don't know why the author feels compelled to include a mini anatomy lesson every time two characters have sex; it adds very little to the story, and it feels like a cut and paste job each time (if I have to hear the words 'hairy triangle' or 'his prick' one more time I'm going to puke).  Also, even though as a man I have a great appreciation for women's breasts, Ken Follett seems to have an adolescent obsession with them far beyond any other mainstream author I have read (especially with his characters need to squeeze them). \\"Mr. Follett if you're listening on this, LESS is MORE!\\"
B00005ATQ9|1.0|By reading the other reviews, I appear not to be the first consumer who fell prey to the new box cover.  Despite the new artwork that says \\"Newly Restored and Remastered\\", this is the same master as the previous versions.  I had previously purchased the earlier version (letterboxed and poor quality).  I had been waiting for a newly mastered version, and when I saw this new artwork (and that all of the other Warner Kubrick titles had been remastered for enhanced 16X9 viewing), I figured that BARRY LYNDON had also been.  My big mistake and my great disappointment. So much for truth in packaging.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is, quite simply the best show on television. I have loaned these dvds to 3 of my friends and within 2 days each of them watched the entire season. The character development is excellent, the acting is superb and the storyline is inventive and unique.
B00005JLCI|2.0|When this Hamlet first came out in the theatre, Ie thought it was great.  It's taken years for the DVD to be released, and I couldn't wait.  I was badly disappointed.  There are some good points: \\"to be, or not to be\\" is interesting; Polonius is impressive inlife and in death (lots of blood)--his advice to Laertres is sincere, not caricature. Polonius is  very convincing as the scheming two faced character he really is; Derek Jacobi's Claudius is convincing, like the entire play should be, he's a sincere stepfather and  a sincere villian. Guildenstern is uncomfortably slackk jawed and brain dead.  Jack Lemmon has absolutely no expression as the guard who first sees the Ghost?!! Robin Williams as the page???  Julie Christie as Gertrude goes from helpless to murderous without batting an eyelash. And worst of all, I think Branagh actually chews on some of the scenery at one point.  It takes him longer to die than any opera satire would dare.  The last scene in which he's carried Christ-like like after Fortinbras' arrival is to laugh.  Branagh's Henry V was great, as good or better than Olivier's version.  HJis Hamlet is a four hour bore bettered by almost any of the other modern film versions.  Oh that this too, too, stolid film would melt away!    Sorry, I really didn't like it.
0765318741|5.0|Not at all what I expected.  I read the book in preparation for the movie - now I'm even more interested to see how the film version is handled. Great, fast read - easily done in one sitting.  This version of the book is about 1/2 short stories after the I Am Legend story.
1576751988|3.0|I've read about and taught time managemtn for over 20 years. The book reminds me strongly of Edwin Bliss's \\"Getting Things Done\\". The chapters are consice and informative, but there really isn't anything new here. If you are looking for a book to help the disorganized, this will certainly help. However, if you are at all read in this field, you will find it a disappointment.

0385474547|3.0|Things Fall Apart, by noted author Chinua Achebe, is the fictional story of a family living in a small village, weathering and tolerating clan and religious traditions, until the coming of the British, who bring their own set of \\"clan\\" and religious traditions.<br /><br />It's also a misogynistic tale full of anger and violence.<br /><br />Achebe develops a story that has, as its key insult, to be called a woman.  The reader is reminded of this over and over:<br /><br />\\"That was why he had called him a woman.  Okonkwo knew how to kill a man's spirit\\" (p. 26).<br /><br />\\"No matter how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man\\" (p. 53).<br /><br />\\"If any one of you prefers to be a woman, let him follow Nwoye now while I am alive so that I can curse him\\" (p. 172).<br /><br />\\"He mourned for the clan, which he saw breaking up and falling apart, and he mourned for the warlike men of Umuofia, who had so unaccountably become soft like women\\" (p. 183).<br /><br />There is an interesting story here, but the stories of the women are not just hidden and untold, but they are ground into kola nut paste.  Frankly, Achebe is either not interested, or not able, to incorporate a female perspective in this tale.  It is an ancient male fantasy of control and dominion.  Beat the wife who is late with dinner.  But she still exists 24/7.  How can she be invisible?<br /><br />The answer, I believe, lies in the location (Africa) and Achebe's creative period for this book (it was first published in 1959).  If written today, it would be a different story.  But the misogyny is still key.  This is a story written by one who didn't understand women, even in 1959.<br /><br />I wonder about its attraction today. Are we to pity the poor, \\"uncivilized\\" Africans?  Are we to accept the deletion of women as significant in a community?<br /><br />So... interesting, but irritating.  Well-written, but brutal enough to lack \\"classic\\" status.  This is not Africa, and even in the past, Africa was a big enough place that this tale didn't \\"speak\\" for all clans, tribes, and nations.<br /><br />On the back cover, the promotional material states \\"Uniquely and richly African, at the same time it reveals Achebe's keen awareness of the human qualities common to men of all times and places.\\"  I don't think so.big enough place that this tale didn't \\"speak\\" for all clans, tribes, and nations.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Wow. This is my favorite version. I watch it frequently. I did not believe I would like any other but A & E's version of Pride and Prejudice. I believe this version (although shorter) is truer to the emotions most likely felt by the lead characters. I also preferred the casting of the other characters overall. If you are only going to purchase one version of Pride & Prejudice then this is the one I recommend.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a great family movie, created from the great imagination of Jim Henson.  The Labyrinth is a classic film of fantasy that fits the taste of adults and nurtures the imagination of the younger generation.  - A film for all ages.  I watched this movie as a child myself, and I have never lost my love for the puppetry and the acting skills of David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly.  I believe this was actually the movie that I fell in love with David Bowie and his music.  The soundtrack for this movie is suggested for music lovers like myself.  This movie is easy to fall in love in love with, and can revive any imagination and creative thought easily.  It is something for everyone to enjoy!
B000XR49VQ|3.0|Prospero' s books represented a regrettable achievement, because all of us are aware about the daring artistic proposal of Peter Greenaway, but in this opportunity, the visual grandiloquence surpassed by far, the dialogue. On the other hand, the superb cast remained less that relegated, being Gielguld the narrator who supported the drama.

The only thing negative about this recording is that you can't see how poised and elegant she is; no histrionics, just gorgeous music played exquisitly.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Martin Scorsese's seminal, defining film finally gets the Special Edition it has rightfully deserved for so very long.  This Two-Disc Collector's Edition of Taxi Driver packs a bevy of special features that not only outline the film's history, but it's impact on American cinema, and the impact of Scorsese to boot.  Featuring a new commentary track from writer Paul Schrader, featurettes and discussions with Scorsese, Schrader, Robert De Niro, Oliver Stone, and Roger Corman among others, retrospectives on Schrader's inspirations on writing the film, and comparisons between Travis Bickle's New York of 1975 to the New York of the present day.  As for the film itself, well, chances are if you're reading this, you already know what to expect here, and you already know what a classic Taxi Driver is.  Needless to say, even if you already own the original edition of Taxi Driver on DVD, this new Collector's Edition is a must own for longtime fans of one of the most influential and important films to come out of the 1970's.

B000UNYK3A|4.0|I originaly saw Hostel in the theatre, and will admit that I am one of those who couldn't make it through to the end.  The level of gore and grossness that Eli Roth brought into this film was shocking, explicit and the most outrageous I had ever seen on screen.  Though there have been many films in the past that have done even worse, Hostel has a more realistic feel to it - and I felt I was actually in the film upon initial watch.  Scary thing.  After awhile, I decided to give it another try.  I am glad I did.  I missed out on a very satisfying ending, and more, realizing there is a film here beneath all the gore and blood.<br /><br />The other thing that got on my nerve the first time I saw Hostel was the ongoing sex and nudity throughout the first 30 minutes of the film.  But, I realized the characters are college boys, and that's just what they do best.  Now whatever the message Roth was sending out with this film or what some people get out of it, I saw a simple message clear as day - trust no one - especially in a foreign country.  And if something is too good to be true, it usually is.  That's what happens with these young men.  And the fact that they are American makes it even worse - there are people that pay handsomely to see Americans suffer, and that's where the real guts (so to speak) of this movie lies.  Torture scenes are brutal and inventive, and will leave a mark (on the viewer too!).  After a few viewings, it seems mild now but still has a very scary element to it each time I watch.  I would have to say its Roth's use of the camera and lighting, and the dark setting where this takes place that makes it so creepy every time I watch.<br /><br />This unrated director's cut contains two verison of the film - thank God.  The original, as seen in theatres, is fortunately there too.  The reason I say fortunately is because the alternate ending on the cut version was very dissapointing - and not satisfying at all like the original.  Fortunately, here you get both.  This dvd is still worth the buy to see the difference between the two endings.<br /><br />I felt dirty and I took a shower - thats how I felt coming home from the theatre that night.  But its ok, its just a movie.  It still has its morals - good defeats evil in the end.  Give it a second try if you haven't yet, all that gore really blocks us from seeing a deeper picture at first.  If you have not seen this yet, watch with caution.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 4dvd is still worth the buy to see the difference between the two endings.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|Given the high ratings elsewhere for this animated movie, I expected more.  The animation was great and the story was cute, if simple, but it just did not touch me emotionally.  Even taking into account that I'm an adult, it still lacked something from my view.    Don't get me wrong.  Great for the kids.  Some nifty animated scenes, like the ride through the sewers of Paris, but it just felt like something was missing.    William J. Trinkle

0374280967|5.0|Alan Bennett is surely one of the funniest writers of all time.  And with this book, he scores another big hit.  It can be read in an afternoon, but it will be one of the most enjoyable afternoons imaginable.  HRM takes her regal hits in this spoof, but she also shines with a humanity that neither we, nor she, suspected she had.  Funny and warm, acerbic and kind, Bennett can play both extremes simultaneously.  Now that's talent.
B000002G87|5.0|Sometimes magic happens in the midst of high-strung talent, and such happened here. Duane Allman, (bless 'im!) complements Clapton's guitar as well as Bobby Whitlock's voice does Eric's scratchy rock 'n' roll holler. I'm going out on an arguable limb here...this album is the best rock album ever made, and Layla the best rock song ever recorded.
0307387178|5.0|This is the best book I have read this year. I purchased it for my mother for Christmas, but could not keep myself from reading it first. I absolutely devoured it and was sad when it came to an end. It was an incredibly moving book. Just when it seemed as though Chris McCandless might actually be showing some real signs of personal growth and maturity, he lost his future. I was deeply saddened for his family and could really feel their pain. I would recommend this book 100%.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|As action movies go this is about as good as it gets. In keeping with it's two predecessors this movie rattles along at a high octane pace and never lets up, racking up the tension to brain busting levels, so don't blink or you'll miss some vital clue as to what's actually going on! Damon reprises his role as super-agent Jason Bourne, completely overshadowing those other `JBs', Bauer and Bond, in the process and once again succeeds, largely, in outsmarting the baddies masquerading as goodies, in the form of David Straitharn, looking far more creepy than Chris Cooper ever managed, and Albert Finney, looking suspiciously like Brian Cox! Joan Allen is also back as the anti-heroine Pam Landy and the result is a more than satisfying thriller in which paranoia rules.<br /><br />All three films are firmly in the tradition established by the likes of Alan J Pakula - in the 1970's with The Parallax View and All the President's Men - and Sidney Pollack with Three Days of the Condor and, the much more recent, Enemy of the State, directed by Tony Scott in that they deal with the uncomfortable issue of the accountability or otherwise of non-elected government officials and the seemingly limitless paramilitary and technological power relinquished to their control by our supposedly responsible government representatives! However, satisfyingly and, of course, herein lies much of the trilogy's appeal, in Bourne's case, it is these very villains who end up being paranoid, never knowing when the ultimate weapon, of their creation, is going to appear and exact a well deserved retribution.
B000E97HIA|1.0|I have always loved Prince. He is a great entertainer. I have been to a few of his concerts and he has to be one of the most talented artists ever but this album just didn't do it for me. That is thing about him though it's his music I just wasn't into this album.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Everything about this DVD is great. For some reason I think I may have come across and acoustic version of Echoes. But going back to review it again I couldn't find it. I must have dreamed it up.      Review part two.  Remember that night - David Gilmour    The sound and video is like as live as you can get with great quality. Just like PINK Floyds Pulse DVD concert. You can hear every part of each song, and not have to be so loud. Ha Ha.   All songs are Pink Floyd, with no doubt.  On an island is a keeper of trust that it's truly David Gilmour.   And the rest of the musical show is just to sit back and enjoy. Buy the DVD with no questions asked. All music on this DVD is great.  New and classic songs are crafted well. (Crosby and Nash) YES.  The guitar work of David Gilmour has so much soul for (Wish you were here) and vocal added by Crosby and Nash is just perfect for the ear.    There is a hidden track of Echoes on disk 2. Enter music tracks. Then enter Dark globe and it will play.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|\\"Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" was a gripping film.  The myriad of DVD extras on the bonus disc give the viewer a feel for what it was like for the actors and filmmakers.  The shrunken head comedy routine was cute on the Bonus disc.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter is developing into a strong actor.  Rupert Grint as Ron and Emma Watson as Hermione give strong support.  Maggie Smith continues as a strong presence in the films, as her two Oscar wins for \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" and \\"California Suite\\" might foreshadow.  I found the transition to Michael Gambon's Dumbledore to be seamless, although it's hard to replace an actor of Richard Harris' stature.  David Thewlis as Lupin adds a nice flare to the film as does Gary Oldman's Serius Black.  I also appreciated Julie Christie's brief appearance as Madame Rosmerta and Dawn French as the Fat Lady.  This film received two Oscar nominations for John Williams' score and for Best Visual Effects.  Director Alfonso Cuaron does an excellent job at the helm.  I found the Death Eaters to be very scary.  This is an excellent addition to this film series.  Enjoy!

I had a big stuffed tiger when I was kid. :)  The reason I was named after him was due to my cute, funny antics and stinker/brat-like qualities. Anyway, I love this collector's set! I've always wanted to get it and for a time online retailers just didn't have it, but it's back now and costs way less here on Amazon! My packaging sucked, the box was torn and tattered and about to fall apart on a redelivery, but fortunately my product wasn't damaged. This could be an isolated incident as far as packaging goes and I was somewhat worried there, but at least the bubble protectors kept it intact. This thing is heavy! lol. There is nothing better than Bill Watterson's creative genius, especially with today's comics' poor qualities and values (money-hungry ones). The intro by Bill himself will tell you all and why he didn't care about the spotlight. Now I understand why he retired and I agree with him.

B000JJSJR8|5.0|This is based off a true story as well as a documentary I watched recently. It is really wild! We get exceptional performances from all actors involved, many who came from Goodfellas. Sharon Stone does a decent job here too, as well as James Woods of course. Joe Pesci is really funny and it's interesting how they narrate it like in Goodfellas. The picture quality on this HD-DVD is fantastic! I would say it could very well be reference. I got this free from the HD-DVD Toshiba offer but it would have been well spent if I bought it. Vegas baby all the way!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I know this sounds trite, but \\"Amazing Grace\\" is an amazing movie.  The reason it is amazing, is that is based on a TRUE story.  How one man, with dogged determination and faith -- can (and did) make a difference.  He (along with others, of course) is responsible for ending slavery in England -- leading, ultimately, to the \\"abolition\\" of slavery in the United States as well.  My only criticism is of the name of the movie itself (\\"Amazing Grace\\") -- because when I hear those words, I think of the song and the story of John Newton.  Well written and well acted by an excellent cast.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|Great album.  This album is a move towards the technical with Muse-like base patches on songs like Red Carpet Massacre.  Guitar takes a back seat.  The hip hop angle works on songs like Skindive.  It's a little hard to tell how much will be pre-programmed live but I look forward to finding out.
0312995423|2.0|Brown wrote two doppelgangers that copy the structure and style of this book: \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". And those two were better by far. Once again, Brown writes about a woman who is both a genius and graced with a supermodel's body. Her other half is a very attractive, intelligent professor (they're always professors).     The language is a thin butter of overused clichés scraped over too many details of what the characters look like and how they function on a daily basis. The reader isn't allowed to use their imaginations because Brown is too busy nailing down every person, place and thing with exact and dreary verbiage.     I'm not a Brown-basher. I enjoyed \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" for their entertainment value. But, perhaps I can only stomach two Brown books before the novelty wears off, and this was the third that pushed me to the brink. Had I read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" third, I may be complaining about it instead. But I'm not.
0143038583|4.0|A great read if you are interested in where your food comes from and how that has changed in just the past 20 years. Should be on every required reading list at every American high school. It would have such an impact on the way kids (and all of us) make choices about what we eat, where we buy our food. Such a basic part of being a huiman being.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I didn't want to like Supernatural.  I have been a Buffy fan forever and Supernatural didn't seem to have the continuity and the lure that I felt Buffy did.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Granted, Supernatural doesn't have the \\"have to see the next episode\\" motif like Buffy or 24.  The characters do seem a little cardboardish at times and I got tired of hearing about \\"family,\\" etc., but for some reason I couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />Like the aforementioned shows (and Vernoica Mars), Supernatural has something I love.  Continuity.  Even though Sam and Dean continue solving and helping mysteries and murders across the US, they still are after their father and the thing that killed their mother and Jessica.  Just when you think they've forgotten about it, BAM, a quick line pulls you right back into the mother-story.  Weapons and clues scattered throughout the season come back and rear their heads in the season finale that has me itching for Season II.  Great show.  I'm shocked I like it this much.
0060229357|5.0|Timeless classic book.  Wonderful story, simple enough for young and older children to enjoy.  Encourages imagination and imaginary play.
1878424505|4.0|I purchased the audio version of this book and gave a printed copy to a friend going through some 'life stuff'. Peter Coyote reads the audio version and he's always a hit with me. I found the book refreshing; however, if you've been on a path of discovery for some time, this book may be a bit basic--unless of course you need to be reminded of the basics, not an unheard of circumstance. My friend, who is just beginning to see himself as God made him, could not say enough about how much the book meant to him, so that should be included in my commentary. I certainly respect the good doctor's change of heart to becoming a teacher. I, too, struggle with the 'image' given me versus my true nature and, if that's a struggle for you, this book is one read along the path you should consider. I've bought the trilogy and think this book would be a good first choice of the three.
0743201140|5.0|Buckingham and Clifton have done an excellent job of identifying the strengths of individuals according to their research.  The book is well written and allows you to delve into each personality type and to understand how strengths when harnessed can become the secret to a top performing team.  The questions asked are also exactly what I was thinking - what can I do with the information I have now discovered from the previous book \\"First, break all the Rules\\".  I really believe you need to buy both books to really understand how the Gallup Survey has been conducted to understand the analysis.  I would highly recommend this book and particularly so, if your organisation has used this methodology to rate their managers.
B0009DBXXG|5.0|The great documentary and a fantastic treat for not only opera fans but all kinds.It is also a very good study of the  great artists, like Leonard Bernstein, Kari Te Kanawa, Jose Carrrreras,,,and etc. They work very hard, just like any other  plain people, in order to to create a piece of work.  And I think Kiri was at the top of her career,when this was made.
0977326403|5.0|Collins does a great job of contrasting and offering adaptations of the Good to Great for non-profit and government.  Conpanion to good to great, must read the original first to make sense of this one.  Recommended.
B00000ING2|1.0|I have loved almost every Coen Bros movie I've seen, and consider most of them all-time classics, (Raising Arizona, Millers Crossing, Fargo, the Big Lebowski, etc etc).  So it was with great eagerness that I popped this one into the DVD player!  Let me tell ya, (Bub!- haha... not), it's a rare film that I can't sit thru.  This one I had to turn off about 1/2 way thru.  It just rubbed me the wrong way.      Judging from the reviews, lots of people seemed to enjoy this movie.  So don't take my word for it.  Go ahead: watch it anyway.  But don't say I didn't warn you.
B000YABV90|4.0|This is the best feel good film of the holiday season, folks! Aside from a few overly sappy moments - and a pitifully miscast Robin Williams - this was a treat for the eyes and ears that should not be missed. I personally think that Freddy Highmore should gain an Oscar nomination for his work here. The score also deserves a nomination, by the way. It is simply breathtaking. This film, if anything, will have you pulling out all of your classical music CD's. SEE IT.
1582701709|5.0|Having read so many negative reviews i really feel pity that people cannot believe in themselves and the power of attraction.<br /><br />Even before i bought this book i believed in the power of attraction out of my sheer experiences.  It takes an indepth passion and belief in everything you do to attract the positives to your lives.<br />When i came across this book i was thrilled to understand that such powers exists.<br />The book is an descriptive of how the power of attraction works.  Positives attract positives and we can draw similar parallels into our lives inorder to make it better.<br /><br />It works for me cos i believe unconditionally.  You got to believe it,  if you are trying to challenge it,  dont waste your time.
B00005JPNW|3.0|This was a typical fantasy film. It isn't even in the same league as Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia. Not the best I've ever seen, and it could have been longer. I would have liked a bit more character development. It's totally not worth all of the controversy that it's generated. I am a Christian, and I could note a few minor things that were a bit questionable, but nothing too extreme. With that said, I do think that Philip Pullman needs to back off. I also think that the zealous, extremist Christians need to cool it with all of the boycott threats, and I also feel that they owe it to themselves to see a film or to read a book before they can have an opinion on it. Boycotting only draws attention to the film, and people will usually see it regardless...and so, to all of my fellow Christians, please stop making fools of yourselves. Totally ridiculous, and like I said, not worth it. Save your money, and wait for the DVD.
B00079ZACM|4.0|A classic genre film of subsection Empire: pieces of it show up in Westerns, Costume Picture and so on: blind in the desert, called a coward by his fellow officers, saved by a bloke in disguise, BASHIBAZHOUKS. SEE IT.
B00005JPS9|4.0|I was skeptical about this one. I love the story. I read it in high school, and I think that I was the only student who enjoyed it, and so of course I had high expectations for this film version. I was not disappointed! The motion capture animation really takes it to an entirely new dimension. You totally feel like you are surrounded by an entirely new world...and Grendel is freaking scary. I want to go back, so that I can see it in 3D. I will buy this DVD when it comes out, and I hope that it is the R or NC-17 rated cut.     By the way, this is NOT a film for children. Extreme violence and some nudity are present. Should not have been rated PG-13.
B000BCE918|3.0|Jurassic Park is fabulous for dinosaur fans.  The Dinosaurs are great, the acting is decent, the plot good. It is a fun thrill ride. The Lost World is only like a Godzilla adventure with great CGI, and was disappointing. Better plot, script salvaged the III. I would rate #1 a 5, #2 a 2 and, #3 a 4. None of them were particularly horrifying abut the dinosaurs close up were fantastic.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|It was a masterpiece back in 1987 and it's still a masterpiece nowadays.  Thank you U2.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Hey, I'm shocked, too, to be beating up on this film. I figured I'd love it.<br /><br />I wonder how much Stanley Kubrick would have changed AI had he lived to make this film, as he supposedly planned to do? Although I also wonder if given Kubrick's record of starting into a project and then moving onto another without completing his last work---such as his long-awaited but never-made 1970's Napoleon bioflick---would AI truly ever have been shot at all? As he's indicated was the case, Steven Spielberg was perhaps being honorable in sticking as closely as possible to the vision and script of his hero as it was written at the time of Kubrick's death, but I can't help but wonder how much (or little) AI would have resembled the final product we encountered in this version. AI was not a movie I enjoyed, and that surprised me. It felt hollow, it wasn't endearing or satisfyingly alienating, either, and it will never justly be dubbed a classic. Its minuscule plot was twisted around itself until it was like some sort of coiled wire, and its outcome in those famous last twenty minutes was simply terrible. AI was slow-moving, visually underwhelming, not thought provoking, not well fleshed out, and if it wasn't for Jude Law's sexbot character adding interest to the production, I'd go so far as accuse AI of being a waste of time in its entirety.
0060776749|5.0|This book is a must for all U2 fans.  Really well ilustrated and narrated.
B000VI70WM|5.0|Band members said they were focused on \\"groove\\" and \\"basics\\" with the bass and drums but I say this album is more about keeping it simple with everything. Sharp, precise and clean are words that come to mind along with A+ hooks. And I don't care how old he gets, Simon continues to shine. Great performances by the lead vocalist forge a modern day Duran Duran sound with the Timbaland/Timberlake team vocals clearly not being overkill. Duran Duran's Nelly Furtado influences are apparent on track 10 \\"She's Too Much\\". The mix engineers kept this recording dry and I mean that in a good way. Overboard on effects is not the case here. The only downside for 'Red Carpet Massacre' is there has been a lot of competition on the airwaves worldwide in '06 and '07 so let's hope these strong tracks at least get recognized with many club remixes soon to come.<br /><br />A few notes to the biggest Duran Duran fans out there:  I get some Liberty flashbacks on the title track #2 sounding a little bit like their canceled 3rd single in 1990 \\"First Impressions\\". All kinds of vibes from Big Thing, Astronaut and Pop Trash may hit you at times too. For my last note, if you like The Devils album or hard-core young Duran Duran first album instrumentals then track 8 \\"Tricked Out\\" will take you back in time.
0525950079|4.0|Basically this book is Pillars of the Earth set 200 years later with a sub-par plot.  My basic complaint is that there are so many themes that were obviously just re-hashed from Pillars.  For example:<br /><br />- independent woman who fights against gender inequality<br />- corrupt religious men<br />- a big secret that starts out when the characters are children and isn't reveled until everyone is old or dead<br />- man loves woman but circumstances dictate they can not be together<br />- the brilliant craftsman with the jealous master<br />- the brilliant craftsman that is ostracized at first but over comes to be the most respected builder in the region<br /><br />I could go on and on - the book is still a good read, but Pillars of the Earth is my favorite book and this one felt like a cheap knock off (worth having, but you know it's a fake).
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!  It is very clever and my kids adore it!
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This production was on the web for months by now, and every opera lover is dying to own it in a neat and snug DVD set (also for gifts during Christmas).<br />Dmitri Hvorostovsky previously sung a CD version in the late 1990's with Nuccia Focile as Tatyanna. I would say with 100% certainty that this MET production's Onegin and Tatyanna topped the previous version. Baritones are like wine; in the case of Hvorostovsky, exceedingly good wine. I remember well the last parting scene of the two protagonists in this production - devastating is the only description I could think of.<br />Fleming and DH were like being engaged in a vocal dual, each singing and acting their hearts out. Their proficiency simply unblievable. I strongly recommend this recording to students undertaking operatic training.<br />Ramon Vargas delivered an aria (\\"Kuda, Kuda\\") that earned him an applause for well-nigh 2 minutes. He is in his absolute prime in this performance.<br />Gergiev - yes, he's the person chiefly responsible for bringing out the best in his cast. Rene Fleming's so-called 'mannerisms' were no where discernible in this performance.<br />Miss this one, and die.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This saga was an incredible drama and character study which resonated with the studies of social injustice and class poverty done by Dickens' pen.  It also deals redemptively with a labor union clash between masters and workers. Of course there is a delicious edge-of-your-seat romance which is fraught with assumptions and misunderstandings.  The only negative part is to note the immodesty in which the women in part 2 of the four part series are dressed.  The rest was so tastefully done that this inclusion was a downright shame.  However, you can listen without watching and still follow the story to part 3 where it's clean again. One of my all-time favorites.
B00000257O|2.0|If you're looking to hear Herbie absolutely blow it, look no further than here. The best example of him blowing it is on the \\"Cantaloupe Island\\" remake, done up as stereotypical mid-'70s funk - which I normally really enjoy, but not here, since \\"Cantaloupe Island\\" doesn't work as funk. It works as bluesy jazz, for sure, but not as funk. Or, are you interested in hearing Herbie try arena-rock? I hope you're not, but if you are... well, that's the best way I can describe \\"The Spider\\". Hell, he even shoots for calypso on \\"Gentle Thoughts\\". Something's wrong with that, not like that isn't glaringly obvious or anything. He also walks right into the overproduced cheese trap on the would-be menacing \\"Sansho Sima\\" and \\"People Music\\". He does cook up two genuinely solid funk grooves: the poppy, slightly disco-influenced \\"Doin' It\\", and \\"Swamp Rat\\", with great soloing. Those two songs are great, so if you're totally convinced this may be worthwhile in spite of what I say (I can't run your life, after all), you may want to play the tar out of those two and skip the rest. And if you get this before Empyrean Isles, Maiden Voyage, The Prisoner, Head Hunters, Man-Child or V.S.O.P.: the Quintet, shame on you!
B000784WMW|5.0|Having read Jane Eyre in school years ago, I remembered liking the story and being touched by it, however I couldn't remember why.  At the beginning of this movie, I almost groaned with how the cinematography seemed class \\"B\\", but that was soon swept aside by the truly excellent portrayals of the characters by the actors and actresses.  This was a moving and passionately done, believable rendition of a classic.  Now I remember why I liked the book so much!
B0000CE742|5.0|This imported version is much better a CD package than the American set.  Both CDs are different and there are loads of songs.  I'm so glad I read the reviews before ordering.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|If you even like Eddie Vedder just a little bit you will love this CD.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  I find myself singing the songs in my head long after listening.  His writing has matured along with us and the song topics just fit our generation.  MUsic is beautiful and haunting.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|ALIAS is by far the best tv show ever - even better than Buffy and that's saying something.  J.J. Abrams and the writers and directors and actors are all geniuses.  Jennifer Garner is probably the closest thing to an absolutely perfect person and watching her as Sydney Bristow is such a treat.  But the entire cast and guest stars are also a treat.  And, can you get any hotter than Sark?<br /><br />ALIAS gag reels are probably the funniest things ever - especially Victor Garber's, since he's usually so serious on the show.  This box set is an ALIAS fanatic's dream - who doesn't want a replica Rambaldi artifact??  And especially the Irina box!?  This set is so amazing!

B000SO7OL6|5.0|This is one of the best jazz albums I have bought in the past year. It has been such a surprise because I really didn't know Diana Krall when I bought her CD. She has a wonderful warm voice that enables her to interpret the songs beautifully. This album has many of the best jazz songs ever and I cannot emphasize enough what a great singer Diana Krall is. I played her CD during Thanksgiving and many of my friends decided to get her CD afterwards. You will definitely not regret getting this album. If you love old time jazz songs with a fresh voice. This is the album you want to get. I love it.
0316067598|5.0|Excellent non-fiction work by someone's first hand account. Well written and a must read for anyone who is a patriot in the best sense of the word.
0312995423|2.0|\\"Where's a nuclear physicist when you need one!\\" says one of the characters on page 422.  I have been waiting all my life for someone to say that. Now here it is in a best-selling thriller. Actually, the quote is \\"Where's a nuclear [f-word deleted]ing physicist when you need one!\\" Unfortunately, the author failed to find one himself in time to correct the factual errors that he needlessly inserted into this book.  He asserts through his characters that the atomic bombs dropped in World War II, one on Hiroshima and the other on Nagasaki, were uranium bombs and that one bomb used uranium-235 and the other uranium-238.  At the risk of sounding like a know-it-all, the author is wrong.  The second bomb, the one dropped on Nagasaki was a plutonium-239 bomb, not uranium as the author asserts. Also, you can make an atomic bomb out of uranium-235 but not uranium-238.<br /><br />I purchased this book at JFK prior to a nine-hour transatlantic flight. It served its purpose, to get me to Europe. However, I would not recommend it. It is not particularly well-written in terms of plausibility of plot, characters, or technical content. Maybe the movie will be better.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|I was never too fond of the original \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" album. It wasn't bad, sure, but compared to the \\"BBC Sessions\\" CD it sounded unfocused and occationally even a little bit lethargic. And a couple of songs suffered from less than impressive vocal performances by Robert Plant.    That part obviously hasn't changed. The opening number, \\"Rock And Roll\\", is still disappointing, and the thirty-minute \\"Dazed And Confused\\" is still mostly for diehards. But the sound quality has improved, and \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is better than I remembered, even if Plant could no longer reach the high notes at this point in his career. Apparently he permanently \\"lost\\" his highest register in late 1972.    The addition of six new tracks is of course the biggest bonus. The first disc contains previously unreleased performances of \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", and \\"The Ocean\\" with its stuttering, \\"Back in Black\\"-like riff. And the second one has found room for a great, tough \\"Heartbreaker\\" in between the 10-30 minute excesses. I'm sure it was very cool if you were actually there.    Apart from \\"Heartbreaker\\", the best of the \\"new\\" tracks are \\"The Ocean\\", which surpasses the album version, and a powerful, if somewhat short \\"Black Dog\\". But there is nothing bad to be found, excactly, even if some of what is here is starting to sound overblown and/or slightly unfocused. \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" is definitely not as tight as \\"How The West Was Won\\", and it's not as tough and intense as the \\"BBC Sessions\\". But it's still a good live album, and the market isn't excactly flooded with (legal) live Zeppelin as it is.  It is NOT the place to start, but fans will want a listen. Fans will want to buy it, in fact. Especially if they enjoy Zeppelin at their grandest and most excessive.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is one of the most delightful movies to come out to date, Christmas time or not. Will Ferrel is a comic genious, the rest of the cast deliver a perfect \\"10\\" in entertainment. Life should be filled with joy and fun. Elf will leave you feeling delightfully smiling. Great for grownups or kids (as long as you're not too serious, in which case, you need to watch it twice!).
0979660742|5.0|This is a really small nice book on rules of English grammer that you have to take care of while writing.  I am still a novice and will surely be able to appreciate the value of this book more in 6 months or more.
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Overall, Spider-man 3 was a good movie. The action and character development rivaled the first two movies and, despite some inconsistencies, continued the story after the end of Spider-man 2. If story is what you're going for you won't be disappointed.<br />However, as much storyline as they packed into the movie, it seemed rushed.  And Raimi sure had fun \\"emo\\"tizing Peter Parker after the symbiote got a hold of him. His quirky  directing came out (in the form of a couple one-liners and a few awkwardly silly scenes) more in this film than the first two--a plus for Raimi fans, but not so much for Spidey fans who wouldn't so much expected it.<br />All-in-all, though i very much enjoyed the movie, but it'd be rated below the Spider-man, which i would rate below Spider-man 2. So the third placed third.
0316067598|5.0|Everything I can say about this book is a gross understatement!  This is the most amazing true story that I have ever read. While the way the story was written is really good, it was the content that really tore me up. I recommend this book to everyone.
0316018953|4.0|I am a huge Harry Bosch fan but I found that this book was too short and as it had been originally aimed for a serial audience, the flaws of that format shone through in this book.<br /><br />Everything seemed to be too rushed and light. The basis of the storyline (terrorism) just doesn't seem to be a strong suit of Michael Connelly's and it makes this book appear a Michael Crichton wanna-be.<br /><br />Besides my reservations, it is a readable novel.
067003830X|5.0|I was highly impressed (and pleasantly surprised) at the \\"readability\\" of this book for those who might be considered \\"laymen\\" (like me) in the field of neuroplasticity of the brain. It kept me intrigued and dedicated throughout the book and I became fascinated by how science might advance populations of individuals with barriers to employment or other life activities. Highly recommended!
B00005JPNW|4.0|The movie is based on the Philip Pullman Book \\"The Golden compass\\" which was originally published under the name \\"The Northern Lights\\". It is the first in a trilogy, The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass . The story is set in an alternate earth and is about a young girl named Lyra Belacqua who stumbles upon a political conflict occurring amongst the adults in her life. Her uncle, Lord Asriel is conducting controversial research on this mysterious thing called Dust. This research is opposed by the Magesteriem who are the controlling authority in the setting and are determined to save the population from Dust's corrupting influence. But when Lyra's best friend Roger gets abducted by the GOBBLERS she needs to head to the north pole to rescue him. She teams up with Mrs. Coulter who takes a special interest in Lyra and promises to take her to see the North Pole. Before Lyra departs the school she is given a secret to guard and protect by the head master. A secret she must epically keep from Mrs. Coulter.    The movie Starred:    Marisa Coulter Nicole Kidman   Lord Asriel Daniel Craig   Lyra Belacqua Dakota Blue Richards   Roger Ben Walker   Pantalaimon (voice) Freddie Highmore   Iorek Byrnison (voice) armored ice bear Ian McKellen   Serafina Pekkala Eva Green   John Faa Jim Carter   Farder Coram Tom Courtenay   Ragnar Sturlusson (voice) bear king Ian McShane   Lee Scoresby aeronaut from Texas Sam Elliott   First High Councilor Christopher Lee   Stelmaria (voice) Kristin Scott Thomas   Second High Councilor Edward de Souza   Hester (voice) Kathy Bates   Fra Pavel Simon McBurney   Magisterial Emmissary Derek Jacobi   Ma Costa  Gyptian matriarch Clare Higgins       I really enjoyed this film and had a lot of fun watching it. The acting quality was really outstanding with even the CGI Characters behaving in a realistic manner. The animation is consistent throughout the film so as not to break the immaculate reality of the setting. The steam punk elements were visually stunning leaving me memorized in my seat. The film was exciting and entertaining but it didn't quite reach the knock out film level which is why I give it 4.5 stars. I will own it and want to watch it over and over again. I have also included a section for those who are familiar with the book.    I loved the acting quality in the film. I felt that the people involved with the film really had a firm familiarity with the materials both the script and the book. I say this because many of the actors and actresses really hit the right emotional note for their scenes. This is particularly difficult feat with this project because there are a lot of subtle actions being taken and secrets that are not reveled until a latter point in the movie. Some of those things are only revealed in the book. I really appreciated seeing the responses that I expected see to seemingly innocuous events.    The quality of the CGI characters just amazed me both through the amount of emotion that was shown through the characters and through the realistic behaviors and movements. I was very touched to see Iorek's feelings toward Lyra develop and grow. I was also very entertained in the scenes with Mrs. Coulter's monkey, where she was able to be so reserved hiding her emotions and her monkey was not able to hide anything showing her true feelings. I was most amazed by the realistic movements of the various CGI animals. The animators really captured the natural movements and behavior quarks of each animal lending a delightful realism to the film.    The animation was consistent throughout the movie maintaining the immaculate reality. I was able to be pulled into Lyra's world.    The steam punk elements were visually stunning. I particularly enjoyed the gyroscopic propulsion elements and how they were consistent throughout the film whether it was on an air ship or on a carriage. I found it a nice visual addition.    The movie was not a knock out film though. The events were exciting butthe end just didn't pop. This was not a big surprise and I would bet that the studio felt the same and for that reason gave the movie a December release instead of a summer release.    For those who are familiar with the book.    Book Was better but it's rare for that not to be the case. In the book Phillip Pullman is able to really build a tension and excitement that just drove me all the way through the last 1/3rd of the book. The ending was more of a knockout in the book although more controversial and darker too.    They made some changes to adapt the book to the movie. the first 2/3rds was true to the timeline with the events occurring in order as they were in the book. The last 1/3rd of the movie had a different order of events than the book but this was done so that they could end the story on a happy note.    That being said the abridgement of the movie was very well done cutting out material to make the movie fit into it's time constraint but also maintaining the spirit of the story. I was very impressed with the movie for that because it is very hard to make the length of a book fit into the short time space of a movie.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Stunning, amazing footage unlike anything I've seen except in an IMAX presentation.  A lifelong lover of nature and creatures, I am hoping people will view this and gain a new appreciation and love for the earth and it's most vulnerable inhabitants, wildlife.  Hopefully, it will spur all viewers to be better caretakers of this incredibly beautiful planet we live on.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|It is incredible the attention that Gore has gotten over this book.  Everyone agrees that we should do what we can to preserve the health of our planet, and be good stewards of the earth, but meteorologists and associated experts are not in agreeance over the whole global warming theory. This is nothing more than an attempt to get polital attention. Apparently it worked.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|This is my first Jlo album ever, yes I have a guilty pleasure of listening to her, I won't lie.  Mi cansion favorito, \\"No Me Ames\\" or my favorite song is \\"No Me Ames\\".  It's a sentimental and sad song, translated from a Italian poem, well that's what I heard.  And Marc Anthony does the duet beautfiully with Jlo!  And another favorite was \\"Should of Never\\" and of course, \\"If You Had My Love\\" or \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" in English and en esponal!  Recommended for those who listen to Jlo!
0525950079|1.0|I, too, was a fan of Pillars of the Earth.  When I read about this book's imminent release, I was very excited.  I suppose I would feel cheated about the total lack of payoff that the sequel provided but it was so bad that, at times, it was good and provided me with some measure of entertainment.  Some measure.  Right now I'm still marveling that I made it through all 1,000 pages.  Reader beware: spoilers will abound in this review.    Where to start?  How about with the controversial issue over the sex scenes.  I agree with the reviewers who wrote that they were gratuitous--were they ever.  It's one thing to have sex scenes in a book if they propel the plot but that certainly wasn't the case with this book.  The sex scenes were unnecessary and so poorly written that they were unintentionally humorous.  I felt like I was reading the lascivious ramblings of an adolescent male.  The scenes were all more or less the same and even when they were supposed to take place between characters deeply in love they were completely devoid of emotion.  What's more, I found some of the terminology used to describe the bodies of female characters rather offensive.    As for the plot...well, there is no real plot.  Instead, there is a series of episodes that are linked together to create a tale of the less than compelling lives of the characters.  Some of it is interesting, such as the recounting of how the social and monetary structure of towns and villages fell apart in the wake of the plague.  Some of it was just graphic and grotesque, such as the detailed description of a flaying.  Some of it was just plain absurd, such as two nuns traveling unprotected through very hostile territory as they attempted to track down the English army and bother the bishop with their petty--when compared with the fact that people are at *war* here--concerns.    Perhaps the worst thing about the story is the unrelenting misery that falls on the heads of the characters.  Tragedy is heaped on the goodcharacters in such copious amounts it's a wonder any of them manage to get out of bed in the morning.  By contrast, the evil characters experience triumph after triumph.  Sure, it's all tied up very neatly in the end--practically with a bow--but it's certainly not satisfying.  Perhaps the sitcom style-ending is appropriate to a book that is pretty much one big medieval soap opera.    As for the characters, with whom should the reader sympathize?  For the most part, they are all so stereotypical they might as well have their roles tattooed on their foreheads: hard-working peasant, strong female character, noble builder, evil prior...  There is precious little internal dialog and so the characters are very stunted.      Merthin should be the character for whom the reader roots but he's so boring and his devotion to his brother is just unfathomable.  Caris is little more than a self-centered harpy who is so out of character as a medieval woman that it's laughable.  I certainly don't object to the idea of an unconventional female character.  In fact, I welcome it.  However, she must still be within keeping of the spirit of her times if she is to be believable.  The love between her and Merthin is inexplicable and his supposed devotion to her is made cheap by his hopping into bed with various other women the minute he is slighted by her--and then Caris has the nerve to be mad about it.  How can Merthin be such a sex object when he's so unexciting?  How can Caris be the love of his life when she spends most of the novel using him in various and assorted ways?      Ralph is unrelentingly evil and his occasional twinges of guilt with regard to how Merthin views him were completely unconvincing.  Godwyn is much the same, though his evil is more of the ignorant and arrogant nature than Ralph's.  Either way, both characters would have benefited a great deal from a healthy dose of nuance.  If evil characters are to appear in a book, they should at least be interesting.  If they're meant for nothing more than to just be evil, they should take up a whole lot fewer pages than these two do.    As for Gwenda, she is a woman who more or less sells her body and then commits several murders.  Though the first two are clearly a struggle for survival, the last two are appalling.  Yes, the two men she kills are evil but that doesn't justify her taking their lives simply to protect a secret that she brought upon her own head.  I was very disgusted with her character in the end, though I didn't like her all that much when she tried to seduce Wulfric into marrying her rather than Annet.  However stupid Annet is, it hardly justifies the depths of Gwenda's deception.  The reconciliation between the women is so cheesy.    My other big gripe about this novel is its repetitiveness.  Did no one edit this thing?  How many times does the reader need to be told that the people of Kingsbridge come to view Caris as something of a saint?  Why does the reader need a rehash of everyone's pasts when he or she reaches the last section of the book?  The book is bloated enough without everything being repeated over and over ad nauseam.  I really have no idea why this book is earning so many rave reviews.

B00005JPFH|3.0|This is the dumbest mistake I have ever ran across. Beware to those who bought this!! On disc 2 Trailer 1 and Trailer 2 are the same trailer. They should have put them in the correct order. The Teaser came first then came Trailer 1 with a running time of 2:34. Then Trailer 2 should have been what trailer 3 was with a running time of 1:42. Then there was a final trailer that was released after that one with a longer bell tower sequence that I have in my possession with a running time of 3:01. My point is this is a blatant mistake that personally upsets me as a fan of the movie. Thank god I did not buy this stupid special edition. If it were not for the behind the scenes featurettes I would say this dvd sucks!!!!

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I am only 5 weeks along and did this video and sweat the first time.  I can see when I get into my 3rd trimester it will be tough, but that is the point.  I want to keep my muscles toned all through my pregnancy and that takes work.  I have a Denise Austin video that was boring compared to this. Also, she does it in a living room setting using a coffee table and couch as props.  It is very realistic and shows you, you can do this is a tight space.  Also has a great 20 minutes separate workout to do with your husband helping.  I like it becasue she changes routine just when you think you can't handle one more of the rep you are in.  She even pauses for pee breaks and water breaks.  I should add, I just had a baby 6 months ago and even though I lost all my weight, I am not in tip top shape and I was able to do the entire video.  She gives instruction on how to make it less hard if you are having trouble.
B00003CX8V|5.0|That question has been asked since this movie was released.  Is it a drama with comic undertones or a comedy with dramatic overtones?  I don't know.  I do know that the Academy \\"got it right\\" when they made this the Best Picture of 1960.  Wilder's genius in seeing the humor of everyday life and how it helps us continue living is fully developed in this movie.  The principals experience the triumph of humor over pain. While this may not be a feel good film, \\"Shut up and deal.\\" is an excellent battle cry.<br />How realistic is the movie?  Very!  The office is Met Life in New York.  Yes, this is office work prior to the introduction of computers.  No one thought the conditions were bad and Met Life was thought to be an excellent employer.  There is no law about sexual harassment and the term MCP has not been coined.  I say this to show how realistic the film is and how sure the portrayals are.<br />The cast is great!  Jack Lemmon is a sure-footed as ever.  He is the rising young white-collar worker determined to secure every advantage and promotion.  Smitten by Shirley MacLaine, Lemmon proceeds in a stumbling bumbling comic courtship of the unattainable.  Fred MacMurray breaks out of his good guy image with an outstanding performance as a bully and womanizer.<br />This is one of Wilder's best films and one of the few must see movies in existence.  While not a funny comfortable film, it is thought provoking and enjoyable.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|I saw this movie on TV when it first played and although it did depict a world of ruin I found this movie to be a bit on the \\"light\\" side of depicting the monstrous destruction and aftermath of nuclear war.  None the less, the picture painted was one of which one hopes will never come to pass.  In an instant, all that we are use to, all that we (should not) take for granted and all sense of civilization would be gone, suddenly leaving you in barbaric and primitive ages.<br /><br />The movie was still good in it's presentation of the destruction from the blast and the beginning steps survivors would have to take in the aftermath.  Would this be a life worth living?  Would this be a world worth bringing new life into?<br /><br />While from this standpoint in the new millennium, this movie may be entertainment, let it be an exhibit and a history lesson of how things would have been utterly and disdainfully different - if at all - had this event come to pass and what we stand to lose should it ever come to pass.

B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|\\"Stone Cold\\" is a solid adaptation of the Robert B. Parker novel, though sometimes it feels more \\"inspired by\\" than \\"adapted from\\" the original novel.  I say this because, even though the story and themes stay fairly close to those of the book, \\"Stone Cold\\" the movie definitely establishes its own flavor and tone.  And that flavor and tone can be described thusly: dark and moody.  The humorous banter of the book is cut way back in the movie; the book's bright, busy resort of Paradise, Massachusetts is reimagined here more as a grim, chilly seaside town that's sparsely populated and even a bit tired; and there are long, moody passages of silence between moments of character interaction.  All these things bring about an autumnal mood of thoughtfulness and introspection, a mood- I should add- that definitely works and keeps us watching, but is somewhat darker than the book, which had more of a mix of the dark stuff and the usual Robert Parker mischievous observational humor on the part of Jesse Stone and his cohorts.<br /><br />Tom Selleck works fine as the strong but troubled Jesse Stone, making him (as in the book) likable but tough when he needs to be.  It's a well thought out, artful performance:  with all those long, moody passages without dialogue that I mentioned above, Mr. Selleck conveys emotions and concerns with just his expressions and body language much of the time.  And it's more than enough to keep us involved and engrossed.<br /><br />An enjoyable, making of/behind-the-scenes featurette is also worth watching.  It shows that the thoughtfulness, attention to character detail, and general, well... artfulness of the movie were definitely conscious efforts on the part of the film's creative forces.<br /><br />I liked this movie enough to check out \\"Jesse Stone: Night Passage\\", the second adaptation of Mr. Parker's book series about the character.  That one- a prequel to this movie- adapts the first book in the series and shows viewers how Jesse Stone initially landed his police chief job in Paradise, Massachusetts.  Happily, \\"Jesse Stone: Night Passage\\" is very good, too.ief job in Paradise, Massachusetts.  Happily, \\"Jesse Stone: Night Passage\\" is very good, too.

0060899190|5.0|The Post-Secret phenomenon is at first strange and awkward.  Why would anyone want to post their secrets?  However, this sensationalist activity of peering into other peoples lives, becomes and truly beautiful and heart wrenching exercise in empathy.  It's absurd at first that one would care about the anonymous letters, but the reader is sucked in to the possible lives laid bare on the pages.  It shows that all of human kinds fears, anxieties, and desires, are universal.  Beautiful.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|I first saw NOSFERATU in an edited version on an old TV show hosted by the late William K. Everson called SILENTS, PLEASE! back in the early 1960s.  I was then a youngster, and the silent nightmarish images terrified me.  NOSFERATU has always been a much better cinematic treatment of DRACULA than the Tod Browning version.  And yet. . . the image quality in the best available prints, videotapes and even recent dvds has always been lacking.  Murnau was still a young director when he made NOSFERATU, and the budget for this movie was modest compared to those for his later work.  The direction of the actors seemed as lacking as the budget: melodrama and exaggerated pantomime is all too characteristic of stilted acting in bad silent films.  In NOSFERATU, the actors who play Hutter, Ellen & Knock display the worst excesses of Grand Style acting, in evident contrast to the genius of composition, lighting, camera movement and editing rhythms in the film which already prefigure Murnau's fully developed visual style.  Only Max Schreck as Count Orlok transcended the limitations of hammy acting and poor print quality, and turned in a bravura performance whose creepiness was possibly enhanced by the ghostly effects of fuzzy heightened contrast in poorly duped prints.  When I looked at the old Kino NOSFERATU a few years back with a group of friends, we all felt the film was thrilling, but the acting--- simply laughable.<br /><br />Yesterday I got NOSFERATU (Ultimate Edition) and the restoration impressed me quite as much as the restoration done on Lang's METROPOLIS a few years ago.  The picture quality is astonishing, and the restoration of proper film speed with the vivid pallor of the images has proved to me I was wrong about much of the acting. The subtleties in performance were the first things to be lost in inferior prints projected at incorrect speed.  Hutter, Ellen and even over-the-top Knock turn in more finely-tuned melodramatic performances than I had believed was the case.  The famous shot of Orlok standing in the window of his deserted house, gazing towards Ellen's bedroom, now reveals a ghoulish face in the thrall of frustrated erotic longing as well as bloodthirsty intent.  The other amazing thing about this restoration is the quality of the \\"nature\\" shots: frightened horses bolting from a hyena; the phantom play of light against the spray of the waves as Ellen sits on the beach, the astonishing clarity of the establishing shot of Wisborg, even the close-up of the Venus Fly-Trap seizing a fly in its interlocking leaves, all are now seen in a way not possible for anyone to see since the film's release in the 1920s--- before the suit brought by Bram Stoker's widow caused much of the original film material to be destroyed. The music, adapted from the original score, works quite effectively and is frightening at all the propeer moments.  If you love the Dracula legend, NOSFERATU is the best, and these DVDs are by far the best version of NOSFERATU.  If you admire F.W. Murnau's work, this set is a must-have.

B000PY52EU|5.0|This movie really surprised me. It is about a woman named Rae who learns to love herself. At the beginning of the film, she is a waisted woman who allows men to use her to feel good about herself. She is basically destroying her own life because she doesn't know her self worth. The sex and nudity at this point in the film is so necessary because it shows the viewer just what a low and revolting person she has let herself become.     With the strange help of an unexpected friend, Rae learns to have faith in herself and realize that she is worth something. It was utterly inspiring and touching to watch Rae overcome her challenges in life.     This film is so great because the ending doesn't pretend that everything is suddenly all better. These people still have a lot of work to do, and a long way to go before proving themselves. The ending is so hopeful because we know the characters are trying as hard as they can to stay on the right track in life.    If you are interested in watching someone turn her life around in a strange and funny, but sincere way, you will surely like this movie. I think this movie is so inspiring in a surprising way.
0060763280|3.0|I picked up this book because a colleague of mine said she used it as a blueprint for how she runs her workshops and seminars - which is a topic that I was looking to learn more about at the time.<br /><br />What I didn't realize is that she meant that - although he holds those types of workshops on building wealth etc., that he didn't really examine this in the book. This book was more for the general public - as more of a \\"teaser\\" to the wealth building topics he discusses at his seminars.<br /><br />So I read the book anyway, and I must say that it was well-written and had a few inspiring parts -- but if you buy wealth building books all the time -- then you may not learn anything that you haven't read in 10 other books before.<br /><br />If you enjoy getting a dose of inspiration and motivation from various sources - then by all means - this book is worth buying.

In my mind he has joined the Pantheon of actors who will work until they drop - actors like Michael Caine, Jet Li, Morgan Freeman, Eliot Gould, Geoffrey Rush and (amazing to me) Sylvester Stallone. If you want evidence that old guys can still kick butt, this is a movie for you.

B000W1V5VU|4.0|The script for Ocean's 13 demands viewers to vigorously suspend their disbelief throughout the movie. Still, this is a minor cavel since disciplined disbelief-suspension is mandatory with most heist/caper movies. In the case of Ocean's 13, it is more than offset by the evident joy the filmaker and players had in creating this three-quel. The absurd plot devices even contribute to making Ocean's 13 a pleasure to watch again and again. Admittedly I'm not a Julia Roberts fan, so her absence along with that of Catherine Zeta-Jones, who was acquired in the second movie, was actually a plus. And since Ellen Barkin's role was little more than slightly misogynistic comic relief, the third Ocean's settled in to being what the franchise has always been at heart...a great buddy/heist/caper/comedy. I hope Ocean's 14 is at least as good.

B0000AOV85|5.0|This DVD takes you behind the scenes and lets you see the genius of Pink Floyd. After a short intro of what Pink Floyd was up to before \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", the bandmembers tell the story of how they made the greatest album in history. They walk you through each song, letting you know how the musical and lyrical ideas came about. You find out what instruments were used for particular sections of the album. The most interesting part, for me, was finding out about the \\"talking\\" you hear when you listen to the album. They let you know who said what and why. The album's engineer, Alan Parsons, is also featured. He gives you the lowdown on the different tracking techniques used for each song. The DVD also contains archival footage of the band recording parts of the album and Bonus Interviews that pertain to the music and lyrics as well as the graphics used on the cover. I own quite a few \\"Classic Album\\" disks and I have to say this is the best one of them all. It takes the experience of a \\"Headphone Classic\\" recording even farther than I thought possible. Genius!

B00006G8G1|5.0|Maiden's Rock in Rio is a fantastic DVD concert. It depicts them on the last date of their Brave New World tour in front of 250, 000 people at Rio de Janiero's \\"Rock in Rio\\" festival. Great set list, and Bruce's energy shows the band's enthusiasm.<br /><br />The audio is amazing, if you have it wired correctly you can hear the Guitars and bass from the left and right speakers, Bruce's voice from the subwoofer, and the drums from the back speaker. The audio DOES rise and fall in a few quick places, but that doesn't distract you from the awesome-liciousness of the film.

1582701709|1.0|Its no \\"Secret\\" that our thoughts and feelings can influence our reality, however \\"The Secret\\" takes off with those ideas and ends up with a mishmash philosophy that is so ridiculous that it would be laughable if not for the insulting nature of its callous attitude towards anyone facing hard times.    The core of the Falsehood that betrays The Secret is the concept that our reality is so fragile that spending time with an overweight person, for example, can cause us to become overweight because of negative thoughts we may have around that person. Nonsense. Then it follows that whoever works with the overweight will be overweight, counselors will be depressed, and to become rich and famous all you have to do is watch reruns of The Lives Of The Rich And Famous on TV a few times and you're all set! Yeah thats happening. Its the beliefs and feelings that we have about our reality that influence that reality. You can spend forever around a billion \\"fat\\" people and unless you believe and feel \\"I am fat\\" you won't gain an ounce.   Theres some good books out there on creating reality,attracting, mindpower,ect., but The Secret isn'nt one of them.

B000002UWE|5.0|Talk Talk never really hit it big in the U.S., probably due to the lead singer Mark Hollis' extremely nasal style of singing.  The only one of their songs I ever got into was \\"Life's What You Make It,\\" and I played that one single to death back in the late 80's.  But I recently took a chance on this affordably-priced compilation, and was more than pleasantly surprised by the diverse, sophisticated music these guys produced.<br /><br />Stylistically, the early material is reminiscent of Depeche Mode and late Roxy Music, but as the band matured it took on a very unique sound that defies comparison.  Adding guitar and occasional wind intruments into the synth/bass/drums mix was a good idea, as it allowed Hollis and his songwriting partners to expand their horizons almost wothout limits.  While the early hits like \\"Talk Talk\\" and \\"It's My Life\\" might be the most well-known, they only hint at the sophistication of the band's later material.<br /><br />For all the \\"new wave\\" music I listened to back in the 80's I'm amazed to find that I can't really lump this band in with anyone else.  But I'd recommend this collection for anyone with an open mind.  The only thing that might put some listeners off, as I already mentioned, is Hollis' voice.  Much like Bryan Ferry from Roxy Music, Hollis had a sound that was immediately identifiable - not always for the better.  But his music was always original and ground-breaking.<br /><br />bonus: the live version of their best (IMO) song, \\"Life's What You Make It\\" is incredible, and the other live track from the same 1986 show is great, as well.<br /><br />For the price, you really can't beat this one.
B000VNMMRA|5.0|This movie is absolutely BRILLIANT! They shifted this movie into a way that I never expected, and I was shocked at how funny it was AND that the action wasn't at all \\"old\\", \\"done before\\", \\"repetitive\\", \\"boring\\" - it actually kept my interest. If you thought that the 3rd \\"Matrix\\" movie sucked (as I did), give this a try - You won't be disappointed!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You're doing yourself a disservice to not own this series on DVD. I'm sure some of you are weary of a sci-fi series, but it's much more than that. It's  a story much like the old American experience we read in history books. A group of people on the edge of civilization fighting to live another day. This series is more episodic when compared to other series such as Battlestar Galactica or 24, but there are several arcs that work well and it definitely follows a clear order. Of course, be sure to catch the follow up film \\"Serenity\\". This DVD set has already proven to be a must have for every DVD collection.
0307387178|5.0|The main charecter - Christopher, had a great insight on tragedy, spirituality, life, the value of family and the importance of keeping your individuality. However, not always in that order.  The book was very thought provoking.  I highly recommend the movie as well as the book, as the movie really gives you a visual along with the words.  The movie emphasizes how he touched other peoples life as well as how the same people affected his life on his journey to Alaska. A remarkable human being, however short his life on earth.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|[[ASIN:B000SO7OMA Loreena McKennitt: Nights from the Alhambra (Amaray - DVD + 2CD)]]<br />\\<br /><br />This issue from Loreena McKennitt, and Quinlan Road, simply put, is Astounding.<br /><br />If you can only buy one live performance this year, then make it this one. How amazing, after all these years of collecting Loreena's stupendously beautiful albums, to see her and her crew perform this awesome music live! And, further, to see them doing it in one of the most beautiful buildings ever built, the Alhambra is just perfect. It is so fitting to have McKennitt's music and all it means to all the peoples of the world, performed in this glorious and ancient structure that means so much also to all the peoples of the world is just so \\"right\\".<br /><br />Some of her most beautiful and moving work is captured here, from the span of her career, in some of the most glorious cinematic concert footage ever captured on film (I feel).<br /><br />You will endlessly be entertained with this release, both for its audio (the most spectacular 5.1 surround you've heard), and also for the beautiful shots of the individual instrumentalists playing their various and sundry rarely-seen instruments. Just wonderful! And, of course, leading it all, the graceful Celtic Lady herself, in her warm and unimposing way...Sheer Delight!<br /><br />Do NOT hesitate to pick yourself up a copy of this truly wonderful release, containing the whole concert on both DVD, and on CD as well...how thoughtful of QR to include these formats together for us in one reasonably priced package!<br /><br />.....Kudos to all involved in this great product.<br /><br />****<br />Note that there are two issues of this album. One (featured here) is the CD formatted one, with 2 cd's and 1 dvd all in a jewel-case sized package. The Second (at the link provided above) is the DVD formatted one, with the same 2 cd's and 1 dvd all in a dvd-case sized package. This seems unnecessary, but I'm sure, given her character, MS McKennitt perhaps thought offering a choice for those who have a preference for where to file this (music/vs/film) it would \\"fit in\\" with one's collection more neatly.<br /><br />Note that the photo on the DVD listing is another copy of the CD package...I have supplied a customer image of the actual DVD package below it.reference for where to file this (music/vs/film) it would \\"fit in\\" with one's collection more neatly.

1594489505|5.0|This was an amazing story that deeply touched me. A beatiful story of the sacrifices, pain and suffering one will endure for someone they love, be it a friend, spouse, lover, or their child. It also opened my eyes to the extreme injustice so many women in Afghanistan and similar countries are subject to even in our present time.
B000002KGT|5.0|Genres can be pretty demeaning.  Just look at the genre for this album, as it's labeled \\"soft rock\\".  Soft rock is usually one of the biggest genres to be labeled muzak (also known as elevator music).  That's a little appropriate, as crap like Air Supply is some of the blandest, soul less crap ever made.  But this?  I really don't think so.  While you can put anything on speakers, I really find this album something you can chew on.  They may not have any sense of rocking, but who needs that all the time?<br /><br />The thing that makes this album have more real messages is the turmoil.  When Rumours was recorded, there was a lot of turmoil in the group.  Actually, wikipedia has a lot explaining this, but since I won't write it, you can check it out yourself.  Take my word for it.<br /><br />If you know me, however, you know that lyrics are always the second priority.  While songs in general go hand in hand with the lyrics , you must at least have good music to at least express something, even just wanting us to get the _______ up and dance. I though this was the best part of this album. The music is compelling enough.  It definitely wouldn't stand on it's own, it's not the primary focus), and it needs lyrics.  The great thing is that they can go together.  The hopeful vibe of Don't Stop comes out in both elements, resulting in a great song.  Songbird does it with the lyrics reflecting the mood of the piano.  You'd be suprised how this band can do things like this.  Fleetwood Mac often get lumped as tripe, muzak, or boring, shallow music.  After listening to Rumours, I disagree.  While Don't Stop was beat into the ground, the radio hits always played, and the lack of grabbing, loud music, it may be easy to say that.  However, It's far from the truth.  Remember the turmoil going, and listen to the music.  If you are looking for ANYTHING half loud, don't touch this album.  If you know that intense doesn't always equal emotional, than your chances of liking this are better.<br /><br />Take a listen.  If your a guy, and think this kind of stuff is what sissies listen to, than be that way.  Life won't be as great for you.<br /><br />10/10listen.  If your a guy, and think this kind of stuff is what sissies listen to, than be that way.  Life won't be as great for you.    10/10
B000N6TYLW|3.0|It was a shame to see the girls leave my living room.  I generally enjoyed the seoson, however I wish there would have been more of a resolution between Loreli and Luke.  I guess I just wanted more Gilmore Girls!
0440418569|3.0|For what it's worth, I'm agnostic and not religious.    I found this book a disappointment.  <Harry Potter spoiler ahead>  In the last book of Harry Potter, Snape looks into Harry's eyes as he dies.  You find out later that he loved Harry's mother, and Harry had his mother's eyes. Therefore, the scene of Snape's death is very touching because the reader realizes that Snape's last wish was to look in his beloved's eyes.  Rowling's books were great that way -- she did not spell everything out for you, yet you still understood the motivations of each character.    Pullman takes a different approach.  He's not going for any subtlety here -- he rams his views down your throat.  Whereas the earlier books in the series were more about fantasy and plot, there are long sections in Amber Spyglass where he preaches his own ideas.  B-O-R-I-N-G. If the earlier books did not exist, this book would have been panned by the critics.  It sacrifices character, plot, and everything else for Pullman's views on religion.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I am biased towards Arcade Fire.  I flew to see them in Berkeley earlier this summer, and waited over 8 hours this past September to be in the front row for their set at the Austin City Limits music festival.  To say that Arcade Fire is the kind of band that will make you want empty out your bank account to follow them around the country is a pure understatement in regards to myself.<br />Like most hardcore fans, I was worried that the second album would not hold up to the expectations of the first one, but I can say that Neon Bible is not a sequel to Funeral.  While Funeral may have focused on the concurrences of life and death, Neon Bible takes on a political tone with \\"Intervention,\\" \\"Black Mirror,\\" and \\"Windowsill.\\"  Joe Simpson (Jessica's dad) gets his own song with \\"(Antichrist Television Blues),\\" and a new, re-vamped version of \\"No Cars Go\\" is simply stellar and the last minutes of the song never fails to inspire me, especially when Win Butler shouts out the siren call of \\"Little babies - let's go!  Women and children - let's go!  Old folks - let's go!  We don't know where we're going.\\"<br />It's rare for me to fond of every single song on an album, but Neon Bible is one of those rare exceptions.  Different instruments are brought in this time around, and while the some things are different sound wise, the emotional pull from Funeral is still there.<br />My definite highlights include:  \\"No Cars Go,\\" \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations,\\" \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" and the closer \\"My Body is a Cage.\\"  I won't state that this album is better than Funeral because I have such an attachment to both albums, but it does show the growth of Arcade Fire as not only a band, but a creative force.
0061122416|1.0|Paulo Coelho needs a reality wake up call.  Life is not that simple.  I wish it was but it isn't.    Two words - wishful thinking.  If you are still under the spell of all the new age wishful thinking with little critical thinking - this book is for you, if not - stay away.    Even if looked from the viewpoint of mysticism, spirituality or religion - this book is not only nothing new in terms of ideas, but a huge simplification of their meaning.      If you find this book appealing, i suggest pick up a intro to philosophy book, you will learn more from 1 page then from 10 books of Paul Coelho.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|This is a MUST own for Blu-ray owners! This is the most amazing picture quality that I've sen since Planet Earth.  Although I have this movie on DVD and thought it was great, I watched the Blu-ray and sat there mesmorized by the movie.
B000PC8AFU|4.0|I was shocked to see how few stars this product has received. I purchased it myself through amazon a little while back before there were the reviews, and when I came back to see what people had reviewed, I was amazed that the average review was 2 stars. While this certainly is not the best collection of Stevie Ray Vaughan material, it certainly is not as bad as the reviews make it out to be.    I also have to disagree with many people who say it's bad because it's the record companies cashing in...   while this maybe be more or less true, it's still a decent collection of some hard to find (and great) material. I've read that many people said they already had half these songs...  Not every music fan has the entire Stevie Ray Vaughan catalog...   hell, I have all of his studio albums and some unofficial bootlegs, and I still only had about 3 or 4 songs out of the whole album already in my collection. For those of us that are fans of his music, you will enjoy this album. Especially if you want to hear how he interracts with other guitarists and musicians.    My personal favorite cuts would be The Sky Is Crying (With Albert King, B.B. King & Paul Butterfield), Goin' Down (with Jeff Beck), Oreo Cookie Blues [Live] (With Lonnie Mack) and Albert's Shuffle (with Albert Collins). It really is a good collection from Stevie's shortlived career, with material as early as 1978, to material as late in his career as 1988.    All in all, a good collection. There are a few tracks that don't really showcase Stevie's playing, that probably could have been better replaced (Let's Dance), but I think the point of this album was to showcase the versatility of the great Stevie Ray Vaughan. If you already have everything ever done by Stevie, you can skip this, since you've probably already come across the good tracks on this album. If you've got some SRV material but would like to hear a few of the other artists Stevie's performed with, get this album. It's not as bad as all the reviews make it out to be. I'd say probably 3.5/4 stars. I've heard better Stevie compilations, but this is still something that any blues fan should have.
B000VR824S|5.0|I tuned in to the original air date when broadcast on PBS,  thanks to a FYI Shoutout from the great staff that make up   Tulsa's Blues Society and was totally MEZMERIZED during the   entire concert !!! I was playing along,...and then TRYING to keep up with B.B., John Mayer, Albert Lee, Buddy Guy, Los Lobos, Jimmy Vaughan,...The INCREDIBLE Jeff Beck,...OH MY GAWWWD !!! Steve Winwood's performance was FANTASTIC !!! Vince Gill, Clapton and Sheryl Crow doing Tulsa Time ??? C'MON ??? Completely UN-REAL !!! (Ever so slightly biased,...being from Tulsa,.... what can I say ?? )  I urge anyone that loves guitars, variations of artists and styles,  or just GOOD, GOOD MUSIC - to RUN,....don't walk,....and GET THIS   DVD !!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED !!!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|As a bit of a foodie, I was a bit concerned about a Disney film that delved into the world of fine dining.  Fortunately, the movie ended up being one of my favorite Disney films of all time.  In addition to putting a charming new perspective on the world of celebrity chefs and their restaurants, the movie provided characters one could root for and a story that was intriguing and entertaining.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This is by far the best blu-ray disc I own, and David Gilmour is still the greatest living guitarist.
B000WS4OUW|5.0|This album is probably the the 2nd best of all the Danzig albums. The self titled first album is in my opinion the best. That being said , Lucifuge is a very,very close second. The original Danzig lineup created a much fuller sound on this second release. At times it even seems a bit radio friendly which makes me wonder why it never achieved more airplay. My suggested listening, as with the first Danzig album, is from beginning to end. Every song is good. This album is a true classic of the Danzig collection.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I love the last line of this great movie.  If you've never seen it, I won't give it away...but somehow it reminds me of the last line of Some Like It Hot (I won't give away that line either.)    It's hard to believe that the beautiful little girl is Natalie Wood.  And Ed Gynn make the perfect Santa Claus.      I like the original better than the re-make.      This is a charming movie that is great for the whole fmaily.    Also recommended:    [[ASIN:B000B5XOZC Christmas in Connecticut]]--a great Christmas movie in the screwball comedy tradition.    [[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]]--a touching look at the miracle of giving.
6304602901|4.0|I watched Police Academy Two and Three before this one.  I was  disappointed with some of the sensual humor, and then later realized it was rated R.  I had assumed it would be rated PG like the sequels.  Also, I didn't think it was as funny as Two and Three.  Don't get me wrong, it contained the classic Police Academy humor, but it took more time getting the action going due to the introduction of the characters, whereas the sequels got the characters immediately into action.  So, in the case of Police Academy, the sequels Two, Three and Four were funnier than the original.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|buy the dvd version.the hi-def version is VERY grainy & backgrounds flicker so much you may have a seizure. excellent movie bad format to view in
006056251X|5.0|I thought this story was the best out of the wallflower series. The characters were exciting and the love scenes steamy. St Vincent and Evie were two of the more interesting characters from the previous novels. Evie is desperate to get married to leave her abusive family and be with her dying father. Rake St Vincent desperately needs some money. Evie arrives at St Vincent's townhouse and suggests they quickly marry by eloping to Gretna Green that night. They are both desperate and each understands exactly what the marriage will be but the marriage between them becomes something precious and passionate.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The characters are interesting. Every episode is made differently. Overall, a wonderful show that deserves to be re-aired!
B0007OCG56|4.0|During this movie there are parts where I wanted to slap a few of the characters but for the most part I loved it. Don't bother watching this if your expecting to see a typical Adam Sandler flick, but if your into emotional stories about family ties,love,and relationships than it's for you. The story revolves around so many relationships and they're all very different. Mother and daughter,husband and wife,and the complicated tangle of affairs are just some of the main focuses. I found it touching and heartbreaking at the same time. But this is definetly a movie that only some can appreciate it's got a few funny moments but if you want to see a comedy pick something else.
0061142026|2.0|Warning!!! The Paperback version has no illustration. If you plan to buy this book because of the illustration, do NOT buy the paperback. The Amazon preview of this book is not creditable. I am very disappointed withthe paperback version.
0380789019|5.0|I picked up this book to read on a long plane flight and I was so hooked that I didn't even notice how long I was on the plane.  The book starts off and engulfs the reader in the story - there was no long delay in getting the plot underway.    I found the London Below setting to be a fantastic, Gothic place and the puns used on the names and people were very well done.  As someone who has been to London more than once, I picked up on many of them right away.    This was also my first introduction to Neil Gaiman and I must say that I will be looking into his other books.  The entire time I was reading the novel I kept thinking that this was so visual and atmospheric that it'd be a great movie - little did I know that it was!  The DVDs are now on my WishList.

B000Y96EWK|5.0|Some other \\"Trilogies\\" suffered from a severe degradation of quality with every new installment after having produced a hit with the first movie. Fortunately is the \\"Jason Bourne Trilogy\\" not part of this group, because the creators were able to create three movies that were each by themselves great movies in their own rights and also made sense when looked at as a whole. This movie is the third and last part (I hope) and the conclusion of the story does make perfectly sense and does not feel like an afterthought by the writers.<br /><br />As in the first two parts, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" and \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", does the anti-hero Jason Bourne play the cat and mouse game with his former employee, which brings him to different places throughout the world. The movie is action packed, but not over-the-top action like in the \\"Terminator\\" trilogy.<br /><br />It's an action movie and not a philosophical piece of intellectual depth, no, it is plain and simple good entertainment. Nothing more and certainly nothing less either.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|In the last year or so, I've become immersed in the Monterey Pop Festival and the blues from this time. I picked up Pearl because I love Janis and she's always been a genius figure in music. However, this album is one of the first albums to actually give me goosebumps. Listening to her voice, I saw so much versatility. She could get raspy and passionate in some of the tracks, while she could also tone it down and display her magnetic voice. Her backup band, which she helped choose, is a fantastic partnership to Janis.    Get this album. Whether you get this version or the version with a whole disc of live cuts, please get this album. The additional liner notes comment on this being her most mature and polished work, and that couldn't be more right. Pay tribute to one of the greatest, most classic blues singers and buy this album.
B000A2H812|5.0|In this day of musical mediocrity, Gogol Bordello provides the energy and excitement I've been holding out for for a few years now.  It's the kind of thing that when you're listening, you can't help but move to the beat.      My sister was the one who turned me on to them and then as a gift I bought her tickets to a show this past Summer.  I was totally hooked after that.  If I had to describe them in one word:    INTENSE!!!      Buy this CD if you're looking for an amazing, energetic, communal type experience.  They are inexplicably awesome!!!  You just have to see for yourself.    P.S.   If you can't get enough of them - also see the film Everything Is Illuminated - excellent film co-starring Eugene Hutz.
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for what it is: a book.   So many reviews are angry with the book, the author, the publisher, etc.   Why?  The book is the memoir of one woman's year-long trip.  Yes, it is unrealistic for most people; we simply can't up and go off for a year, leave jobs, and not to mention - where'd we get the money?  But she could, and so, let her!     No one is trying to brain-wash the general public into taking her book as gospel.  So, you disagreed with her insights... and... ???   I don't think I'll ever afford a trip around the world, and I certainly never wish to rough it in an ashram. I did, however, enjoy hearing about her journey.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|How can I say this. All the incredible \\"Friends\\" episodes, all in one box, all packaged in great individual boxes per season, with a guide book included, all for what.. 16 bucks a season!?!? How can you not buy this? I look about at other great series I want to own, and they want 30 bucks a season. 50 bucks a season. Friends wants... 16!    Get this today, it brings you into the friends world even if you aren't a huge fan. So many great episodes, and great actors, all packaged in a great full series gift box. Its a no brainer.
0385732554|4.0|The Good:    The story was compelling and the author was able to draw you into the characters. You really began to care about the few \\"real\\" people in the story. The people who know \\"anything\\" come alive and you feel the depth of the truly unique and horrible situation they are in.    I applaud the perspective on the intrinsic value of human life. The horror felt by the taking of innocent life for the convenience of the community is a breath of fresh air in our society.   I love the narration. I listen to quite a few books and quite a few narrators and Ron Rifkin did a first rate job here.    The Bad:    It seems that the most difficult part of a story to write is the ending. In this case the author simply chose not to write an ending, leaving the decision of what actually happened up to the reader.

0143038419|5.0|This is hands-down the best book I've ever read. It is an autobiography, but as the author is finding herself in her travels across the globe, her insights and experiences lend the reader tips to find themselves. It is funny and serious at the same time. It is very easy reading in the sense you feel as if you are having a conversation with the author, but it did take me a long time to get through the book as I wanted to take time and absorb what it had to offer. I am slightly envious of her travels, and found myself wishing I could have a similar journey, whether it be physical or mental. I received this as a gift, and I'm sure I'll be giving it as gifts for years to come. BUY IT, you won't be disappointed

0743270754|5.0|Goodwin delivers a very well written history book that reads like an interesting novel.  The cast of characters are all the more compelling for their being real.

B0002NRQTS|5.0|I have been a huge Rush fan for many years now, and i cannot state enough how intelligent, classy, and excellent the music is.    Neil Peart is an excellent songwriter, and he has a knack for creating songs that actually have a meaning, instead of deviating to the beer swilling, or gang banging music of nowadays. The music is comprehensible, giving you a feeling that you can relate to the words.    Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson combine to create an excellent sound to go along with the lyrics.     The key word for this rock group is EXCELLENT, period.
1400095204|5.0|This evocative novel took me back to when, as a junior lecturer in a Nigerian university in the 60's, I experienced the raw, pulsating life of West Africa, the inexorable turning of that energy and hope into destructive forces, the despair of those whose visions of Nigeria as a model black nation were disintegrating. All these aspects are brought to life in the earthy and sensitve portrayal of a varied cast of fully drawn characters in \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\". Their survival through the graphic horror of a shattering of civil life that must accompany inter-tribal warfare, left me in dismay and admiration.    A difficult and wonderful read. Bravo!
B000UR366S|4.0|In the opening selection of this c.d., \\"One Week Last Summer\\", Joni does an autobiographical introduction.  It's been 10 years since her last album.  But the creative juices poured out of her, one night at the piano, and what resulted was a song cycle for the week, and an epilogue (Rudyard Kipling's \\"If\\", put to Joni's music).<br /><br />Judging from this song cycle, Joni has had a bad week.  She is not happy with you, caretaker of this island Earth.  You have done a really cr@ppy job, in fact.<br /><br />I mean, 40 years ago, you paved paradise and put up a parking lot.  Now, apparently, it's a 10-story parking garage.  You babble on your cell phone in shopping malls, while condors and whales die as a result of your sludge.  You overpopulate this planet, and choose to \\"solve\\" the problem with needless wars.  You overdevelop, selling precious earth to California.  California!  Home of that girly-man, Governor Ahnold!  No wonder Catholic Priests are doing their dirty, filthy work, doggone their souls!  No wonder you support \\"shock and awe\\"!  No wonder your holy temple is in Vegas!<br /><br />There's just one problem with all this.  This c.d. is licensed to Starbucks.  Starbucks?  The folks that \\"Dr. Evil\\" and \\"Number One\\" spoofed in \\"Austin Powers\\"?  (Well, it all makes sense if your creative juices were fueled by a $4.00 double latte that evening at the piano!)<br /><br />But with all that said, before you Joni fans get to that neggie button and plaster yours truly, let me say this:<br /><br />\\"Night Ride Home\\" from 1991 was, IMO, one of the most influential pop albums of the last 20 years.  \\"Brilliant\\" doesn't begin to capsulize it.  Musically, this c.d. has the same musical buzz about it as \\"Night Ride Home.\\"  Bob Sheppard (soprano sax) sounds as good on this one as Wayne Shorter did on that one (a controversial statement, perhaps, but I'll stand behind it.)  While nothing on this one hits me at the emotional level of \\"Come in from the Cold\\", \\"Cherokee Louise,\\" or \\"Ray's Dad's Cadillac,\\" it still makes me think and want to listen more.<br /><br />And it reminds me of why Joni Mitchell is the most influential pop musician on this generation of jazz singers.  Erin Bode, Judith Owen, Sara Gazarek and Jackie Allen (to name 4 off the top of my head) owe huge debts to Ms. Mitchell, and all of the rest have their roots to some degree in Joni's music.  No wonder Herbie Hancock did a recent tribute to Joni Mitchell.  She deserves it.<br /><br />I'm giving this 4 stars only to emphasize the brilliance of \\"Night Ride Home.\\"  But I do recommend it to all.  Even if you like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, you ought to give it a listen.  RCme think and want to listen more.    And it reminds me of why Joni Mitchell is the most influential pop musician on this generation of jazz singers.  Erin Bode, Judith Owen, Sara Gazarek and Jackie Allen (to name 4 off the top of my head) owe huge debts to Ms. Mitchell, and all of the rest have their roots to some degree in Joni's music.  No wonder Herbie Hancock did a recent tribute to Joni Mitchell.  She deserves it.    I'm giving this 4 stars only to emphasize the brilliance of \\"Night Ride Home.\\"  But I do recommend it to all.  Even if you like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, you ought to give it a listen.  RC
B000NA2776|4.0|If Rufus Wainwright is too \\"out there\\" for you, don't even touch this CD.  Leave it alone.      However, if you are open-minded and enjoy infectious, brilliant music without worrying too much about categorizing it, PICK THIS UP.  Mika had me from the first song (the outstanding single \\"Grace Kelly\\"...like the bastard child of David Bowie, Freddy Mercury, and Elton John, what a great song!)      Throughout the rest of the album, he shows great musicmanship and range (there are ballads, rockers, disco tunes, electronic tunes...all over the map!)...the common component is that this guy just writes really great songs (plus there's his voice...almost a dead ringer for Freddy Mercury, and GREAT use of falsetto....)    Get this one, it's good...can't wait to hear more from Mika.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Slow paced with kindness, grace, warmth and caring seen throughout the movie.  Reminds me of a time in life that is sadly forever gone.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|There's just not enough adjectives to describe how good this movie really is. I was disappointed by Supermacy. But this movie far surpasses. Everything you wanted to know about Jason Bourne will be answered. It has everything action,great supporting casts,beautiful scenery and very clever plot. Not to be out done is the special features. This is a must!
B000I2IT44|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD. Must have for any Porcupine Tree fan, and a great way to get to know their music if you haven't heard it before, but you are interested to. Recomended for fans of Rush, Pink Floyd, Dream Theater, King Crimson... basically anything in the prog-metal and symphonic rock vein.<br /><br />The video in itself has a lot of effects that go very well with the music; so, if you like to watch the performance like you would in a live show and hate special effects on live concert dvds, you might want to think twice about this one. For me, I think it enhanced the musical experience.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is one of those albums that will never be forgotten. Even after you grow up and quit driving cheap sports cars and drinking till dawn with your friends, you'll hear a song from this CD and remember how good their music is. It's one of hundreds of CD's in my collection and every now and then I see it in my MP3 list and have to give it a whirl.  Good stuff!
6305263248|5.0|The plot of actions throughout the length of the movie and mysterious expression of characters are very enjoyable. Considerably, the story is somewhat related to Christmas time. Therefore, it is worth to spend your time to stay in the warm sofa and enjoy the non-stopped action movie while it's really cold outside during Christmas time. Highly recommended.
0793518326|1.0|While there are some things that are quite well done in this collection (and some things lacking that one can't realistically expect, such as variations in the parts when a section is repeated), there are some very inadequate transcriptions as well.<br /><br />As a pianist, I can vouch for the keyboard parts being completely wrong at times (especially where keyboards are featured, as in \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Lady Madonna,\\" for example). The sped-up solo in \\"In My Life,\\" in contrast, is quite close. Given the method used---having several people working separately, one for each type of part---it's not all that surprising that some aspects are weaker than others.<br /><br />The guitar parts look more impressive to me (but I'm much less proficient on that instrument). Then again, in the opening of \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" surely someone (John?) is just playing the open strings with a capo on the third fret.<br /><br />All that said, I think anyone who doesn't want to take the trouble to figure out what was played by listening to the songs over and over can learn quite a lot from this book. I'm giving it such a low rating because if it was worth doing (and I think it was), it was worth doing much, much better. But with the price, even of used copies, don't buy it, as I did---borrow it from the library.
B000W0DFDM|5.0|Hi  my name is Alex Duffy and I am a freshman at Loyola Marymount University. I am doing this review for a final paper in my Interpersonal Communications class. This book interested me because I had always heard so much about it and relationships are a big part of communications as a course. We explored this topic widely in my class with Professor Perry Reynolds. I personally have never been in the type of relationship or the mindset in which this book is aimed towards. However, I have dealt with many close friends that have been in all sorts of these situations and have revolved their lives around obsessing over failed relationships and first loves. I chose this book first because it directly related to what I learned in this course and second to get a better understanding on what my friends were going through, to better advise them on similar situations in the future. What I really enjoyed about this book were the labeled excuses and letters to Greg. There was not one thing that I didn't like about this book because I think that both men and women can benefit from reading this. What I found most valuable about this book was Greg's feedback. Although he was sometimes harshly blunt, he was straight to the point and stated exactly what these women needed to hear. I would most definitely recommend this book to everyone in a relationship, both men and women because it gives you a completely new outlook and better understanding of relationships all together. I now know what to expect from men and can be better prepared with my emotions in future relationships. One of the great things that this book focuses on is realization, assessing the situations you are and being practical throughout.
0060005696|4.0|This is a good book, but not great. It has a great idea that with more choices, we bring more stress upon ourselves, but that seems obvious.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|It's not just a CD, its an experience. Its seriously the greatest electronic music compilation of all time.
0330448447|5.0|This was a choice by my reading group and I really wasn't looking forward to reading it. I thought it was going to be a light `woman's' read, full of flowery descriptions. The cover, although very pretty looked like `The Secret Garden' and added to my reservations.<br /><br />How wrong I was!!<br /><br />The story is told by Grace, a wonderful character whose memories are reawakened by Ursula who is making a film about the tragic suicide of a poet. The way the author brings the realities of old age to us through Grace is both truthful and poignant.<br /><br />\\"She passes the photograph to me, lays it across my gnarled fingers. Our hands met for an instant and she withdraws quickly, frightened she might catch something. Old age perhaps.\\"<br /><br />So often the elderly are dismissed as just `old' and we can't imagine them ever being young. Yet Grace has experienced so much. As she shares her memories with us we get to know so many rich characters and you feel you're almost living through the first two decades of the twentieth century with her.<br /><br />For all it's nearly 600 pages, I just couldn't put it down and read it in 4 days.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|When I first heard Dream theater, I was blown away like any other, crazy hooks, and creepy keyboards, and Mike P is by far the best drummer alive. I have always been impressed with the Theater to give me what I need in metal, which is musical journeys and spirtual awaking. \\"Train of Thought\\" is a powerfull staement that unleashes an hour of pure Metal. The CD opens with \\"As I am\\", a kick you in the face force jester that does not let up until it ends. Not to be confused with Metallica, which seems to be the talk on a lot of these reviews. Dream Theater will and have never sounded like Metallica. \\"As I am\\" seems to go into ears of not so good listiners.  When I was younger, I'v always asked the question, can DT make an all out Metal ablum? and they did. I thank DT for making such a gifted and unapalogetic Metal CD. Now, for the rest of CD: \\"This Dying Soul\\" for me seems to be a tribute to old school Thrash Metal, with just under 12 min, it seems to fly by with soaring guitar work by John, and inaine drumming by Mike. Now even songs like \\"Endless Sacrifice\\", which has a bit of ballad, and a bit of Metal. Lots of keys. Joarden is an amazing and trueley gifted soul, and goes a little jazz like in \\"Sacrifice\\". Now for my Favorite song  \\"Vacant\\", a song lyricly writtin by James, is a creepy, and haunting journey into self depature. Which by the way is their first ever album with one Ballad, amazing...truely amazing.  In closing, I have all of DT cd's and \\"Train of Thought\\" will always be along with \\"Awake\\", and \\"6 degrees\\", my favorite DT album. DT sets moods on all their albums, this just happend to be a crazy, fist in the air, mosh pit, journey into the world of Heavey Metal. This is a \\"DREAM THEATER MASTERPIECE\\".
B00005JPLW|5.0|Amazing movie, but a litte bit science fiction, but anyways it's pretty good.  feel a little bit sorry for persians since i am one of them, but anyways despite that fact love the movie and holywood effects.
B0000931QA|5.0|Concept albums either work really well or fall completely flat. There's no imbetween. Problem is, a lot of concept albums are terrible. Of course, the seminal concept albums (like \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Ziggy Stardust\\") are spectacular; But, Queensryche's epic \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is not only the band's best album, but also one of the best concept albums I've ever listened to.     It's got only 15 tracks, two singles were released from the album (\\"I Don't Believe in Love\\" and \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\"). But every single track is solid. I'm not going to get into the story of the album (anyone reading this knows the story of Nikki, Sister Mary, Dr. X, and the whole religious and political corruption that occurs throughout the story. Queensryche really hit their stride with this album...In earlier albums, Geoff Tate's vocals sounded slightly muffled (listen to \\"Walk in the Shadows\\"); But here, they're crystal clear...And his voice on this album (and \\"Empire\\") is really where it was in peak form. The lead guitar work of Chris DeGarmo, combined with the rhythm guitar sensibilities of Michael Wilton on top of Scott Rockenfield's terrific; John Bonham-league drumming...The musicianship here is just amazing.    The album opens with \\"I Remember Now\\" and \\"Anarchy-X\\" which are transition songs, building to the epic moment where the first actual song stars \\"Revolution Calling.\\" \\"Anarchy-X\\" is a short instrumental, on top of being a transition song and it does a great job of building up to \\"Revolution Calling\\" which has brilliant lyrics that would sound good if they didn't sound GREAT coming from Geoff Tate's vocal cords. But it doesn't stop there; the title track is next and is one of the most well-known songs from the album. The entire song is terrific, with my favorite being the final verse (\\"Hey Nikki!\\"). \\"Speak\\" took some time to grow on me, but when the song finally hit me...I began listening to it over and over again. The lyrics are angry, but intelligent...Lines like \\"The system we learn says we're equal under law. But the streets are reality; the weak and poor will fall. Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown. Educate the masses; we'll burn the White House down\\" are still relevant today. The next track, \\"Spreading the Disease\\" is my favorite song on the album. The lyrics are absolutely fantastic; \\"Spreading the disease, everybody needs. But no one wants to see, the way society...Keeps spreading the disease.\\" Or \\"He takes her once a week on the altar like a sacrifice.\\" Tate's high-notes and vocal cadence on this song are terrific. The next track, \\"The Mission\\" penned by Chris DeGarmo has some of the most epic vocals on the album. \\"Suite Sister Mary,\\" the 10+ minute song that truly defines epic is brilliant. Another song that I couldn't stop listening to once it hit me how good it was. \\"The Needle Lies\\" is terrific (one of the most memorable songs they play live, if you see them...Which I did over a year ago before I was familiar with any of their music). \\"Electric Requiem\\" (a transition song) and \\"Breaking the Silence\\" are great. Then we get \\"I Don't Believe in Love,\\" which features some of the best (and easily, stand-alone) lyrics on the album and Geoff Tate's most emotionally filled vocal performance. The next two songs \\"Waiting for 22\\" and \\"My Empty Room\\" are transition songs, but they don't feel like it. They just seem like short tracks (\\"Waiting for 22\\" is an instrumental and \\"My Empty Room\\" has vocals). The album ends with the masterpiece \\"Eyes of a Stranger,\\" In which Tate sings one of his very best lyrics \\"Why am I here? And for how long?\\"     Few albums (especially concept albums) can really claim to be perfect,  But \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is. There is nothing wrong with this album, there's no flaw. There's not a weak high note, a sour guitar note, a misuse of symbols, a wasted bassline, etc. NOTHING! Even if you don't really care about the story behind \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" (which is terrific, by itself); This is just a great rock album. In my opinion, it's the best concept album of all time. Better than any Pink Floyd album for just great songs...It's a masterpiece that no music fan should be without.    GRADE: A
B000WMEAKC|3.0|I bought this album because of the popular song (#4) on it.  It was a decent cd, but not as great as I expected.  Songs sound a bit alike...so maybe get a little listen of each song before you decide to buy. That said, I do not regret buying it. Oddly, I enjoy listening to it more at home than in the car...?!

B00005JLEU|5.0|I can't give a thorough review without giving too much of the movie away as well, so I can only offer prospect viewers some personal advice at best:    This isn't your average anime. Its chalk full of heavy Japanese cultural-overtones and some things in this film may \\"offend\\" parents. For example: a vomiting scene, parent transformation, etc. But no bad language or sexual innuendo though. You'd just have to watch the film and decided for yourself whether you should love it or hate it; and keeping an open mind is definitely a must while watching this particular anime.    I loved it, but there's no guarantee that you will.
B00004S6GL|3.0|What most people will find here, is a collection of marginally depression, hookless indy pop. After a time, the songs largely start to run together and sound the same. Not a bad album by any means, but certainly not worthy of the praise it receives in this listener's opinion.      Trust me, you can skip this one.
B000ZOW96Y|1.0|I had the same problem as some other users. I rented this movie and downloaded it. When I went to watch it later it was gone and no record of it ever being there could be found. Amazon took my $3.99 claiming I already watched it. Don't rent this movie. It is broken.
0316001821|3.0|The main problem I have with `The Lovely Bones' is that it doesn't really connect to the reader.  At least I had a really hard time connecting.  The characters never meant anything to me.  I just read page after page, hoping that eventually something or someone would strike me and I would feel invested in what I was reading, but instead I just turned yet another page, the void in my growing wider.  It's not that the book is amateur in its construction, because it's not.  Alice Sebold does a wonderful job creating her mood, setting her scene so-to-speak; it's just that this mood or scene is unfulfilling.  I know that this book is raved about by many, professed to be a classic of all classics but I just don't see it.  It's a sweet book, and in the end I will admit I felt a little something in the pit of my stomach, but it's nothing close to classic and nowhere close to astonishing or brilliant.<br /><br />`The Lovely Bones' tells us the story of Susie Salmon, a young girl who is raped and murdered within the first few pages.  This of course should be devastating, and I'm not saying that it isn't, but I just didn't feel the emotional pull I was expecting.  When I read `Reservation Road' earlier this year I felt the pain and agony of losing a child.  I felt the guilt and the blame and the self loathing that comes with not having the answers.  When I read `Atonement' just a few months ago I felt so connected to these characters that by the books closing I was in tears.  With `The Lovely Bones' I didn't get that feeling.  Everything is so lighthearted here, even when bad things are happening, when Susie's family is falling apart inside and out it just seems so carefree as if it has no real impact.  I don't want to give much away but I will say that even when people close to the victim, like say Susie's mother Abigail, do something unkind or selfish I still felt nothing, not remorse, not frustration, not understanding.  Maybe this was because Susie seemed to feel nothing as she watched the events unfold from heaven.<br /><br />I know that I'm in the minority here.  I understand that but I can't and won't lie about my feelings on this novel.  It's not a `bad' novel, but it is not a great one.<br /><br />The story that is told is of the after effects of Susie's murder on her family.  She watches from heaven as her killer slips through the fingers of the police, as the police search for her body and as her parents search for answers.  She wants to help them, lead them in the right direction but she can only do so much.  The novel tries to flesh out how this tragedy has affected the relationships of everyone around her, some growing stronger, some falling apart, and it succeeds...some of the time.  If the tone of the novel had been a tad darker, a tad harsher then maybe it would have resonated more.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on Harvey, the biggest clich&eacute; in the book (and this book is full of clich&eacute;s come to think of it).  His `killer' was so `been-there-done-that' and his `demise' was a HUGE let down.<br /><br />There are moments in this novel that are beautiful, even if they are rare.  A scene involving Susie in her heaven with another one of Harvey's victims is truly spellbinding, and an `out of body experience' towards the end is probably the highlight of the novel, but all in all there is little here that is truly memorable.  There is a lot of hype surrounding this novel, and maybe if the hype was not there then this would have been a better experience, but I was expecting greatness and that's not what I got.<br /><br />The most real character to me was that of Ruth, someone who wasn't even closely related to the victim yet became the closest person to her after the incident.  Ruth's obsession with Susie's murder is the most engrossing and interesting aspect of the novel.  If the whole novel had revolved around Ruth and her `gift' then it would have been more palatable.<br /><br />Susie's family, much like Harvey, was one big clich&eacute;.  None of these characters are anything knew to the whole `tragedy befell us' scenario.  In fact Susie's parents Jack and Abigail deal with this situation much like Ethan and Grace did in the aforementioned `Reservation Road' except with different results.  The tone within `Reservation Road' was much darker.  As you watched Ethan and Grace drift apart you felt so much pain in your heart for them because you could feel them unraveling in the air of their son's death.  With Jack and Abigail though you feel a bit confused and bewildered with their decisions, and the fact that time moves so fast towards the end we are never really brought into Abigail's world to understand her decisions.  I actually hated her character. I felt no sympathy for her and yet I couldn't feel sympathy for Jack either.  He just seemed like a moody mess.  When his son Buckley goes off on him towards the end of the book I felt like shouting \\"Hallelujah\\" since it was about time someone kicked him in the butt.<br /><br />Lindsey, of the family members, is probably the most realistic depiction of grief.  She handles it much like you would expect someone would.  If only the rest of the family were `normal' like she was.<br /><br />I know it seems like I'm bashing this novel entirely, and I'm sure that most people are going to dog this review as well, but I have to speak my opinion and I hope that you can take this for what it is and maybe this review will be of some use to you.  Ultimately we all have to make up our own minds on a matter.  Maybe the lighthearted feel of `The Lovely Bones' is just what you need, or like me, maybe you are put off by it's mood and tone.  I'm glad I read the novel but it did not have the impact I expected it to.  It's a nice sweet story, but in the end that's about it.ing knew to the whole `tragedy befell us' scenario.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|No complaints. The DVD is just as expected, and it came within the given timeframe.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Plenty of swearing (the f-word 138 times - way more than the minutes in the movie), not a female character in sight. Glengarry Glen Ross is a chamber piece of the highest order - A Death of a Salesman, a Seize the Day, brought bang up to date to lay bare the Sysiphean masculine endeavours of seedy real estate salesman.<br /><br />This movie is all acting and dialogue. Set pretty much in two places - an office and a restaurant, Mamet's play is brought to the big screen in as minimalist a way as possible. Clearly the bulk of the budget went on the cast - and what a brilliant scoop. Pacino, Baldwin, Lemmon, Spacey. Guys at the top of their game in a world of cheating, lying, charming and conniving to get the signature on the line of dodgy real estate leads. Pacino as Roma, the slick fast talking salesman was the highlight for me - but also brilliant were Spacey as Williamson the 'Company Man' and Lemmon as Levine - the has been, working his crow's feet expressions, his  anxious nibbling on the levers of his glasses, into a foolish gamble that leads to his downfall.
B000MV9026|4.0|This movie is the cutest thing I have seen in a long time. There are lots of chuckles and laughs. The main character is a loveable little guy who goes through some real changes in his short life. He shows us all that being different is a good thing, and we have to follow our hearts.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Very impressed. As a life long Who fan I am always looking for new info regarding my favorite group, and this did not disappoint. Although there was less pure music than The Kids are Alright, the biographical information was spectacular. I was pleased to see that the post-Keith and post-John version of the band was also included. I grow weary of the constant dismissal of the bands work after Keith's death. Face Dances and It's Hard may not be Quadrophenia but they still have good music to offer. As a final thought, my wife and I were able to attend their Long Beach show last winter and I was very pleased to see that shows version of Tea and Theater closing out the disc.   Great tribute to the only band that matters.
068987474X|5.0|A well written book with lots of great advice. Greg is an awesome author and has great insight into guys and how to deal with (or without) them.
B000W0DE7O|5.0|Simply Red Live at Royal Albert Hall is a MUST HAVE. The band's possibly last DVD made since lead singer Mick Hucknall is going solo in 2010. There will be a Greatest Hits tour in 2009, but this was the last collective performance of the recent Simply Red Band which was performed in May 2007, 6 sold out performances.  You'll have tears in your eyes when you realize this IS Simply Red, and you MUST have this DVD. Order this, and all other DVD's produced, as memories you'll always cherish.

0060012218|4.0|The Geography Club is a fun book. Very fast pased. Russel is an interesting carector, but I was just wondering where the parents were through all this. He never had a conversation with any of his parents, or adults for that matter, except the coach, and it was very brief. But besides that, I enjoyed the story. Can't wait to read the sequel.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|The first Duran Duran album was moody, danceable pop with some rock sensibility sprinkled around for good measure. It was a new sound. \\"New Romantic\\" was the coined phrase of the day. Then they followed up the first album with a smash hit called \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\" which was a stand-alone single that had all the pieces in under four minutes. They were stars.    Rio ups the ante. More guitars, more melodic pop, more suggestive phrasing and some more rock added to the mix. You get the moody experiemental pieces like \\"The Chauffer\\" and \\"Save A Prayer\\" along side some burners like \\"Hold Back The Rain\\" and \\"Rio.\\" \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" is a killer single and \\"New Religion\\" really gives them some street credibility as songwriters. \\"New Religion\\" became a concert staple they still play today and for good reason. It's a great rock track. Something no one had heard so clearly in any previous Duran Duran tune.    Even the \\"filler\\" here like \\"Last Chance on that Stairway\\" and \\"Lonely in your Nightmare\\" work very very well. This is Class A pop music for 1982 or any era. Great stuff!
037582913X|5.0|This book will keep your little ones interested and involved with every exciting turn of the page.  It was my favorite book when I was little, because my mom was so animated when she read it to me!  It was like watching a play!  I was SO HAPPY to find a copy of this book, and I know my  new baby will love it as much as I did.  What a great memory!
B000002V1D|4.0|Funny now how Justin Timberlake is working with Duran Duran because he was a fan \\"back in the day, you know, when they had hits like 'Ordinary World.'\\"...    Obviously this was past Duran's \\"Day\\" of regular hit singles like \\"Hungry Like The Wolf,\\" \\"Rio\\" and \\"Is There Something I Should Know.\\" Funny also that many people talking about this album talk about the first time they heard \\"Oridinary World.\\" I remember the first time I heard it too as the radio alarm went off and it was playing. I thought, that's an interesting song, wonder who it is? I was floored when I heard it was Duran Duran. The songs is simply haunting in its beauty and gravity. A wonderful ballad of depth and feeling.     In addition to O.W., there are plenty of other good songs here like \\"Come Undone,\\" \\"Love Voodoo,\\" \\"Too Much Information\\" and \\"Sin Of the City,\\" but where things tend to break apart some are in the number of average songs like \\"Drowning Man,\\" \\"UMF,\\" and \\"To Whom It May Concern.\\" None of those songs are bad, they just don't stand out like the others. Still this was a welcome album and an improvement over \\"Liberty\\" which lacked any really great songs like the ones included here.    I also felt like Warren Cuccurullo really became a fully assimilated member of the band here. He started to contribute more to Duran's sound from this point too (especially on 2000's Pop Trash). Warren is a very gifted guitarist and Duran was lucky to have him. My opinion is that they should have never parted with him, but who am I?    I also saw the band on this tour at West Point Military Academy and it was knock-down great! I'll never forget Simon strutting around the stage in his pink suits and bleach-blond hair to hundreds of cadets in uniform all singing \\"Hungry Like The Wolf.\\" Quite surreal.    So here we have the commercial success that Duran Duran has been trying to regain ever since. This is an excellent album. The ballads like O.W. and C.U. are some of thier best songs. Even with the filler songsyou can't go wrong by adding this to your collection.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Holly Hunter is fantastic in this movie, as is Richard Dreyfus.  But John Goodman steals the show.  I think it's one of Spielberg's best but I'm a sucker with love stories.  Yes, it's probably a chick flick but my husband enjoys it too.
B000024KBZ|4.0|I first have to say that \\"The Edge Of America\\" goes into my top ten of best Duran songs ever! The only problem is that it is so short (under 3 minutes), but it does surge into \\"Lake Shore Driving\\" to complete the album.    Now, the rest of \\"Big Thing\\" is quite good. It's experiemental in a way not all Duran Duran albums often are. \\"Big Thing\\" takes many of the lessons learned from \\"Notorious\\" and adds in a few current dance trends and pop moves.     Some of the most effective tunes here are the ones that play it straight. \\"Do You Believe In Love?\\" is earnest and heartfelt, \\"Too Late Marlane\\" is simply sublime pop and \\"\\"The Edge Of America\\" is intellectual, beautiful and poignant.    The album begins with the rock-pop slam of \\"Big Thing\\" which is a sly job at the record business circa 1989. The wierd part of it is that it is followed immediately by \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\" which is a track so much of its time its hard to imagine it without thinking of the world pre-grunge. So they slam the music biz and then kow-tow to it right off the bat.    Then we get the absolutely wierd yet affecting pop mash of \\"All She Wants Is\\" before settling into a groove for the rest of the album.    \\"Big Thing\\" goes in several directions and that's what stops it from being an immediate classic (something that could be said of many Duran albums actually). There are enough excellent moments to recommend it highly though even if only for \\"Edge Of America\\" and \\"Do You Believe In Shame?\\"
B000W1V44I|5.0|I have loved the band for years and can admit that I have not loved the last 2 CD's. I do however love this one. Critics have criticized the CD for being too \\"sentimental\\" and offering nothing new. It is somewhat sentimental...but when did that become a bad thing? But the CD shows so much growth from the band. A.J. and Brian have always been the stronger voices of the group, with Howie limited primarily to back-up and Nick utilizing the \\"cuteness factor\\" to cover for his vocal limitations. This CD showcases each of the band members' work in strengthening their vocals and sharing the spotlight. BSB can't go back to their boy-band hayday, but they can be proud of the \\"Backstreet\\"  MEN that they have become.
B00009L1OB|4.0|OK, you have two bonafide classic albums under your belt, you are dubbed the \\"fab five,\\" you take over the new music venue (MTV) with a vengence but you are seen through the eyes of the \\"rock music press\\" as bubblegum or teeny-bopper music. So you take some time with a new producer (80's miracle worker Alex Sadkin) and go over the top in terms of image and create \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger.\\" Even the title screams \\"Hey, this album is important!\\"    Unfortuantely, as most albums that are designed to be masterpieces from the start, this album has some problems. The sound is cold and angular even when the music calls for more sympathetic production. \\"New Moon on Monday\\" is a great song, but the production here reduces it to an odd anti-ballad with harmonies that sound like something you'd hear on a King Crimson record.    The funny part is that it is exactly this awkwardness that endears the album to its listeners. You listen and you know it doesn't really work, but it's still a lot of fun to hear.    Everytime I hear that \\"Why-yi-yi-yi\\" chorus in \\"The Relfex\\" I think to myself, \\"boy that's bad, but boy do I want to hear it again.\\" The bass line alone in \\"The Reflex\\" is enough to redeem that tune. Then you have \\"Union Of The Snake\\" which really does show what Duran Duran were trying for. Something rock orientated with a pop sense about it. On that song they fire on all cylindars just like they do on \\"Shadows On Your Side\\" and \\"Of Crime and Passion.\\" And even if lyrics like \\"My head is full of chopstick and I don't like it\\" (from \\"Cracks in the Pavement\\") make you cringe, I'd be damned if Simon Le Bon doesn't make an equally awkwardly worded and constructed ballad like \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" work.    Confounding thing this \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger,\\" but confoundingly brilliant and worth listening to.
0143038419|4.0|I loved this book because I totally relate to this woman. I'm also an aspiring writer who desperately tries to control her negative thinking-and is searching for God. The narrator is funny--although some reviewers are \\"disgusted\\" by her--Gilbert is a real woman-with real emotions. I think we should all look at our own lives before we judge others...<br /><br />The book is an easy read-and deals with the big issues-what is our purpose? It's a light-hearted alternative to deeper more philosophical, more BORING books. It is about living in the NOW-appreciating the NOW.<br /><br />And honestly, I used to be an avid reader--but I've only managed to finish 3 books this year incl/ this one--the others were The Red Tent, and Harry Potter 7. So kudos to Ms. Gilbert!
B000WQW988|5.0|This is an excellent purchase for any true Nirvana fan. I've been waiting for this release since 1994 - even before DVDs were created. It was so fulfilling to see the show in it's entirety and also the additional rehearsal footage. There's nothing I can say about this performance that hasn't been said. Buy it, now.

B000002UA9|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! One of rock's greatest debut albums. This album exploded on the charts in Europe but took a few months to do so, domestically. Great songs included here: \\"When I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Boys\\", \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"Love Me Do\\" & \\"Twist and Shout\\". The Beatles were such originalists & talented leaving their mark on any song that they covered. They proved that the band itself could write great songs without depending on the so-called \\"professional\\" songwriter; but, still, even George Martin at this stage still tried to impose that yoke upon them. It wouldn't take very long for Martin & the powers-that-be at Parlophone Records to realize that they had two of the greatest songwriters on contract. Just enjoy the ride & realize how fresh this still sounds; also, consider the technology of the day (this was recorder live in about 13 hours, without much sound separation & on a two track machine!!!). Folks, that's an incredible piece of business!
0061544493|5.0|I'm a beauty product & fashion junkie. I'm not a die-hard VBeckham follower. I'm a regular person with an average budget. Yes, she raves about brand names (clothing) that most of us can't or won't afford, but that didn't take away from the charm of the book.    I'd compare this book to a girl sitting down & writing about her favorite girlie things & sharing what she's learned along the way. If you're looking for specific guidelines on fashion & beauty...or looking to be told what to do, you will be disappointed. If you enjoy the ramblings & thoughts, and like to be inspired by the sheer joy & excitement fashion plays in the life of another girly-girl....get it! I will re-read this book section-by-section and enjoy every second of it. It makes me think more about what I like & what I don't like.

B00000IP2L|5.0|This is the first BLS cd from Zakk Wylde and co.  After years with Ozzy, and two solo CD-Pride and Glory and the solo Zakk Wylde-this cd marks the return of Wyldes brand of loud, unbiased heavy metal. Sounds like a Alice in Chains/Corrosion Of Conformity cross with Sabbath directing the mayhem. Top tracks are 'Bored to Tears', 'Hey You' 'The Rose Petalled Garden' which was Guns and Roses demo from when Zakk was playing with them mid 90's, he just finished it. The awesome acoustic numbers 'Spoke in the Wheel' and 'Taz' are tossed in for good measure.  'Taz' sounds like Van Halen's eruption, only on acoustic.  Audio mixing is a little on the loud side, the bass guitar and the distorted guitars are really in your face, but then again, thats the point of this kinda music in the first place.
B000FUO0C4|3.0|Britishers Mrs. Moore and her prospective daughter-in-law, Adela Quested, make the arduous journey to India to visit Mrs. Moore's son, Ronny Heslop.  He is a magistrate in Chandrapore, India, during the British occupation of that country.  The two ladies make the acquaintance of Dr. Aziz, a local doctor who offers them a chance to see the \\"real India\\" by visiting the Marabar caves.  Hoping to please the British ladies, he plans a wonderfully complicated and expensive journey.  However, an unfortunate misunderstanding erupts into a tragic affair that point up the cultural differences and seething anger between the two cultures.<br /><br />Was Miss Quested attacked by Dr. Aziz in the caves?  This question becomes the central issue which propels the plot and lays bare the hostility and polarizing feelings of superiority and inferiority prevalent at the time.  The reader is swept into the life of Dr. Aziz as more misunderstandings cause a permanent rift with his dearest friend and gives him a genuine hatred of the English. While the pompous Heslop contends his countrymen are in India to do justice and keep the peace, the appalling behavior on both sides explodes at a trial and lingers long after.<br /><br />Forster is adept at not taking sides, at showing both the British as well as the Indian side of the issues.  In his fair and balanced telling, the reader can alternately sympathize with Dr. Aziz or Miss Quested.  Neither wins when the truth is revealed and both are forever scarred by the incident in the Marabar caves.<br /><br />In 1984, David Lean brought this drama to the big screen and, in my opinion, actually improved on the source material by making the characters more sympathetic and capturing visually the beauty of India.  Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested atop an elephant riding to the Marabar caves is a breath-taking scene and one any viewer will long remember.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|As a dropkick fan for over 13 years I liked the album for the songs that are harder and faster and reminescent of their old school stuff. I could really do with out most of the bubble-gum pop songs that are appearing more and more in recent albums. All and all it's still dropkick so I mostly enjoyed it.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|This is by far the best Trilogy HD DVD set to date. Amazing HD DVD picture quality & audio quality. I highly recommend it 1000000%.    If you have an HD DVD player, then this set is a MUST.
B00005JPNW|3.0|The Golden Compass is one of those fantasy series that just released one movie just to see how it would do. I honestly hate when film-makers do that. I mean I liked a Series of Unfortunate Events and couldn't wait for another part and then I hear it won't happen because the first didn't make enough money. That movie at least tried to end everything in one movie just in case. The Golden Compass basically ends with nothing being resolved. So if it doesn't make enough money we'll never find out what happens next, well unless you read the books.<br /><br />  What also bugs me is that the cast is great and if sequels do happen none of them are even signed on for more. Plus if it takes years to make another Dakota Blue Richards might be too old for the part which would be a shame. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig get to make a better movie together since the Invasion and are really good. But it's Dakota Blue Richards that's really needed if another is made. She's a talented young actress that literly came out of nowhere who really owns the part. If the girl in Little Miss Sunshine could be nominated for that then give Dakota Blue Richards a nomination as well.<br /><br />  The movie looks great and does have some cool battles. Most of the fights are owned by the big Polar Bear who's also a good thing about the movie. It's just that the movie makes you think ok that part was cool and so was that part but that's all ? It could've easily have been longer and the actors really deserved it to be because they are all in top form. It's too short and anti-climatic than they deserved but hey the movie is still 100 times better than Eragon at least. They just need to plan another one quick before Dakota Blue Richards gets too old and because I just wanna see what happens next.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Many people don't realize this isn't new. Isaac Asimov copyrighted this story originally as four short stories in 1950. Isaac and Harlan Ellison were good friends that frequently read each others works. Isaac dreamed of having this story made into a movie and asked Harlan to write the screenplay, which he did, and after several rewrites, he sent the final draft to Isaac in 1978. Between these two great authors, and after being lied to by that \\"jerk Bob Shapiro, head of Warner Bros.\\" the movie was never made, even after three more re-writes. But, as Harlan points out, two things stood in the way of getting the movie made: 1-this was post-Star Wars with new movie tech that would make the movie possible, however, as Jules Renard (1864-1910) said, \\"Writing is an occupation in which you have to keep proving your talent to people who have none\\"; and 2-Warner Bros. bought the rights to the screenplay, but studio jerk Shapiro took a meeting with Harlan in which Harlan was told a budget of $17-20 millon, tie up Warner for at least two years, only for Harlan to learn in the meeting that Shapiro hadn't even read the screenplay! It was after both Harlan and Isaac were dead before yet another re-write making the main character for Will Smith, Dr. Susan Calvin is the protag in this story, so this final re-write is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", but about the only thing in common with the original story by Isaac Asimov is the title, which these studios \\"option\\" for years at a time, more to keep others from making them, even if they have no intention of ever making the movie themselves! I loved the movie, but it shouldn't be confused with the wonderful works of Isaac Asimov and Harlan Ellison. As Harlan dedicated his screenplay: \\"To Isaac, my buddy, who, simply put, made this a better world\\".
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I won't get into the details of the movie as there are plenty of others for you to read.     The idea is that a train takes children who do not believe in Santa Claus to the North Pole.     My son absolutely loves this movie and I admit that I enjoyed it when I watched it as well.     What I did not like, however, is the fact that the North Pole looks so industrial. It's not hard to imagine that hundreds of thousands (however many--there were a lot!) could build a toy for every kid that believed in Santa in one year. And the North Pole looked more like a large city than what I imagined as a kid.     For me, part of the magic of believing in Santa was that it seemed impossible. A smallish group of elves in a quaint little Christmas-like village making toys for all the boys and girls. The North Pole just seemed cold (no pun intended) and not very friendly in this movie. Also, Tom Hanks had quite an attitude and I really didn't care for that the second time I watched it either. I could also really do without his singing in the Hot Chocolate number.     Overall, it's great for kids, but honestly the way the North Pole is depicted in \\"Elf\\" and regular classics is the way I picture it and this just left a weird taste in my mouth.
1400086035|5.0|The quintessential Christmas story read by Jim Dale with all the skill (and voices) with which he read the Harry Potter novels.  Wonderful to listen to as you do your Christmas decorating or baking.  I bought copies to give as gifts for several people this year.
B0000041LO|5.0|\\"Delightful\\" is a single word to describe this recording of Haydn's Piano Trios. I was fortunate to find one of the apparently few remaining copies of the Beaux Arts Trio's performance of the complete Landon edition trios on Philips (Polygram 454 098-2). (This was before the apparent re-release.)  This ten and a half hour treasure was originally very well-recorded in the 1970s on analog tape in Switzerland and the Netherlands, then first released on CD in 1991, then again in 1996.     The Beaux Arts plays wonderfully; not much more could be asked from these performances, other perhaps for a slightly more distant microphone perspective. It's amazing that F.J. Haydn had been considered largely irrelevant by his succeeding romantic generations. His compositions are, for lack of a better description, classically classical and far less \\"cute\\" than the precocious and better-known works of upstart Mozart. The Beaux Arts is able to infuse the joyful compositional beauty of Papa Haydn's trios with skillful elegance and charm.     There are some definite surprises, particularly in the later works.  As others have noted, Haydn presaged the Romantic period in some of his later trios.  The variety of compositions presented here are at times beautifully proportioned and balanced, elegant and refined, humorous and witty, joyous and rollicking.  In short they aptly display much of the skill, talent and personality of one of my favorite composers.

B000UNYJV8|5.0|This Is England, the fifth feature film by Shane Meadows (whose debut feature was the 1998 boxing drama Twentyfour Seven), is set in the summer of 1983 and concerns an 11-year-old boy named Shaun (played by newcomer Thomas Turgoose) whose father has recently been killed in the Falkland Islands war. In the course of the story, the boy grows up mighty fast as he falls in with a couple of gangs.    First, lonely Shaun is befriended by a fun-loving bunch of skinheads led by the affable Woody (Joe Gilgun). Woody and his mates are a likable and fairly harmless lot, and their scenes together are quite entertaining. But the party doesn't last forever: Soon a rift forms in the group when their old friend Combo (Stephen Graham) returns from a stint in prison transformed into a nationalistic neo-Nazi, and Shaun chooses to side with his seething posse.    In the hands of lesser talents, Combo might have been portrayed as a one-dimensional racist monster, and it would be a total mystery as to why Shaun would be drawn to him. But it's a credit to both actor Graham and screenwriter Meadows that there's so much more to the character: Combo is handsome and charismatic, he sympathizes with the fatherless Shaun, and though cursed with a frightening, hair-trigger temper, he also shows vulnerability; furthermore, even if you don't approve of his rants or how he terrorizes the local Pakistani immigrants, at least you can sense the frustration and fear behind his words and deeds. Indeed, the entire cast is uniformly strong; Turgoose, Gilgun, and Graham are the dominant figures here, but the many fine supporting players include Jo Hartley as Shaun's caring mother, Andrew Shim as Woody's Afro-Jamaican pal Milky, and Vicky McClure as Combo's former girlfriend Lol.    I must note that, while TIE is an undeniably personal story for Meadows (it was mostly inspired by incidents from the British writer-director's own childhood), you don't have to be a Brit who grew up in the '80s to appreciate it; for one thing, the notion of the gang-as-surrogate-family is timeless and universal. Also, when Combo rages about unemployment, cheap immigrant labor, a \\"fake war,\\" and needing to \\"fight\\" to take back his country, it hits uncomfortably close to home. (Much as I hate to say it, just replace the references to \\"Pakis\\" with \\"Mexicans,\\" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with President Bush, and the Falkland Islands with Iraq, and such scenes could almost be taking place here in the US today.)    As Shaun falls further under Combo's influence, what started as a funny and sweet (if gritty) coming-of-age tale becomes as disturbing and powerful as Meadows' previous feature, the 2004 anti-revenge thriller Dead Man's Shoes. When I first caught DMS on DVD earlier this year (my first exposure to Meadows' work), I thought that it was nearly as good as anything by fellow Brit Mike Leigh (whose films I've admired for their realistic, emotionally rich style) and that Meadows was a talent worth keeping an eye on. TIE only further confirms my initial opinions of the guy, and I will be looking forward to any projects he has planned for the future.
B000Y179KO|1.0|i have listened to the eagles for years and jumped for joy after finding out they got back together. however this new album puzzles me. their first studio album in years and it is a 2 disc set that pretty much stinks. i would challenge anyone to listen to this album and come up with enough songs to make a halfway decent standard (10 songs) album. i counted 3. if this album was released by any other group it would have tanked from the beginning. poor effort in my opinion
B00004VXF2|5.0|How some of the used copies say \\"minor blemishes but plays fine.\\" Like, who could tell anyways, right? That's funny. I have a vinyl copy that's scratched all to heck and I think that qualifies it as my own cover version of MMM.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|I really hate 99.9% of the horror films made after 1974 -- It seems that after the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the final golden age of the horror film had ended and most of what was left was slasher films, teenagers in terror, and something presently referred to as slasher porn. Vulgar, lacking in brainpower and inspiration (unlike the wonderful old mad doctors and madmen, who made you think they were more reasonable than the \\"sane\\" people around them), the horror film has been hijacked just like the good values of a religion giving way to the rages of fanatics and fundamentalists. But, I found Underworld to be an exception. Fast paced, an attempt at a sensible story, and it contains conflict that one can relate to from all opposing characters. At some point, you almost wonder who is right and who is wrong. Great looking film (with focus as sharp as a tack), especially well done considering that it is night throughout most of the movie. Except for the dialogue often being buried and hard to understand without blasting your ears into deafness, the sound  mix is, otherwise, fantastic. Everything swirls and crashes and clinks its way around you. Much better than I would have expected, especially considering that lead Beckinsale was the female lead in what I consider one of the worst movies ever made, 2004's laughably awful Van Helsing.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I'm glad I bought this DVD. I like it... a lot. The heavily edited versions on TV, just kill the whole point. It was a violent time... see it for what it was. It's a long film... but I doubt you'll be bored, or wishing it was over.
0099765217|5.0|If you liked the movie, buy the book.  If you haven't seen the movie, do so immediately, and read this book immediately.  The author's unique writing style, the neurotic characters, and nihilist philosophy are all developed in ways that make this book both stand out alone and compliment the film.  Some may accuse Chuck of being gimmicky with his stylized formatting and sprinkling of seemingly random factoids spouted by Tyler Durden, but I think it fits the story and makes the book an engrossing read.  This is a character-driven novel consisting of neurotic individuals who's disordered personalities collide in a dark and apocalyptic tale with philosophical and psychological undertones.  This book goes much deeper than the text.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|If Hamid's protagonist shares his view of America with much of the world, then it's easy to understand why America is hated... because we're envied. Yes, the protagonist of this tale resents America because he believes America does not sufficiently respect other cultures, and therefore we deserve to be humbled. Nothing personal, said the reluctant fundamentalist, America forced him to hate us despite his reluctance.    The book is the story of a Pakistani's infatuation with, and then resentment of America. Not because America has treated him badly, quite the contrary. Because \\"America\\" is seen as proud and boastful, but really because America doesn't treat other countries with sufficient \\"respect.\\"     I read it, hoping for a good story. I believe the author wrote it in order to tell us what is wrong with America. Instead, I obtained an understanding of what is wrong with much of the rest of the world. I personally didn't find the protagonist sympathetic because I didn't buy his justifications, nor did the author allow the protagonist to convincingly argue his justifications. The author's stated purpose was to get us to look at 9/11 and anti-Americanism from \\"the other point of view.\\" In that he was successful. However, he utterly failed in the task of convincing the reader (or, at least, this reader) of the merits of \\"the other point of view.\\"    Comparing it to other first-person books? It doesn't compare to, say, Grisham's \\"The Rain Maker.\\" It's not as well-written, the plot isn't as engaging, and the characters are one-dimensional. I was expecting more, especially noting that this book received an award, but now I think the award was given primarily in support of the author/protagonist viewpoint, similar to the reason \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" was critically praised.    I won't spoil the plot, but the ending evidently shows yet more of what is wrong with America (our suspicion, distrust, and stereotyping)... yet I look at it as what is wrong with Pakistan, and theprotagonist, especially knowing what happened to Daniel Pearl.    I'd recommend borrowing this book, but I don't know about buying it. Oh, well, at least I paid less for it on the Kindle.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I just received my U2 limited edition pack. I must say the packaging is truly awesome. In my part of the world, Singapore, we have long for U2 to stage a concert here ,but still waiting aimlessly. Back to the album, the package comes with a well deisgn book and it is a worth collectible for all U2 fans worldwide. Though not released yet in Singapore, but I must say ther are many fans out here waiting eagerly for this. The DVD is a steal for the deal, even you may have the Joshua Tree album previously, the remastered CD sounds with more thumping bass and it is not so flat. The rare CD is a must for all U2 fans considering that your may not have  the B-sides on the singles. Lastly, go for no less than the deluxe edition, worth the money

B000OQF6N6|4.0|I was just as excited as anyone else when I heard that the Smashing Pumpkins were putting out a new album, but the difference between myself and many of my peers is that I didn't make my mind up about the album before it came out.    I'll admit the mixing could use a little work, but you have to ask yourself: what do we have in here with this Zeitgeist record? Is it any different in style from past Smashing Pumpkins? Is there anything to enjoy here?  1. Good Rockin' Riffs...Yes  2. Slightly Mediocre Lyrics...Yes (but I still like them)  3. Catchy Melodies...Yes  4. Overly Ambitious Long Songs...Yes    So far, I've described Zeitgeist in all honesty and it seems to match up with the majority of Pumpkins releases. It isn't groundbreaking, and it's no Gish, but you have to take things for what they are.    I'm of the school of thought that Billy Corgan isn't a \\"has-been\\" as everyone is so quick to brand him. There were excellent songs on his solo release and I've always wondered why everyone (including Corgan) hated Zwan(\\"Of A Broken Heart\\" is a tight song).     I don't even listen to this arena-oriented rock stuff, but I found a place for an old band that I love. With Zeitgeist we have some great songs, some good songs, and a couple clunkers. It's still miles above most of the mainstream releases of 2007 (I say mainstream because I'm not including records that don't compete on the same widespread level as the Pumpkins.)    It's so easy to be a hater. Too easy. Besides...\\"Bring the Light\\" rocks - you KNOW it does.

B000VZC4CQ|5.0|I'm sitting here two weeks before Christmas debating whether to buy this CD for my 21 year old son. He loves rock and roll, and he's in a band and writes music, and he is as of now blissfully unaware of Joy Division.     Is it right to give this record to somebody? Is Christmas the right time to do it? People who have heard this record will know exactly why I ask these questions. There is no more gut wrenching work of art in existence in all the world than \\"Closer.\\" Period. \\"Decades\\" is the most gloriously sad moment of human emotion ever captured for posterity. The despondent and exhausted refrain of, \\"Where have they been,\\" repeated deep amidst the swirl of ether-like synths is so bone-chillingly haunting that it simply cannot be described. It must be heard to be believed.     I always imagined \\"Decades\\" to be the final cut on the record. It would seem most fitting there. But the album lists no A or B side to confirm it. Such obfuscation only seemed perfect at the time. It was better not knowing. It wasn't important which side got played first, by the time both sides had been played, the listener came out the other side feeling the same way. The sadness and the pain saturates, it permeates, it envelopes and there is no, repeat, no redemption or hope anywhere in the process. This is as complete and stunning an impression of personal and internal despair as you will ever find.    Don't listen to this record if you are depressed or suicidal! It is too painful.    And, yet, remarkably, it is great rock and roll. The production is coldly distant, as if recorded in a church. The arrangements are simple, rhythmic, spare, and repetitive, and each instrument comes through the ambient reverb with stark and remarkable clarity. Ian Curtis' vocals fly through like arrows. The band has punk energy and can slash like a chainsain one moment and then chunk and lurch the next. This is a first class rock band churning out first class rock and roll songs. And then the band can batheyou in the lushness of \\"Decades.\\"     It is important that anyone who loves rock and roll, or even art, at some point listen to this record. For a full of understanding the human condition, it is that important. Whether to own it, and to listen to it repeatedly is healthy, that's an individual thing.     So, still I'm left, wondering if this makes a good Christmas gift. Well, maybe not. It seems that a Christmas gift ought to be a bit more joyful.  But at some point, this record will end up in his collection.    Scott
B000WAGVHE|5.0|This may be my favorite film for 2007, and I'm not a fan of musicals -- I don't care for West Side Story and I hate My Fair Lady (and I apologize to those who I offend by stating such). But this film has such excellent music, as well as top notch staging and direction, and it has a really good and up-lifting story. My only question is why John Waters does not get a producer credit, as none of this would be if not for his original story (It is his town, Baltimore, after all!) and his highly entertaining 1988 film is the source for the stage musical and, subsequently, this fast paced film. The High Definition transfer looks excellent, and the sound is fantastic -- So good that you may want to ask a friend to let you play it on his/her high end system. It's really that good. My only complaint is that they did not include the original film as well -- But, that is alot to ask considering how much is here in this 2 disc set.
0307346617|5.0|Overall, the best zombie story I've ever read. The tale is believable and all of the different accounts in the book serve to show it as a truly global nightmare. So much confusion, conflict and struggle and it is all so well done. A treat for not only horror and apocalyptic story fans, but fiction fans as well. Reads like an actual account of the zombie war. Excellent.
B000092T6M|5.0|Love this movie!! Nice to see the extended version. So worth the waiting to buy it for this version.
0307155102|5.0|Although a bit outdated (unless it has been updated), this was my children's first language book. We shared it, section by section, and it is fairly extensive,to teach our babies what the words were for the numerous items illustrated.  The pictures are fun enough to catch the eye of a little one, and after reading it to him, long before the baby could speak, he could point to the object I named.  It was later that he could do the opposite, I would point and he would name.  While many babies under a year are responsive to this, I have been in training sessions for preschool and elementary teaching that recommends this book as still the best one available for helping younger children trying to learn English as their second language.  Thus it is good for a wide range of ages.  We wore ours out years ago, so I had to buy this one new for my first granddaughter.  It is not a \\"board book\\", so not one to leave alone with the child.  It takes both adult and baby and makes learning language fun.
B000XJSL9U|3.0|Definitely not as good as Die Hard #1 or Die Hard #3, but better than Die Hard #2.  Bruce Willis is just way too old to be a credible action-hero.
B000J6I0U2|4.0|Not the most exciting movie, and not the most detailed transfer, but this is almost a must if you have ever been to or want to visit Venice, Italy. This film is like what a real estate agent tells a businessman about the most important thing in opening a retail store -- Location Location Location. And, if you don't like the location, you will not care for the movie.
B000ZOW96Y|4.0|Definitely have to pay attention in the beginning to appreciate the complexity of their scheme/ scam (I have a habit of doing busy things/ watching tv at same time :-)  But this one definitely beat out Ocean's 12 by far!  Clooney & Pitt still lookin' good too!<br /><br />RE: other prev comments on Unbox . . .  Amazon is obviously still working out a few kinks, but stands by their product w/ outstanding customer service!  In the beginning, I had a few probs w/ movies not downloading properly to my Tivo.  All anyone has to do is just send them a quick email about what's going on & they'll make it right in no time.  You will definitley get what you paid for (and not pay for it twice).  I've rented several movies since & now, NEVER have any problems ordering/paying straight from my Tivo.<br /><br />I think Unbox rocks (and of course, my Tivo!). . .  it saves me from the huge hassle of having to go through the motions of turning the computer on, etc., especially since being disabled
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love this movie!  The computer animation is amazing and it has a good story also.  Very cute.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Worth the time to see, due to the amount of talk about health care by those who want to run the USA. It does however leave you with more questions than answers.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I was afraid that Bond had gone the way of the old Tarzan franchise, which had its last great bow in 1960 (with the top-notch TARZAN THE MAGNIFICENT partially filmed in Africa) and then began its painful fade into bad movies and silly TV series that unsuccessfully tried to modernize or \\"re-envision\\" the character. And, when I first heard that Craig was to be the next Bond, I wondered what the powers that be were thinking. Was I ever wrong! Bond really is new and relevant again. Excellent transfer to Hi-def.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|ANNOTHER GREAT ONE BY BRUCE WILLIS IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION EVERY SECOND! BIG ACTION PICTURE..
B000W1V7K4|3.0|I am just commenting on the picture quality of the blu-ray version of Ocean's 13.  I enjoyed the movie, but the quality of the picture was lacking compared to other blu-ray discs.  I don't know what happened, but the colors are inconsistent and some shots are grainy.  At first I thought it was a style choice, but the picture quality jumps around so much I doubt that now.  This really didn't look any better than a standard DVD.  This seems to be a problem with the transfer, not my individual disc.  I have checked on other forums and everyone seems to be complaining.  Don't waste your money on this blu-ray disc, just buy the standard DVD.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Not my favorite John Wayne/John Ford western, but visually (at least, as far as fine detail and wide scenery goes), this is unbeatable. Fantastic level of image detail due to excellent transfer and restoration of the large Vistavision film image. One can argue with the color choices in this transfer, but as far as focus even on distant objects, this is the one to beat. After the ho-hum looking titles, you will suddenly drop your jaw when the first shot comes up and the cabin door is open to reveal the breathtaking live action in the desert. The film that will make you glad you are into watching movies in High Definition.
0446577391|5.0|I've been a fan of Baldacci's for a long time.  Stone Cold truly broke my heart; such incredible sadness in this book that it brought me to tears.  Baldacci outdid himself this time around; this by far is my favorite of all his books.<br /><br />And, one final note:  Is he truly gone?  Perhaps it is time, considering his life.  But, only time will tell if Stone is really cold.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Thanks for your prompt fast free shipping. These are Christmas presents for my grandchildren. They will be viewed over and over and over......  Pricing was very good.
B000VECAEO|5.0|The 9th season is great.  It is a little dissappointing that they cut the life of the show short but it is still a great show.  The series finale is great how they bring back many of the previous guest stars. Definitely worth it to close out your collection of all the Seinfeld seasons.
B000M9BPEY|5.0|Maybe not for everyone, but I think this is one of the best movies ever made. High definition transfer may not be reference quality, but better than what I remember in the theater and better than the standard def DVD.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best production of Pride and Prejudice on film/DVD to date.  Colin Firth 'nails' his Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is such a good Elizabeth.  Timeless and worth viewing over and over.
B000I2IT44|5.0|Since discovering this band some years ago I have been waiting forever for a live DVD, well, at last....and what a revelation ! An awesome event of total musical crafmanship,tone,passion and a flawless delivery of sheer great songs - no stage flash , no ego's - these Brits kick major butt ! Buy this in a heartbeat, also buy their older live album \\"Coma Divine\\" with origianl drummer Chris Maitland ( he was just as good as Gavin Harrison)....enjoy at will!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The Blu-Ray version is the only way you should watch this series aside from the requirement of a 40\\"+ screen TV (something smaller would do just fine, but I cannot imagine watching in on anything smaller than my 60\\" TV). The scenes that are represented in this series are simply amazing! The screen shots and video clip does not do it justice. This is great for kids and adults of all personality. The chapters are interspersed with vegetation, mineral and animal and are based on different genres of the world, ie Mountains, Lakes, Oceans, Desert, etc. I highly recommend this series to nature lovers and non-nature lovers alike!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is a truly thrilling noir carnival ride.  A car-wreck, lotsa-guns kind of violence pervades, giving us armchair travelers some very exciting tours of Moscow, Turin, London, Madrid, Paris, Tangiers, and New York. I enjoyed the aerial views followed by close choppy shots and chase scenes when we descend to earth with Jason Bourne and race through the streets and alleys, up, over and off of buildings. While the film is brutal and impersonal on the one hand, the viewer along with Jason Bourne is consumed throughout by the deeply personal question of Jason Bourne's identity. As for Bourne's quest, one must watch the movie to see who survives and if Bourne's true identity is revealed. This is a riveting film that can be pure gritty fun to watch and/or to over-analyze for oodles of deeper meaning. Great fun either way.
B000J6I0PM|5.0|This DVD is not 1:33 Full Screen.  It's 16:9 Widescreen on my HD TV.  Just like it looked when HDNet broadcast it. The HDNet broadcast looks better in 1080i (I have it saved on my DVR so I can compare them), but the 5.1 surround sound is better on the DVD.  I wonder if an HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version of this will be available.  The group's performance is amazing, and the sound quality on the DVD is awesome.  I agree with another reviewer that this is a great DVD to listen to and occasionally look up at the screen.
0307387178|5.0|I read this book in a matter of hours about a month ago.  I still think about it daily - it is absolutely haunting.  I can't decide whether Chris was an extreme adventurer or mentally ill, but I am fascinated by his story.  I haven't seen the recent movie yet, but likely will soon.  I have spent time with the backpacker community abroad, but had no idea such a vast one existed here in the US.    A fantastic read - I highly suggest you take a Saturday afternoon and spend some time with Chris McCandless.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|The movie is a good movie and will a great addition the 100 movies we already own shipping was fast and the price beat the store price
0765357151|5.0|What can I say about Richard Matheson that hasn't already been mentioned here. He's great. He's amazing. He's a master at his craft and nothing exemplifies that more than his novel \\"I am Legend.\\"<br /><br />The first time I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down. And when I got to the end, my throat constricted and a tear almost--I said almost--appeared at the corner of my eye. When words on the printed page can do that to you, you know you've found serious talent.<br /><br />\\"I am Legend\\" belongs on any serious sci-fi or horror fan's bookshelf. I'm getting a chill up my spine just by writing this review.<br /><br />I'm going to stop now.
0345494997|5.0|If you thought you had read everything worth reading about Frank Lloyd Wright, think again. This is by far the most moving portrait of the man in his milieu, yet his giant personality is eclipsed by that of Mamah Borthwick Cheney. It is incredible to think that Wright lived for another 45 years after Mamah's violent death and yet that most biographies give this period of his life short shrift. One can only wonder what would have happened had Mamah lived. An absolute must-read.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|I've read Stephen Kings Novella 'The Mist' several times since grade school in the 80's and it has always been a favorite.  When I heard that it was going to be a full length film, I was fairly skeptical.  Being that it was written decades ago, I figured the movie would be bogged down with modern day tie-ins replacing good old fashioned character suspense.  I was wrong.  First off, the acting and the actors/actresses chosen were phenomenal.  While no one will be winning any awards from this movie, they are all very honest and believeable and their lines come straight from the story, which is generally a rare thing these days.  The special effects were well done and the gore was never too much.  But it was the continous tension that drove the movie to an extremely intense, yet morbid ending.  I won't tell the story, I'll just say this:  the characters, their actions, reactions and motivations carry the film from start to finish.  The science-fiction aspect is more of a back-drop than anything, but it's pretty damned good in comparison to other King adaptations.  The way I envisioned this story every time I read it, was exactly as it appeared on screen....except for the end that is.  The ending was not bad by any means, but I think it will leave a jaw-dropping, awe-struck silence among the many who expect something more cheerful.    It's not hard to believe that the fellas who brought Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile to the screen were behind this movie.  It shines as brightly as those movies when it comes to King adaptations, but it's the subject matter which puts a dark spin on it.  Watch it if you like intense movies, but be prepared for a very sobering ending.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|I was among the many who were disappointed by Linkin Park's new release upon hearing their CD was not composed and arranged in the manner the last two were, especially since the TRANSFORMERS anthem, \\"What I've Done\\", gave everyone the impression that it was exactly that. But, you know what they say about assumptions. Granted, when I listened to the 30 second clips available on Amazon.com I was disappointed.       Linkin Park had fallen into the rut that define most Modern Nu-Metal, Progressive, and Hark Rock bands of the mainstream industry popularized by brooding teens, head-bangers, and casual listeners alike (I honestly still think of this CD in that manner). And to top it all off, the decision to include profanity in their lyrics just felt like a major 180 and totally unnecessary in my opinion.       Which is not to say I was offended, no, I simply thought Profanity never worked with Linkin Park like it does for RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE -- to name a band who uses profanity in their lyrics --, especially when they could their point across or entertain the masses without it. Nevertheless, I decided I would not buy \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" and simply stick with the Ghost of Linkin Park's past; I.E., \\"What I've Done\\" and the previous releases. But then I forgot about on important and flawed detail about LP. Their songs are far too short and get boring easily after a hundredth listening.       So upon hearing \\"Shadow of the Day\\" on the radio, I downloaded the CD and gave it a listening to. Sufficed to say, I was surprised by what assaulted my ears. MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is not as horrible as I thought it would be, I was wrong in thinking I was buying another \\"Fallen (Evanescence)\\" that would forever haunt me as the biggest Musical Purchase Mistake of my life.       No, what I found here still sounds like Linkin Park, only this time it lacks the anger of Chester Bennington's sore-throat screaming, Mr. Hahn's Scratch-Table and Electronic beats (with the exception ofa couple songs), and the constant presence Mike Shinoda's old school rapping (with the exception of one or two songs). To put simply Chester Bennington tries his hand at singing on a softer level and to his credit, it works in most of the songs on MTM and then sometimes it doesn't mesh at all. The songs are softer and carry a more emotional impact (the underline themes catering on Regret, Loss, and Reflection) than the first two.       And in one track Mike Shinoda attempts to \\"sing\\" Microphone confession style (that's what it reminded me of), a song which has very little instrumental, and it doesn't suit him. He should stick to Rapping. And ironically, if you listen to this entire CD, \\"What I've Done\\" suddenly improves as a song, especially with the way \\"Shadow of the Day\\" ends and connects the strange Distorted Sound Affect at the beginning of the song. The strength suddenly returns to the song because it is complemented by the others surrounding it. Ironically, I'm not even sure why this CD got a parental Advisory Warning Label. The F***Bomb is only used a couple of times in two songs if memory serves me right. After that the profanity is hardly existent on the CD. I'm not even sure what the ruckus was about anymore, aside from over exaggerated reactions.         It honestly reminds me of this: [\\"Mothers rally against Barbie with nose piercing or Butterfly tattoo on her leg, back, or stomach... whichever it was...\\"]         [Track Listing]:       1. Wake - 4/5   2. Given Up - 4/5   3. Leave Out All The Rest - 5/5   4. Bleed It Out - 4/5   5. Shadow Of The Day - 4/5   6. What I've Done - 5/5   7. Hands Held High - 3/5   8. No More Sorrow - 3/5   9. Valentine's Day - 4/5   10. In Between - 3/5   11. In Pieces - 4/5   12. The Little Things Give You Away - 5/5     Overall, MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT is a great CD from Linkin Park and unfortunately, like TRANSFORMERS - THE ALBUM, it shall forever be looked down upon as \\"Disappointing\\" because it lacked what people wanted orexpected of them (for TRANSFORMERS, it was the score. The Score, which had yet to come out and thus people sought to degrade the CD and complain like children about the score not being available instead of keeping that venom to themselves. For Linkin Park: The Original Sound of their previous CDs lacking in \\"Minutes to Midnight\\"). I highly Recommend this to anyone who wants to hear something different. ----[A 4 out of 5]

014241011X|5.0|The Witches is an old favorite that I've been reading and rereading since elementary school. You just can't go wrong with Dahl and The Witches is my absolute favorite of all his children's stories. It's a fun romp taking place in our own world where REAL WITCHES exist.<br /><br />Witches, in Dahl's story, are vicious, dangerous and bloodthirsty creatures who hate children with unmatched fury and whose dearest desire is to wipe them all off the face of the earth. There goal is to do away with one child a week and the worst part is that they look just like ordinary women. But there are certain signs, as our unnamed, seven year-old narrator's grandmother informs us, that can help you tell a real witch from an ordinary lady. And it just so happens that the ladies of Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, staying at the same seaside hotel as our hero and his grandmother, display all the signs.<br /><br />This original, quirky little book is perfect for readers of all ages. It has just the right amount of scary details to fascinate a child reader without being to creepy to give them nightmares (such as when Grandmamma tells about a little girl she knew who, after a run-in with witches, became a still figure in an oil painting that grew old and eventually faded away) and enough creative and ingenious details to hold an adult reader's interest.<br /><br />If you missed out on The Witches growing up, it's not too late! Grab a copy and enjoy the sheer imaginativeness of Dahl's writing.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I saw Help when it was first released.  I was visiting my grand parents in San Jose Ca. It became my favorite film of all time (I was very young).This year it was the Thanksgiving post meal movie for all the kids.  The kids loved it and the adults gravitated to it and had a great time. The movie is 10 stars for just plain fun.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Best heard on this particular CD version. The detail and resolution is wonderful. Needs an excellent dac and revealing speakers to do it justice. You'll never do this music justice on vinyl.
1594489505|5.0|This book has made me apreciate my life and the country I live in.  I feel for the woman in this book and all that they have to endure.  It also shows the strength we as woman have.  Everyone should read this book and by doing so I think they will come to support our troops and understand why its important for the woman and the people of Afghanistan that the american troops stay to help their country be more democratic.

0143142364|4.0|Pillars of the Earth is my favorite book, hands down.  When I heard that World Without End was in the works I was over the moon.  After reading it, I'm safely back on terra firma.  Is it enjoyable?  Yes.  Does it come close to Pillars?  No, no, a thousand times no.  I was well into the book...think more than half way...before it really grabbed my attention. Perhaps I was hoping for too much from this book.  Perhaps nothing can compare with the 'original'.  Ah well...it was not a complete disappointment, but, unlike Pillars, one reading is enough.
0307275639|5.0|\\"The truth is Mitch, once you learn how to die, you learn how to live\\". Powerful words from a powerful book. Tuesdays with Morrie is filled with mini-lessons that will help you appreciate the beauty of life. Mitch Albom paints a magnificent picture of a man dying with dignity. It also shows that the true measure of a man is expressed in the love that surrounds him when he is in his final days of life.
B000NA28A2|3.0|I like the music of Luis Guerra, but was somewhat disappointed by this new release. I liked his original \\"ojala que llueva cafe\\" better.
630439845X|1.0|You try. You try again. You try a third time. Finally, you simply throw up your hands, turn it off, and flip over to a \\"Law and Order\\" rerun. I\\"m aware of the film's reputation, its awards etc. I just simply cannot \\"get into it\\". I realize that my entire career is riding on a positive review. But, at least I realize now what Henry Clay said about 170 years ago: \\"I'd rather be right than President\\". Or, Clayton Moore to Jay Silverheels in 1949: \\"You ride into town for supplies,Tonto, while I make camp\\".
B000P6YNSE|4.0|If you didn't stop watching after the finale of seson 2, then you probably won't be dissapointed by this season as well.  I thought it got off to a rocky start but after Ep.6 the season goes into high gear with one mind blowing episode after another, then to finish off the season with one of the greatest cliffhangers next to \\"who shot JR?\\".<br /><br />as far as the DVD is concerned, i like it.  it's in tune with the other seasons (which is a big plus).  The one surprising aspect to this set is the lack of special features; which, i guess isn't too surprising considering that the season 2 DVD wasn't too loaded with features as well (with the exception of the \\"Lost Connections\\", which got me going for at least a few weeks of mapping out the screen and finding all the hidden secrets).<br /><br />I'd really like to hear more about the mythology of the show and the origins of LOST and how they came up with the show.  but i'm guess these kinds of features may be saved for the end due to the mystery of the show's plotline.  Showing this kind of material may give too much away.<br /><br />What really get's me is the complete disregard or inclusion of any of the video footage from \\"The Lost Experience\\" as shown through the many websites between seasons 1 and 2.  I was expecting it on the Season 2 DVD and when they didn't include it, i was surprised but thought maybe it would be in a retro-spective on the Season 3 discs.  But, low and behold they are not there either.  I'd really like some acknowelgement of this video footage at some point.  It seems like a waist of time and money for ABC and the Producers of this great shown not to offer it in some manner.<br /><br />One more side note that they left out of all the DVD seasons so far have been the clip shows.  even though they are filler specials, they did provide some answers to the fans about certain aspects of the show and hinted at some things that have not yet come to be.  they were fun and informative.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're on the fence, just leap over because there is a lot of quality stuff to these DVDs, it's well worth the 40 bucks.r because there is a lot of quality stuff to these DVDs, it's well worth the 40 bucks.
B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|Simply put, this is indeed one of the best action films of the last two decades. Car crashes, brutal fistfights, flying bodies, invincible killers, likable heroes and despicable villains in a pretty nifty tale directed by a sure handed director.... what more can you ask for?<br /><br />This HD-DVD is a nice presentation of the film, with great picture (even though like the HD-DVD for the Bourne Supremacy, it has a bit of a softness to it which I'm guessing to be a result of the film's incredibly shaky camerawork... still looks great!) and fantastic audio. The use of surround sound is off the charts with this picture with audio flying at you from every speaker for the entire runtime of the picture. It's an assault of the senses alright.<br /><br />The extras are your usual fare, behind the scenes, commentaries, etc. They are all well produced and director Paul Greengrass's commentary is well informed, if not a little dry.<br /><br />My only problem with this disc is with it being released as a combo format disc. This whole combo format thing sucks quite frankly because we're being forced to pay extra to get the film on DVD as well, which makes this package a little more expensive than it needs to be. I have several combo discs and not once have I played the DVD side on any of these discs.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm happy to finally have the film in my collection in a far better than average HD presentation!
B0006399FS|2.0|Lets all hope U2 doesn't end with this album. And lets not be nice in our reviews just b/c its U2. Listeners do not need to mature. U2 exist for the listeners and should be trying to enterain us, Thats their job, thats why they are famous and rich. People do not exist to appreciate art, Art exist to be apreciated by people.That is, if its good enough.   The cd doesn't completely suck,Of course not. But its one of the weakest albums I've heard from them. but, I'm a young listener and only have 3 of their cds, Joshua Tree, All you can't leave behind, Aching baby, and the 18singles disk. All You Can't Leave Behind is their best album by my thinking.   This one is a step down throm that.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|My favorite CD of all time, ever. Every single track is superb. A must-have for anyone, young or old, living or dead. You will not be disappointed.
1596912855|5.0|I loved the premise of this book, partly because I wish it were really the case! The main character is given a trip to a replica town of Regency England, where actors play characters based on Austen's heros, and people go there to immerse themselves in the experience and live as they did back then. It was a really sweet, funny book that mixed Regency era romance with the melodrama of modern life
B000EHRXKO|4.0|I enjoy female vocalists and bands with female vocalists.  I also liked other bands of the Blondie era like Berlin, Missing Persons, the Go Gos and the Bangles.  I thought I liked Blondie, but the more I learned, the more I realized I didn't like them as much as the other bands.<br /><br />Blondie fit the new wave movement.  On one side, it was progressive, paving the road for the typical '80's sound.  On the other side, it was nostalgic, borrowing from the '50's.  Blondie captured both sides.<br /><br />\\"Call Me\\" is one of my favorite songs, and I always enjoyed \\"Heart Of Glass\\".  Other songs left me cold.  Part of the problem was the 50ish sound of those songs, and part is the lyrics.  (For example, while I love the sound of the verses and chorus of \\"Rapture\\", I despise the silly rap segment.)<br /><br />There is a DVD, and that is good nostalgia, but they didn't do much for me.  It was not as developed as most MTV videos.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|If you are mood for Great Mindless Fun this movie is  a classic like Animal House.  The great  trip overseas in search   of true love and problems getting to it are just  plain funny.

B000VNMMR0|5.0|I must say that although there were some incredible stunts and unrealistic scenes in the movie, I still thrilled in the fact that this was a well thought out, action, adventure story with a hero that I could believe. I love Bruce Willis and that crooked smile (I definately see what would attract Demi Moore) and his sense of taking a beating and keep on coming. Although John McClane was older and grumpier, he can take a punch or kick with the best of them. This installment in the Die Hard series finds John struggling to maintain his relationship with his college aged daughter. He has moved from being his daughter's hero, to being a disappointment. As he attempts to mend their relationship, he is also thrust into a situation where he has to save the life of a hacker. This story is filled with situations, that some would say are unrealistic, but that I say should give us food for thought. What would happen if there is a cyberattack and every industry that means something is effected? Finance, transportation, communications, and utilities. What if there were a firesale? Are we as Americans really ready? When John unravels the mystery of who is behind this mess, we find a bad guy and a bad, but beautiful girl. I really enjoyed this story and found it to be extremely entertaining. I even bought it to watch over and over on lazy Sunday afternoons.
0316067598|5.0|The story of SEAL Team 10 and Operation Redwing is a compelling and heart-wrenching one to say the VERY least.  \\"Lone Survivor\\" is a wake up call.  How quickly we forget that there is a group of people in this world who are fanatically dedicated to murdering freedom-loving people all over the world.  Their practices are more savage than anyone can imagine, and our soldiers are trying desperately to keep them at bay- only to be attacked by the liberal media.  This is a story, a message, a harsh reality, and a wake up call for anyone who thinks that the liberal media isn't jeopardizing the safety of our millitary.      When you see our soldiers, THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE.

B000TGCR38|4.0|Paul Verhoven likes to explore the darker side of humanity and this movie is no exception.  Exploiting the audience as well as trying to portray all the double crossing, greed, nudity and violence that typifies his movies may attract those types of movie goers that are interested in this type of popcorn movie-going experience genre.  This is overall an entertaining movie - a lot of the plot and story lines seems to be not necessarily unique to the setting of the war.  In fact, you could have told this story during almost any war - just change the adversaries, the combatants, and poof - you have a good war movie.  It doesn't feel like there isn't anything new that you haven't seen in other films.  And that's probably what is lacking about this movie - is that it is not a classic in the same vein as that of \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"The Pianist\\", or \\"Europa Europa\\".  Even though you see the suffering of the people, you just don't feel it like you do in the other classic films of this period.
0790735431|5.0|Wonderful sensitive acting, beautiful score, tremendous photography.    Memphis Belle is a compilation of true stories of aerial warfare in WW2 drawn together through focusing on the B-17, Memphis Belle, as she and her crew complete their 24th and final flight into enemy territory.  It is a story of unbelievable courage and at the same time, unspeakable tragedy.    The courage of aviators is a special kind of courage, just as the courage of the warriors on the ground is a special kind.  But whether in the air or down in the trenches, the death is the same; and one can only wonder why, why, why in our one million plus years we have not learned that war solves nothing: it simply rearranges the pieces on the gigantic global chessboard we call Earth.    Memphis Belle focuses on the youth caught up in war; and we cry with relief as the final wheel of the Flying Fortress's landing gear locks just as it touches the ground, bringing its young crew to safety.  But too soon we forget other youths in another B-17, this one mortally cut in half; we forget the screams of the \\"rookie\\" and others caught in the tail section as it helplessly spins through the air.  We forget the thousands of others burned alive in wounded aircraft just as we forget those in the trenches dying horrible deaths on the ground.    The tragedy of Memphis Belle and all other war movies is that we have not learned.  The instincts that drove the cavemen to beat each other to death with antelope femur bones still drive us today; except we beat each other to death with bombs and napalm.  Still present are the instincts of our ancestors that allow us to depersonalize those we term \\"enemies\\", empowering us to pull the trigger or flick the switch that ends their lives. The difference between us and our distant relatives is that we have less of an excuse.  Unlike our ancestors we have a long written history of mankind to view; and those tomes of our history are, in essence, literally pages of unending warfare. Theelimination of all contents dealing with war would reduce the recountings of our past to pamphlets.  Devoid of any evolution of thought, our history shows only an evolution of more efficient ways to kill each other; and it may well be that even this evolution has reached an end point, for now we have the weapons that will kill us all.      As intelligent as we claim to be, it is impossible to deny that something in us must love to fight be it on the street corner or on the battlefield.  What seals our fate in these endeavors is the fact that our advanced brains are capable or rationalization because for every war, there is some kind of rational sounding excuse.    One can only hope that a miracle will happen to mankind that will somehow divert global thought to preventing war and in harnessing our instincts to kill each other so that there will never have to be another Memphis Belle.  That is the only way to insure that the courage of all those warriors who died as well as those who lived will truly not have been in vain.
B000YENUI6|3.0|First off, I want to say that it is a good film.  So as a film on its own it probably deserves closer to 4 stars.  But because it is directed by Cronenberg, who was responsible for the great \\"A History of Violence,\\" it kind of disappointed me.  The script just isn't very good.  It's not bad, but it's too predictable, and holds back on some important  elements that could make it great.  I admit that the fight scenes are fantastic; much better than even in \\"A History of Violence,\\" but the fact of the matter is if this was directed by anyone else, it just wouldn't be good.  It looks great, sounds great, but doesn't play out nearly as well as I had hoped.  I understand the people who think that the character of Nikolai was played out perfectly (certainly I agree that Viggo was excellent in the role), but I really felt at the end that I wanted to know more about him.  I say, \\"buy it.\\"  It's a good film, and it's totally worth the two hours, and a worthy addition to most DVD collections.  But for me, it just didn't deliver what I had hoped for and expected from Cronenberg.  I know I'll get a lot of flak for this review, but I stand by it.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|I am sometimes befuddled by Blu-Ray, there are times when a recently released movies only looks so-so and then there are movies like UNFORGIVEN. Throughout the movie Leone's film savvy can be seen in Eastwood's directing style....the movies opening scene sets a mood. We, the audience, are caught in the rain (which by the way makes you want to grab a blanket and light up the fireplace), and almost immediatly start forming opinions about the key characters including Eastwood who plays a somewhat dark character. The movie is nicely placed with a very predictable but enjoyable plot. As for the Blu-Ray aspect it is a 10 with one exception the movie is so \\"bright\\" at times the characters seem to become a part, or \\"get lost\\" in the natural shadows. Not sure if that makes sense but you will know what I mean when you watch the movie. The audio is stellar if not exciteable...you will not need surround for this one. The final gunbattle is again dark and clint seems to have no contrast to his environment. This aside this is a must own as it was an instant classic the second it was released.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I saw Stardust in theaters and read the original Neil Gaiman story on which it was based.  This is not a story that is going to scare you or awe you like The Lord of the Rings, but it is a smaller fantasy that is more a romantic comedy and adventure.  There are fun special effects, but it is hard to really feel afraid of Michelle Pfeiffer when you see her graudally transform into her witch persona.  Robert DeNiro is secure enough to play his role as camp.  So Stardust has much of the flavor of The Princess Bride.  If you are not used to reading fantasy like this, it may be jarring to try to comprehend the relationship of the real world of 19th Century England, where the story begins, to the fantastic realm that the hero enters in pursuit of the star he sees falling.  However, the story does not disappoint in following the standard pattern of the hero's journey in which he conquers powerful enemies, wins love, and becomes more than he knew he could be.  All such stories have their roots in the same tales of jeopardy in enchanted lands that Shakespeare drew on to create his Midsummer Night's Dream, etc.

B000FVBLEI|5.0|This is the third cd by ATR. This is one of my favorite cd's of all time. With instant classic songs like this calling to heavier songs like the weak willed. Every song on the cd is amasing. To the solos whether being drum or guitar. To the masterful vocals by Phil Labonte. To any Guitar Hero fans this cd also has the song Six which is on the Guitar Hero two video game. To me this is a must have cd for any true metal fans.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I distinctly remember hearing Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What It's Worth,\\" years ago, played in heavy rotation on  the local oldies station.  The message that song carried--that of the youth movement of the times, protesting war, social injustice and global intolerance--rang loud and clear in the ears of many when it was first released in 1967.  The powerful and unflinching lyrics still ring true today, in the face of more violence and intolerance.  It is hard to believe that such a powerful tune was played by a band that only stayed together for eighteen months, just when they were beginning to tap the surface of their talent and possibilities.<br /><br />This album showcases Buffalo Springfield's best songs, including \\"Mr. Soul,\\" a very clever, up tempo piece, \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You,\\" which juxtaposes the phrasing and delivery of the lyrics (particularly the word \\"you\\") to give it double meaning, and \\"Go and Say Goodbye,\\" a very catchy song with a completely self-explanatory title.<br /><br />It's amazing to think that Stephen Stills, Neil Young, and Richie Furay came together but for a brief period of time, composed so many great tunes and yet broke up so quickly!  At least their legacy lives on in songs like the ones featured on this album, which truly is a retrospective and a tribute to rock and roll legends.
140120306X|3.0|The long-awaited Black Dossier may come as a surprise to fans of League..., and a slight disappointment to fans of Alan Moore. It is NOT a full-length comic book like its predecessors, which at a certain point becomes a definite nuisance. What Alan Moore has done here is appreciated for its inventiveness, but unfortunately Black... pales in comparison to its prequels.   Mina is very much alive, and so is Alan; we find the two of them in 1953 England, on a quest to retrieve the so called Black Dossier that the government has assembled; it details the League's various incarnations and adventures throughout the centuries. There's a political mystery surrounding the plot that is quite complicated; sometimes it's hard to follow 'who's who' in this world Moore has created. Alan and Mina's quest is depicted in the usual comic-book narrative, while the lengthy, sometimes ponderous contents of the Black Dossier are delivered to us as they are to the characters, in full glorious detail. As a result we have the narrative constantly interrupted whenever Mina decides to resume reading the dossier.  Whether people unaware of Moore's inclanations towards metaphysical explorations (most evident in his speech-y Prometheas series) will respond to his ramblings in this book is dependant upon their tolerance of lengthy historical accounts of a so-called parallel world. This world mirrors ours in many ways - though it's slightly more evolved: by 1953 rockets are zooming off into space, and robots roam the Earth - but it's also a place where the heroes of our beloved fiction are very real, where imagination comes alive. Similarly to Moore's Promethea, the character of Orlando, for example, appears in the writings of numerous authors from different centuries, and thus is established as a real person with an ever-lasting life, and a part of the current league.   Orlando's story is actually the highlight of the dossier; others include Campion Bond's 'Shadows in the Steam' (which depicts Mina's first encounter with the frightening Nemo), and a lost prelude to Shakespeare's The Tempest entitled 'Faeries Forunes Founded' (which tells of \\"Queen Gloriana's founding of Prospero's men\\"). The rest of the dossier varies. In terms of technical detail it's flawless throughout: Moore adopts various styles with his usual ease. But try getting through all of 'The Crazy Wide Forever', a punctuation-less pulp brain-tease. Moore's readers are generally intelligent and well-read, but here he puts the most jaded of them to the test - why make them struggle? And the 3-D ending is breathtakingly illustrated, but in trying to encompass too much, Moore veers off, and finally leaves his reader impressed but hollow, feeling like a lot was read but not a lot of it was mentally processed.   Peppered with a trillion references to literary sources, that range from obvious to totally obscure, Black Dossier reads more like an... actual Dossier, a report if you will, but it does not necessarily warrant the entertainment factor of the first two chapters.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" picks up the action just minutes after \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" ended, with amnesiac ex-CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the run in Moscow. Bourne is still looking for clues to his past, and he finds one in plain sight. Journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Consadine) has written an article probing the secret operation of which Bourne was a part. Meanwhile, the CIA insists that Bourne is a threat to national security, despite Agent Pam Landy's (Joan Allen) efforts to convince her superiors otherwise. Attention turns to the source of Simon Ross' information: Bourne wants to milk him for knowledge of Operation Treadstone. The CIA sees the source as a dangerous and traitorous leak. And the sharp but lawless Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) is charged with protecting the CIA's Black Ops from real or imagined threats.<br /><br />The three Bourne films have been consistently smart, fresh, and entertaining, making this my choice for the most successful action franchise. They've maintained the audience's interest in uncovering the secrets of Bourne's past and our sympathy for his pain and anger. Much credit is due writer Tony Gilroy. Like \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", this film is NOT based on the Robert Ludlum novel of the same name. \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" delivers answers and action, with terrific creative camera work, from a rooftop chase in Tangier to a car chase in New York. As always, there is great hand-to-hand combat and an impressive fusion of technophilia with Bourne's preternatural skills. Director Paul Greengrass has tamed his shaky camera since \\"Supremacy\\", so you won't get queasy.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" exploits the theme of paranoia to great effect. It pits a self-righteous, paranoid, and disturbingly powerful ideologue Vosen against his idealistic, thoughtful colleague Landy, and in turn against the apolitical renegade of their own creation, Bourne. The result is edge-of-your-seat action and a comment on how and why smart people can interpret anything that doesn't conform to their agenda as a threat to national security. It is the audience's paranoia -justified or not- that makes the whole scenario believable. We have to think that the CIA is able to track anyone just about anywhere, eavesdrop on nearly everything, and to highjack Britain's CCTV cameras at a moment's notice. This is the second time I've been impressed by the sophistication of Paul Greengrass' ideas and methodology. He's a director to look out for.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2007): There are deleted scenes (15 min), 5 featurettes, and an audio commentary. \\"Man on the Move: Jason Bourne\\" (24 min) takes us to Berlin, Paris, London, Madrid, and Tangier, interviewing producers, director, technical and stunt crews, and Matt Damon about the location shoots. \\"Rooftop Pursuit\\" (5 min) talks with cast and crew about filming the chase in Tangier. \\"Planning the Punches\\" (5 min) interviews actor Joey Ansah, Damon, and fight coordinator Jeff Imida about the fight in Tangier. \\"Driving School\\" (3 min) follows Damon and 2nd Unit Director Dan Bradley as they practice for the car chase. \\"New York Chase\\" (11 min) talks with Bradley, Damon, and other crew about creating and filming the chase. The audio commentary by director Paul Greengrass discusses tempo, themes, the intelligent bad guy, the challenge of accommodating new viewers and returning fans, and the Bourne films as part of the contemporary world.

0307387151|4.0|I found Atonement to be completely different from any novel I've read before. It's a complex story set with some truly beautiful prose. The story is about how the misinterpretation of a scene by a little girl will change her life-and the lives of other people she cares about- forever.       Some things I loved were the beginning of the book, in the Tallis household, and Briony's Part 3. It was really interesting to have that part of the novel set right before  the German invasion of London.      As much as I enjoyed the novel, I had a hard time getting through some parts of it. Briony's narration in Part 1 was so frustrating because I felt so enraged at what Briony did. With her being so precocious and selfish, I felt that she was one of the most dislikable characters I've ever read (thankfully this changes later). I also found Robbie's Part 2 to be too long, with too many details put in. I kept waiting for that section to be over, despite really liking Robbie's character.      Despite those minor problems, I would definitely recommend this book, especially because of how the novel ends. I'm really interested to see how they do the movie now.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|A movie that anyone who has or will need healthcare should see.  Unfortunately Michael Moore is able to find the kind of events which display the worse parts of the American Healthcare System.  He uses the extremes to make his point but if they did not exist his movie would not exist.  As a healthcare provider I have become embarrassed by our healthcare system.  We have developed a sickcare system which is governed by business principles (maximize profits).  The system needs change but the questions now are who will do the changing and what is their motive?  Do we really trust politicians and the government to manage our healthcare?  The government is already the largest payer of all of the insurers (Medicare and Medicaid).  Think carefully about who will have your best interests in mind when it comes to your healthcare.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|This series is better than a review can say. The technical movie-making aspects are superb, right down to the 60's set/costumes/makeup. The acting is stellar and, if you look closely, you'll see some faces you recognize. The writing is amazing. Pair that with the acting and the characters come to life. You get drawn into the story, caught up with the characters, and end up getting the flavor and knowledge of history. You walk away inspired. This production won't grow old; it's true to the 60's and doesn't look like modern people trying to be like the 60's. I recommend it for family watching (just a few cuss words in a few episodes is all) and certain episodes would be ideal to show in a History class. Mostly, it's just great entertainment. It won't feel like you're being educated at all! I highly recommend this for military families and spouses as well because it accurately portrays what it's like to have a family member in potentially hazardous situations of serving their country.
B000ICL3KG|2.0|This is basically a well polished slide presentation.  It is a recording of a live presentation that Mr. Gore gave a few years ago to a very welcoming audience.  This is not really a documentary as such.    Forget science (you have to in order enjoy this), this is about Al Gore.  Fully 33 minutes of this video is spent doing nothing more than \\"profiling\\" Mr. Gore.  Showing him driving around with his Secret Service convoy of Chevy Suburbans (14 mpg) and spending time on his tobacco farm (tobacco kills 300,000 people in the USA annually.)  As the former Vice-President and Presidential candidate, that much time is just excessive, bordering on vanity while hoping you will miss the hypocrisy.    And this is coming from someone who voted for him!    Others will debate the merits of the science presented.  Me, I was just trying to figure out what in the world he was really trying to say.  There was so much \\"Me, me, me\\" that it detracted from the message, whatever it was, he trying to convey.    I think the gushy love that so many people have expressed is based less on science or the quality of the presentation, and more on politics.

B000AGTPUU|5.0|They are now showing this feature on The Family Channel, courtesy of your local cable company, so I doubt there are many people out there who haven't seen Polar Express at least once. To each his own.<br />You know, offhand, I think it would be very dreary if classic Christmas features began to resemble each other, or imitated each other, simply because there was an isolated working formula that pleased the mass audience. So I am really open to newness and fresh material, because great new features don't really take away from those beloved Christmas classics, but actually keeps the home fires burning.<br />So is with The Polar Express. I don't expect any Christmas fantasy or calamity to embrace all the possible angles of Christmas, but I do expect a heartfelt experiance.<br />Animation films are never required to be logical, and quite frankly, that is the extreme attractiveness of animation in the first place. You can get away with alot. If we demanded animation to be on the planes of logical procedures, Bugs Bunny would have been boiled in a stew in a heartbeat, but he always manages to get out of the most difficult situations, simply by kissing the most hardened foe. . . on the lips. THAT'S COMEDY! So I don't expect features like Polar Express to be entirely logical, just fairly to the point of speculation that IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS on Christmas Eve.<br />The premise of children even leaving there warm homes into the stone cold with just a bathrobe in itself defies reality comprehension. So as long as I'm in the comfort of my own home watching children baring the winter Christmas Eve cosmos in jamies, is their problem.<br />Now I admit, that having a lone man luring children on to an unknown midnight vehicle is a bit suspicious, especially without talk of consent from their parents to do so, it is a well known fact that Peter Pan himself has used this same sort of scheme with Michael, John, and Wendy.<br />What else is new?<br />For the most part, it is also likely this could have been somewhat of a dream, but like The Wizard Of Oz, it is supposedly not because unlike poor Dorothy who only had Toto as a living witness, our main childhood focus here has a bit of hardcore evidence.<br />My main concern is that throughout all the angles of what if, and why did it happen this way blah, blah, blah. . .

B000UJ48V8|1.0|...Since I think it's one of the most powerful war movies ever made. I saw it in the theatre when I was 8, and the boot camp sequence stuck with me. The reason I'm giving this 1 star is, why is there no release of the Deluxe edition on standard DVD? Is there some research that suggests that people don't buy standard DVDs any more? I spent hundreds of dollars replacing my VHS collection with DVDs- I'm not about to do the same thing with HD-DVD. Warner Bros, you owe your customers more than this.    *Update, 3/4/08- With the recent developments in the market (Sony going with Blu-Ray and Toshiba saying they will stop making HD-DVDs), this particular product is even more irrelevant than when I first wrote the review.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This is the best! It is all right here in this set! Great quality and sound too! You will especially love the bonus features, including a SNL Twin Peaks skit with Kyle Mclaughlin and the making of Season One and Two! The much shorter Season One is always a favorite for Lynch lovers and those who \\"still need time\\" to adjust to his style. However, if you have not come to terms with David Lynch's style, then you may loose interest with Season Two. Those who love David Lynch and the world of Twin Peaks will definitely love it all though!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Moore takes on the insurance and pharmaceutical companies, mixing fact with emotion to produce a work that alternately makes you laugh and get angry. The main reason people won't watch this is that they may think it's political, like \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", but that's not the case. After a cheap (and deserved) shot at George Bush at the beginning of the movie, he moves on to methodically dissect the insurers and corporations that strive to keep our health care system #38 in the world (behind Slovenia) in order to preserve profits. If this movie doesn't move you, then you've never talked to anyone who's had a serious health problem.

This book is the reason I became so fascinated with pirates. It's a story that just sticks with you. There are memorable characters and slippery plot complications that make this literally a genuine trip as you turn the pages. Some may consider this an unnecessary read given its time frame, but put in context, this is a delightful story that should resonate with young boys. It's a classic for the very reason that it endures. It finds a place in that little place in the mind called adventure and wanderlust. [[ASIN:1432701320 Jamestown: Journey Back in Time]]

B000TGJ8F8|3.0|While the plot and cast promise a lot, the movie fails to deliver on all levels. The necessary character development is lacking and sometimes the dialog is somewhat stilted. Cage and Biel occasionally rise above their direction and have the odd entertaining moment in their interplay; such as the cafe scenes. However Moore comes across cold and uninteresting and no attempt is made to draw the viewer into her character.     A great pity that my fellow countryman, Tamahori, couldn't deliver more on such a great idea and cast. Maybe they spent all the budget on the cast and had none left to actually film the movie, develop the plot and let the actors do their thing, as the sum of the parts is much more than the whole on this occasion.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Moore has really honed the craft of documentary making with Sicko, his best yet. He re-visits previously used techniques, like comparing US social conditions to other nation's, such as Canada. People who want to dismiss the notion of a reformed health insurance system always fall back on the old assumption: \\"Well, the US is not like Western Europe. Socailized medicine just won't work here.\\" But the example that always trumps that tired excuse is Canada. Canada is about as similar to the United States as a country can get, and it operates a very successful non-socialized, single payer system. Moore is so right to constantly compare America's shoddy approaches to Canada's take on similar issues. He really makes us think critically about our nation when he uses this technique.<br /><br />Moore does come across as the annoying liberal agenda-ist in most of his movies, and while I am a liberal, he tends to even get on my nerves. But he's just so on it in this documentary, you can't fault him. Actually, I thought he was less pushy and adgitating in this work than in others. He pretty much just told the story by letting his intervewees do the talking. What the viewer is left with is a sensitive, thought provoking work that really makes one take an honest look at America's failure of a health care system. It is impressive when a director can take a complicated social condition and strips all the complexity away until viewers are left with only the fundamental, basic aspects of the issue. This is why Sicko works so well. Moore gets it right: in the end, it is all about basic humanity.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|If you have heard about Blackwater, the mercenary military President Bush bought with our hard earned tax dollars you will appreciate this movie.  The acting is outstanding and the story could be written from today's news. Keep in mind that the employed mercenaries of Blackwater get paid better wages to fight then our own legal military and Blackwater has much better equipment.  This lovely group of men could actually take over our government, they have enough power to do it.

0679720200|5.0|I was required to read this novel in my English class and I am ever so glad that I had too. This story works on so many levels that most people will find one aspect of the story to love. Each of the characters is original and intriguing and makes you think. It is an easy read at only 144 pages but you will finish it wishing that there were more. I highly recommend reading Albert Camus's The Stranger because it is a thought provoking book that will satisfy even the causal reader.
B00003CX8N|5.0|\\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" is a treasure. A great script based on a true story provides a worthy vehicle for a world-class cast headed by Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins, who play a New York booklover and a British antique book dealer, respectively. The story follows the long distance relationship between the two that spans one ocean and three decades, as Bancroft and Hopkins become much more than buyer and seller. Made in the mid-1980s, the film has lost none of its poignancy or ability to delight. I highly recommend this film.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Stanley Kubrick is my patron saint. In my mind, he is one of, if not the greatest, filmmaker of all time. My first Kubrick experience occured when I was in high school. I was over at a friend's house, and the film that he was watching was THE SHINING. I had never seen anything like it in my life. Not only was it scary as hell - it was - but the sheer inventiveness of the film making stunned me. I started noticing the tracking shots. Most of the film is a series of long tracking shots and zooms. They were all beautifully executed and framed. The lighting also struck me. It was different than what I had been used to, and I liked it. The beauty of this film was in the simplicity of how it was put together. There was simply no need for the MTV-style editing that had become so popular with the \\"cut, cut, cut, cut\\" mentality of the time, which was quite pervasive, and was growing tiresome. Kubrick would simply set up the shot, and let the actors act. There were no distractions, and the story simply told itself. I was hooked, and it instantly became one of my favorite films. I've probably seen it more than fifty times.<br /><br />Later on, I discovered A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and FULL METAL JACKET. Both of these films resembled THE SHINING in their meticulous attention to detail, and not only that, but the films were rich, not exclusively in a technical sense, but on an intellectual level as well. The best thing about watching a Kubrick film is the thought process that you go through afterwards, when you reflect on what you have just seen. You get to peel back all of the intricate layers, and sometimes you don't even realize what you have just seen until the fifth or sixth viewing...which moves me on to Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.<br /><br />Principal photography for this film lasted for 400 days, and it was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"longest constant movie shoot\\". Obviously with this film, as with every other film that Kubrick made, timewas no obstacle. Only someone with Stanley's track record could have pulled that off. Furthermore, if he was anything at all, he was a perfectionist. He pushed his crew and his actors, pushed them so that he could get the best that they had to offer. If the performances of some of his actors seem overplayed, it's only because \\"naturalistic\\" acting never appealed much to Kubrick, as he would always say, \\"Natural is good, interesting is better.\\" The \\"interesting\\" aspect would come after fifty or sixty takes of the same scene. He would bring his actors to the point where they literally had nothing else to give, and then that was oftentimes the take that he would use. Filming on EYES WIDE SHUT played out like this, and thank the heavens that it did, because the final product was nothing short of another masterpiece.<br /><br />The thing that separates EYES WIDE SHUT apart from the rest of Kubrick's filmography could be summed up in one word: hope. Yes, you read that correctly! EYES WIDE SHUT is a very hopeful film! Kubrick was often accused of seeing the dark side of human nature. This would be correct. His films are extremely pessimistic, in that they hone in on the dark side of human nature. Humans are portrayed as weak, ignorant, stupid, and beyond redemption. Most of the time, he was just being honest, and that was hard for many to stomach. But here, in his last film, he embraces themes of passion, commitment, loyalty, and even love. The whole film is a cautionary tale about the dangers of marriage, the temptation of adultery, and how important it is to hold tight to your spouse, taking nothing for granted. After all, we are human. Any one of us can be tempted at any given time. No one is exempt from that. Kubrick understood this. He also understood that divorce rates were through the roof, and that close friends of his had cheated on their spouses. All he had to do was turn on the television to see the latest celebrity scandal or divorce drama. These were situations that were very timely, very relevant to 1999, and even more so, today. Stanley Kubrick understood and respected the institution of marriage, and was, as far as anyone knows, faithful to his wife until the end. Somewhere along the line, however, he felt compelled to make this film, particularly after reading \\"Traumnovelle\\", a 1926 novella by Arthur Schnitzler.<br /><br />What we have here is the story of Dr. Bill and Alice Hartford, a upper class, married couple with a young daughter. When the film opens, they are getting dressed and prepared for a prestigious Christmas party that they have been invited to by one of Bill's patients. Alice gets up from the toilet, adjusts her hair, and asks Bill a simple question, \\"How do I look?\\", to which Bill replies \\"It's great\\". He's not paying her any attention, as he adjusts his tie in the mirror. \\"You're not even looking at it,\\" she says. Bill turns around, and robotically tells her, \\"you're beautiful. You always look beautiful\\". It is here, during the very opening moments of the film, that we are able to see Dr. Bill's major flaw: he doesn't really appreciate his wife. They've been married for years, and, apparently, the act of complimenting his wife has now become routine. On to the party. Once Bill and Alice reach the party, their host comes over to greet them, and we then dissolve to Bill and Alice lovingly dancing together, musing and asking themselves why they were even invited to this overblown party in the first place. Bill sees an old friend of his, and takes off. In the meantime, Alice grabs a glass of champagne and waits by the bar. Out of nowhere, a strange Hungarian man comes over and starts to flirt. It's obvious what he wants from the start. He attempts to wear her down in her drunken state. \\"Don't you think one of the charms of marriage is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties?\\", he asks Alice. He has her cornered, and eventually, after several of his advances, she reminds him that she is married and walks away. Meanwhile, in another part of the house, Bill walks down the hall with two models hanging on each arm. Their game of seduction begins. \\"Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?\\", they both ask. Bill isn't quite sure what they are asking, but he catches the hint. At that moment, he gets summoned by someone else, and he leaves the two temptresses to themselves.<br /><br />So, Bill and Alice have both remained faithful, and resisted temptation, for now. Later on that night, and with the help of a joint, Alice starts questioning Bill about the two women that he was with. He tells her that it was nothing, that they were just two dumb models. She also takes it upon herself to tell him of the Hungarian man that tried to seduce her. Bill tells her that it's only natural for men to feel that way. She's beautiful, after all. There's not much jealousy in his response. This sets Alice off, and she goes into a tirade. Bill, in his ignorance, also makes the statement that women don't think the way that men do, as far as sexual matters. She stops him dead in his tracks, and tells him that when they were vacationing the year before, she made eye contact with a young naval officer. She goes on to say that it was only a glance, but that she would have been willing to give up her family and her life for one night with him. She came to her senses, but the fact remains that the thought of infidelity was on her mind, and she could have acted on it.<br /><br />From here on, Bill becomes insanely jealous. He realizes that his wife isn't just a prop. She is capable of hurting him, and he sets out to prove that he is just as capable as she is. He goes out on the town, and his journey into the sexual underworld begins. He is faced with temptation the entire night, but every time he is close to giving in, he is interrupted. One interruption happens to come in the form of a phone call from his wife. However, he proceeds and is determined to explore, almost hoping that anopportunity to be unfaithful will present itself. Before the night is over, he ends up at a masked, pagan orgy filled with powerful members of society. Here, he sees just how sick and depraved the idea of infidelity is. It's so fitting that the password to get into the house is \\"fidelio\\" - \\"faithful\\". It is exactly the opposite. This scene, probably one of the most controversial scenes in film history, is not sexually enticing at all. It's ugly and horrific. It's a picture of hell on earth. It represents the evil that is adultery and sexual debauchery. The scene plays like something out of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\".<br /><br />The core of the film is in the last few moments, where Bill confesses to Alice of his night time journey. His eyes are filled with tears. \\"I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you everything!\\", he tells her.<br /><br />The last scene takes place in a shopping mall. Bill and Alice's daughter runs around looking at dolls, while they talk amongst themselves about recent events. \\"The fact is that we are both awake now,\\" Alice says, \\"and I do love you.\\" She then suggests that they go home as soon as possible to have sex. This scene is powerful and brutally raw in it's honesty. In Kubrick's only love story, he has taught us the importance of the covenant of marriage, and how it is important to treasure your husband or your wife.  There is such a thing as healthy jealousy, and both Bill and Alice have learned this valuable lesson by the film's conclusion. They will strive to keep each other away from the darkness, to appreciate one another, taking nothing for granted.<br /><br />The controversy that surrounded this film was predictable. The orgy scene is twenty minutes of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is brutally honest in it's raw portrayal of sexual debauchery. However, I feel that, as repulsive as this scene is, it is a necessary evil which is needed to convey the depravity that we live amongst. Sexual immorality is not pretty. It should not be presented as suchon film. Kubrick was never a prude when it came to pulling us out of our comfort zones. He was always honest, no matter how much it hurt or how ugly we thought it was. If you look closely at each one of his films, they all have a moral center. He was not pleased with the way that he saw the world, and like us, he wanted things to change.<br /><br />\\"In a modern world that is rife with infidelity, lies, hedonism and sexual decadence Stanley is encouraging us all to throw away our masks and take a good look in the mirror. His final and most underestimated masterpiece is a call for an end to all forms of secrecy, be they personal, social or political.\\" - Rob Ager, from his essay, \\"Unseen Reflections\\"<br /><br />Tragically, Stanley Kubrick died two weeks after the release of EYES WIDE SHUT. He was quite pleased with the final product. Like all of Kubrick's films, it opened to mixed response from the critics. Over time, this film has aged like a fine wine. That's the thing about his films. They get better with age, and as Steven Spielberg said in an interview, \\"They tend to grow on you.\\" I have personally found this to be true. Every time you watch one, you learn something new, or you see something that you had never noticed before, and who knows, you may learn something about yourself.<br /><br />It is in this way that Stanley Kubrick left a legacy. He will never be forgotten and his films will live on, decade after decade, and will remain classics. Funny that he has a classic in just about every genre of film that there is.<br /><br />How many directors can pull that off?
B00003CXA2|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie from the first time I saw it when I was like 9 years old. I cannot even begin to think how many times I've seen it, and it just gets better and better each time. You can really connect with this movie, and you really feel for every character. No other movie makes me feel as many emotions as Forrest Gump does. An absolutley perfect movie that to me has no equal.
B000UJCALI|5.0|This was one of the first horror films that I ever saw in my life. Ever since the first time, it has been a tradition for me to watch this film at least once or twice every year, preferably on a dark and stormy night. Jack Nicholson does an excellent job as the psychopath who tries to do away with his wife and son, after succombing \\"cabin fever\\". Shelley Duvall is both effective and annoying as Jack's mousy little wife. Ah, I love it all. Who cares if it strays from the book? They are both great on their own terms, and you should just look at it that way.     I read that Kubrick would leave the film \\"Eraserhead\\" playing on the set to create a sense of dread in the actors. Awesome!     How I miss the Kubrick.

B000002JSP|4.0|( Written By Ted Buchanan)    1978/79: The music industry was in its time of dying as Disco was king,and New Wave and Punk were loudly becoming more popular than hard rock. The members of Led Zeppelin were un-officially broken up and Plant was on his farm in England drinking heavily and mourning the death of his son. The annoying music critics were still pontificating that Zeppelin were 'dinosaurs headed toward extinction.' More bad news came as a 19 year old kid was found dead at Page's home after a party-Victim of a drug overdose. Bonzo cracked 3 ribs in an auto accident near his home,but quicklyrecovered.Kieth Moon, drummer of The Who, also OD'd and died. Jones had some really cool ideas for a new album and Bonzo had to talk Plant into coming back to try a few rehearsals. They went well and Page saw a possible comeback at the upcoming Knebworth concert. 'In Thru The Out Door' opened as a dark, subdued, and ominous sound with 'In The Evening.' John Paul Jones was clearly in the lead, musically, and commandeered this exciting album into new territory for the band. Brazillian mambas, synthesizers, and highly upbeat songs and ballads followed. Even a parody of a country song ( 'Hot Dog'). It was said that this Zep album single-handedly saved the American music industry from bankruptcy! Knebworth was a success along with the album ( Released in 6 different covers as to purposely confuse critics)   but the Zeppelin 'curse' had yet to strike again. A European Tour was barely completed as Bonzo collapsed in Germany while on stage and Page seemed dazed and confused as well. ( At one point Page was so wasted before a show that he had to be carried out of the limo) The years of excess and self-indulgence were catching up to them. The tour ended in Berlin in 1980. An American Tour wasn't just a rumor, it was expected.  Everyone was upbeat about it and were enjoying the Phoenix-like resurrection of Zeppelin and the new decade to come. Bonham was not so eager to return to theStates-and for good reasons- Several lawsuits against him were pending as well as possible arrest warrants. He decided to go out on a drinking binge and never woke up that night. This was the tragic final blow that finally split the band for good. ( They very recently re-united in London to a sell-out crowd and very good reviews)  The mystical legend of Led Zeppelin lives on as each new generation discovers the awesome influence they had on music-forever changing the landscape of Rock 'N' Roll.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|I actually feel sorry for him and all those who don't get this excellent and original film. They are in severe need of a humanity injection. Until something better comes along it will hold the #1 movie of all time on my Best Movies List.     ***ALSO*** I've NEVER come across someone who laughed at the characters depicted here with a smug feeling of superiority. (And I hope I never do). Most of us honestly relate to these characters recognizing in them some degree of the awkwardness that is common to all of us.     When the characters achieve a pitifully tiny victory we are left to recognize how painfully rare even small victories can be. There is much that is all too real here. In fact, I'm not sure it's really a comedy at all. It's certainly not just a comedy.

038572179X|5.0|This was the first novel I read by Ian McEwan--it was recommended by a friend and I (frankly) had never heard of him before.  What a great introduction to this author! Atonement was a capitating story, which keeps you guessing about the ending until the last page.  The device the author uses to accomplish this is very effective.  The language is rich, and he creates vivid landscapes with his words.  I am hoping the rest of McEwan's work is a great as Atonement.

B000C3H4MC|5.0|This was is your stereotypical \\"didn't-do-too-well-upon-release, but-is-a-total-classic-now\\" album. And the reasons why it's such a masterpiece are the same reasons it didn't sell hugely: it's really, really weird. The titles are so paranoid! I mean, look at them. \\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\\". \\"Cross-Eyed and Painless\\". \\"Seen and Unseen\\". \\"Listening Wind\\". \\"The Overload\\". Dammit Dave, stop making me cast nervous glances over my shoulder! Of course, Brian Eno's production job fits the paranoid lyrics. If you ask me, this is the best album he's ever produced. The sound is weird, too: dense, funky, complex, avant-garde, blending several genres. \\"Born Under Punches (the Heat Goes On)\\" gives you the best example of all this madness: it's got chicken-scratch guitar; slap bass; complex vocal overdubs; hordes of percussion; and an instrumental break that sounds like a bunch of blips from a primitive computer. For all I know, it is a bunch of blips from a primitive computer. And it doesn't relent, either: take \\"Cross-Eyed and Painless\\", which mixes all of those elements with heavy guitar riffs, a great chorus, and dance beats; or the insanely experimental \\"Great Curve\\", a blisteringly fast, claustrophobic dance song that mixes R&B horns with heavy guitar. And here's the really cool part about it: it's more or less a song about sex, but the musical backdrop is so neurotic and schizophrenic it sounds like it could have been written by a psychopath. Once again, it's got the dance percussion and the complex vocal overdubs. And it's catchy! No, really, it is! What is up with this band, anyway? If I didn't love them, I'd hate them. So anyway, after the madness of the first three songs subsides, we're hit by one of the best singles of the decade, \\"Once in a Lifetime\\". Other than the lyrics, it's actually a perfectly normal pop song with two choruses that will never leave your head once you've heard them even once (the \\"Letting the days go by...\\" one and the \\"Same as it ever was...\\" one), with this cool bubbly keyboard tune, and then Byrne starts singing about water, and then there are three or four overdubbed Davids going at the same time. Then it returns to normal, only to have this really weird guitar playing during the fadeout. See, that's one of the things I love about this band, one of the things that makes them indisputably the most original band of the '70s. They'll be grooving along with this normal pop song and then all the sudden... bang. They hit you with something out-of-the-blue and you're all, \\"what the hell was that?\\", and then it's back to normal pop song. Oh yeah, the lyrics. They're weird. I think it's about getting and recovering from amnesia or something, but then with the Talking Heads who can tell? It could also be about a midlife crisis, but I like my amnesia theory better. It's more of a David Byrne thing to write about in the first place. The best way to experience this song, however, is through the Stop Making Sense video, which you should go rent right now if you have yet to see it. The song itself isn't as good, but you get to see David Byrne dancing around in that huge suit.<br />So then after that it's right back to intricate New Wave weirdness: the bizarre, funky, partially spoken-word \\"Houses in Motion\\" simply cannot match up to the four songs that came before, but as a pure freakout it's hard to top, with all those echoing horns and and wacko flute (is it a flute?) creepy guitars and the vocal interaction. \\"Seen and Unseen\\" is even creepier, with trilling guitars reminiscent of Television, funky bass, and bizarre keyboards. And spoken-word lyrics about being able to completely change the shape of someone's face and personality because they're in a science experiment. And then there's \\"Listening Wind\\". God, I love \\"Listening Wind\\". Avant-garde world music mixed with funk, with more vocal overdubs. And as if this album wasn't freaky enough already, Eno goes all-out on the slow sound collage \\"Overload\\", which has this deep, rumbling drone; assorted squeaks; atmospheric synthesizer sweeps; buzzes; blips; pulsating beeps; echoing guitars (at least I think they're guitars), sparse drums, and, of course, suspicious stream-of-consciences lyrics recited (not sung) in David Byrne's echoing voice - for exactly six minutes. A lot of people hate that song for all those reasons, and mark it as the only weak spot on an otherwise perfect album. But it's one of my favorites, because of Eno's incredibly creative production job. The arrangements are intricate enough to be symphonic, which really contrasts the minimalist funk-rock that made up several Fear of Music numbers (\\"Cities\\"; \\"Life During Wartime\\") - another reason why it's an improvement over Fear (which was fantastic to begin with) is because of their progression from goofy art-school nerds to menacing art-school nerds. Sadly, this was their last album for a few years - they reformed, minus Eno (whose production is so important he might as well have been a member too), in 1983 as a solid but more mainstream New Wave/Worldbeat group on Speaking in Tongues (very underrated album there) and spent the rest of the '80s constantly reinventing themselves while their music got steadily and steadily worse. Then they broke up. I'd love to see them reunite, though. For the record, there are some pretty high-profile guests here: besides Eno, ex-King Crimson/David Bowie/Paul Simon/Nine Inch Nails/Everyone Else guitarist Adrian Belew (who plays that solo I love on \\"The Great Curve\\"), P-Funk keyboard player Bernie Worrel; LaBelle singer Nona Hendryx; pop star Robert Palmer and  famous World Music trumpeter Jon Hassell contribute.hich has this deep, rumbling drone; assorted squeaks; atmospheric synthesizer sweeps; buzzes; blips; pulsating beeps; echoing guitars (at least I think they're guitars), sparse drums, and, of course, suspicious stream-of-consciences lyrics recited (not sung) in David Byrne's echoing voice - for exactly six minutes.

B0000026NC|3.0|It's sad to see Pink Floyd as a mere crowd-pleasing dinosaur act, but that's exactly what you get. See, nothing about the music contained herein is bad - if this was my first Floyd purchase, I'd probably give it a high rating. But I've been exposed to a lot more of the group's work than this, and I can safely say that there's one key problem with it: In order to keep the crowd pleased, Pink Floyd decides to show them just how good they are at re-creating the studio versions of the old classics like \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" note-for-note - the only real difference in terms of arrangement is in Gilmour's vocals, which haven't really held up well. And the music is just pointless. For one, who really wants to hear \\"Learning to Fly\\"; \\"Yet Another Movie\\"; \\"The Dogs of War\\" or \\"On the Turning Away\\" again? Yeah, I know they were touring in support of A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but A Momentary Lapse of Reason is one of the worst albums ever made (and certainly the worst Pink Floyd's ever did), so I get no enjoyment out of any of those tracks - live or studio, even though once again there's very little difference. If anything, they make \\"Learning to Fly\\" worse, since the female backup singers sound sick or stoned or something. I do kinda like \\"Sorrow\\", though, but there's no point in it being nine minutes long. As a matter of fact, there never was. So then after the awful Momentary Lapse of Reason set ends, it's back to oldies act mode. These versions of \\"Time\\"; \\"One of These Days\\"; \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" are nice enough, but again they're totally pointless in light of the far better studio versions. I mean, I guess I'm impressed that Dave still remembers and can perfectly recite his guitar solos from those old '70s classics, but I'd rather hear them take risks in a live setting. There are a few changes of pace on a couple of the group's biggest hits, though. \\"Money\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". If you ask me, this version of \\"Money\\" is pretty much awful - way too long, with random stupid \\"ooh, ooh!\\" and \\"MONEEEEY!\\" backup vocals and awful singing from Dave. At least it isn't a total rip-off of the original studio version. But it's a bad deviation. See, for some reason, Dave thought it would be a brilliant idea to vie everyone solos on that song, including - I am not making this up - the backup singers. Who are, other than the Momentary Lapse of Reason set, my least favorite part of this album. See? They can't get it right here. When they do play it safe, it ends up nice but half-hearted; and when they try to totally change things up it ends up awful (they also do that on \\"The Dogs of War\\", which features a guitar-sax duel. As if the sax solo in the original wasn't mindless enough, now they have the guitar and the sax dueling. I mean, why did they even perform \\"The Dogs of War\\" in the first place? Why not \\"Echoes\\" or anything from Animals or anything from the Syd Barrett years? Or maybe \\"Dogs\\", that would've been sweet. Not \\"Dogs of War\\", mind you, but \\"Dogs\\". \\"Comfortably Numb\\" also changes things up, which again is good, but sadly they convert it into bombastic arena-rock. Whatever, we still have the studio version of \\"Comfortably Numb\\", which was my favorite song ever when I first discovered this group a couple years back) Or they could've just broken up after Roger Waters. Oh yeah, there are a couple of other songs I didn't mention, both hits off of The Wall: \\"Another Brick in the Wall, pt. 2\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\".  Needless to say, they're both pretty pointless. If you've heard the studio versions, you've heard the live ones (well, there's no children's choir on \\"Brick in the Wall\\", but that goes without saying). There's some pretty cool guitar on the finale \\"Run Like Hell\\", though - the only song on this album that I can throw my full support behind. That's good, at least. One great song; a lot of accurate but meaningless remakes of the classics, a couple of blundered experiments, and some just-plain bad songs. Whydid this even come out?y did this even come out?
B000AGTPUU|3.0|This frantically manic madcap would-be disaster epic was not what I expected or wanted The Polar Express to be, and was definitely not what it should have been. I'd go so far as to say this was not all that good of a movie, despite its novel animation and occasional visual brilliance. What frustrates me here is how great this movie could have been and should have been. There is only the slightest connection between this movie and the plot of the much better short book that goes by the same name. Also would it have killed the filmmakers to have stuck with the characters from the book as written and drawn instead of turning this beloved classic into some sort of misguided effort at furthering \\"diversity\\" in America? Just a very disappointing film from every aspect.
B00004Y6NX|3.0|If you ask a lot of fans, this is the peak of Mark Knopfler's career and Brothers in Arms is just crass commercial crapola. Well, I agree that Brothers and Arms is crass commercial crapola, and I will also say that the invigorating \\"Tunnel of Love\\", with all kinds of awesome guitar riffs, is the best Dire Straits song I've ever heard. Another thing I like about it is that Knopfler keeps his guitar soloing to a minimum - I don't really think he's anymore than a mediocre soloist - and the song achieves its gigantic length instead through multiple paradigm shifts. There is a guitar solo, though, and it's decent but my least favorite part of the song. As a guitarist, Knopfler tries to emulate the Dave Gilmour Sound(tm) by playing as few notes as possible and hoping that the less-is-more technique will win us over, but why should I listen to a Dave Gilmour imitator when I've got the real thing? (If you were curious, I think Pink Floyd is much better than Dire Straits). Other than the guitar solo, though, it's a pretty good \\"progressive pop song\\" with my favorite Knopfler melody by far. It's just that I would've preferred it to last 6:10, rather than its full 8:08. The next song, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", is awesome. You hear? I'm describing a Dire Straits song as awesome. Because it is. The lyrics give the classic love story to end all classic love stories an appropriately cinematic treatment, but the real virtues are in the melody (veeeeeery catchy) and the song's humble, endearing nature. See, the Dire Straits are sometimes boring, but they know their limits and stay with in them. Very rarely is their music terribly inadequate. Only when they try to ROCK OUT, DUDE!!!!!, in fact. Or when they try to appeal to the MTV crowd. But when they shoot for subtle, understated power, they're good. You know why I don't like \\"Skateaway\\"? Because it does try to ROCK OUT, DUDE!!!! during the chorus, and tries to make it funky during the verses, but Dire Straits are neither funky nor rocking, and so \\"Skateaway\\" fails. But even though it does boogie, I like \\"Expresso Love\\", for two reasons: the melody, and the piano. I say screw the guitar parts. And definitely screw the five-minute length. Get rid of the guitar solo, for one. And toss out the last minute, for another. For a third, please tell Knopfler to stop trying to sing like Elvis Costello. Speaking of Elvis Costello, he wrote a song called \\"Hand in Hand\\" that's a ton better than the song also called \\"Hand in Hand\\" on this album. The one on this album is just a dry piano ballad. Oh yeah, then there's the awful blues-rocker \\"Solid Rock\\" and the near-racist \\"Les Boys\\". So let's see... if you were to take \\"Tunnel of Love\\", \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" from this album and \\"Private Investigations\\" and \\"Love Over Gold\\" from the next, you'd have a really good album! But now... now, it's really uneven. Blerf.g, and so \\"Skateaway\\" fails. But even though it does boogie, I like \\"Expresso Love\\", for two reasons: the melody, and the piano.

B00007GZR5|4.0|When I was 21, I moved to London, and lived in a flatshare where I didn't get on well with my flatmates, and didn't know anyone else.  So some nights after work, I'd go to the bookshop in WHSmith in Victoria train station and flick through the books...where I came across \\"I Am Legend\\" by Richard Matheson - it was so gripping that I read it standing there and then, in the bookshop before even buying it.  Later I sought out books by the same author, and though a completely different book in every way, the same thing happened with \\"What Dreams May Come\\" (one of the most moving books I've ever read - proved to me that I was more of a romatic than I'd admitted to myself, hehe)...    When I recently bought this film (some time later), I was in a somewhat emotionally fragile mood & seeking something uplifting and life affirming (& to restore my confidence in love and romance).  This film was certainly enjoyable, and Robin Williams plays the main character with heart...but the it just fell short of what I was expecting, and hoping for...    Of course the book is in a class of it's own, and this doesn't touch it...but nor was I expecting it to...and unfortunately this film doesn't even reach the lesser standard I was hoping for it.  I would have given this 3 stars, but for the fact that it evokes the memories of the greatness and emotional heights reached by the book...and thus I couldn't give this story any less than 4 stars.
B0009A21R6|2.0|So here comes the overproduction! I'm not impressed with this group by any stretch of the imagination, but they had their strengths in subtlety, subtlety that does not occur at all on this album, which was somehow a masssssssive success on MTV, probably because of the overproduction. But it's not all that good. The previous two albums were spotty, but none of them contained anything as awful as the synth-washed pop song \\"So Far Away\\" - I don't think either of those albums even used synthesizers, in fact. Somehow \\"So Far Away\\" was a massive hit regardless. An even bigger hit was the endless, boring, trite, homophobic (ironic or not, the entire second verse is simply unacceptable from anyone) anti-MTV rant \\"Money for Nothing\\". Now here's some wonderful food for thought: \\"Money for Nothing\\", in spite of supposedly being this huge anti-commercial rant, is the most stereotypical '80s pop song you can imagine. It's got the loud, calculated, distorted guitars; the big booming 4/4 beat; more synthesizers than you ever knew what to do with. And I'm being lead to believe this is anti-corporate? HA! So then there's the third of the three big bad hits, and the worst of the bunch: \\"Walk of Life\\", modernized, sterilized boogie. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Dire Straits should not boogie. And even when the group touches on what could be something good, like on the jazzy \\"Your Latest Trick\\", with that fantastic sax part, they ruin it by contrasting that sax part with hair-metal guitar. Why? It was perfectly fine as a Steely Dan rip-off with neat little bongos. It did not need the stupid metal guitar. It's good compared to the three hits, true, but... eurgh, I hate those three hits. Besides, I love the sax part, as I have said multiple times. And then... well, then you have your token boring Dire Straits songs. Not only are \\"Your Latest Trick\\" and \\"Ride Across the River\\" impossibly lethargic, they're also impossibly long and overproduced in the process. But then after that you have the one song I do like. \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" has a subtle, menacing-sounding folk section and a big booming rock chorus. Now, that song I like. Not for the rock parts at all - it's another one of those '80s heart attacks -  but for the quiet acoustic bits. The rock parts are totally useless. And after that, we get to hear Dire Straits' take on generic '80s funk-rock. The insulting song in question is \\"One World\\". If I never hear that song again in my life I will be happy. And then you have the third token boring Dire Straits song, the totally uneventful title song. I'm not big on Dire Straits, but sometimes they can good - though I've never heard an impressive album by them, I like random songs of theirs (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\"; \\"Private Investigations\\"; \\"Sultans of Swing\\"; every part non-guitar solo part of \\"Tunnel of Love\\"), and they're good when they manage to be subtle without boring me to death - something \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" totally succeeds in, I'll add. But this is just plain awful. There are no songs on it that I like entirely. Not even \\"The Man's Too Strong\\", because of the hair-metal guitar that should not have been a part of it.that you have the one song I do like. \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" has a subtle, menacing-sounding folk section and a big booming rock chorus.

B00000J1YS|3.0|I've never been a fan of Brothers in Arms, obviously the group's biggest success, or either of the solo Mark Knopfler albums I've heard - but I thought I'd give their work a try, since it's unfair to dismiss a band just by hearing one album of theirs. So I decided I'd check out the two albums that the \\"real\\" fans love, with Love over Gold being one of them (and Making Movies, which I also intend to review, being another). And, well... basically, it's uneventful. I will stand firmly by my belief that the famous \\"epic\\" \\"Telegraph Road\\" goes nowhere, other than a few interesting guitar passages - but come on, when you're more or less soloing for fourteen minutes it's expected that after a while you'll get lucky and play something worthwhile eventually. And the verse sections are just kind of boring meditations on how people ruined the environment. There's no real structure to it, either - rather, it just kind of meanders from one riff to another without offering us any reason as to why it's doing so. I think it was his attempt to craft a progressive suite much like Yes' \\"Close to the Edge\\", but without the virtuosity of Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe, the instrumental passages lose me. It's never offensive, unlike a majority of Brothers and Arms, and that's to its credit. But if I wanted to hear guitar wankery (and hey, I like a lot of guitar wankery), I'd put on something like \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" for chilling out, or \\"Machine Gun\\" for rocking out. Either way, you can do much better than this. I guess the piano part's pretty. Now, I know for certain I like \\"Private Investigations\\", if nothing else than for that pretty acoustic guitar and flute, because Mark Knopfler mumbles his way through it. See, that's another problem I have with this group: Mark Knopfler's kind of a boring guy. His unassuming nature can be charming, or it can be deadly dull. On \\"Private Investigations\\", it's both. Again, that's a hell of an acoustic guitar solo he plays (and the marimba and flute), and his crunchy electric riffs are satisfying, but you can barely make out what he's saying. On the other hand, the boogie \\"Industrial Disease\\" does nothing but exasperate me. You see, Dire Straits are okay at making really quiet atmospheric late-night chill stuff (though they're not great at anything), but they should not boogie. \\"Walk of Life\\" boogies, and it's one of the most idiotic things I've ever heard. \\"Industrial Disease\\" boogies too, and it's even worse. And it's not funny either. It wants to be, but it's not. It's got a talkbox, too, which isn't good. \\"Love Over Gold\\" itself is a bit like \\"Private Investigations\\", and hey, I like it! You can actually hear Knopfler, that's a plus. And it's got a cool Steely Dan vibe to it. And again, nice piano and acoustic guitar. I mean, it's the kind of song that really fades into the background when it ends, but I enjoy it while it's playing. \\"Private Investigations\\" is the same way... and every other song I like by this band. Sadly, \\"It Never Rains\\" is the worst track other than \\"Industrial Disease\\" (absolutely horrible song!). Like \\"Telegraph Road\\", it tries and fails to be a big sweeping epic for all generations, but unlike \\"Telegraph Road\\" there isn't a single memorable passage in it. Really, it's more of a long Springsteen rip-off than anything else. And I like Springsteen a lot more than Dire Straits. Again, \\"It Never Rains\\" is rarely offensive, but it's even duller than \\"Telegraph Road\\". I actually like looking at this album's cover more than I like listening to the music itself. But the music isn't bad... for the most part, anyway.

Fierce resolve and humility are character strengths I've observed in great leaders of nations throughout history, of businesses, of sports teams and of social sector organizations.

I've presented some of the evidence in [[ASIN:0785223584 Fired Up or Burned Out: How to Reignite Your Team's Passion, Creativity, and Productivity]].  Presently I'm working on a follow up book and would be grateful to hear any thoughts on that issue.

0307237699|4.0|I picked up this book because I wanted to know more about the possible future President of the United States of America. This year will be an interesting one in American politics: A woman (Hilary Clinton) or an African American president? Both gender and race of the former were deemed impossible just a few years ago. It is about time we vote for who is better at the job, and not based on gender or the color of a person's skin.    Barack Hussein Obama, Jr., is the third African American, and the first African American male Democrat, to be elected to the U.S. Senate. Obama's father, Barack Obama, Sr., was originally a goatherd in Kenya, who later earned a scholarship to study in the US and became a professor. Obama's mother, S. Ann Dunham, grew up in Kansas.     Raised in Hawaii and Indonesia, Obama received a bachelor's degree from Columbia University (1983) and a law degree from Harvard University (1991), where he was the first African American to serve as president of the Harvard Law Review. He became active in the Democratic Party and lectured on constitutional law at the University of Chicago. He also worked as an attorney on civil rights issues. In 1996 he was elected to the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was elected to the U.S. Senate. He is now, as you all know, running as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States of America.    This is his second book, and it has already become a bestseller. His first book, `Dreams from my Father', was on the New York Times bestsellers as well.    This book is about how we can solve the present problems facing the US. He admits that he does not have all the answers. He examines, among many other topics, the growing economic insecurity of American families; the racial and religious tensions in politics; developing strategies to wean ourselves off foreign oil; expanding health care for kids; and the threat of terrorism. He tells stories about his family, friends, and members of the senate. He even has stories about President Bush. In one story, he relates how he was invited to a White House dinner. While the other senators were busy taking pictures with the president, he went straight for the buffet. He was starving! Then the president called him. He was a bit embarrassed, fearing that he might have breadcrumbs on his face. The president pulled him aside and gave him some advice. He told him how dirty politics is in Washington, and warned him to watch his back.     Was this book written as a political ploy? Will Obama really do all the things he promises in this book should he be elected? So many presidents promise so much before election, but how many promises materialize? Remember Bush senior saying, \\"Read my lips, no taxes.\\" First thing he did when he took office was to raise taxes.    Talking of taxes, Obama says in his book that he is against lowering taxes so that the rich benefit more. He's skeptical of big government and of Republican tax cuts for the rich and of Social Security privatization. He also warns how rich organizations are now controlling our politics. We all know that, but why isn't anyone doing anything about it? Why is the senate not addressing this problem? Do we really need a book to tell us about it? And does it really take the vision of one man, or the vision of the senate and Congress (the government in other words) to address this problem? Obama is actually surprised at how little serious debate and deliberation takes place on the floor of the House and the Senate. This came as a surprise to me.    Obama warns that we give too much of our power away, to the professional politicians, to the lobbyists, to cynicism, and that our democracy suffers as a result.    Obama is prochoice when it comes to abortion, and supportive of religion, but not of imposing it. He favors tax credits for the poor, and a health-care program that resembles Clinton's Hillary-care proposals. On Iraq, he favors troop withdrawal. He supports free trade, while deploring its effects onAmerican workers (he opposed the Central American Free Trade Agreement). According to Obama, more support for education, science and renewable energy will see the economy through the dilemmas of globalization. And most importantly of all, he believes that the Constitution is a beautiful document that is a `Living' document, and not `Static'.    Obama is well read, and it shows in his writing style. In fact, he does encourage parents to read stories for their kids when they are young, and try to limit TV viewing. This will encourage them to read when they grow up. I can't agree more!    It is easy to say things but harder to actually do the things one is talking about. I think Obama can be a great president, but will he be able to do the things he says he will, or are forces greater than him (and us!) govern the US government? We will soon find out.

Their paths diverge, but nine months later, Lyla gives birth to a boy.  Lyla's father (Sadler) tells Lyla the child died in childbirth and gives the child up for adoption.  Twelve years later, that boy, who will go by the name August Rush (Highmore), is in an orphanage.  He runs away to New York, where he discovers he has musical talent.  He believes that if he can make his parents hear his music, they will find him.<br /><br />\\"August Rush\\" is hokey, but harmless.  It is a nice movie that will be enjoyed by many, but there is not much substance to it.  If you can accept that music and fate bind these characters together, your enjoyment level will be higher.  In fact, musicians will be more likely to appreciate the film and its love of music.  Non-musicians may find it cheesy.

There is nothing new in the files booklet, just some of the characters from the movie and a couple of fight moves. Just buy the regular dvd and save yourself some money. Anyway, this movie is by far the best movie ive seen this year. Two Thumbs Up! Love all the key elements to this film. Matt Damon is awesome. Get It!!!

B000HBKCDC|5.0|I got this album last year and fell in love with it. Like so many others, I was skeptical. I just hate hearing people sing songs like O Holy Night when they really don't care about the true meaning of Christmas. I'm a huge Sarah fan, but I just didn't know. But what she made was a very reverent, very \\"Christmas-y\\" album. I love that it's so melancholy, because really, Christmas is about a child who was born to die, so it's a mixed joy.     In fact, I found this album to resonate so much that it's my go-to album when I'm stressed and need to bring calm back into my life. I really do listen to it all through the year. I've had people laugh when they hear a Christmas song in August, but what can I say? I can't explain, but it really does help me feel more relaxed and centered.    The only song I could do without is the John Lennon song. She did a great job, I just don't like that song and keep meaning to take it off my ipod. But I love The First Noel/Mary Mary, Greensleeves, River, Wintersong... every other song, I suppose. :)    I just wanted to write a review after I've had the album for a year and say that it's still not old to me at all. Sarah is a true artist and has made a meaningful and respectful album.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|I do love the scissor sisters and have since I first saw \\"Take your mama out tonight\\", on some music channel late one night. There seem to be a couple arguments as to the originality of their music. Of course that can be debated but what is really the point? My opinion (which I'll make short), there is rarely any original music anymore. Anyone can be compared to anyone. It's unfortunate but true. What I feel about the scissor sisters is they took quite a few different genres and ran with it. Honestly, they have songs for the club queen all the way to the rock ballad lover. I suppose the cd as a whole is most suitable for the eclectic. Those with say the violent femmes and Mika in the same playlist. You get my drift. Now I didnt give it five stars... and that was on purpose. I dont feel it was a groundbreaking album- but it is quite a ride, should you choose to let it be.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|of course i love it...what james blunt super fan wouldn't?? it's definitely a change from back to bedlam; it's a slight different style, so if you're expecting more of the same from the first album, you might be slightly disappointed. there are some songs that remind you of songs you've heard before...such as the bee geesk, but i'm sure many artists tend to borrow sounds from other artists. all in all, you get hooked and want to keep on listening to it; my 4 month old loves it!
B000002JSP|4.0|\\"In Through The Out Door\\" is not a classic like \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" or the unnamed fourth album. But it's still a much better-than-average hard rock record, featuring great songs like \\"Fool In The Rain\\" and \\"All My Love\\".    John Paul Jones is the main songwriter here, and in 1979 Led Zeppelin were slowly starting to move away from heavy blues-rock and towards a slightly more \\"comteporary\\" pop sound which (unfortunately) included synthesizers on some numbers. The particularly synth-heavy, ten-minute \\"Carouselambra\\" is frankly awful, ponderous and misguided, and the otherwise excellent \\"All My Love\\" could have done without the electronics as well.  But most of what's here is real music (!). \\"In Through The Out Door\\" opens with the good but slightly unfocused \\"In The Evening\\"...nice riffs, good, thumping rhythm (which changes to half time for no good reason two-thirds of the way through), but not all that memorable.  \\"South Bound Saurez\\" should have been either \\"Suarez\\" (the name) or \\"Soiree\\", I guess, but the song is great. A driving, up-beat R&B-piano moves the song a long, and the melody line is wonderfully catchy even if the lyrics are slightly nonsensical.    The mid-tempo \\"Fool In The Rain\\" is probably the best song on the album in my opinion; the main piano riff is a bit repetitive, but the percussion is subtle and latin-tinged and the melody is one of the band's very best originals. Even the lyrics are good! And you can't help but enjoy the silly but good-timey country rock of \\"Hot Dog\\", honky tonk-piano and everything:  \\"She took my heart, she took my keys / From in my old blue dungarees / And I'll never go to Texas anymore!\\"    The occationally atonal \\"Carouselambra\\" sucks big time, but \\"All My Love\\" is too good to be ruined by a bit too much synth. Jimmy Page plays some wonderfully subtle, liquid guitar fills, and even Bonham tones down the attack. I still grind my teeth at the Toys 'R' Us-like keyboard solo shortly before the halfway point, but still - greatsong.  Led Zeppelin's final studio album closes with the rather slow, blues-influenced croon \\"I Wanna Crawl\\". It's not bad at all, and Page plays excellent guitar, but it's not truly memorable either, although it does grow on you a little bit. Just kill the synth, please, John Paul.    And that's it, I guess. Not much psychedelic 60s blues-rock here, and no fairy-tale English folk either, but Led Zeppelin still manage to sound like Led Zeppelin. And that's not bad at all.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns  Khaled Hosseini    One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,  Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.    The two lines above are from a poem about Kabul, Afghanistan, in which the poet expresses his love for his homeland; and it is from this poem that Khaled Hosseini has taken the title of his latest number one bestseller, A Thousand Splendid Suns.     In spite of having fled his country, the author's love of his country is clearly evident in both of his books. In this book in particular, his story of two women not only exhibits his love for his country but also his respect for women and their rights.  Mariam and Leila, both forced into marriage to a much older man, first meet as rivals in a polygamous marriage but become the closest of friends and each other's protector from their abusive husband.      When it becomes possible, the surviving protagonists flee to Pakistan, where they seek refuge from the horrors of war, but in the end they return to their country to help rebuild it after the Taliban are ousted.  In his characters the reader gets the feel that Hosseini is expressing a wish that he in real life himself cannot fulfill.                                 ........................    The two books helped me put a face to a country I had only envisioned politically and, of course, negatively.  However, reading Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns has enabled me to humanize this country.  In the midst of all the turmoil in Afghanistan, there is still living...and loving...just as in any other country.  Here are human beings whose lives are turned upside down.  It is heartbreaking to read about these people's lives torn asunder by one war after another, first the Russian invasion and finally the Taliban takeover.  The author writes about his native country with love and regret-a country he fled for the U. S. amidst all the turmoil.  I suggest that before you see the movie, TheKite Runner-which is due out soon-you read the book.  Then, by all means read A Thousand Splendid Suns.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

B000VWE5OY|4.0|For bringing me this show.  I watched the first episode or two, out of sheer curiosity.  Then I was hooked.  I love the way that they have taken the time to develop each character showing both their strengths and flaws.  The season finale actually made me tear up a little when everyone reacted to seeing Jack.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars...ONLY reason, is that it relies so heavily on Dr. Who to get the full gist of what is going on.  I found myself searching Wikipedia and fan sites trying to figure out what the deal was with the hand in the jar...and some other quirks.  I have, however, ordered the three \\"modern\\" seasons of Dr. Who...in an effort to catch up before Season two starts...I would recommend it for real Sci-fi fans, and maybe not just for casual viewers and prudes.

B000002WPI|5.0|Wu Tang Clan is the best rap group ever. This album came out when rap meant something and wasnt watered down like it is today.  All nine members have a style all there own and they all blend well into the songs. I love the production from the RZA, he is one of the most under rated rap producers out there. I wish he'd get more credit for his work but oh well. There is not a weak track on this cd. I know the words to ever single song on the cd.  A must for fans of real rap. Not todays rap because there might be some good rap out there (and thats a big might), its not as good as it was in 93 and 94.

B00004TA41|5.0|To begin, I am very new to the wonderful world of jazz. I had been introduced to free-jazz almost a year ago with Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew,\\" but had been relatively unimpressed, writing it off as directionless and dull. It wasn't until I recently purchased another Davis classic, \\"Some Kind of Blue,\\" that I fully appreciated \\"Bitches Brew\\" and decided to begin a cool-jazz, free-jazz and hard-bop collection. Although I am relatively new to jazz, I have a extremely diverse collection of progressive rock, art rock, and avant-garde albums so I am used to unconventional music, in which \\"Interstellar Space\\" definitely applies. Understanding my musical taste is vital in comparing the relevance of my review to your own preferences.<br /><br /> I came across \\"Interstellar Space\\" at an illogical point in my discovery of jazz music. I was just getting over my initial astonishment at Coltrane's brilliant release, \\"Blue Train,\\" and was substantially thirsting for more 'Trane. Though I knew enough about \\"Interstellar Space\\" to understand that this would not be another \\"Blue Train,\\" I really had no idea what I was spending 15 bucks on. Expecting this album to be anything remotely similar to \\"Bitches Brew\\" proved to be a mistake, and had I no experience in avant-garde music, I would have never gotten past even the first track (\\"Mars\\") of \\"Interstellar Space.\\" Upon first experience this album, the listener is assaulted with almost utter cacophony consisting of Rashid Ali's frantic, polyrhythmic percussion and John Coltrane's largely atonal, experimental, and ultra-complex alto sax attack. There are no strolling bass lines and absolutely no other accompaniment of any kind. I initially found the first two or three tracks utterly unlistenable and was just about to set \\"Interstellar Space\\" aside in utter frustration when my ears subtly began to recover from the realization that this nothing like the conventional \\"Blue Train,\\" nor the multi-layered \\"Bitches Brew.\\"<br /><br /> John Coltrane obviously had no interest whatsoever in creating an album based around a tonal center, or even the acknowledgment of a steady meter when recording \\"Interstellar Space.\\" Coltrane's bombardment of mostly twelve-tone scales hardly differ from track to track in tempo and ultimate spontaneity, so it is most effective to think of this album as one long track divided into parts. Most \\"parts\\" are largely arranged in a similar fashion, beginning with either Coltrane shaking bells, a theme-like melody, or both, with five-plus minutes of improvisation and Ali providing a dazzling drum solo towards the end. The emphasis on \\"Interstellar Space\\" is ultimately the intensity of the music, and the sheer technical proficiency. While this may sound dull, I find it absolutely intriguing. While it may prove difficult to overlook than the lack of a tonal center and steady meter, the patient listener will be graciously rewarded with a stunning tour de force. There are moments on this album when Coltrane is playing so quickly and ferociously that it seems the music is due to combust into broken shards, yet it never does. Coltrane manages to keep the listener vividly awake and efficiently succumbed to the hypnotic, raw power of \\"Interstellar Space.\\"<br /><br /> The tremendous impact of this album could have not been as stunning without Ali at the skins. While maybe not quite the virtuosi that Elvin Jones was, the tension created between Ali and Coltrane is absolutely perfect. While Ali does not seem to acknowledge a steady meter, there is a sort of pattern in his performance. Rather of keeping the arrangements together, Ali follows Coltrane in his attempt to tear them apart. Ali carefully matches Coltrane in intensity, tempo (though it is mostly consistent), and more importantly, color! I have yet to hear a drummer who can attain as much a melodic feel as Ali has on this recording. This album is ultimately kept vividly alive with the imaginative interplay between Coltrane and Ali. Not only do both manage to keep things interesting and tense, but they keep the arrangements monstrously complicated. The most prominent characteristics of \\"Interstellar Space,\\" are interestingly, contradictions. The effective simplicity of the duo and its lack of meter or melody, and the technical complexity of the performance are, in effect, delightful foils. This contrast works in the album's favor, providing little to no distractions from its overall intensity.<br /><br /> As I become more and more familiar with the works of John Coltrane, I cannot help but think that this album is Coltrane in his experimental prime. Coltrane's free will and \\"flow-of-conscience\\" improvisation style that have ultimately become his trademark, are the most prominent characteristics in \\"Interstellar Space.\\" This album seems like the apex that Coltrane had ultimately been hinting at throughout the evolution of his career. While there are definitely more instantly gratifying Coltrane albums in circulation, \\"Interstellar Space\\" is something the adventurous listener will want to check into, wether in appreciation of its unconventionality, complexity, or sheer intensity.keep things interesting and tense, but they keep the arrangements monstrously complicated.

0440238609|5.0|His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman is a gift for those who enjoy reading fantasy but are also readers of philosophy and science. I suppose Pullman is more interested in creating and peopling  other worlds, but he is, nonetheless, adding his bit, however much leavened by a wonderfully imaginative tale,  to the prestigious work of thinkers including the humanists Voltaire and Rabelais (who also wrote some very entertaining stuff).    The scientific possibilities, parallel universes, e.g., he makes a part of his work are part of the scientific dialogues presently being considered in actual scientific circles.    Thanks, Mr. Pullman, I wish there were more thinking writers like you shedding some light  in this  very murky world of ours.

B000002J0B|4.0|1972 went by without a Led Zeppelin album, but then, in March of 1973, came \\"Houses of the Holy\\". Less dense and less bluesy than its predecessors. More diverse and more folkish. Less heavy and intense. More loose and relaxed.   Now, is that good or bad?    I actually didn't like \\"Houses of the Holy\\" all that much when I first heard it about the age of 19. I missed the heavy blues, the riffing and the thundering drums which dominated \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" in particular. But it has grown on me since. In some ways it is not as immediately accessible as, say \\"II\\" and the one that isn't really called \\"IV\\", and you have to pay more attention to songs like the moody folk-fusion number \\"The Rain Song\\", the weird, sinister \\"No Quarter\\", and even the opener, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", in order to fully appreciate them.    Not so with \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", though. That one is classic Zeppelin, opening with a briskly strummed acoustic guitar, then two, and then comes a thumping rock rhythm and a scratchy riff from Page's Gibson Les Paul. The band works up a tremendous groove based on the supple foundation of John Bonham's drums and John Paul Jones' bass guitar.    \\"The Crunge\\" is the only really lightweight number on the album, a forgettable, half-baked funk-pastiche which (relatively) quickly gives way to \\"Dancing Days\\". A mid-tempo electric folk-rock song, it is occationally plagued by annoying synthesizers, but that's a minor quibble, really. Nice one. And \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is even better, a fun, breezy reggae-romp with a deep, deep groove and a particularly great drum part by Bonham.    The seven-minute \\"No Quarter\\" is a slow, spooky blend of blues, folk, jazz and general weirdness. A centrepiece at the vast majority of Led Zeppelin concerts during the latter half of the band's existense, it it drum-less for well over two minutes, gliding along on an electric piano and synthesizers.   At three minutes everything stops again, and the song comes almost to a halt. John Paul Jones' slow, moody piano part then bleeds into Pages's guitar, and shortly before the five-minute mark guitar and drums fall briefly silent again, re-entering shortly afterwards alongside an odd-sounding theremin. I still don't know quite what to think of it...    The album winds down with \\"The Ocean\\", probably the only song to sound better and tougher on the \\"Song Remains the Same\\" live album. It's still good here, though. And if you turn up the volume just before the song proper begins, you can hear John Bonham saying \\"we've done four already but now we're steady, and then they went 1, 2, 3, 4!\\" :-)    I don't love \\"Houses\\" like I love the first four albums, or the \\"BBC Sessions\\" package, but there is still a lot of good stuff here, and some excellent musicianship being put on display, and fans will certainly not want to be without this one.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|Disk 2 skipped so bad that it wouldn't play, and the episode \\"Jump Jack Jump\\" I believe it was, went skippy towards the end of the episode.

B000W4KT64|3.0|Clearly I am once again in the minority because unlike the rave reviews this film is receiving, I cannot justify anything better than a so-so rating.  The story line deals with racial prejudice but it approaches the topic with such a heavy hand it borders or a parody.  It is filled with music but it all seemed to be the same tune with different lyrics.  It wasn't that the music is bad, but it lacked variety and had a deadening sameness about it.  I kept wondering what Bob Fosse or Gower Champion could have done with the choreography because I thought this was the weakest point in the movie.  But once again -- it is OK and entertaining but fell far short of what could have been done by a great choreographer.  I really didn't have a problem with John Travolta in drag, but why did the director feel this was necessary?  Couldn't they find an actress willing to wear a fat suit?  Travolta did a good job as did Christopher Walken but they were little more than props.<br /><br />The entire storyline stretched credibility to the very limit.  The \\"white folks\\" were suitably and virulently prejudiced -- the \\"black folks\\" really had rhythm and the cops were suitably dumb.  All of this was so extreme as to seem like a parody but like most musicals the plot was only a vehicle to carry the music and dancing which I thought were OK but never rose above \\"competent\\".  I saw it , I watched it to the end, and unlike Chicago which I have seen many times, I probably will never see Hairspray again.  Three stars was all I felt it deserved.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|Before I begin, I'd like to make one thing perfectly clear.  This is the third movie in a series.  If you haven't seen the first two, you will be lost, especially since this one picks up moments after the climax of the last one.  Ready?  Then let's begin.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is injured and on the run.  The Moscow police are after him because of the car chase that ended the last film.  When cornered, Bourne explains that he has to find out who is after him and who he is once and for all before he escapes.<br /><br />The action skips ahead six weeks.  Bourne has once again slipped under the radar.  The latest flashbacks in his memory are connected to his early training at the CIA.  But his motive is the death of his girlfriend.  He may have caught the person responsible, but he wants to know why that person was sent after him in the first place.<br /><br />Meanwhile, British reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is writing a series on Jason Bourne.  He has a secret source in the CIA.  And he's attracted the attention of Bourne as well as Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), the head of a secret program at the CIA.  Who is Simon's source?  Will it lead Bourne to the secrets of his past?  Or will Noah have everyone is site killed first?<br /><br />I'll admit I am not the biggest fan of the first two movies.  I found them overly complex and hard to follow with some big plot holes.  But this one was actually straight forward, so I was able to sit back and enjoy.  Yet you do need to have seen those first two, and recently, because they weave in lots of plot points from those films.<br /><br />Now that's not to say the movie was boring.  There are lots of great action scenes here.  I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  Heck, an extended scene in Tangier had my stomach in knots.<br /><br />One complaint that holds true is the lack of character development.  With the exception of returning characters, we really don't get to know anyone.  Of course, that does make it easier to root for our heroes.  And this isn't a complaint about the acting, but it was all wonderful as always.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the shaky camera work.  It makes it harder to follow the action at times.  I wish this fad in camera work would end because I don't think I will ever appreciate it.<br /><br />This is the first film in the franchise to make me interested in reading the books, so I'd say it was a success.  There's always a possibility they will come back for a fourth film, but if not, this ending should satisfy fans of the series.And this isn't a complaint about the acting, but it was all wonderful as always.

B000067FP8|5.0|Three years has passed since the incident in Kingston Falls, Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) and his fiancee Katie (Phobe Cates) has moved to New York City where they work for a Donald Trump-esque media moguel Daniel Clamp (John Glover) who has a unique kind of buidling for technology and cable TV.  Luckily Gizmo (voiced by Howie Mandall) is there in the big apple as his master (Keye Luke) has recently died and is captured by a Clamp buidling research scientist but gets rescued by his old pal Billy. However Gizmo accidently gets wet once again to spawn more Mogwais that turn into the ghastly Gremlins once again but this time they are more advanced and more enchanced thanks to the genetic material in the labs. Now they have taken control of the building and it's up to Billy, Gizmo and Katie to put a stop to the ghouls before they escape in the big apple.<br /><br />The film also stars Christopher Lee, Robert Picardo, Henry Gibson, John Astin, Leonard Maltin, Robert Prosky, Geedee Wanatanbe, Dick Miller, Bubba Smith, Hulk Hogan and has the voice of Tony Randall as the voice of Brain Gremlin. It's a creative and more inventive sequel to the 1984 horror comedy masterpiece as Steven Spielburg and Joe Dante reunite to make a sequel that almost surpasses the original and it's even more funnier with some tounge-in-cheek in-jokes with satire on commercialism. This is truly a worthy sequel to the classic and is great fun for everyone who enjoyed the original.<br /><br />This DVD has excellent picture and sound with fine extras like audio ocmmentary, Gag reel, Cast and Crew film Highlights, an easter egg containing an alternative video version of the Technical difficulties scene, Trailer, Featurette, and deleted scenes with optional commentary.
1892065312|5.0|The story is told quite differently from any other fantasy author i have read, each chapter is from the P.O.V. of a particular character, which makes the story unique. Which is a plus. The realism of the story with the mixture of medieval style history makes this novel stand out.    As a fan of Medieval History this was what drew me to the book, I wish he would incorporate more battles into the book, but when that lacks he offers a great political intrigue.     As an author he rank up there with Tolkien, I would hazzardly say that these two are the greatest writers of the genre. Tolkien mastered the narrative style, Martin mastered the point of view style. Everyone else is inbetween.     This is a story that is not meant for the easy reader, this is a book that takes time and concentration to get through, also not to mention he is very frank with subject matters and is very detailed (similar to Tolkien). Martin can only really be compared to Tolkien, in the sense of detail of the characters, the houses they come from, the history of the land and the story itself. GRRM is Tolkien come again.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Inventor Randy Peltzer (Hoyt Axton) has bought a special gift for his son Billy (Zack Gallaghan) and it's a furry Chinese creature called a Mogwai (voiced by Howie Mandall). But there are three important rules that must be followed if he wants to keep the creature such as number 1 which means to keep him away from bright light especially sunlight cause it will kill him, number 2 is to never get him wet and number 3 which is the most important rule of them all which is never feed them after midnight. But Billy does what he can but he accidently gets him wet one day and it makes him mutiply other Mogwaii like him and he accidently feed the Mogwaii except Gizmo after midnight as it makes them into ghastly reptilian ghouls that cause havok in the town of Kingston Falls.<br /><br />Brilliant and highly original Horror fantasy comedy from executive producer Steven Spielburg, director Joe Dante (\\"The Howling\\") and writer Chris Columbus. This movie became one of the biggest box-office hits of 1984 and of all time, this movie has a great sense of charm and of course black humor thrown into it with gruesomeness. The film co-stars Corey Feldman, Phoebe Cates and Dick Miller and special appearences by Robby the Robot and Chuck Jones, this movie did caused some controversy when it came out because parents thought it was too violent for small children even around the same time \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" came out. So the MPAA created the \\"PG-13\\" rating was created that year, i love how make-up artist Chris Walas did the lovable furballs and the hideous beasts and made them some of the most memorable creatures to hit the screen. The film has often been imitated much with films like \\"Critters 1 & 2\\" (Which are great movies in their own rights), \\"Ghoulies\\", \\"Munchies\\", \\"Beasites\\", \\"Elves\\", \\"Evil Toons\\", \\"Troll\\" and the worst one of them all \\"Hobgoblins\\", this one is a true must see even around the holidays.<br /><br />This special edition DVD has excellent sound and picture with nice extras like deleted scenes, Trailers, 2 audio commentaries, behind the scenes featurette, photo and storyboard gallery and filmmaker and cast highlights.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Gremlins 2 : The New Batch\\", \\"Black Christmas (1974)\\", \\"Small Soldiers\\", \\"Critters\\", \\"Critters 2\\", \\"C.H.U.D.\\", \\"The Pit\\", \\"Evil Dead II\\", \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", \\"Grindhouse\\", \\"Silent Night Deadly Night\\", \\"E.T.\\", \\"Troll\\", \\"Dead Alive (a.k.a.

0618680004|5.0|This book is one of the best books on religion I have read.  If you notice it has a high rating.  The only thing bringing the rating down from a five to a four is the fact that crazy religious people like to post reviews attempting to ruin its credibility.  This is a must have for any atheist or agnostic.  Spectacular!
0887307280|5.0|This book is very interesting starting from the foreword. The story begins right there. The story about life which continues every moment. People who are not afraid to live get everything they want. There are ascents and collapses and those are parts of the Way. But it is OK, it is dynamics.    This world can give you everything you want. There is one condition though - you have to concentrate on that. This book is like a funnel. If you hit its mouth you find yourself thinking, deciding, concentrating and gaining intention. Intention is exactly that raw material which transforms to your wishes. You just need to apply the right technique.    Everything begins in the moment when you clearly understand what you want - your goal. People tend to think that their life and personality are unique. It is true to some extent. There are stages of life and personality development which are common for the majority. Entrepreneurship has some stages as well. Ability to recognize them and act accordingly can help you to achieve your goal, moving towards to your aim, not stepping aside. This book gives you understanding of that parts entrepreneur life consists of.    When you read this book you see how simple everything is. It is true. But people usually tend to overcomplicate things or deviate from real intentions. That is why such kind of books is precious and thoughts discussed there need some time and repetition in order to introduce into your life.
075640407X|5.0|The Name of the Wind is the best debut novel I've read in a long time.   The fact that it's also one of the best Fantasy novels of 2007 is even better.    Characterizations, plot, detail: these are all done to an A++ degree.  It doesn't detail as much as an Erikson novel, for example, or have as many \\"gotcha's\\" as a George RR Martin novel, but it does read like a smooth glass of red wine: full of body and flavor, and gone all to quickly.

B0002EXH54|2.0|Peace does sell, it's true, but is anyone really purchasing? That's the question I asked myself when I purchased this thrash-metal classic from Dave Grohl and the boys. His high-pitched squealing grates, sure, but it's the guitar you have to listen to, to figure out so that you can make your own way.     I've always preferred Metallica's antics to what goes on in these parts, but the skeleton photo does ring to life a true form. Who is it? Where does it come from? Did it meld its terrorizing presence from an Iron Maiden cover into this abyss of a record?     But these are just questions for amateurs (like myself). The real question is:    Peace sells ... but does anyone care??    Doesn't seem as such.     Hope the dude from Velvet Revolver gets back in G 'n' R soon. Now there's some real tunz!!!!!!!!!!

B000MR9D5E|3.0|If you're looking for a visual feast, your search is over. Each episode of this series will bring you the most jaw-droppingly beautiful images, and you will often wonder how the cinematographer managed to capture unbelievably difficult shots with such superb quality. If you have a really large high-def screen, you are *guaranteed* to be blown away by this visual spectacle.    However, if you want more than just images, well, maybe this is not the series for you. If you can put up with David Attenborough's highly affected, pompous narration, you may be surprised by how inaccurate some of the information is. And if you know some of the information to be incorrect, you will be asking yourself how much of the rest of the information that was previously unknown to you is also inaccurate.    Here's an example from episode 3, \\"Fresh Water\\", approximately 35 minutes and 30 seconds into the video:    \\"Even for giant rivers like the Amazon, the journey to the sea is not always smooth or uninterrupted. Iguaçu Falls, on the border of Brazil and Argentina, is one of the widest waterfalls in the world, one and a half miles across.\\"    If you think that the capital of Brazil is Buenos Aires, go ahead and buy the video. But if you're not a geography ignoramus, you will know that the Amazon river crosses Brazil from west to east, far to the north, while Iguaçu Falls are located in the far south of the country and have nothing to do whatsoever with the Amazon region or river. Imagine listening to David Attenborough say that the Colorado River, after crossing the Grand Canyon, creates Niagara Falls...
0385341067|5.0|I should confess at the start that Great Expectations is one of my favorite novels, and as the author employed this classic as a major plot device, well, he captured my interest at the title.  There are many potential pitfalls inherent in using this kind of literary convention; the author artfully dodges them all.  Speaking in the voice of a black New Guinean adolescent, Mr. Jones convincingly lures the reader into the spellbinding narrative of tragedy, hope, and growing up.<br /><br />What I liked particularly was the painfully unsentimental way the character Mister Pip was cast, and then reexamined from the perspective of the narrator's older self.  But it is a tribute to Mr. Jones skill that the mystery of Mister Pip is altered by mature hindsight, but not diminished, nor is the enduring spell of Great Expectations.<br /><br />This inspirational novel succeeds on every level: characterization, plot, emotional impact, intellectual appeal, and evoking the enchantment of the ordinary.  And it stands as a heartfelt testament to the immeasurable value, and reward, of teaching.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|I'm afraid I have to disagree with the earlier reviewer who prefers the 1995 remaster to this new Rhino reissue.  In fact, the new remaster is much clearer than the Atlantic digital remaster without resorting to unnatural brightness.  Indeed, the new remaster sounds almost \\"organic\\" and with the increased clarity the listener can peer more deeply into the mix than ever before.  (Indeed, the difference between the two is apparent from listening to the Amazon song clips for Wooden Ships or 49 Bye-Byes, for example.) Helplessly Hoping is especially notable with the three voices in the left, center, and right positions.  (Alas, if only all the songs had been mixed this way but that would be rewriting history.)    The bass is more prominent on the Rhino remaster.  This is effective on several tracks where the bass notes dig especially deeply, such as Pre-Road Downs and Long Time Gone.  However, it is less effective on Wooden Ships where it tends to muddy the waters a bit.    Some of the other objections that have been raised by reviewers seem to amount to little more than quibbling. All in all, I'd say the Rhino reissue beats the competition hands down.
1400063515|5.0|The Black Swan is one of those landmark cross-disciplinary works that should be read by all people interested in deepening their knowledge of our understanding of reality and the distortion of reality by cognitive and emotional biases.  In a quirky, anecdotal, highly idiosyncratic style, the author describes how most people make flawed decisions by incorrectly understanding probability and risk.  He explains our tendency to err in thinking, whether in the voting booth, in making investment decisions, researching scientific discoveries, or purchasing a car.<br /><br />Of course it is one thing to understand on an intellectual level cognitive and emotional biases and another to be able to remove or neutralize them.  Take, for example, confirmation bias, which is when we tend to reject information that does not support our dearly held view/theory/argument.  Easy concept to comprehend, tough to  incorporate into everyday thinking, especially when it is OUR beloved view/theory/argument that some pesky piece of information undermines.  Critical thinking requires considerable effort and practice.  Such books as The Black Swan make this rather enjoyable.<br /><br />In short: The Black Swan is a rarely occurring, high-impact book that shakes the pillars of social, political, and economic orthodoxy.  Highly recommended.

B000EHSVS2|4.0|Over the past 20 or so years it has been instructive to listen to the rants of various political conservatives who have retroactively adopted Patton (the man) as their hero.<br />I recall one political commentator who solemnly pronounced that George Patton admired Frederick the Great and quoted him often. Then the political commentator quoted Frederick the Great as saying \\"Audacity, more audacity, always audacity.\\"<br />Indeed, in this very movie there is a scene where George C. Scott says some such thing to an American general whom Patton is trying to motivate to advance across Sicily in the face of an expected Nazi counterattack.<br />If you go back to the Ladislas Farago book from which the \\"Patton\\" screenplay was written, the same byplay is there.<br />The only trouble is, it couldn't have happened that way.<br />Frederick the Great didn't say it.<br />And Patton didn't particularly revere the Prussian.<br />A quick check of Bartlett's \\"Familiar Quotations\\" places the quote (originally, \\"Il nous faut de 'laudace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace\\") in the mouth of George Jacques Danton, who on 2 Sept. 1792 was the minister of defense, addressing the French legislative assembly. The situation was that the Austrians were at the gate, threatening to overturn the French Revolution.<br />Frederick the Great had been dead six years.<br />Patton was raised as a bilingual American living part of the time in France and was an acknowledged expert on European military history. It is ludicrous to imagine that he would have made such an error.<br />A quick review of the book, \\"The Patton Papers,\\" will reveal that Frederick is mentioned exactly three times -- twice in a list of eighteenth century military leaders, and once in a paragraph that says Frederick's reputation relies mostly upon his invention of the \\"oblique manuever,\\" which Patton said was due to be invented anyway.<br />We mention this not because we don't like the movie (we really like it) but because one must be careful to check one's facts before one makes broad sweeping statements.<br /><br />Also because we believe that those who cannot remember their history are doomed to misquote it.before one makes broad sweeping statements.

It looks spectacular on my 58\\" plasma, and why have a big tv over your fireplace if you can't make all your friends green with envy. This series goes in the blu-ray player whenever someone comes over and we offer drool buckets at the door. Many of my friends have bought this for their relatives after seeing it at our house. Kids love it (even though its educational...shhhhh), and adults are facinated as well. This is a super series that we have watched over and over, and will continue to bring out for many years.
0446679089|4.0|After reading Charm School, another Demille novel which I found to be more of a lesson in Russian history and politics than anything else, I was reticent to pick up Plum Island.       With Plum Island, on the other hand, Nelson Demille strikes gold.  If you enjoy action, comedy, intrigue and adventure, this one is right on target, or I should say \\"right between the eyes\\".       Our hero, John Corey, a wounded and convalescing New York City homicide detective reluctantly finds himself out of his natural habitat, but well within his element, as he faces the most challenging and rewarding, yet personal murder investigations of his career.       As Plum Island opens, we find Corey busy recuperating from three gunshot wounds and a killer hangover in a quiet New England seaside community.  He receives news that his neighbors and close friends, two highly placed scientists working at a secretive biological research facility have been murdered.       Hired by an overwhelmed and under experienced local police chief to sift and sniff out the killer and motive, he soon finds himself at odds with the FBI, CIA and a particularly annoying head of security, not to mention his boss back in the Big Apple.       The Aforementioned biological research facility is located, by the way, on Plum
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This movie is an almost complete and utter waste of time.  The characters are not sympathetic in the least, not even in the hate them so much you love them sort of way.  The plot decides to disappear for most of the film, only ducking in for about ten minutes of the movie's total 120 minute running time.      The rest of the time is filled with stupid, insipid dialogue that has nothing to do with the plot.  This isn't even entertaining dialogue, like in Pulp Fiction.  No, it's just idiotic conversation between characters that we couldn't care less about.  After the first forty-five minutes we fast forwarded through the rest of the movie until we reached the car chases.      Kurt Russell is decent in this, but his talent is wasted by the idiocy of the script and the ineptness of the rest of the cast.  As it stands, his character was the only one I even cared about a little.    The stylized nature of the film, such as when it has jumpcuts, and when it recreates film reel changes, is campy fun.   Those bits and the car chases are the only good things in the film.  Rent it if you must, then fast forward to the car chases.  That's the only really good way to watch Deathproof.

0316067598|2.0|Let me say this first: As a grunt in the Vietnam war, '68-69,  I have nothing but the highest respect for those who put their lives on the line on behalf of their country.  Even greater respect for the highly trained, highly motivated, and superior committment of the SEALS, Special Forces, and Rangers. They are special men, elit warriors.  We all owe them our gratitude and highest regard, for they stand between us and those who would do us great harm, and are willing to sacrifice their lives to protect us and our country.  LPO Luttrell, and every SEAL who has ever worn the Trident, is a genuine hero.    That said, I will now review Lone Survivor with no agenda, no political objective but simply on it's literary merit as I perceive it.    Vast portions of the book, and especially the intermitable first half, is devoted to three things:    First, the intensity of SEAL training. The intent was clearly to demonstrate the rigors and effort needed to achieve placement with the SEALs, and the team work that is so important to their operating success. However, its repetitiveness, minutia of detail and hyperbole,that went on page after page became almost a cliche.  The sand, the pain, the cold, the discomfort, the stress, the exhustion and the high pressure sprays, etc., etc., ... yes, I got it the first nine times it was stressed over what seemed like fifty some odd pages. Certainly if you are planning to become a SEAL, you'd want to know this.  But to the casual reader it had the effect of becoming so redundant as to make one wonder if the story would ever progress to the meat of the book's intent.       Second, PO Luttrell's obsession with and constant focus on the \\"liberal media\\" as though it was some vast conspiracy to undermine him and his fellow SEAL team members became tedious.  It was mentioned in almost every chapter like a littany.  Luttrell's admiration for President Bush as a \\"great president\\" (so HE'S the one who thinks so), his ultra conservative view point, and his irrational distrust of the media in general consumes him. It becomes a subtheme to the story, and the liberal media is subtley (or not so subtley) made the scapegoat for the tragic outcome of this mission.  He never does place the blame directly on the media, but neither does he ever explain that the tragic result of this horrendus military debacle, which is what it was, falls solidly on  an ill planned, poorly conceived operation by the US military in general, and the SEAL Command specifically.   Indeed, he goes so far as to first claim he voted against killing three goat herdsmen who stumble across the Team's position because of his \\"Christian\\" morality and ethics.  Then later goes on to blame his ultimate decision to let them go free on his fear of the \\"lefties\\", the liberal media's likely demonization, later wishing he had killed them.  So which was it: his \\"Christian\\" upbringing, or his fear of the media that prevented him from killing three presumed noncombatants?       As far as his objection to and rant over the ROE (Rules of Engagement).  Every war, every operation has ROE.  It's a fact of military /combat reality, has been for a long time. No, they aren't designed to hamper your mission, or specifically endanger your life, in order to placate the \\"liberal media\\", as Luttrell comes close to attesting.  They are there to prevent wholesale disregard for civilian life, whose good will and \\"hearts and minds\\" are as important to win as is winning a specific battle. Without ROE then \\"spray and pray\\" becomes the ROE by default, and results in a free fire zone, a killing field of civilians, exactly the tactic less civilized, less respected foes embrace.     BUT, if faced with a potential life or death situation, where NOT breaking the ROE represents a clear and present danger, then one breaks them and faces the Code of Military Justice with the expectation that their actions and the circumstances that caused them will be understood and supported.  But evidently PO Luttrell prefers to just blame the existence of ROE, and the liberal media, for the disasterous outcome of his mission.        Third, and finally, the never ending list of people upon whom he heaps the superlative's of awesome, great, wonderful, finest, one of a kind, the best,  etc. etc. became another cliche.  It permeates every chapter and takes up lots of print. It reads as though it were somehow meaningful to the reader to learn the names of every human, civilian or military, that ever bestowed a kindness on him during his entire life, or with whom he and his parents ever came into contact. Tedious.       The best discription I could apply to the wrting style is \\"sophomoric\\".  I don't fault Leading Petty Officer Luttrell for this, he is clearly not a polished author.  The fault rests with Patrick Robinson, his ghost writer. Cutsie little asides to the reader like \\"blah, blah, blah ... RIGHT?\\" Or, \\"Sorry Lefties!\\", while perhaps intended to be earthy and give the author a down home unpretentious persona, simply makes it appear unpolished, and almost comic bookish. I was embarrassed for him.    Bottom line, Very disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any serious student of military history or sophisticated reader of nonfiction.  If you're young and thinking about wanting to join the SEALs, you'd probably get alot out of it.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" (2007) is a fun, well-crafted action thriller, the third installment in the Jason Bourne spy saga.  Once again, Matt Damon excels as an amnesiac, government-manufactured super-assassin -- his performance is in many ways minimalistic, but the minute responses and micro-expressions that pass across his face speak volumes.  The film is fast-paced and consistently enthralling, with highly stylized editing and cinematography that help put a new look on some now-familiar situations in the spy-thriller genre.  There are chase scenes, and hide-in-a-crowd shenanigans, control-room screen-watching and lots of well-placed, unnerving cell phone calls, but it is the fragmentary visual presentation that gives this film its unique feel, and that keeps the audience as off-balance as Bourne's pursuers.<br /><br />Minutes after you finish watching this film, after you catch your breath, you'll realize that the plot was pretty flimsy -- although the assassins that are sent after Bourne are refreshingly lethal and efficient, David Strathairn's big bad-guy, CIA Deputy Director character folds like a deck of cards in the end, and Bourne's psychological revelation when he gets his memory back is kind of anticlimactic. But the action's the star here, and the brutal duel between Bourne and a rival agent named Desh is one of the most tautly choreographed, lethal fight scenes in modern cinema history.  So, are we ready for Bourne 4?  Heck, yeah.  Bring it on!  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)

B00005JPTI|3.0|I know this will come as a disappointment to the millions of night dwellers willing to risk crowded roads and over priced tickets in order to see this movie, but sadly I Am Legend does not live up to its hype. The third movie release of Richard Matheson's horror classic, [[ASIN:0765357151 I Am Legend]], this film stars Will Smith as a former military officer living in New York City in the year 2012, three years after a deadly virus created to cure cancer mutated and decimated the worlds population, killing 90% of all human beings and transforming almost everyone else into blood thirsty zombie/vampire like creatures called \\"night dwellers\\" who come out only at night because UV rays from the sun burn their skin.<br /><br />Will Smith is the last man on earth, his only companion being his family dog named Samantha, or Sam for short, and manikins at the movie rental store that he likes to talk to. He goes though the \\"Cast Away\\" effect, like Tom Hank's character tries to remain sane by talking to a volleyball, Will Smith talks to manikins. the most stunning aspect of this film is the city itself; a deserted Time Square, overgrown with weeds and taken over by deer and escaped lions, is pretty creepy but unfortunately for this film 28 Days Later outdid it years ago with its deserted London, shot on location without using special effects. Anybody familiar with zombie movies have seen dozens of deserted cities as good or better before, whether it is from the 28 series or Romero's Living Dead series. I Am Legend, although impressive, is hardly groundbreaking in this area.<br /><br />while the city effects are good, the main focus of this movie is how Will Smith deals with being the last man left alive. a military man at heart, he goes though a rigid routine every day, exercising with his dog in the morning, working in his lab trying to find a cure, making his radio broadcast at noon and hoping someone will answerer, and then spending the rest of the day hunting and gathering supplies. At night, when the night dwellers roam the streets, he returns home where his home transforms into a fortress, and falls asleep in the bathtub. Then, next day, he does the same thing. his tests for a cure drive him to seek out human specimens every now and then, so like in Romero's [[ASIN:B00008G8L9 Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition)]] he captures zombies, brings them into his basement, and tries to cure them, more often killing them then helping.<br /><br />Unfortunately the movie never has a real sense of focus. does it want to be a character drama that keeps the zombies in the background and highlights the characters loneliness and despair like Night of the Living Dead, or does it want to be a classic shoot em up zombie movie like Resident Evil or 28 Weeks Later? It never makes up its mind, and in the end does both poorly. there isn't enough character depth to make this a great character drama, for that it needed to be at least twenty if not thirty minutes longer, and it doesn't have anywhere near enough action to make it a shoot out film; actually there is very little in the way of action. Social commentary is none existent as well, giving this film absolutely nothing to set it apart from other zombie/horror/virus movies from this year, or any other year. its lack of originality and depth makes almost guarantees this movie to go the way of other I Am Legend movie adoptions [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] and [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]].

That in its essence is the story of this mega movie that was so popular on its original release .It would have worked equally well ,30 years earlier for ,say Paula Prentiss and Rock Hudson .This time out the sex is raunchier than it would have been in an earlier era ,the language a lot spicier and they would not have had the nudity which appears in Pretty Woman back then .Suprisingly-given the title -there is more male nudity than female -perhaps one reason the picture was popular with the feminist critics .    What makes this movie work as well as it does is the skill and style of all the ingredients in the mix.Roberts is simply adorable while Gere reveals an hitherto unsuspected gift for light romantic comedy .The two stars are backed by a strong suporting cast including Laura San Giacomo as Gere's girlfriend ,Hector Elizondo as the manager of the hotel in which much of the action takes place ,Jason Alexander as Gere's slimy attorney and a shrewd cameo from Patrick Richwood as the night elevator operator ,eyes practically out on stalks as he takes in what is going on before his eyes.  Add to this the hit strewn  soundtrack ,some polished direction from Garry Marshall , a perky script rich in good lines from J Lawson and you have a \\"Beverly Hills Cinderella meets Pygmalion \\" yarn that is given more plausibility than it perhaps deserves     This is a polished rom-com that ,providing you can accept the basic premise and ignore its profanity and nudity ,will entertain royally
1400079276|3.0|Despite what some people are saying, Murakami is no Kakfa, Camus, Sartre, Mann, Hesse, Beckett, etc. He tries to grapple with some of the same issues as these literary greats -- i.e. the subconscious, other Freudian and Jungian concepts, absurdism, \\"fate\\", free will, responsibility, the nature of morality, etc. -- but he does so at a level that is really not that deep or complex. Which probably accounts for the his wide popularity and acceptance...    My take on Kafka on the Shore is that the book is sort of like Harry Potter for adults. Its plot is interesting enough, bizarre enough, and clever enough to keep you hooked. Murakami deserves credit for that. The book, as John Updike said in his review in the New Yorker, is \\"a real page-turner.\\"    But I really doubt that the book is also, as Updike puts it, a \\"metaphysical mind-bender.\\" Murakami deals with issues from philosophy and psychology that are in fact very interesting (if somewhat outdated). But his writing doesn't take us much further or deeper into these issues than, say, a pretty good undergraduate paper would. By contrast, truly great works of literature do, I think, grapple with philosophical and psychological issues with the same level of insight, complexity, and sophistication that the great works of philosophy and psychology do.     Sure, Murakami is an entertaining writer. But let's not get carried away in comparing him to some of the greatest writers of all time. He writes, plain and simple, what some critics are calling \\"pop literature\\". Certainly, there's room in the publishing world for all sorts of writers, especially in this day and age when there is a growing demand for literature that is highly entertaining and easily accessible. And it doesn't hurt that Murakami's work (like so many of Charlie Kaufman's movies...) leaves a lot of readers feeling smart, philosophical, and \\"deep\\" for having read his work. Just because his work can engender such feelings in the reader, however, doesn't mean that the work itself possesses these characteristics.     So Murakami is no intellectual giant. Big deal. This book is still entertaining, and if that's what you're looking for, Kafka on the Shore will take you for a pretty fun ride. If you want \\"deep\\" philosophical insights or complex psychology, you won't find it here.    In summary, Murakami is to \\"real\\" philosophy/psychology as McCullough is to \\"real\\" history. But, hey, the masses love McCullough. And they seem to love Murakami, too. And in the publishing world, that's what really matters, not  what a few intellectual snobs up in the Ivory Tower think.
0061142026|4.0|Stardust, by Neil Gaiman, is a tremendously fun and well written fairy tale. This is a fun book with a story featuring witches, poison, betrayals, magic, romance, and a lot of fun.  This is a very enjoyable read by a gifted author.
1401300901|5.0|this book is amazing, I recently lost my Husband and I swear that the same things that she experienced I have been feeling.
0060557818|5.0|Neverwhere, by the ultra-talented Neil Gaiman, was my first experience with the author's work.  I could not be more impressed.  This is a fantastic tale full of memorable characters; some of which could have stepped right out of a Charles Dicken's novel.  When everyman or anyman Richard Mayhew decides to help a hurt young homeless [looking] girl, he embarks on a magical journey into the area known as London Below.  There he meets Door and a variety of interesting chracters including Rat Speakers and a couple of dedicated sadistic assassins.  The book is part heroic quest, part fantasy, part satire, part mystery, but all fun.  I highly recommend this novel.  I anxiously look forward to discovering more of the author's work.  5 Stars!!!!!
B00000IMTG|4.0|As I consider this record is worthy of being on many: \\"Best Of\\" lists. Best: \\"Live\\" album, Best: \\"Live Album of the 1970's\\", Best: \\"Live Hard Rock\\" Album, Etc,Etc. This double record, had more room on the four sides of those records to fit more songs from the 1976 concert on it. I was lucky enough to see a show from the Summer 1976, \\"Rainbow Over America\\" tour at the Berkeley Community Theater. And, as I have always been big about this album, as one of the very greats. But, when it is compared to the concert I attended in Berkeley, here on this CD, you are only getting about HALF the show.<br /><br />The epic version of: \\"Stargazer\\" {with drum solo by Cozy and the big explosion in that solo} is not here. That was by far one of the highlights of this amazing show. \\"Black Sheep Of The Family\\" was far better than it's studio counterpart {not included as well}. \\"Do You Close Your Eyes\\" {where is that?}. 31 years is indeed a long time, and as I don't remember everything from that night, I do know that the 1976 show was 2 Hours in length, and lot's more of that show could and should be presented here to tell the complete story.<br /><br />Still, this is one of the very best live recordings ever released, but if there was a CD that needed a: \\"Deluxe/Expanded Edition\\", of 2 CD's to be released: \\"On Stage\\" should be at the top of that list.<br />Any fan of: Ritchie, Tony, Cozy, Ronnie James and Jimmy, should already own this monster, but there is more that needs to be heard!<br />Four Stars !!!
B000R7GKQE|4.0|One of my favourite tv series for the last two years, and the best supernatural series ever made.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.      Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.    Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called \\"Light in the Black\\".      For Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way \\"Iron Man\\" is Black Sabbath's classic.      Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's \\"Snowblind\\".      Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.    Escape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyricsby their standards too.    Creeping Death- another memorable heavy/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.      Call of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.      You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it.
B000XB5WHW|4.0|I got this for my sister for her birthday, she enjoyed the CD, overall, there were the better songs and some filler songs. (Anything you can expect from a typical cd) She liked it though so thats her two cents for any Amazonians.
B000008GAC|1.0|Did you know these guys copied the main guitar riff from the Black Sabbath song \\"Zero the Hero\\" and used it for \\"Paradise City?\\"  Don't believe me?  Just buy Sabbath's Born Again album and read the inside notes.  All the information you need to know is mentioned right there in the notes.  The other two hits by Guns N' Roses are just overplayed, unmemorable rock songs that seriously copied what Aerosmith was doing back in the mid 70's with the dirty, speedy rock sound.  I don't sense a hint of originality anywhere.  I don't sense any good music anywhere on the Appetite for Destruction album either.  So why is it so popular?  It's not a classic by any stretch of the imagination.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|The collection is great.  The DVD of his concerts and videos is the best entertainment if you can't be there.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Although the film can seem dry as it really is a lecture in global warming, it's content is something that should be viewed by all.  This is not a bipartisan issue.  We are all citizens of the earth.  I certainly was inspired to change my behavior based on this documentary and more importantly to educate our children on how to be less wasteful than our generation has been.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is pure magic.  I've always liked Neil Gaiman's work but this one is special even among his masterpieces.  It plays out like a typical fantasy tale without the typical children's cushioning that subtracts from it's adult appeal.  It is fun, fantastic, whimsical, and humorous.  I would recommend this movie for anyone over the age of 12.  Excellent for couples to watch together.      Also if you like this movie you really should check out [[ASIN:B000BT97AO Mirrormask]].  It was also written by Gaiman and has a very fairy tale feel to it too, though a very different one.
B000VR824S|5.0|Excellent video! Great to see Johnny Winter, Jeff Beck, and the rest of the company of \\"journeymen\\". The new bands are very good. I like what Clapton is doing for the Blues genre. He is helping keep the tradition going and giving new groups a venue to strut their stuff.

B000JLTRIG|5.0|I have been a fan of Charmed from the start, and eagerly looked forward to getting this season and the next.  There were a few slow episodes that were largely to build plot, but that aside, I enjoyed this season very much.
0446577391|5.0|I have no idea why but I just love this little rag tag group keeping an eye on the lunatics in the White House.  I love the secret places Oliver keeps his arsenol of information.  I wasn't too happy about them taking up with a circus carny girl -- she adds nothing to the story and can't be a love interest because she is too young for these old coots.  However, she does have $$$ which helps them out of some tight spots.  This latest adventure was Ok but Oliver was too kind to the killer when he found out who he was.  I was also sorry one of the group is no longer part of the group -- I wasn't expecting that.  Now that carny girl has gussied up Oliver's cottage with frilly girl things I hope Oliver doesn't lose his rough edges that keep him so invisible.  I felt like I was being reunited with old friends reading this book -- I can't wait for the next one.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have been a fan from the start of this series.  The characters are incredibly complex, and ever-evolving.  I was very sad to see the show end, but I suppose everything has to come to an end sometime.  I won't give away any of the plot in case you haven't watched it yet, so it's hard to say much, but die hard fans of the show will really enjoy this last season, even though some things don't end up quite as we had hoped they would.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I was not prepared for the deep impact this film left me with. The effects this film will have on me, will resonate with my every move. There is not a single human being on this planet that does not need to see this film. I cried, I giggled, and I changed my ways forever...
B000006SGT|5.0|This is awesome!!!!<br />If you have ever thought about checking out The Animals, I have to say I definately reccomend this. This is an imported disc, but if you have stumbled into this room, be glad... I never saw this one before just recently, and I wish I had found it a long time ago. Animals albums are virtually non-existant in this day and age, all we are left with are countless of best of packages...or...I should say, countless of rip off best of packages made by fly by night record companies that somehow got ahold of a couple of the bands rights way back in the day...(somehow the original members make absolutely no money on these recordings, but the rest of the industry all gets a little peice)<br />This two disc collection is by far the most competent one I have seen so far. Formely I would have sent you in a different direction, but never mind that now. This is two discs of what I believe may really be the complete recordings of the ORIGINAL line-up of The Animals (pretty much all of the others save room for the 67-70 San Fransisco line-up, which isn't bad, but is a little too hippy'd out. The original 62-65 lineup has way more balls)...<br />Besides HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN, which is the song that turns everybody on to the band, most of their material varies in style, between blues, scat beat, hand jive and early R&B. I initially was in it for the eerie tunes in the vain of House, but quickly became a fan of all their early years stuff. These guys are one of my all time favorite bands, and this collection has stuff that I never found until now. Any hit track you could possibly be looking for as a new fish will be here, as well as a slew of other greats. PLUS even as a two disc import, it's still cheaper than the one disc set that is currently available in the U.S! Get this!
0143038095|5.0|This is another excellent book by Amy Tan.  I had heard about it for years, but had never read it. I finally read it because I thought her book, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, was one of the best books I have ever read.  I was not disappointed by this book.  It inspired me to read another of her books, Dragon Bones, which I am currently reading.    I am impressed with the details that Amy Tan includes in her books, which make them better stories and more enjoyable to read.  In this respect, she brings to mind Ha Jin and his book, Waiting, which is such a compelling novel that I read it twice in the same month.  The little details about Chinese culture and emotions awaken the mind to another world, but one in which we find there are people just like ourselves.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This was quite a great soundtrack that upon first hearing, really... REALLY opened my ears up to the different styles of music contained within. Wally Gator never dreamed he would enjoy a bluegrass tune or a lot of the old timey kind of music so much before he was introduced to this disc.<br />My overall favorite performance is the one with Alison Krauss and Emmylou Harris, DIDNT LEAVE NOBODY BUT THE BABY. Such a haunting and yet extremely sexy song (when performed in the movie, even more so... the three ladies walk out of the lake in those white nightgowns) and really turned me onto the idea of sexy ladies singing lullabyes... oh yeah! But there are other great old fashioned songs on here done extremely well like the rendition of I'LL FLY AWAY and MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW. Not to mention songs that I remember from being a little kid like BIG ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN, done up in a little more of a grown up way... lyrics in tact,  nothing to dirty or provocative, but plenty of hints...still something acceptable to play with the kids in the car.<br />I'm sure this stuff is not for everybody, but this disc really opened me up to a lot of great old timey music. It wasn't all the hokeyness I had always thought it was. Several artists from the thirties and forties played music that is really strong even today. I am still amazed though at how quickly this album went to the top of the charts. Nobody has really had as much success with tributing this era of music since...? Oh well. Guess thats what makes this one stand out. I really got a kick out of the movie too, even though it had George Clooney in it.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It was marketed poorly - aiming at graphic novel fans instead of political progressives, who can see it for the 1984-ish work it is.  I like the movie version; the musical score really brings it to life.  It is scarily applicable to the current political situation in the U.S....and massively entertaining.  Five stars!
0440238609|5.0|so many \\"readers\\" who are writing reviews (I use quotes because many of these reviews are written by people who obviously have never read the books...) have the misconception that God was killed in this series.     Not only was the being known as the Authority not God.. He was never killed.    The Authority was a Angel, the first Angel to gain conciousness who had at one point tried to gain power by calling himself falsely the creator.    He was imprisioned by Metatron (who is known in religious texts as the voice of god) who in this series is another Angel who once had been a man.    Once the children release him from his prison he joyfully discorporates into Dust.. wich in the book is like life essence.. the spirit diffused into the universe to become a part of everything else.    This is hardly murder, more like a prison break. The Angel who was once man is then Dragged into the Abyss by the girls parents who sacrifice themselves to save her.    I think what the Author is trying to say is that if there was once a being who wrote the Bible, or rather dictated it to humans then this being was captive by humanity who has used this set of Ideas to hold all of us captive within the power of the church. You say that pre-marital sex is evil? Ok well then we should shun, punish, stone to death anyone who has it. Why? God said so. So now the church has the right to dictate who has comitted sins, and who descides whats a sin? the church does.. just look at the right to life murderers who bomb clinics.. the Church says its evil, so they carry out the sentence.    Dont forget that the only beings killed in this series were mortal.     Now this is just one small part of the stories, please dont feel that im simplifying everything to this one issue. But I have been reading reviews here and it seems like the con is mostly about how the Author kills God, or about how children will be corrupted.    Personally I feel that if you are raising your children in a insulated bubble where you try to keep their eyes averted to everything you dont believe in... then they will have one hell of a time once they get to college meet other people with other ideas and start to think for themselves.    Stop trying to force your children to think exactly like you do..  and stop telling me what you think is safe for me to give to mine.    I never would have found these books if it wasnt for the controversy though... so thank you for publicizing them so well :)
B000RZIGYU|4.0|I'm a big fan of John Woo, so i allready owned \\"Face Off\\" on DVD, but without any extra's. I was happy to hear that it was coming out on HD DVD, and ordered it. The improvement was very clear, a crystal clear picture and fantastic sound. The extra's are also worthwile(mostly on disc 2), some very good insight's into the movie, and very interesting interviews with the cast and crew. Very hard not to like!!!
B0000019PA|5.0|I never would have stumbled on this, my new favorite CD, if not for the 0 degrees of separation fostered by online reviews. A guy from Texas who reviewed a book of mine also reviewed this CD. I loved his description of the music's \\"cathartic energy and abandon,\\" ordered the CD, and am very glad I did.<br /><br />It's always hard to describe music but I'd say the strains I hear in here come from all over the place: Celtic bagpipes, Herb Albert-style horns, spare alt-country strumming, carnival fun-house mirror riffs, musical saws, and what sounds like crickets. But it all holds together like a wired-up old car with a clanky throaty hum coming from the engine.<br /><br />The vocals are kind of hard and flat and painful, in the best possible way. If Jeff Mangum ever took singing lessons he did the right thing and forgot everything he ever learned. It sounds like he HAS to sing, no two ways about it. His straining to go higher or louder makes the limitations of his voice all the more evident, but it also somehow makes the songs better -- deeper and with more of an edge. He's also an inspired and highly poetic lyricist - if I started quoting I wouldn't stop until I'd transcribed half the album.<br /><br />I'll indulge in just one utterly subjective analogy: Listening to these songs is like hearing a eulogy that's so  raw and poetic and elliptical it makes you smile to be still drawing breath.
0440418569|3.0|I just finished Amber Spyglass and am amazed at all the inconsistencies and the plot threads that were completely dropped in the final volume of the trilogy.    *MAJOR SPOILERS*    Worst offenders:    - The significance of the subtle knife. Wasn't the whole point that mankind made a knife that could cut ANYTHING, including God himself, therefore making it the only thing in existence that could kill the Authority?  But in Amber Spyglass the old guy just kind of fades away getting out of bed! WHAT?!?!!    - Wasn't there something about Mary tempting Lyra? About Lyra being Eve and leading the world into a second fall? Where did that plot point go?    - Then there's the overall inconsistency with Pullman's claim that there is no god even though he frequently relies on the use of \\"external authorities\\" as needed. First there's that prophesy about Lyra and prophesies, by their very nature, imply some kind of force of fate or larger intelligence behind existence.  Then he says that grace let Lyra read the alithiometer until her task was done, indicating some third party was steering events. He also quotes heavily from the bible, even citing Paul's reference to a difference between the spirit and the soul (or something like that) as if since Paul referred to it in the bible that legitimizes the concept when it shows up in Amber Spyglass.  Finally we have the random female angel at the end who shows up as some kind of omni sentient being that dictates to Will and Lyra exactly what needs to be done.    These are just some of the ways Pullman squandered what the first two books had set up to be a very exciting, epic adventure.  Add to that the insertion of all-too-convenient technology (quantum bombs and intention machines), awkward and pretty much pointless sub-plots for Mary, Lyra and Will, and a seemingly sadistic desire to force a tragic ending the lead characters... I have to say this is one of the biggest letdowns to a series I have read in quite awhile.
0307237702|4.0|In his book Barack lays out his opinions on a wide range of issues, not pandering and trying to impress anyone, but just telling things the way he sees it.  Obviously people will give this book negative reviews because of their political bias (most of them haven't touched the book).  Anyways, I am impressed with Barack's willingness to lay it all out on the line, and take a stance on what he believes.  Admittedly, the book is a little dry and slow in parts, but the man is a US Senator, presidential hopeful and a father, he doesn't have time to fluff it up for everyone.  So, if you have some interest in what Obama really has to say, not what you are fed in the main stream media, pick it up and give it a look, you might be suprised.

0684830515|3.0|Because if you do, you won't be able to stop laughing.  I made the serious, serious mistake of reading Boston's November 29, 1998 review before I read the book, and so when I finally did read the book I noted every time \\"drink,\\" \\"wine,\\" \\"bottle,\\" \\"bar,\\" \\"cafe,\\" \\"coffee,\\" \\"breakfast,\\" \\"lunch,\\" \\"dinner\\" and their variations appeared, and son of a gun if they really weren't on almost every page.  Every time I came across one of the words I'd start laughing, making it very difficult to concentrate on the book, which is mainly an extended low level whine about how screwed up everyone was after the Great War.<br /><br />Seriously, Hemingway shows some flashes of brilliance, but ironically for me they didn't occur with style or even theme, but rather with extremely vivid, stripped down descriptions of the Spanish countryside and such activities as fishing and bullfighting.  If you want to read the book for that, you're not going to be disappointed.  But if you're expecting action and character development, por el amor de Dios, look elsewhere.
0765318741|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am  HUGE Richard Matheson fan....you know...the guy who WROTE \\"I Am Legend\\". Of course you do, everyone does. Ok, maybe not, but if you read the book, you would come to respect that man like many of us who have...<br /><br />To start with Will Smith was awesome. and thats about the only good part of the Movie. What it comes down to is the whole point of the story was forsaken for a typical \\"hollywood happy ending\\". The whole point of the BOOK, was far from that and the last line is \\"I Am Legend\\". Well guess what...sorry, hollywood missed that. \\"This was the story of Robert Neville and his Legend\\", doesn't even come close. I don't want to ruin the book for you, all I can say is this...it is truly amazing and hits the heart and makes you think.<br /><br />This movie was as bad as \\"The Village\\" by M. Night Shayamalamamamadingdong. In fact, it reminded me of parts of that plot.<br /><br />and then we have the \\"lets not call them, but they may as well be, Vampires\\"....well, it may as well haev been The Incredible Mr.Limpit....you know...that movie with Don Knotts and the cartoon fish? Or better yet, lets just say all the non-Vampire-Vampires were Imhotep from the mummy...but not when he is first formed, like a bad cartoon version of Uncle Frank from Hellraiser...I mean when is is just about Human...still a CGI extra from Beowulf, YEAH...that crap.<br /><br />ENOUGH WITH THE frigING CGI. PLEASE. ENOUGH. YOU GUYS SUCK AT IT. IT HARDLY EVER WORKS.<br /><br />moving on...As much as I liked Smith's performance and had to hold myself back from shouting out \\"WELCOME TO ERF\\" or \\"DON'T YOU SHOOT THAT GREEN crap AT ME\\", he did his damnedest to say \\"hey world, I am just as good as tom hanks in Castaway, I swear...no frig you, really, i friging mean it\\". And he was. Wilson was replaced by a dog and manikins. oh so clever and funny. cocksmokers. This was almost as bad as \\"The Omega Man\\" with Chuck Heston. Which was another poor adaption of this story.<br /><br />No matter how badly i want to ruin the end of this movie for all of you, i wont. I am done with spoiling crap for people. Just go waste your money on a movie that blows penises by the dozen.....\\"36....no 37 including you\\", yeah THAT many. Puts Dante's (clerks) girlfriend to shame. Please just read the book and save your money. I promise you we can talk about it and pretend it was a movie if that will make you feel better.

1416911049|3.0|The first sentence of this book nearly lost me.  \\"The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit?\\"  I nearly missed the very decent prose of the next paragraph because I was still reeling from the shock of that first line.  I mean, if you want to use a metaphor to evoke color, please use something that has a definite color.  Might as well have said the sky was the color of a smelly beach towel.<br /><br />By the end of the first page I realized that \\"cat vomit\\" had nothing to do with the sky but was more a metaphor for how the point of view character felt about life in general.  It isn't hard to see why she feels wretched.  She's been waiting all her life for the operation that will make her pretty: gorgeous features, perfect body shape, big beautiful eyes, so that she can look like all of the other sixteen-year-olds and join them in their eternal pretty party across the river.  Right now she feels ugly and petulant, and has nothing better to do than sneak out and break the rules by trying to find her best friend, who already turned pretty and lives in that other glittering world she is waiting to join.<br /><br />Then she meets someone else, someone who isn't sure that turning pretty is all it's cracked up to be.  Pretty soon our heroine is entangled in intrigues, underground resistances, espionage, betrayal, and even gets to do a little smooching on the way.<br /><br />The book is full of interesting ideas.  Hoverboards are REALLY COOL.  I wish I had one.  The issues of body image and judging people on looks are dealt with in a thought provoking manner, and there's also some environmentalism and remarks on the evils of totalitarianism thrown in there.  I enjoy Westerfeld's prose, direct and colorful.  He is endlessly inventive with his imaginary technology, and the world he has created is interesting to consider as a fable if not entirely believable as a possible future.<br /><br />On the other hand, it wasn't a deeply satisfying read.  The constant hair-breadth escapes are fun at first, but eventually grow tedious.  By the end I wasn't even paying attention to how they \\"got out of that one.\\"  I knew the author would contrive some way for them to manage it.  The characters all seemed a little thick: good guys, bad guys, everyone seems to be thinking far too little about what's going on and what they really ought to do about it.  The pacing in the middle was so slow I put the book down for a whole week. The second half did draw me along well enough, but at the end I was once again questioning everyone's competence.<br /><br />It was a good book, don't get me wrong.  It was well worth reading, but it had some problems.  Nothing really offended me, but younger children wouldn't understand a lot of the issues.  I recommend it for ages ten and up.ventually grow tedious.

B000F8O4DQ|5.0|A New World Record is the album that made ELO a Super-Group of the 1970's  A Classic Album by Jeff Lynne and ELO at the height of their artistic abilities. I wore the record out playing it so much, great to have a remastered CD with a lot of extras and great input from Lynne.
B000J4QWM2|1.0|To say \\"Miami Vice\\" is a disappointment would be an understatement. A blonde Colin Farrell is hopelessly miscast - not to mention unlikeable - in Don Johnson's old role. He spends most of the film trying to be \\"cool\\" but his performance descends into parody. Jamie Foxx is OK but has little to do. Combined with an incomprehensible plot the fun drains away pretty quickly in this film.<br /><br />The man (Michael Mann) who brought us good films like \\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\" has laid an egg here.
B00005JPNW|4.0|Story: B+  Special Effects: A+  Music: B+  Acting: A+  Overall: B+    GREAT acting and cast choice. Newcomer Dakota Blue Richards was excellent as Lyra. Nicole Kidman was also great. Daniel Craig and Eva Green were good too, even though they were each in it for a whopping 10 minutes.     I am disappointed with the ending. I am a huge fan of the books, and I loved the ending to the first book and looked forward to seeing it on screen. However, it was cut out. It will hopefully be the beginning of the second movie. The Golden Compass ended right after the battle, and it ends even before she gets to Lord Asriel to bring him what he needs. I wish it had gotten a little farther. I wouldn't have minded an extra half hour added onto the less than 2 hour movie.    Special effects were fantastic. The bear fight was phenomenal. The Ice Palace looked pretty cool, too. The Alethiometer was portrayed in a pretty cool way, and I loved how Lyra's world looked. The daemons were awesome.    The movie felt rushed to me. One minute Lyra is on the Gyptian ships, then she is suddenly up north and meeting with Iorek. The battle scenes could've lasted longer, especially the final battle scene. The acting was great, but Daniel Craig and Eva Green didn't have enough time to get to their full acting ability.     Overall, a great movie whether you've read the book or not. If you haven't read the book, I think you will enjoy this movie more. If you have, I think you'll find the movie entertaining and cool to finally see the book on screen, but you'll be disappointed with the ending. B+.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Dune  DVD<br /><br />Dune is based on Frank Herbert's Science Fiction Classic by that name.  Dune was an allegory for the Arab Oil embargo.  If you substitute the House of Saud for the House Harkonnen you get a pretty good fit.<br /><br />Anyhow Dune revolves around the flow of \\"Spice\\".  It is full of action and evil villains.  It is a movie that you'll want to watch over and over again.  It is too bad that Hollywood hasn't seen fit to make a sequel or two which follow Herbert's books.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Science Fiction and Frank Herbert.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2007
B000IJNGAO|4.0|This was a great deal.  Cheap.  No problems.  Still has the booklet.  Good stuff!
0143038419|1.0|Not completely uninteresting but surprisingly disappointing. This book may put me off bestsellers for good--my natural inclination anyhow. So many missed opportunities to explore in depth some of these fascinating subjects, especially involving religion and spirituality. The author never really uses her lively mind to engage with the questions posed by the various religions she encounters, opting instead for what sounds like a pretty glib relativism. She skims the surface of these subjects in a trendy prose style, and her basic stance is familiar and predictable.<br /><br />And the extreme wordiness! Many times she's chewing on more than she's bitten off! Too often the result comes across as tiresome, self-absorbed, and superficial. But not altogether unappealing. She just needs to gain greater discipline in her thinking and writing and to attempt greater depth.<br /><br />At the end, though, I couldn't discern why anyone should be interested in this person's life or this writer's thoughts.

B000TGJ8IU|5.0|I wouldn't say I'm a \\"Troy\\" fan, I'm not. I simply like this movie like many more in my collection, in which dialogues or even some phrases spoken by heroes make those movies written in my heart (in \\"Troy\\" it is the dialogue between King Priam and Achilles. Simply Brilliant!) I had the theatrical version which I like a lot, but now I decided to improve it and ordered this Ultimate Collector's Edition.    I am satisfied with what I received in the box. Not only the improved and extended version of the movie makes it worth buying, but the additional set of wonderful picture cards, album with movie art, excerpts from the script, revealing some nuances of the \\"new\\" material of the movie, and, of course, excellent packaging.     As for the negative aspects of this edition (although those didn't affect my maximal 5-star rating) I noticed some gaps and freezing of the picture between different parts of Bonus Materials. Later I got the idea (techie stuff follows): some materials (chosen from sub-menu) are presented as one DVD title with several chapters set on it, others are all different titles! Strange but all transitions (even from chapter to chapter within one title when Played-All) experience the above-mentioned problems. I tried both on my DVD player and PC DVD-ROM - same result. Thanks Goodness, movie plays fine!    To conclude myself, if one is a \\"Troy\\" fan, then this is a perfect addition to the old edition. If one is looking only for the movie then I would suggest to buy regular version of the Director's Cut.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was slightly hesitant to buy this product after reading the reviews, but I'm so glad I did. First of all, you can't beat the discounted price that Amazon sells this product for (compared to $300 from HBO). Yes, I agree with other reviews that the box set is large and doesn't fit with the rest of my DVD's...OF COURSE IT IS!! It's holding 20 DVD's...it's going to be a large case! DUH!So that's absolutely nothing to complain about in my opinion.  I've noticed no scratches on any of my discs and my case was not cracked or damaged when I received it. Amazon had it packed in a cardboard case within the delivery box, so it shipped safely. I am definitely a satisfied customer.  This is one of my favorite shows and I'm looking forward to hosting many Sex & the City Party Nights!
0446577391|5.0|Two themes run through this latest tale of the Camel Club.  Annabelle Conroy is being hunted by the ruthless casino owner she conned out of $40 million in The Collectors and Oliver Stone and the rest of the \\"Club\\" set out to protect her.  Meanwhile, Oliver (John Carr in a former life) is haunted by his past as someone is murdering members of his CIA killing team and history comes home to roost, endangering him as well.<br /><br />The story, while wildly entertaining and well-told, is to a large extent far-fetched.  Of course, the author is entitled to use literary license to rewrite history and exaggerate conspiracies in high places, which is at the heart of the novel, at least as far as the Oliver Stone part is concerned.  It's too bad that these reservations can't be revealed, since they would give away the plot.<br /><br />Will there be a follow-up to \\"Stone Cold?\\"  I certainly hope so.

B000Y179KO|5.0|There are 20 tracks on the standard edition of this album and 22 tracks on the deluxe edition, making this Eagles album a good value as compared to some CD albums having fewer than 10 songs. Long Road Out Of Eden is probably one of the better produced Eagles albums in terms of sound quality, it does sound very good on a home stereo or in a car. If you are an Eagles fan, you won't feel as if there are only 1 or 2 good songs on this 2-CD album. If you're not such a big fan of the Eagles you will not be missing out on much if you don't purchase this album. The songs on this album are not the same kind or type of songs as the 1970s Eagles classics are (Hotel California, etc). I recommend this Eagles album to Eagles fans, I recommend another Eagles CD \\"[[ASIN:B000000OU0 Hell Freezes Over]]\\" if you want to get someone an Eagles gift for their music collection.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|(Note: This review was written in October 2006 and is being moved here since the other AMOLAD was taken off amazon or something, I don't quite know honestly.)<br /><br />I will start this off by saying that if Iron Maiden weren't my favorite band, I'd probably give this album a four, but I love this album so much more than that so I can't settle for a four.<br /><br />People seem very divided about this album. I personally think that it is stronger than Dance of Death and equal to Brave New World, though completely different from it. The production is the perfect sound for Maiden, many people complain about it but honestly I think it works perfectly for the album and for the band. It is similar to the sound they had on albums like Piece of Mind, the bass is loud and in your face, the guitars scream when necessary, and the drumming is powerful.<br /><br />As for the song writing, I believe that there is truth to the fact that the intros can get tiresome. Still, I think that all of the intros are appropriate EXCEPT on The Longest Day, which could have been cut in half. Still, Maiden (and Harris in particularly) has always been about giving you something good and then giving you more of it then you need, excess excess excess. I personally think that this works for them and the lyrical content of the songs, the music fits all of this pretty perfectly. Many people are comparing the album to Seventh Son of a Seventh Son but I would say it's more like The X Factor, dark, mid-paced, lots of clean guitar, and more complex song arrangements. Once again, I see this as a good thing because I believe that The X Factor is a very underrated album. Still, this is about A Matter of Life and Death.<br /><br />There are many powerful moments on this album and there are several points that could be considered the climax. Whether you want to argue for the odd-timed galloping in Brighter Than a Thousand Sons, the instrumental section of The Longest Day, the lead section 4:50 into The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, or the last 3-4 minutes of The Legacy, you can't go wrong. Every song has something that will make it your favorite of the album for at least a day or two.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say that this album is just as good as anything Maiden has ever released. It really takes multiple listens for you to catch every guitar lick, every drum fill, every lyric, and every note that Harris plays. For those who want to argue that Janick should be kicked out of the band, all I have to ask is why? Firstly, the man is a talented guitarist and brings good song-writing to the band. Secondly, he has been a part of the band for 16 years and 7 albums, he's as much a part of the band as Adrian Smith. Third, he adds more depth to the band and the songs with the ability to use three guitar parts. Some would say that this is not done anyway but if you play an instrument you should be able to notice all three guitarists and three different parts throughout a lot of the album. Sure, you could use studio magic to add a third guitar to the harmonies or to add a solo over a harmony but I believe that you can hear a difference in all three of their's solos and leads. There's no logical reason to kick him out.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is one of the best metal albums of the new millenium and is equal to anything Maiden has put out. I'm not saying it's better than The Number of the Beast or Somewhere in Time, it's different but there is just as much depth and as much to enjoy. Give it a chance and try to appreciate it as its own album rather than comparing it to the older stuff and you will find that this is a very strong album.or the last 3-4 minutes of The Legacy, you can't go wrong.

0812550706|5.0|Like so many great sci-fi stories, I ran across \\"Ender's Game\\" in a back issue of Analog, and loved it.  Later by chance I found out that Card had turned it into a book.  I was very happy to see that by extending the concept contained in the short story into a book he had made the story better, principally by expanding the role and importance of Peter and Valentine.<br /><br />For those of us who follow Card this is arguably his best novel.  Fear of the Other, stolen youth, fights, action, plot twists, camaraderie, genius .  .  .  it's all in here.  If you're curious about Card's sci-fi, this is the place to start.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|Others have pointed out that there isn't anything new here, or anything that's really not available elsewhere.  Very true...also true of most other collections of this type by artists from The Beatles to Zevon. I have to disagree with one reviewer who said the DVD -- which is something mostly new after all -- isn't worth the price of admission.  It is - especially for those poor blokes who weren't around during the 70's.    Look, what everyone really needs to know is that the mastering is excellent and the 2 hour concert DVD - covering much of the long career of the band - is truly outstanding.  In the first two discs, the song selection is pretty darn good for the most part -- I would have preferred that they didn't leave Heartbreaker entirely disembodied by not including Living Loving Maid (that's the worst of this).  And instead of four songs from the first album, I would've added a track or two off Physical Graffiti (like In My Time of Dying - which is very notably on the DVD - or Ten Years Gone or Rover) and I would've likely replaced D'yer Mak'er and No Quarter from Houses of the Holy with The Rain Song and The Ocean (also notably on the DVD) or Dancing Days.  Other than that, they were just about perfect.    The DVD really makes this set -- and it's a fitting effort for the most powerful band of the 70's -- an era which provides us with greatest rock n' roll of all time.  No one who buys this set as an introduction to the band will be disappointed, in fact, I'd be downright stunned if they didn't buy the entire catalog because of it.  And isn't that the point after all?
0739358049|5.0|I almost quit on this book. The first half of this book irked me. I found myself angry, angry at the self-indulgence of Chris McCandless. If you want to know how angry I was, you can read the one star reviews of this book. Then, if that wasn't enough, the author, Jon Krakauer injects himself into the narrative with 2 chapters devoted to Krakauer's experience climbing a mountain in Alaska. It was at this point where I resolved to quit.<br /><br />But then a funny thing happened, right at the point I decided I wanted to quit was the almost exact point in the narrative where Krakauer had, after enduring hardship, wished to quit climbing the mountain. Just like Krakauer was fighting the mountain, I was fighting Krakauer's book. Krakauer's description of what it was like to climb a mountain was remarkably similar to my experience reading his book.<br /><br />I found that my major difficulty was that I was judging McCandless. Krakauer knew it was inevitable that people would judge McCandless. Krakauer's purpose was not to be an apologist and defend McCandless, but rather to explain what McCandless did, how he did it and (perhaps) why he did it. Judging McCandless may make one feel superior but utlimately, misses the point of Krakauer's book.<br /><br />Philip Franklin's reading is excellent. He speaks clearly, and his pacing is steady as he draws the reader into Krakauer's text.
B00000099Y|5.0|This band has influenced my taste for music for ever.    I just want to say, that this was, is and will be the best album of all time.    I know a lot of people think, that the best album ever is probably one of the STONES or BEATLES or even LED ZEPPELIN or PINK FLOYD, or that LATERALUS or 10000 DAYS is better, but sorry guys and gals. It´s not. AENIMA is the best.     No matter if you´re talking about the singer, the instruments, the cover art or the experience (for body AND mind). It is simply the best, period.
0385335482|1.0|I wish I hadn't wasted $10 on this book.  It was silly and boring.  Other critics are right - it reads like a book published by a fashion magazine or something, with way too many detailed descriptions of retail items for sale.  It almost felt like someone was trying to entice me into going out to purchase some of the items so much time was wasted on describing in intimate detail.<br /><br />I particularly dislike the book from a political viewpoint:  it makes light of a very, very serious problem in the US - people living way beyond their means.  The subject could have been dealt with in a comedic manner without making it seem as though we are all SUPPOSED to be paying off one credit card with another, buying things we don't need, and being wasteful.<br /><br />Thumbs down on this book.  Don't waste your money or your time.

B00005JPTI|4.0|We've seen a lot of films that take place in a post apocalyptic future, and of those films, many open by telling us that government, civilization, and humanity in general collapsed because of a viral outbreak. This plot device is used once again in \\"I Am Legend,\\" a science fiction thriller that would be far less impressive if an epidemic was all that the plot had to go on. In all honesty, the plot isn't all that interesting or original; this is the fourth film adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel, the first three being 1964's \\"The Last Man on Earth,\\" 1971's \\"The Omega Man,\\" and 2007's direct to video \\"I Am Omega.\\" For this newest adaptation, the casting of Will Smith is what made it work, especially since he had to act by himself for most of the film. He plays an intelligent, driven, and desperate character, a man whose isolating circumstances have driven him to emotional extremes. Some extremes almost come off as funny, in a pathetic sort of way.    Yes, I can praise Smith a great deal for this role. The story, on the other hand, is generally entertaining but not entirely successful, especially as it nears the end; at that point, it relies too much on the clichés of hope, loss, and redemption in the midst of frightening special effects. This isn't to say that the film doesn't work altogether--the first three-quarters of \\"I Am Legend\\" are surprisingly strong, not only because of Smith's performance, but also because of the way it builds tension. The story functions under the premise of a cure for cancer that was introduced in 2009, only to mutate into an infection. By the year 2012, ninety percent of the planet's population is dead. Of the remaining ten percent, less than one percent is immune to the virus--everyone else has been transformed into a vampire-like flesh eater. Nothing is ever mentioned about garlic or wooden stakes, but it is known that exposure to sunlight is fatal for these things.    This is the horrible future in which we find Robert Neville (Smith), a sole-surviving military scientist who struggles to exist in an empty, decimated New York City. When he's not gathering basic supplies, hunting loose herds of deer with his beloved dog, Sam, or protecting himself from hordes of mutant vampires, he's trying to discover a cure in a makeshift lab in his basement. Because he's immune, his blood serves as a possible way to produce a cure. The ironic implications of that are too clever to overlook: Blood may in fact be the key to ridding the infected of their thirst for blood. But irony is not what this film is about; at its heart, \\"I Am Legend\\" is about loneliness, guilt, and paranoia, all of which come into perspective during flashback sequences involving Neville and his family. Piece by piece, the fates of his wife, Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter, Marley (Willow Smith), are revealed, as are the facts of how Manhattan Island was quarantined.    Neville's memories are second only to his emotional well-being, which is barely hanging on by a thread. He tries to maintain his sanity by (1) keeping a video diary of his scientific research, and (2) sending out a radio message to anyone who might be alive and in need of shelter. But his sanity may be slipping. Early on, he enters a video store that not only has a fine selection of DVDs, but also a number of strategically placed mannequins. He speaks to them as if they were real people. He also avoids some out of nervousness; he just can't bring himself to strike up a conversation with the pretty female mannequin in back of the store. Here's a scene that appears light-hearted and funny but is actually quite serious. Simply put, loneliness can make a person do some strange things. And consider the moment he returns to the video store--he finally does approach the female mannequin to say, \\"I promised my friend I'd say hello to you. Hello.\\" Now with tears in his eyes, he says, \\"Please say hello to me. Please. Say hello to me.\\"    This is the kind of depth that can meanthe difference between a compelling film and an unimaginative rehash. Most of \\"I Am Legend\\" is a well-structured character study, highlighted by palpable levels of suspense, drama, and fright. It isn't until the final twenty minutes that the film loses some steam, turning a fascinating story into a run of the mill creature feature. It begins with the introduction of two immune humans: a young woman named Anna (Alice Braga) and a boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan). Anna believes that a survivor's colony exists, not because she's actually seen it, but because God told her so. This, of course, brings out the worst in Neville, who has not only lost his faith, but also his willingness to leave New York--\\"This is Ground Zero,\\" he says. \\"I can fix this.\\" Despite his daily radio message, his years of isolation have left him unable to interact with other people, least of all with Anna.    And that's when the vampire mutants attack, infiltrating Neville's fortress/house in a final showdown. I obviously can't say how everything ends, but I can say that it isn't all that surprising given the kind of movie this wants to be. I won't go so far as to say that the ending doesn't work, but I do think it could have worked better, especially since the rest of the film was so much more effective. For the most part, \\"I Am Legend\\" is an above average thriller, with a tense opening that quietly plays itself out. I'm recommending this movie despite some structural and narrative flaws; on the whole, it's still an engaging, taut, emotionally charged thriller, one of the better ones of recent memory.

The writing style is very similar to other basic home survival manuals.  In fact some of the information is useful in any emergency.  It covers the basics of logically considering your situation and determining the best way to deal with it.     The writing seems so sincere that I had to laugh at myself at times just because I caught myself considering how I'd prepare and deal with a zombie uprising.      A very well-written and entrancing read.

I never like to review books without finishing them, but my reading time is limited and I just couldn't let this book take up my time.  It's certainly not the worst book, but it's just too silly and tripe.
B000Y179KO|5.0|It took a long time but these are great albums.  Maybe a bit repetative towards the middle of the second CD, but a very good listen.
B000H5V8DG|1.0|As my title say's I purchaced 1 set and had 3 replacements, none of which worked. There was warping, finger prints in the dvd's themselves and a whole host of other problems. I wouldn't buy this set or recommend it. I've gotten my money back but it was a HUGE disapointment.
0316166685|5.0|I ordered this book because of the reviews my friends had. I have to say that it was the best book I have read in a very long time. My heart was broken, mended, and full of peace by the time I finished the book and I plan on reading it again. There's not a lot of dialogue (which is something that I need to be gripped into a book) but the narration is so well written and intriguing. I have recommended this book to many people and the ones that have read it feel the same as I do.
B000WS4OUW|4.0|Danzig 2 stands out as being the first album where Gleen started to drift toward blues influences in his music. This is made much more apparent on his third album \\"How the Gods Kill\\". This is a very good album, while not as good as the first Danzig album, is in my opinion better than the third. With tracks like Killer Wolf, 777, and the melodic Devil's Plaything, one can not go wrong with purchasing this album, esspecially if one is a fan of Danzig.
0307120007|5.0|My kids, favorite book and now we buy it for others.  Great tactile book and simple.
0714843377|5.0|For starters, this book is short.  I read the entire thing on my 40-minute train ride home from work.  I like that.  Long books leave me weary and reading hastily toward the end.<br /><br />The core of the message behind this book is simply: Be ambitious.  Success is significantly more a product of ambition than it is of skill, or talent, or even luck.<br /><br />Arden instructs the reader to choose the level of success they desire, and then to do everything in their power to reach that goal, even if the goal seems unreasonable at first.<br /><br />The advice is simple and memorable, and more importantly, it's good.  Even though he obviously writes from the background of an advertiser, the majority of the things he says are universal.<br /><br />This is a book that I will read again and again.
B000UR366S|2.0|I have all of the Joni records, tapes, CDs.  I understad that as people age maybe some of the creative juices don't flow like they used to, but there are few high points to this album.  In the same shipment I got the new Eagles CD.  The Eagles did much better than Joni.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I was first turned onto Lost when my brother bought season 1, and immediately I was hooked! I could't wait til season 2 came out, and I loved it almost as much as season 1. Then season 3 came out and I wasn't really able to watch the first couple of episodes, so I had no clue what was going on or what happened. Needless to say I could not wait til season 3 came out on dvd.<br /><br />I heard alot of things about season 3. Mainly that the first couple of episodes were not really all that good, but the shows start gaining momentum for the season finale. When I finally got my amazon copy, I immediately put it in. Honestly, I don't really know what people were talking about. I have loved it from the start!! Lost has grabbed me yet again and I don't mind being along for the ride.<br /><br />In my earlier review i mentioned not seeing the entire season yet, well now I have and IT'S AMAZING!!!!! One of the things people have been getting angry with is that they really haven't been answering many of the questions the show has posed. I feel that in season 3 we're finally getting some answers. At the end of just about every episode I found myself thinking... well what happens next?! I needed to know more! It caused me to lose some valuable sleeping time cause Iwould just keep watching. The show seems to grip you like no other show on television. I wish January 31st could come sooner!! Everyone should own Lost, and be Lost along with millions of people! Great Buy!
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|This goes down in history as one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.  You wait an endless amount of time waiting for a plot, only to find out there isn't one. Scenes dragged on at a most painful pace. What a pointless film, a complete waste of time.
B000002HFU|5.0|Ol Dirty is my favorite rapper of time. His style is all his own and I love the way he raps. Im not ashamed to admit that I cried when ODB died. Even though I never met the guy, he really inspired me thru his songs. This album is a mix of great rap tracks like Cuttin Headz, Brooklyn Zoo, The Stomp, and Raw Hide. I love his take on Somewhere Over The Rainbow as well, cant explain just listen and you'll know. I'll just say that there is not a weak track on this whole cd. Anther thing I like is there isnt skits on this cd. ODB speaks on his first track but the rest of the cd, its mixed in with songs. Besides Enter the 36 Chambers by Wu Tang CLan, there isnt a finer rap cd out there. I really miss ODB but his music will live on forever.
B00005JPS9|3.0|A demon named Grendel rampages through the feasting hall of King Hrothgar and smashes grown men as if they were china dolls.  Hrothgar sends out a call for heroes to come and fight the demon and Beowulf shows up to accept the challenge.  He and his men spend the night in the hall and Beowulf ends up taking on the monster virtually single-handed.  Grendel's mother, also a demon, retaliates and Beowulf goes to confront her.  This is where the story begins to diverge significantly from the original epic as Beowulf is seduced by her beauty and promises of fame and fortune and then must deal with the consequences later in life.    The strength of this movie lies in the voice acting.  Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich are particularly strong and well suited to their parts.  The greatest weakness to the film was the decision to use all CGI, even motion capturing all of the actors.  Many scenes looks cheap and fake, even though they would have been easy to do using sets and live action.  The characters have waxy faces and often move stiffly and jerkily, and often seem unnatural.  The story changes were apparently an attempt to make the tale more tragic and more personal but the wisdom was questionable.  This Beowulf is no longer a hero, just a fraud.      This is not a great movie, but it isn't bad for someone looking for simple action fare.  As long as you can set aside the odd look of the CGI characters, the action scenes look pretty good.  This movie may be popular on DVD where fans can skip to the chapters that are more dynamic and skip the nonsensical attempts at drama between battles.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|We have been going to Vegas since 1963 and have seen alot of shows but let there be no doubt that A NEW DAY  had to be the most fabulous Las Vegas show we have ever seen.   Celine is \\"SECOND TO NONE\\"  when it comes to a perfect voice, showmanship and special effects.  She is the absolute best!   Kathryn Orsulak Bossier City LA
B000V6I7WG|4.0|In America, movies are a commodity, driven by the almighty dollar.  Outside of the US, however, movies tend to be viewed with a more artistic mind.  This film is a perfect example of what happens when a director doesn't have to answer to a board of directors, and is allowed to follow his vision...and what a vision it is!    Oh Dae Su is a Korean businessman, who is mysteriously abducted after a drunken night on the town (and at the police station).  He awakens in a tiny apartment, completely alone.  His only human contact comes when he is unconscious, and the television is his only contact with the outside world.  On the 15th anniversary of his imprisonment he is released; given only a cell-phone, wallet, and 5 days to discover why he was abducted in the first place.    The core theme of this movie is revenge, but its so much more than that.  We are shown glimpses of one man's slide into madness (and brutality), an extremely tight mystery, a touch of romance, and (in it's own bizarre way) redemption.  Nothing is quite as it seems, in this film.    The acting, direction, and story-telling are top notch (M. Night Shamalan would do well to take notes from Park on the use of plot-twists).  The visuals are both brutal and beautiful.  Given the graphic nature of some scenes, this movie is most definitely not for everyone.    If you're willing to go outside the box, this movie will reward you many times over.  It will challenge you on many levels, but the payoffs are more than worth it.
0805079831|1.0|While Friedman was certainly no fan of Pinochet's human rights record, his assertion that free markets will lead to free people is certainly one that has played itself out time and time again. Strong economic growth creates the kind of well educated middle classes necessary to sustain a democracy. Pinochet did give up power voluntarily, and the transition from quasi-police states in Taiwan and South Korea (to name a few) into democracies following the implementation of free market polices would also seem indicate that Friedman is right and Klein is wrong.<br /><br />As someone who has been to Eastern Europe both shortly after the collapse of Klein's kind of \\"economic justice\\", the economic reforms that have taken place in most of the former Soviet Union have made them far more prosperous and far more politically free than they were 20 years ago, and that is undeniable. Ask the citictens of Hungary, Poland, The Czech Republic, Georgia, Latvia, the Ukraine, Slovakia, etcetera if they think their lives and future prospects are better now than they were 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago and the answer is a resounding yes. Were these necessary reforms difficult pills to swallow? Are they always popular? Of course not, but just because something is difficult and unpopular, does not mean it's the wrong thing to do!<br /><br />But Klein's book is packed full of these kinds of half truths. Take here example of the Iraqi museum. Klein said that 170,000 items were looted from the museum, when it was actually more like 3,000 and through the efforts of Marine Colonel Matthew Bogdanos, nearly every single one was accounted for and returned. Klein's use of hurricane Katrina as proof that \\"disaster capitalism\\" swooped into New Orleans privitized the public school system is another example. While some charter schools have come into New Orleans after KAtrian, most schools are still run by the government, with many transferring to the State control over municipal (a fact Klein has neglected).<br /><br />Save your money and buy \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" by Friedman and appreciate why he won the Nobel.oney and buy \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" by Friedman and appreciate why he won the Nobel.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Cars on Blu-Ray is really an excellent buy for anyone that likes Pixar flicks. I always enjoyed the movie itself, and when it became available on Blu-Ray, I had to buy it. I have not tried the extras yet, but the movie itself is flawless - I should mention I have the PS3 as playback device.
B000MTPAHW|5.0|One needs to consider the times from which it was made (1960's) and the type of detective films that preceded it. This is not a Raymond Chandler story. Nor is it supposed to be a modern \\"Hollywood carnival ride\\" movie, even with the great classic car chase here. Answer's are not neatly explained, if at all. If you weren't alive in the 50's and 60's you're not going to understand the context of the times and what it was like unless you dig deeper... The world moved both slower and faster back in the 1960's. In some ways the story follows like a stoned dream, how San Francisco was rediscovering itself back then. That's what continues to make this film interesting all these years later. It's classic cool.<br /><br />Looks super in HD-DVD, no problem. A \\"must own\\" title in HD format.
B000002G7E|4.0|If you were around in 1968 then you remember the times, the vibe and the violence in the air.  Drawn from such times the Velvets released this masterpiece.  There is a reason they're in the Rock & Roll Hall of fame my friend.  Even their \\"lesser records\\" (like this one) were masterpieces.  They were light years ahead of their time. This is one HEAVY record.  Definetely worth a listen to the younger generation.  The Velvets did it first and sometimes better than some of the rest.
0061124265|3.0|A good friend suggested that I read this novel during a difficult time in my life.  I was hesitant at first, however, after reading the first chapter i was hooked.  Many reviewers have said that this novel is about redemption, and it truly is.  Life stops for no one.  And just when you think life is over, that's when you get the will to live.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I wish more people could see this movie.  It's very erotic and has a good story to tell.  It is not offensive, and the cast did a great job handling some difficult subjects not normally discussed in public.
0143038419|3.0|I just finished this book, and the overall feeling I came away with was uplifting. However, getting there was somewhat of a trying process. I could initially identify with the author's plight of being a soul-weary divorcee at not even 35 years old (turns out we are the same age). I could feel a lot of her pain and struggle at first, but about 1/3 of the way into this book it became very clear why the author was the way she was: basically she was a self-indulgent, self-pitying, confused and sheltered kid who had no idea what it was like to really live her life. She only seemed to know how to throw a very long pity-party for herself that spiraled out of control. And I only know this because I have been that spoled kid. I have been that young divorcee. I have been to the bottom, mentally emotionally physically and spiritually. And the only way out of it is to go out and live life and find yourself, and in so doing to connect with others and realize you are not the first person on planet earth to have problems. She arrived at this conclusion by travelling to exotic places and meditating a lot, which in the end turned out well for her. But I only began to like her by the time she was about halfway through Bali! Most of the book is unfortunately written from the persepective of the self-deprecating, softly mocking, pity-party girl who is kind of stumbling through her first semester of Real Life. It was like watching the growing pains of a pouty, insecure adolescent who suddenly finds herself on an Excellent Adventure and at the end finally begins to lighten up. I liked reading her descriptions of the exotic locales and the characters she encountered; I just found myself wishing she could enjoy it more and not be so overwrought and analytical all of the time. Then again, as a career neurotic myself, who am I to judge so harshly... but this is a review, so I must be truthful. On the positive side, I did find many of her quippy observations funny and insightful. Obviously she is very bright and has a real ability to turn a descriptive phrase. In the end she seems finally to have found peace with herself, so as I said, I came away uplifted. But be warned, fair reader; this is definitely one of those weepy-Oprah-chick books, so if you're looking for a heavy duty, gritty, road trip philosophy of life type of thing you're not going to find it here. You're going to find something written by a very typical liberal-arts-degree-holding white suburban gal who (*gasp*) suddenly realized that the white picket fence and 2.3 children were not what life is all about. No big surprises here, but there's a lot of chicken soup for the soul if you'd like a light snack. Enjoyable enough if you want to stick it out till the end. Makes you wish everyone you know could afford to take a year off and get lost on some tropical island, that's for sure. Too bad we all can't be so lucky.
B00005JPTI|4.0|It's a funny thing about `end of the world' (EOW) stories, they usually read quite well, but rarely adapt well to cinema. I've always had a fascination with EOW, not that I'm morbid, I just believe it is an inevitable scenario. One day, humanity as we know it, will be drastically altered. Perhaps viral, or perhaps ecological. No, not global warming. I'm talking asteroids, here. At any rate, a thousand years from now, maybe even ten thousand years from now, or maybe even tomorrow, some catastrophic event will bring about the destruction of society and decimation of mankind.<br /><br />As with virtually all EOW stories that evolve from print to film, I AM LEGEND, the movie, falls far short of the book. That's NOT to say that the movie is not worth seeing, or even not enjoyable. It was actually quite enjoyable for me and maybe even one of the better EOW movies made to date. But....<br /><br />There's always a `but' right? The movie falls short on several fronts. There is too much time spent on scenes which really fail to contribute much to the story, and not enough time spent explaining important details. There is a brief elusion to God and His plan for humanity, but that shred of promising storyline is short lived. I never like to give away too much in a review, so I'll not go further into the story itself.<br /><br />Now here's what this movie does offer. Suspense, drama, fast cars, good verses evil, high tech weaponry, zombie-like humanoids and everything else one might expect. The filming is good, special effects are first rate. There really IS no casting here, it's pretty much a Will Smith solo performance.<br /><br />In the end, if I had it to do over, I wouldn't spend $10 at the theater, but I would definitely pay a couple of bucks for a rental.
0060007737|5.0|If you would like to speed up six years of college into six hours of reading and study - buy this book.<br /><br />I've been creating world known brands for Fortune 100 companies for over ten years like Heinz, Hershey, BJ's, Sams Club, COSTCO and Mc Cormick - and this read sharpened my skills to a razor slicing edge.<br /><br />I can't say enough about having every manufacturer or college student to have a copy of this amazing tome on their, \\"required reading list.\\"  Some of the most inane things million dollar and start-up clients try to do are revealed in the Ries writings.<br /><br />Creative groups and major marketing agencies with 20 people around the table roll what they think are amazing and astounding ideas.  A good example of this is Miller Clear Beer with a 50 million dollar advertising budget.  It was pulled in six months and the brand suffered.  The product was removed from the shelves.<br /><br />At our company, King Marketing, this book is required reading for all to memorize!  I can also say that a lot of my colleagues at Momentum Worldwide, the Interpublic Group, Marketing Drive and Proctor & Gamble love this book.
B000X3KZVI|3.0|I am one of Mariah Carey's biggest fans.  I've been a fan of hers ever since \\"Vision of Love\\" debuted in 1989/1990, and I've been a member of her official fan club for six years. I've seen Mariah four times in concert and have met her twice.  I, too, was at the Adventures of Mimi concert that was taped for this DVD, and I can say that it does not depict the actual concert.  The roller coaster introduction, which sets the concert into motion, was heavily edited and great quotations were cut out.  The DVD goes from song to song and never really shows you all of the interaction Mariah had with the audience. Many things were cut out, actually, the best parts were cut out, making this DVD almost painful to watch.  In all honesty, if I had the option I would return it.  I love Mariah Carey to death, but I cannot recommend this DVD.
0805079831|5.0|The Shock Doctrine is an intensively researched and  cogently argued expose of single largest impactor on the  World economy in the last 4 decades.. that of the Chicago  School of Friedrich von Hayek's and Milton Friedman's free  market economics. That is really a reincarnation of classic  19th Century British Liberalism of Adam Smith, David  Ricardo and Thomas Malthus.     It has consisted of a global plague that started in Latin  America, moved on to Asia, Africa, the old Soviet Block and  has moved like an infestation into the first world. It is  imposed through duress and intimidation, and preys on the  ignorance of politicians and the gullability of  electorates.     It is lauded in the popular media, from 'liberal' to  'conservative'.. NY Times to Fox News, not only as the best  but the ONLY viable economic model available to the world..  despite the immense impoverishment and social disorder it  has always fostered.     It's potions and dictates come from the cauldron of the 3  witches of international finance.. the IMF, the World Bank,  the WTO.. using garbled, specious logic. It conflates  corporate interests with national interests, where none  exists. It imposes 'austerity', privatization, breaks  unions, opens the country to foreign plundering by the  predatory international and interconnected investment  organism. It holds entire nations for ransom through  usurious international loans and currency sabatoge.    There is no cruelty or tactic its proponents will not use  to impose its agenda, singling out the poor and the weak as  especially vulnerable to its deceits.       It's prized champions include the strutting military  peacocks like Augusto Pinochet of Chile and Jorge Videla of  Argentina, the Russian Oligarchs, any number of third world  despots... and virtually every present first world  government. It is facilitated by corporately financed think  tanks and Harvard whiz punks like Jeffrey Sachs, whose star  has faded since the disastrous, crimeinfested  privatizations in the old Soviet block.    Iraq, has proved to be a perfect test case for creation of  pure neocon/neoliberal state, has produced the purest form  of its results.. an economic and social debacle.     We have lived through a century where both the experiments  of socialism and of unfettered free market capitalism have  failed, or are failing, in cataclysmic ways.     The success of the developmental economy that built the  West, the only proven model of succesful capitalism, has  been completely sabatoged by this reckless ideology.    The successes of the West's postwar economies are based on  national privilege in trade, in currency and credit, in  industrial planning and progressive tax policies.. in state  ownership of natural monopolies and natural resources. All  are founded on a sense of community and responsibility and  an equitable distribution of the nations wealth. Strong and  sovereign national governments serving the broad public  interest are an anathema to the Chicago School.    A weakness in the book is the credence it gives an icons  and idols of the left, such as Global Warming (and  others)..an artificial crisis of Klein's thesis if there  ever was one. In fact one whose proposed solutions through  Kyoto's 'carbon credits' mesh completely with the world  trading juggernaut.     Shock Doctrine provides a lens into the workings of post  structural economy; the motives and methods behind it. The  economies it describes are unsustainable. They will lead to  a global economic catastrophe of unknown depth and  duration.. but it will be unprecedented.    This book provides a caveat as to the destiny of paradigms  based on greed, powerlust and human exploitation. The jaws  of this brave new world are only now starting to close on  the global economy with avengance.
B000VS6PD2|5.0|Excellent album. Poor service from Amazon.  I pre-ordered this from Amazon weeks before the release date, and then they say it is unavailable and cancel the order.  Do not offer it if you cannot provide it.    The same music is available through iTunes and it comes with a PDF of the 50 page booklet offered with the limited edition CD.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Director Paul Verhoeven (\\"Robocop\\") returns to his \\"Soldier of Orange\\" roots and delivers this fantastic film set during WWII in Holland. He managed to make a film that is tragic, thrilling, sexy, touching and sad all at once, proving what a fantastic filmmaker he truly is. Carice van Houten is wonderful in the lead and Sebastian Koch (also star of the incredible \\"Lives Of Others\\") somehow makes you feel sympathy for what should have been a very unsympathetic character. Truly one of the best films of 2006.
B000000YBQ|1.0|Only one star for Waltz for Debbie? This is a sublime album and deserves all the accolades it gets but Orrin Keepnews managed to blow it. Not only does he add three alternate takes but instead of tacking them on at the end he plays them in succession and then runs those three back to back. Thus we hear Waltz for Debbie-Waltz for Debbie-Detour Ahead-Detour Ahead-My Romance-My Romance, each about seven minutes long. Using the \\"Random Play\\" option doesn't help because the ratio of alternate takes is so high your just as likely to hear the same track three or four times in a row. Musicians wouldn't play a set like this. The album was perfect at about 45 minutes.
B00005JPKE|5.0|\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", the tale of Japanese soldiers who fought and died on Iwo Jima in WWII, is the flip side of \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" - the tale of American marines who fought and died taking the island.  While each film can stand (very elegantly and sturdily) on its own, they are complementary. I first saw \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\",  then \\"Letters...\\", and I believe that is the order in which they were filmed.      Both movies are honest in a way many war movies are not.  They show the war, the effects of the war on young men and their families, and in so doing, they further explore the mystery of why we humans have such a long and bloody history of killing each other.  Although there is blood and guts galore, I was left with the feeling that I was being shown the truth. Neither movie is simply a manipulative attempt to horrify, frighten or convince the viewer. \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" and \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" represent, I fervently hope, an evolution in the film industry's ( and hence the American public's) perception of war and our \\"enemies\\".  Director Clint Eastwood has moved on from John Wayne heroes and Deer Hunter psychos to a deeper examination of the tragedy of war and its effects on all of us. Thank you, Mr. Eastwood!
B0009A40ES|1.0|The following is excerpted from yesterday's, December 13, 2007, IDAHO STATESMAN, entitled: TEEN GETS LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR KILLING MOTHER.   Ethan Windom, a 16-yr.old boy, brutally murdered his 42-yr. old mother on January 25, 2007. The murderer was \\"obsessed with the book and film, 'AMERICAN PSYCHO,' copying the mannerisms of the main character Patrick Bateman, going so far as to try to cover up his mother's murder almost exactly as described in the book.\\"  \\"Police learned during interviews and the investigation about Windom's fascination with 'AMERICAN PSYCHO' and serial killers. In the film, Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street by day but at night kills for no reason at all. Police learned from his friends that Windom had emulated the Bateman character since eighth grade.  Police say they also discovered he copied the character in the book by:  +Wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase at times.  +Obsessing over material possessions and luxury items, like Jean Paul Gaultier bags and designer bags and designer cologne. In fact Windom asked for his expensive cologne after he confessed to the murder.  +Asking police for his white comforter in his jail cell, similar to the character's comforter.  +Taking two showers a day and appying a cosmetic face mask after the first shower, just like the film character.   +Snorting his medication through a dollar bill like the character snorted cocaine in the film.  +Windom had a figurine of Bateman in his bedroom. He told people he had homicidal thoughts, just like the character did. And like the character in the film, Windom told police he planned to kill some bums Downtown, but he killed his mother instead because she was closer.  +Police also said Windom had several books about serial killers in his room and had taken an upper level psychology class as a sophomore in high school.  +Police also found a day planner in the Windom home with seven graphic pictures Window drew of women being brutally murdered with knives, ropes and chain saws.\\"  Is it movies imitating life? Or life imitating movies?
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Sublime! This is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is perfect, there is not one shot of this film I would change. I'm not saying this is \\"the\\" perfect movie for you, if you are in the mood for a romantic comedy for example, this won't fit the bill. But if you want to see a fantastic thriller that says a lot about the human condition or just a great movie - prepare to have your mind blown.

B0000024U8|5.0|Marc Greilsamer has it dead wrong. When this album was released I was 17 years old. At the time, it was considered to be a must have album for music lovers that liked the guitar driven jam sessions. In the late 60's everything on the radio was a 3 minute commercialized song. The long jam session albums were the real music of the time. This album was one of them.
B000002UVX|5.0|If you are a classic rock/blues inspired guitarist, I highly recommend this CD. I've been playing various styles for 30 years - and, in my opinion, 'Who Knows' and 'Machine Gun' represent the two greatest recorded live guitar performances. It's too bad these tunes don't get the FM/rock station airplay they deserve.
B000WCDI5K|3.0|I own numerous b-side compilations from many different artists. I also own both of The Killers cds \\"Hot Fuss\\" and \\"Sam's Town\\". Generally speaking, b-side compilations tend to be on the average side--unfinished, rough drafts of songs that didn't quite make the cut. Every once in a while I find a b-side compilation that contains a-sides, or songs that should have made the Top 40. Case in point, Pet Shop Boys 1995 b-side compilation \\"Alternative\\". More often than not, however, b-side compilations are a mixed blessing such as Tears For Fears' \\"Saturnine Lunatic & Marshal\\" or Cake's \\"B-Sides & Rarities\\". Even U2's second discs from \\"Best Of U2 1980-1990\\" and \\"Best Of U2 1990-2000\\" were hit and miss.<br /><br />So what about \\"Sawdust\\"? Well, there are some good songs like their cover of Joy Division's \\"Shadowplay\\", their cover of Kenny Rogers' \\"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town\\"(although Cake's version is equally as good), and their cover of Dire Straits' \\"Romeo & Juliet\\". Other reasonably good songs include the remix of \\"Mr. Brightside\\", the Abbey Road version of \\"Sam's Town\\", \\"Who Let You Go?\\", \\"Where The White Boys Dance\\", \\"Under The Gun\\", \\"Leave The Bourbon On The Shelf\\", \\"All The Pretty Faces\\" and \\"Glamorous Indie Rock And Roll\\" and maybe even \\"Move Away\\". The other songs felt average to me. I was particularly disappointed with \\"Tranquilize\\" and Lou Reed. I've heard much better from Reed and The Killers and \\"Tranquilize\\" felt like such a waste of a potentially great moment.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers here that with only two cds The Killers are pushing it here. Most artists don't put out a b-sides until they have at least 5 or 6 albums out, sometimes much more. Yet, I see the Gorillaz have done the same thing with their \\"D-Sides\\" after only two cds (which I will review next week). Overall, \\"Sawdust\\" is fifty-fifty. There's some good songs and some not-so-good songs. I didn't feel there were any great songs here. \\"Hot Fuss\\" and \\"Sam's Town\\" contain some great songs surrounded by some good songs. \\"Sawdust\\" is just a stop-gap between albums, and a chance for The Killers and the record company to cash in at the holiday time.t songs surrounded by some good songs. \\"Sawdust\\" is just a stop-gap between albums, and a chance for The Killers and the record company to cash in at the holiday time.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|I heard \\"lovesong\\" and it really stood out from everything else on the radio right now. I previewed the tracks online and decided to buy the entire cd. I am so glad that I did as it's infectious. I love it so much that I bought it as a gift for some of my friends. A solid pop album!!
B000SO7OLQ|2.0|There has been a re-emergence of thrash metal as of late in many parts of Los Angeles.  Bands like Merciless Death, Fueled By Fire and others are at the forefront of it and although it is great to see this music again, this particular album does not really seem to capture the scene of the 80s.  Sure they have high tops, tight jeans and King Vs, but when you really listen to the lyrics, the record seems more focused on posers, circle pits and it is filled with references to 80s thrash bands and their lyrics.  Hopefully their next release will contain songs with a meaning.  But hey it's a start.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|It's always a pleasure to whatch a new movie from Pixar, those kinetic wizards of shiny sculpted animation who gave us the Toy Story films, Finding Nemo, and Cars, because it's a safe bet that you're in for a sparkly good time -- or, just maybe, a great one. In the case of the antic kiddie gourmet comedy Ratatouille, which might be described as Anatole the mouse meets Emeril Live, the expectations are high: The writer-director is Brad Bird, who made The Incredibles (2004), and it would be hard to name an animated film, from Pixar or anyone else, that was ever more incredible. So... Enjoy!!!
B000000W5H|3.0|1974 was a odd year for rock 'n' roll. The \\"youth culture\\" the music had both stimulated and given voice to was clearly, and unsurprisingly,  fragmenting as the '60s receded into memory. A lot of important bands broke up that year - Jefferson Airplane, Traffic, Mott The Hoople, King Crimson, The Stooges, Byrds, Sly & The Family Stone, and even the New York Dolls, to name just a few that come to mind, all fell apart in the space of about a year (The Beach Boys stopped bothering to record, at least for several years, and embraced the past when their old label's collection of early-to-mid '60s hits reached # 1 in \\"Billboard\\"), as they either lost their sense of purpose or self-destructed. Concurrently, soul, with its direct yet artful emphasis on emotional expression and cathartic energy, also struggled as black music, after a remarkable period during which hit records both pushed the envelope in terms of musical innovation and challenged their audience with hard-hitting, often painful truths, became increasingly utilitarian  (a phenomenon in the clubs, 'disco' would become part of the popular lexicon within a year or so), and all of a sudden legends like Aretha, Wilson Pickett, and James Brown seemed as unable to cope as their white counterparts. To borrow Gertrude Stein's remark, it seemed \\"there was no there there\\".   Also in 1974, we witnessed the first big-money comeback/reunion tours: CSNY (hey, I bet they were still funkier than the Eagles) made what was still an unusual and plainly mercenary decision to play outdoor stadiums; Dylan returned, after eight long years, with The Band and rocked the same arenas The Stones and Led Zep had been filling since the turn of the decade. Before reaching my teens, I'd already seen a handful of my favorite bands live, starting with Creedence back in '71, but Bob Dylan/ The Band was the first show I attended at which nostalgia was palpable,  at least in the crowd, which roared every time Bob bleated through his harmonica and politely sat on its hands during powerful sets by The Band, or when Dylan and The Band performed new material); Clapton, MIA since 1970's \\"Layla\\", and George Harrison (first ex-Beatle to tour) all 'returned' from someplace. Unless you looked through import bins for Eno albums, who could blame you for feeling nostalgic? Both AM and FM radio played tripe like Loggins & Messina, Seals & Crofts, Elton John, Barry White, and Bachman-Turner Speedwagon, as well as the aforementioned band named after the predatory, flesh-eating bird pictured on dollar bills. Free devolved into Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane crashed and mutated into the Starship. No one knew it yet, but third generation 'supergroups' like Firefall and Foreigner were just around the corner. Naturally there were brash new artists waiting to fill the void - Patti Smith, Ramones and Television were playing to small crowds and giving birth to the next wave at C.B.G.B's, while Britain's Roxy Music made fresh, smart and original music that could only have been made in the 1970s.     The big groups, meaning the Who and the Stones, who somehow survived their first decade - something unprecedented in rock 'n' roll - flailed their arms and anxiously tried to re-assert their relevence. The Who offered bloated concept albums (\\"Quadrophenia\\"). As for the Stones, who had by comparison never really been preoccupied with themes of youth or adolescence, an inevitable self-conciousness permeated \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\", making it one of their all-time weakest studio albums...   During the previously year or two Keith Richards had been busted for heroin numerous times, and his ghostly presence on \\"Goats Head Soup\\" (1973), the final installment in the Stones' great trilogy of impotence, hard drugs, decay, and soul survival, led some to wonder if he was destined to be the next rock star death. (\\"Creem\\", the American rock 'n' roll magazine, had actually reported that Faces' Ron Wood might fill in for Keith on the '73 European tourshould Keith's legal problems prohibit him from travelling freely - two years later, of course, Wood joined the group after Mick Taylor's defection). The Stones may sound weary on \\"Goats Head Soup\\", but it's an honest expression of the band's spiritual crisis (Charlie Watts even sounds exhausted, on first listen, thanks to a dry, muted mix that was unlikely to court many new, young fans) and if the album didn't outrock the New York Dolls' debut it remains a powerful and underrated album in the Stones' body of work. The Rolling Stones, having entered their second decade, may have been tired (Keith's guitar, for the first time, is not central to the sonic identity of \\"Goats Head's\\" and Bill Wyman, increasingly alienated by Keith's addiction and its impact on the band, started to pull away, playing bass on only three or four tracks). Yet \\"GHS\\" offers some exquisite moments that reflected the Stones' willingness to take musical risks; at the same time the record vividly conveyed and dealt with the torpor threatening the Stones. If the band was fragmenting, so was the culture they spoke to. \\"Coming Down Again\\", \\"Winter\\", \\"Can You Hear The Music\\", \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo\\" and \\"100 Years Ago\\" and the mournful hit \\"Angie\\" may not be rockers, but they're all great songs, reflective and searching. With Keith presence subdued, the album remains unique in the Stones' catalog, and aside from a set of superb Jagger/Richards songs, many of the album's musical highlights are due to Mick Jagger's exquisitely rich vocals, which as usual are full of contradictions - now past 30 he sounds restless and calm, confused yet with a fully integrated persona, communicating wonder, humility, anger, and melancholy, and his weariness is unmistakeable even as he sings with utter authority. And \\"Goats\\" highlighted Mick Taylor's exquisite blues-drenched yet lyrical guitar playing - his last consistently focused and inspired performances as a Rolling Stone. Unfortunatly, as is the case with \\"Love Is Strong\\" from 1994's \\"Voodoo Lounge\\", \\"Dancing With Mr. D\\" was a rather underwhelming track to open a album, and one song placed at the beginning can color listeners' assessment of an entire record. Contemporary reviews were lukewarm.  When \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\" was released a year later many were relieved that you could hear Keith's guitar again (whew!), and that - now in their 30s! - the Stones could \\"still\\" rock, as tracks one and three explicitly remind us. But for the first time the Stones appear to be trying to recapture something, rather than moving forward (as they would on their next, more exploratory disc, \\"Black and Blue\\"). \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\", on one level, is a pale version of the early '70s Stones' classics, minus the horns and with a few hints of soon-renewed vitality in its tentative forays into funk, reggae, and Philly soul. And sure, it rocks, but you sense a strain, like their hearts aren't in it. The title track, perhaps the dinstinguised exception with its understated and subtle performance, chugs along with a funky and unforced groove, dense with overdubbed guitars and Ian Stewart's marvelous piano, its pensive, laconic lyrics expressing a sense of distance from their ever-expanding audience. As the first single to be excerpted from the album it offers a glimpse into the band's future, for it was evidently written by (sorry, the liner notes say \\"inspired by\\" which means no royalties) one Ron Wood during sessions for his solo debut recorded that year, \\"I've Got My Own Album To Do\\", a virtual collaboration with Keith (and featuring two new Jagger/Richards songs), featuring guest performances by the Micks, Jagger and Taylor. Five short minutes, and I like it, a lot more than the anthemic Chuck Berry throwback it would later become once it took its place as a concert staple. One notices the bass is played by Willy Weeks (from Wood's solo album). Elsewhere, Mick Taylor, expressed his own frustrations  - and deepening addiction - by not showingup to some of IORR's Munich recording sessions. He adds fills and solos that sound pretty and out of place, expecially the overly linear solo that decorates \\"Time Waits For No One\\". \\"Til The Next Goodbye\\" is an acceptable ballad that might sound fresher if \\"Angie\\" hadn't come out the year before. Even a solid rocker like \\"Dance Little Sister\\", which should rip, comes off as slightly pallid thanks to a lumpy mix that mars the whole album. The record (which marks the first time the Stones produced themselves since \\"Satanic\\" in '67) has a grey film over it, and it finally feels both overworked and underdeveloped. I never much cared for \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\" (a listenable but uninspired filler track reminiscent of the J. Geils Band, utterly lacking the life and power of their next attempt at a Temptations cover, \\"Imagination\\").   The nearly seven-minute finale, \\"Fingerprint File\\", to its credit, tries to make a timely statement, but falls a little flat as both drama (it's no \\"Midnight Rambler\\") and musically in comparison to their next album's unforced excercise in hard funk, the Meters/J.B.'s inspired \\"Hot Stuff\\" which asserts itself from the the start with Keith's chicken-scratch riffs and Charlie's authoritative drumming. \\"Fingerprint File\\" closes out a long album with Mick trying too hard, and his vocals are sometimes affected, for the first if not last time in his career.   Aside from the title track, there are other strong moments: the  kickass opener 'If You Can't Rock Me' (with Keith on bass and guitars), and the gorgeous Philly soul ballad (with its cinematic imagery) 'If You Really Want To Be My Friend' are the other unequivocally successful cuts here. I also like the way they place Ian Stewart's boogie-woogie piano upfront in the mix for a change on the rollicking 'Short and Curlies', but it's still hard to ignore the throwaway lyrics.  Sorry, \\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\\" is certainly a decent rock album, but a confused - and drab sounding - Rolling Stones album.

B000JIHP88|5.0|We have consistently used this mostly as a night light and music for every nap, and every night at bedtime (since day one) for my now 6-month old son.  Still have not had to change the 'D' batteries, so that's a big plus.  We didn't run the mobile very often, because I only used it for naps and night time, and we keep his room very dark, so he couldn't see the mobile most of the time; however, between 2-4 months of age, when I did put him in his crib to play, he did seem to really like the mobile.  The editor's description is incorrect--there IS a volume control (soft or softer), I use the lower volume unless it's daytime and very noisy down the hall like when I'm doing laundry or something, and no problems hearing it.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Zeppelin's obvious heavy hitters: Achilles Last Stand, Tea for One, and Nobody's Fault.  However, the real gems are the \\"tight but loose\\" rockers: Hots on for Nowhere, Royal Orleans, and For Your Life.  Candy Store Rock is the artful one-off.  The instrumentation is a revelation of heavy, hard, but fun and purposeful.  Every song is stark, greasy, lean, and raw.  My favorite LZ album.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is my favorite Dire Straits album with good reason.  It's easily their most ambitious album, and the musicianship is pretty damn awesome.  Who says there was no good music in the 1980's?  This was also the last time they were experimental, as their next album, Brothers in Arms, was a monster hit and they pretty much fell apart after that (only one more studio album came out from them).  Many people like to talk about the length of the first song, Telegraph Road, without mentioning the actual song.  The song is a majestic epic, almost like a mini rock opera symphony.  The last 5 minutes or so are some of the most intense playing that these guys ever did.  The 2nd song, Private Investigations, is atmospheric and moody, but it's not a favorite.  I love the Industrial Disease song, with its still timely lyrics and its bouncy beat (god, that sounds corny).  The title track is similar in tone to Private Investigations.  It's OK.  It Never Rains, as many have said, has a major Dylanesque vibe to it, and it's a great song to close the album with.<br /><br />It's a shame Dire Straits broke up.  Knopfler just released his first solo album in a very long time, and honestly, it's not very good.  I heard it at work, and I nearly fell asleep.  But we still have this album, one of the most adventurous albums that Dire Straits ever made, and, in my opinion, their best album.

Thanks to some strange case of evil transferrence, Jamie (Danielle Harris), confined to a child clinic, can now psychologically \\"zone-in\\" to Michael Myers, and provides a valuable tool in his recapture.  Donald Pleasence reprises his role of Dr. Loomis, whose quest has changed into acting as Jamie's guardian at the clinic.  Also back from the 4th sequel is Ellie Cornell, as Jamie's stepsister Rachel.<br /><br />Michael's \\"immortality\\" almost becomes a joke in HALLOWEEN 5, with the poor fellow shot by a harpoon-rifle, beaten with a two-by-four, and surviving yet another fiery carcrash.  On the upside, you get foxy Wendy Kaplan (as Rachel's best friend Tina) running around for most of the movie wearing a sexy French maids' costume.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN 5 is by far the most laughable of the \\"Halloween\\" franchise, but hardcore fans are sure to love it anyway.
6304712936|4.0|AMADEUS  It is important to remember that this movie, being \\"based\\" on a real person will definitely have it's theatrical additions. Keep in mind that this film is portrayed through Salieri's (the king's royal composer) eyes.  The movie accurately shows Mozart expounding upon or making better several works that were not his. Another historical accuracy was the portrayal of Mozart as a young child performing in different courts all across the country where his fame started to spread as a young, budding composer. The great thing about this movie is that it has enough historical accuracy to be an interesting fictional drama that leads the viewer to have a desire to learn more about Mozart and his life.   We found the movie to be a bit long and questionable in parts, However, overall it was very entertaining. This movie is full of the flair and brilliance accustomed to Mozart's time. The movie had many amazing costumes and the actors did a wonderful job of presenting the story.   One might ask, why Amadeus?  Why not Mozart, Wolfgang, or Wolfie (as his wife calls him)?  Amadeus means God's Love. The symbolism in this is not only was this Mozart's middle name, but also a recurring theme throughout the movie.  Salieri was bitter about Mozart's talents, he wanted to be able to write wonderful music, but his was only mediocre. Salieri cursed God and said that he wouldn't believe in God anymore a few times, but kept coming back to the love of god during the course of the movie so the title Amadeus is portrayed through symbolism throughout the movie.   The movie showed Mozart playing the clavier, the piano, etc. Most of the music for the movie was Mozart's and the film showed Mozart working on his operas, namely, The marriage of Figaro.  There was a constant theme of religion and of God. Salieri, a competing composer in Mozart's time, often claimed it was God's work that he had the constant desire and urge to create beautiful music but that he had been made \\"mute\\" compared toMozart's talent. Throughout the movie, he questioned why God would work though this crude, arrogant, inappropriate person. Just the fact that the story is based on Salieri confessing to a priest is another contributing factor to this theme.  Revenge, another theme, is portrayed as Salieri strives for a way to bring about Mozart's death The interesting thing is, throughout the movie, Salieri's work is constantly being recognized by. This is a classic example of jealousy and how a person should be content with what they have.

B000VWYJ86|3.0|I can't believe I bought this DVD. I bought it because I like the film-making and action and acting and martial arts.     What I am really saying is that anti-Americanism screenwriting is now really conventional in Hollywood. It is now completely stale to me. I sit through movie after movie (\\"Shooter\\", etc.) in which the U.S. is the bad guy, and it is just now stale and trite and not interesting anymore. Put a twist on it at least. For instance, in the third movie, it would have been interesting to have some real terrorist that Bourne has to fight, and not just the rehash of \\"it all starts at home\\". Note that in the real \\"Bourne Ultimatum\\" novel, Bourne's identity is stolen by a real (non-US) terrorist, who Bourne then has to track down on his own. That would have been a fresh idea and would have to me injected new life into the series. Bourne could still be fighting his own CIA, but also the external threat. Would have been fresh and new. The old standard, \\"let's make the bad guy a middle-aged white bureaucrat in Washington, covering up America's secrets\\" is just conventional, \\"paint inside the numbers\\" scriptwriting to me. The filmmakers took no real chances here (the more sinister motivation, as someone on this site mentioned, is that Hollywood now knows that most of its revenues come outside the US on movies like this, and thus, purposely makes then a bit anti-American, because they know that will sell well in London and Paris and Jakarta and Moscow). But I will assume the former, not the latter.     Here is what I don't like about it. The message of the movie is as follows:    - There is no real external enemy (note that in the REAL Bourne novels, there is an external, terrorist enemy (Carlos the Jackal, a communist terrorist, etc.). In the Bourne movies on the other hand, Bourne is only fighting in essence, his own government, the U.S. The movies thus are not really true to the books).     The CIA (or at least large parts of it) is (as portrayed in the movie)the real enemy of the world. (This corresponds to an extreme left-wing, Noam Chomsky / Howard Zinn view of the world, which, by the way, Matt Damon evidently endorses, and which sees all world conflicts as basically America's fault [if you doubt me, read what Damon thinks, politically, and read Zinn and Chomsky]). [I like Matt Damon and I thus am sorry to see that he reads Chomsky and Zinn, but he does].    - The CIA is complete evil.   - The CIA can brainwash people.   - The real heroes in our world are people who fight the CIA.     Anyone who knows anything about how our world functions, knows that this is not correct. I am actually sorry I bought yet another piece of anti-American propaganda.     BTW, if anyone doubts me on the CIA, read the book \\"Jawbreaker\\", by a REAL CIA agent, who went into Afghanistan with about 500 Americans and they beat the entire Taliban using airpower and knowledge and guts. That is the REAL CIA. The author of \\"Jawbreaker\\" states that 97 % of what we read about the CIA is untrue, and I suggest to you all that this applies in spades to these movies. I suggest that 97 % of the movie is B.S. as it applies to the real CIA. Please remember, there are millions of Afghan girls that now get to go to school without a burka on, because of those brave CIA patriots !    In the movie, the CIA \\"asset\\" shoots a British journalist in the head in the crowded London train station (!). Puh-lease !!! You have got to be kidding me. This is straight out of a fevered liberal's hysterical nightmare, and is so ridiculous, that it really ruined the movie for me. (and all the CIA people sit around their TV screens and watch it without protest. Yep, they might as well all just put on black SS uniforms at this point).     In another scene, a bomb planted by the CIA goes off in Morocco. Yes, folks, this is true to reality: in Muslim countries, all would be well and eternal tolerance and peace would prevail, if it were not for those American bombers, setting off bombs. Very, very realistic.
B000000I0I|5.0|Mike Oldfield's third studio recording marks the end of the most creative phase of his career. \\"Tubular Bells\\" explored an aggressive and improvised world of chaos and turmoil. \\"Hergest Ridge\\" presented listeners with the genteel and serene flip side of that world. \\"Ommadawn\\" is a step outward into a much larger and all encompassing world. It combines both the energy and serenity of his first two albums, but importantly expresses itself through shifting ethnic backdrops. Oldfield is for the first time acknowledging and utilising a `world music' ethic, with Celtic influences sitting comfortably with African influences.<br /><br />  Many critics have seen the explosive finale to Side One as representing some form of cathartic rebirth for Oldfield, and certainly post \\"Ommadawn\\" he would enter into controversial therapies and emerge a new man in late 1978 when he returned with his fourth album \\"Incantations\\". Rather than a rebirth, \\"Ommadawn\\" almost feels like a death. Oldfield would never recapture the simple beauty and resonance of this album. Certainly he would go on to produce fine works (Incantations, Amarok, Voyager), but \\"Ommadawn\\" feels like the thematic culmination of something far grander and important, something which can only be understood with the support of his first two albums.<br /><br />  The sense of an end is further confirmed by \\"Ommadawn\\" being Oldfield's final album in the serene countryside of Herefordshire. Although Oldfield's albums tended to veer towards adjectives such as complex and progressive, there is still an essential child-like naivety, purity and innocence to \\"Ommadawn\\", best exemplified by the sheer playfulness of certain parts and of the beautiful folk ditty \\"On Horseback\\". On the front cover a sombre Oldfield stares out through a rainy window, there is a sense of passing, of moving on, of facing an uncertain future, and with \\"Ommadawn\\" Oldfield finally broke free from the insecurities of the past.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I had the amazing opportunity to see this show in 2004 and it was worth every penny.  For those of you who missed out on the concerts, while not the same as seeing it live, this DVD comes as close as you can get to actually being there.  I loved all the extras too.  The set list I saw in 2004 was changed several times throughout the five year run.  The producers of this DVD were smart to include all the songs she performed during her tenure at Caesar's.  I also loved seeing the \\"behind the scenes\\" too, and not some 10 minute snippet either.  The producers of this DVD went far beyond expectations.  The behind the scenes footage is over 50 minutes!  This is a well put together DVD.  You will not be disappointed.

A Hard Day's Night I could watch over and over, this one, maybe I'll give it another viewing in a couple of years. Nice extras but again, I just wanted more.

0393061310|3.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is an encompassing encounter of human history that explores the reason as to why some human societies thrived and gained technology while others didn't.  Author Jared Diamond focuses more on domestication of plants and animals, coupled with the diseases prone to certain cultures and geographic locations.  While really breaking no new ground, he at least brings ideas already known into new light to give us food for thought.  Why didn't the wheel develop in the Americas as opposed to Asia and Europe?  Well, they did not have a horse, or anything equal to it to haul a wheel.  Those were the kind of ideas that finally got me to see the relation between animal domestication and technological development.  He also analyzes the different diseases and why the Europeans had stronger immunities than the Americans. At the outset, he relates it to the different geographic environments.  Europe and Eurasia have quite a different climate as opposed to the Americas.  However, he also ignores other factors that play into technological and viral developments.  Blatantly omitted was the step backwards taken by Europe during Medieval Times.  He also forgets one reason for the European immunities was waste disposal.  Europeans, being constrained by space, often located their refuse heaps too close to their major cities whereas Native Americans had some distance from those refuse areas.  Also, Europe's smaller continent size had more people closer together to spread diseases.  Also, during times of lose sexual morals led to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in Europe.  My final critique of Diamond's treatise is that is becomes very repititive, mostly in the different plant domestications of different cultures.  What he says in 431 pages could have been said in 350.  Still, despite all that, a reader will come away realizing why China, Africa, the Americas and Asia developed why they did, and connect old ideas that relate to each other.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|I expected a bigger box. I expected a bigger book (dimensions).  But, I was not dissapointed at all. It is better than I expected. Well worth every penny and more! I wasn't even a teenager when this album came out, but as years have gone by, this album has become my favorite! This collection comes with the original cd of course. It's remastered and sounds better than ever!! Then there's the bonus CD. Songs I've heard, but never truly appreciated, until now. Knowing they come from the Joshua days makes them special to me now. Then the DVD. I own everything U2 has released, and I am always excited to get new live footage. This footage is from the Joshua tour, and since I wasn't lucky enough to see them live in those days, it gives me a small taste. The concert footage doesn't include Where The Streets Have No Name, so thats my only gripe. If you are a hardcore fan like me, you have to have this collection! If you aren't, I would still recommend this, or one of the other versions of this re-release. I don't buy a lot of music on CD anymore, but this was a must have for me, and it has definately proven once again why they are the biggest, and most enduring band of my time.
B00005JPTI|5.0|In 2009, a dangerous virus spread through New York City and, possibly, the entire world. Now the entire human race has either died or turned into creatures who are impervious to light. Except for one survivor, scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith). For three years, he's been trying to find a way to reverse the effects and hopefully bring humanity back to normal. During his latest roundabout, he was trapped in his car and was about to be attacked when a surviving family (Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan) rescues him from certain doom. Unfortunately, the bloodsuckers have followed. Now Neville must make a last stand, because he would rather die trying than become one of them.    While I wouldn't call I Am Legend a classic in filmmaking, it sure had me riveted. Based on a classic novel by Richard Matheson, and directed by Constantine helmer Francis Lawrence, Legend is a doomsday movie mixed with frightening chills, a reliable performance from Will Smith, and hardly any exposition (made better by the fact that dialogue is minimal).    Legend is hardly considered a blockbuster actioner by any means. While it has Smith, guns, and special effects, this isn't \\"Men in Black\\" meets 30 Days of Night. More or less, it's a combination of \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and \\"The Omega Man\\" (which the source material was previously adapted), and it focuses on top-notch horror sets (much like \\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\" and \\"30 Days of Night\\", the shocks come quick rather than being cheap), a sense of claustrophobia, and biting commentary about racial relations that figures into the story (at least I think it does).    And concerning the vampires, Lawrence also outdid himself as well. Since this is a big-budget film, unlike \\"30 Days of Night\\", the blood-sucking creatures are rendered in full CGI, and have little to do but scream and snarl. And that's fine with me, because it benefactors into the need to just be a good-ol-fashioned fright fest.    Even better is the fact that it doesn't have anymajor stars backing it up. This is Will Smith's movie through-and-through, and Lawrence made a wise decision not to have him channel the Fresh Prince in a action/horror movie. As I said, the film focuses less on flat-out explaining the story, and more time to flesh out Smith's character, allowing the drama to breathe, while still throwing in action and horror sets all the way through.    As I stress, for those seeking a popcorn-munching action fest, you may be partially right. But the film has more on its mind than just cheap thrills. This is probably why the film won't be memorable, but to be PG-13 and dead-on thrilling (compared to the idiotic thrillers recently dumped into theaters), consider Lawrence not one of the hacks in the business.
B000I5YCCO|3.0|I bought Taylor's CD after seeing her on the CMA awards awhile back.  I like her music, although it is somewhat juvenile...but I can totally understand that considering her age.  I enjoy Taylor ok, but I think I will stick with Miranda Lambert.
0743298039|5.0|This book has tales within tales, voices over time and somehow interconnected - just the way I like it. Each story engaging, each woven smoothly into the fabric of the major story with a bit of intrigue and suspense to keep wondering: how are these disparate stories going to come together? How do these people mirror parts of the others' stories?  A very enjoyable, satisfying tale with no contrived endings. This novel flows well and the writing is strong. I feel like I've known these idiosyncratic characters for a very long time.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I own this concert recording on both VHS and DVD.  As a major Styx fan since I first heard them on the radio back in 1975, and after having seen them more times than I can remember since my first time back in 1978, I have to say that this is by-far the BEST Styx concert you'll ever see from here-on!  It has 4 out of the 5 members from their classic line-up; and the drummer, who is the only one that is not from that line-up, has done an AWESOME job to fill some very big shoes!!  He is also their current drummer.    I saw the band twice in 1996, and one of those times was the night before this show was taped in Chicago, and that was in Madison, Wisconsin.  After seeing this concert twice that year, I knew I had to own this DVD, because it is as close to the perfect version of Styx as you'll ever be able to see!  It took me back to their heyday in the late 70's.    If you're a Styx fan, buy this concert on DVD!!  You'll LOVE it!    Also, on the DVD version, they've included some really cool \\"behind the scenes\\" footage, and photos that just make it all the more worth owning.  The VHS tape does not include these extras, however.
B000MG1YC0|4.0|morten veland & co. could do much much better:( to be sure,it ain't a bad piece of work. i can think of plenty of other so called artists with much worse offerings but compared to their previous releases like \\"an elixir for existence\\" or the superb \\"at sixes and sevens\\" , this album sounds too radio friendly or \\"safe\\" for my liking. newcomers or those looking for something mainstream sounding like evanescence might fall in love with this but for those who are accustomed to sirenia's earlier works or tristania during morten veland's era, ND&D may disapoint you...<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Maybe the writing isn't as good as the other Seasons, however, its still the Gilmores!  Its a fun, fast-paced show to watch.  We love it!
B000077VOY|4.0|Much has already been written about this DVD set.  The plots are simple and fun, the characters have a some depth to them.  It's kinda funny to watch marionettes smoking cigars after hours, or sweating when under pressure.  One of the things that I think appeals to kids about this series (and other Gerry Anderson series) is that the crafts and puppets look like toys that would be fun to play with.  The first thing my son commented on when he saw Stingray was how neat it would be to have a Stingray sub of his own.  Another thing about this program that is striking is the attention to detail and special effects.  The designers and puppeteers were obviously very serious about creating believable environments and lifelike characters.  And there is surprisingly very little recycled footage throughout the series.  Compare that to Battlestar Galactica for example, which routinely used recycled footage for their spaceship battles, and Stingray is way older than Battlestar Galactica and probably had a much smaller budget to work with.  The music is also top notch, and is very effective in bringing the emotion of scenes to life.     In all, it's a very well done and imaginative series which has aged quite well, and is a lot of fun for both boys and girls (at least mine).  It's fun for parents too.    The program has been nicely restored for DVD.  It looks great.  Hard to believe it came out in 1964.  I did have a couple of problems with my DVD's.  On a few episodes on disk 1 the sound does not track correctly and is about 1 sec behind the video.  I solved this problem by pausing it and scanning backwards to the beginning of the first explosion.  After that it tracks fine.  Also, the final episode will not play from the menu.  I had play the ending of the second to last episode and scan forward until the final starts.  Then it it plays.  I don't know if this is just a problem with the DVD's or maybe my player.  It's a minor annoyance, and not worth the bother of returning theset since I bought DVD's from an online vender for about $26.00.  Everything else plays great.

It's nice to see a toy that isn't \\"high tech\\" or \\"super educational\\"....just a good old fashion toy that lets him use his imagination, learn hands on by doing and doesn't require batteries, etc etc.  Think kids now adays don't get enough of that....everything is high tech and no chance for them to just plain be kids.

0738206709|4.0|A lot is discussed in this book, and I'd agree with Eric Raymond's comment that this is the best history of the open source movement. It starts off from Richard Stallman, GNU and \\"Free Software Foundation\\" and goes to the Mozilla foundation and the new trendy name of \\"Open Source Movement.\\" The best parts are the email excerpts from various mailing lists, which take you back into history when things were still being defined.    Of course, most of the book deals with Linux only but isn't that the best case for hackers?
B000TEMS1Q|1.0|I had this album (The CD) in my shopping cart.  When I went to pay for it - it told me I could download the album for $.99.  Why not I thought.  When I went to play it, the MP3 \\"album\\" contained only one song, the title song for the album.    Quidado - Esta \\"disco\\" en MP3 solo tiene una cancion!! No es igual de el disco DC.
B000VWYJ86|1.0|The director, camera man and editor should be fired. They took a ready-made blockbuster and had to play cute. The jiggly camera was totally unneeded. The MTV cutting made the picture a mere blur. The director OKed the whole thing. Very bad choices.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I had great expectations after reading some of the ***** reviews and I was a bit disapointed.  Promising story(I won't repeat it, you can find it in the other reviews),  very good acting, a bit of humor, not exactly science-fiction as some characterized it, a bit of action-enough to prevent you fall asleep, the old story about the sceptic who doesn't want to get involved and in the end saves the world, however when it ends you ask yourself-what is missing to make it a great movie? I'll let you decide by yourself.
B000VD9MG4|4.0|From the beginning of this film, it had an eerieness to it. The onset of the three boys on vacation, you knew some thing was going to go drasticly wrong at any time! This movie was shocking, and exciting to watch the susspence unfold...
B000003TA4|5.0|You can count on one hand the number of albums that have changed music forever: Sgt. Peppers, Dark Side of the Moon, London Calling -- add Nevermind to the list. How many 12-cut albums can you think of that are 10 cuts deep?    The genius of Nirvana (read: Cobain) was that he invented a new kind of music. The trick is not just to do something revolutionary, it's to do something revolutionary and have people identify with it. I remember buying this album because I couldn't understand the damn words to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and I thought the album would have liner notes. Mine didn't. As soon as I put it on, I knew it was something special.    If you don't think Nirvana (and particularly this album) changed music, try listening to one of the songs on this album without wishing that Kurt was still around cranking out pain-riddled, counter-culture musical poems.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|Luc Besson breaks the mold and proves that he can craft pop-culture idiosyncrasies with artistic French film making that evokes the New Wave cin&eacute;aste of François Truffaut or Jean-Luc Godard.  Hailed as a contemporary \\"[[ASIN:B000VDDDVO It's A Wonderful Life]],\\" Angel-A is a film that examines the human condition and isn't afraid to tell us that in this really screwed up world that everything is still A-OK.  In an age where we still can't seem to accept our cultural differences and struggle for individual acceptance, Besson delivers us an angel in the form of the seductive blonde vixen Angela who is about to take her life by jumping over a bridge into the Seine when she meets Andr&eacute;, a compulsive liar, thief, gambler, and loser, who despises himself so much that he wants to end his life too.  Together they save each other and discover who they both really are.  It's a complete 180 from the visceral violence of [[ASIN:B00008ZZ9E La Femme Nikita]] or [[ASIN:B0006GVJEE Leon - The Professional]] but it will make you feel alive and appreciate the important things in life we take for granted.  With a penchant for casting unforgettably strong lead female talent ala Milla Jovavich, Anne Parillaud and Natalie Portman, Besson again does not disappoint with the spot-on casting of Danish actress Rie Rasmussen who both charms and seduces us with her amazing performance as Angela and whose career is destined to take flight.
1401302378|5.0|This book is relevant to business today and is insightful in its numerous examples and explanations. Although the reader understands the author's thesis of \\"The Long Tail\\" within the first chapter of the book, the following 200 pages are not unnecessary recountings of that same thesis. Instead, Anderson follows the implications and consequences of The Long Tail in sales, marketing, trends in consumer behavior and how companies must understand why selling less of more will be the key to survival in the upcoming decades to come.<br /><br />The book's downfall, however, may be that it focuses solely on a few key companies that have helped to usher in the digital age of unlimited varities and choices where the consumer is king and countless niches are the new mainstream blockbusters. The book is enjoyable and entertaining and resonated with me as a frequent visitor to Amazon, a user of iTunes and avid blogger. Young or old, anyone in business today should have an understanding of how The Long Tail and the companies that benefit from it has and will continue to change our lives.

B00005JPTI|3.0|Will Smith stars on the fourth adaptation of Matheson's book I Am Legend. The movie, which is set in 2009-2012, fails to entertain most of the time.     After a doctor discovers the cure for cancer (2009), evertyhing seems to be right until some of the patients star dying out of this cure. The results?  99% of the population of Earth infected with only 1% of the whole world immune, if anything.     Three years after the infection has taken place (2012), Robert Neville (Will Smith), is one of the only, if  not the only, survivor from this deadly virus, who is trying to find a cure for the \\"cure\\". Called the KV, this virus, does not kill the human, but it turns them in to what the movie describes as \\"dark seekers\\".    The movie fails on evolving past anything. Not only does the movie take a while to develop, but the development if not clear enough. The movie becomes slow, and not much goes on (and how can it when the characters are: Smith, Sam:The Dog, and Mannequins). Once the \\"dark seekers\\" are introduced, the movie does pick its pace up a little bit, but this is not until after 50 minutes through the movie.     The movie is unclear on how humans change from human-like, to not human at all. The script is dull, acting is so-so, and effects might make you jump out of the your seat once in a while. What we have here is a sci-fi/horror flick that is neither sci-fi or horror, its more like a slow-drama with mutants.    Please try and avoid this movie, just if possible. Just remember \\"God didn't make this, we did\\" and that's whats Neville believes.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|Great pixar movie! We watched this at friend's house,and for some reason, all adults loved it, but little kid hated it :)
B0000067L2|5.0|I just received this in the mail today(thanks [...] again).I still have my old vinyl copy of this and actually bought a copy of Cream Gold which I recommend to people who want a mixture of the best of Cream's studio and live releases. But I had to have \\"Disreali Gears\\"  as I remembered it on that old slab of vinyl.<br /><br />This to me is a landmark release for many reasons:\\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\"- NOTHING sounded like this back when it came out (I was 10 at the time and dug surf, soul and British Invasion stuff),DG was recorded in just 3 days(the bands visa for their US tour was about to expire) thanks to Tom Dowd and Felix Pappalardi and this is the introduction to us mortals of Clapton's Woman Tone and Wah Wah work(Hendrix was digging this as well-Up From The Skies anyone?).\\"We're Going Wrong\\" is the supreme use of the Woman Tone(along with tremendous feel and note choice) as well as \\"Outside Woman Blues\\",\\"SWABLR\\" and \\"Take It Back\\"(the intro any way).<br /><br />The funny thing is,the same day I received Disraeli Gears I also received the latest Fender sales booklet \\"Fender Frontline At Home\\" with guess who on the cover? None other  than the great one, Eric Clapton(pretty cosmic). After all this time it finally dawned on me that the TBX circuit in his signature Strats is trying to cop the Woman Tone from Disraeli Gears. Sorry,Eric. Too fuzzy.The clarity is not the same.<br /><br />This release also shows Eric's love for Albert King's playing as can be heard in the leads for \\"Strange Brew\\" and \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\".Can't forget the most powerful rhythm section of their time,maybe all time, Jack Bruce on Bass and vocals and Ginger Baker on Drums and vocals(?).Jack's \\"Dance The Night Away\\" is a great example of this man's bass playing,song writing and arranging skills.I love the counterpoint work during the chorus with ascending and descending vocal melodies happening at the same time.Even Ginger's \\"Blue Condition\\" is a good track with a bluesy,swinging feel and Ginger on vocals.I can dig it.<br /><br />ANYWAY,if you just want to replace your worn out vinyl or wonder what all the fuss was about this needs to be in your collection.One of the all time greatest rock records.dig it.    ANYWAY,if you just want to replace your worn out vinyl or wonder what all the fuss was about this needs to be in your collection.One of the all time greatest rock records.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|After reading the reviews, I ordered this and it came before Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving afternoon, after the kitchen was clear and the only murmors were groans, I put this on in the living room for a group of people who ranged from 8 to 80.    We were marvelously entertained. If you like to eat, or you like to cook, you will enjoy this movie. It is very easy to forget this is an animated movie, because the characters are so full, and the interaction is believable.    It has a surprising ending, which is particuarly satisfied becuase it is not saccharine as most \\"cartoons\\" are. The movie was so good, we all sat around with coffee and desert afterwards and talked about it, lauging again at various parts.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|Finally the film El-Cid comes on dvd.    I sincerely hope that they have done a better job with the restoration of the movie when it was first released on laserdisc by the Critirion collection.The picture quality is not very good some dirt and scratches are clearly visible here and there. The sound is not good either and the intermission card is not to be seen. Lets hope that the Weinstein company is wiser to correct all this, then the above mentioned company . I believe, and not very sure they will use most of the extra's taken directly from the laserdisc version, but still a treat for everyone who has never seen it before.  The interview with Sophia Loren is not to be found on laserdisc at all, that's great news for people who love this picture.    I have however one point to consider, on the laserdisc version the son of Miklos Rozsa tells the viewer I quote: \\"even we go to the deepest archives the music is married to the surround channels\\". In other words, there are no original mastertapes of the music recording available after the film was released.I wonder if the Weinstein company did find (somehow) the orginal music tapes and have corrected this mistake.    In his book \\"A double life\\" of Miklos Rozsa tells his readers that his music was cut several times during scenes and that the music was put back in volume in favour of the soundeffects. The sound was edited by Vera Fields, who happens to be later the film editor of \\"Jaws\\" and won a oscar for it. Mr. Rozsa was absolutly not pleased what they had done with his score on his almost last big epic movie. Lets hope that they have solved this problem as well.    This movie was shot in 70mm technirama technicolor process, the film runs through the filmprojector almost the same as 35mm but was projected horizental. One frame has 8 sprocket holes.     Anyway, I'm looking forward to see it as soon as it's released on dvd.It includes also \\"55 days of Peking\\" \\"The fall of the Roman empire\\"and \\"Circus world\\" in the near future. Thank you Weinstein! These films were all produced by the late Samuel Bronston in Spain, he did a marvelous job to do so.I will remember you forever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0143038419|4.0|I think this book was an insightful portrayal of a woman's quest to find herself.  What I particularly liked about it was her sense of humor and humility. Although the author struggled with some life defining issues and depression she never claimed that she was representitive of every woman's experience and didn't project her experience on everyone.  It was inspiring to me.

Had it not been for the very distinctive sound of Simon LeBon's voice, I would have missed this as a DD album. Astronaut was beyond fabulous, especially given the long dry spell since the release of the Wedding album in 1993. Coming on the heels of that, Red Carpet Massacre is, well, a bit of a disappointment. While you can wade through the overproduction and find a few gems, it's work. (Check out Box Full of Honey for a glimpse of Duran Duran as themselves and not some tricked out, generic dance floor wannabes.) God save me from Timberlake and Timbaland! Guys, you were doing just fine without them.
031286504X|2.0|I bought this book in anticipation of the film starring Will Smith. I must say it was a very short story. I continued on into the short stories afterward thinking I was still reading I am Legend, only to quickly realize they had nothing to do with it. I was very disappointed. I suppose I should have looked over some of the other customer reviews first.<br /><br />I would not have bought this had I known that merely half the book is I am Legend. I gave it 2 stars because at least what I read was interesting enough. I hope the movie is better and doesn't end the way the book did.
B00102F5WK|2.0|This movie was actually split into two stories. It seemed like one of them was the original premise of the movie and the other was thrown in last minute to take advantage of the current political climate. The first follows a young girl who finds herself entangled with a young boy who is involved in an Islamic terrorist group. The other follows an Arab-American who is taken to another country (Egypt if I remember correctly) for interrogation after intelligence found phone numbers in his call list that were tied to known terrorist numbers.    It is this latter story line that really falls apart. First of all, they are completely misrepresenting the premise of Rendition. Rendition is used when a suspected terrorist is caught OFF AMERICAN SOIL, which limits their rights to what we know as due process since technically they are not an American prisoner. Rendition is basically just a way to get information quicker instead of bringing them back to the United States and going through the judicial system, you take advantage of the fact that you found the person in another country and you keep them there or fly them to another country for interrogation. In this movie, the character is arrested in an American airport, and he is magically erased from the record by clicking a mouse button on a computer terminal. Of course the movie makers forget about paper trails, the eye witnesses, etc.    Then through the entire movie, they are supposed to convince you that this person is in fact innocent, and is being held unjustly. But of course, typical political movie, they do this through emotion instead of through actual facts because they NEVER really explain why he had those phone calls from those numbers. Never did he simply say \\"oh, that number is my uncle's\\" through the entire movie, we all know he had calls from these numbers, but every time they show him the number or mentions it, all he ever says is \\"I don't know.\\" Come on, I understand it's hard to remember all numbers especially now that you have them all saved on your cell phone, but at least attempt to explain. Even by the end of the movie, they never really explained it. They simply briefly mentioned something about numbers being disposable and they hoped you would buy into that \\"coincidence\\" junk and not think about it any further.    For me, this was a cop-out. They couldn't find a witty way to explain away these things in a way that would justify the mistaken identity and his innocence at the same time, so instead they just throw in a lot of sensationalism to stir up emotions to try to take your attention away from these obvious loop holes. I'm sorry if I give away a spoiler here, I guess skip over this paragraph if you don't want to hear anything. Another loop hole is the fact that they claim there's a fail-safe in case a bomber ever changes his mind about blowing himself up, a gunman would shoot him and set off the explosive that way (when the detonator switch is released and the spoon releases the striker). So in the movie, the bomber and the gunman watching him, are both within 50 meters of their intended target, and the gunman has a CLEAR shot at BOTH the bomber, AND the intended target. When the gunman saw that the bomber might not go through with it, why did he even bother shooting the bomber when you have a clear and easy shot at the target itself??? When you watch the movie, you'll see what I mean; the gunman could have EASILY taken out the target since the target was not moving, outdoors, with no cover...    Anyway, the movie is mildly entertaining, primarily the side story with the girl and the terrorist boy, but other than that, the plot is full of holes and over dramatic unrealistic acting from Reese Witherspoon, at no fault of her own, the script is just full of the typical over-romanticized, overly dramatic dialogue that if not performed in a similar fashion would seem very corny. And then Meryl Streep's character is supposed to play some high role in the Pentagon and this lawyer gets her to admit to Rendition's role in the main character's disappearance within 3 lines. I mean seriously, high ranking government officials like that are much better at denying things and being persistent in keeping information from falling into the wrong hands than that. But apparently it's easy to get her to admit to anything. Again, this seemed like a cop-out, it's like they were not able to think of a smart way for this lawyer to find this out on his own so he simply approaches the source directly and within 25 seconds of questioning gets her to open up and basically disclose top secret information to him. Maybe he's just a playboy like that, lol.
B000005RMJ|5.0|Possibly the best Supertramp CD you never heard.    Every song on this CD kills - and this is AS GOOD as Crime of the Century.    No kidding.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I might be making a bold claim saying this is the best Bill Murray film of them all. Many people would call me on that with films that showcase his sophomoric hijinks like Stripes or Ghostbusters. Some may look at his more slightly more refined character works like What About Bob? and Scrooged as their hits. To me Groundhog Day tops them all. This is because not only do you have Bill Murray doing a perfect performance, but also because the content itself (and the writing behind it) takes this movie to the next level.     Groundhog Day is a morality piece done in the vein of a classic Rod Serling's Twilight Zone episode. I kind of \\"what if...?\\" sort of tale that puts a generally successful and selfish man (played by Murray) into a hopeless situation of never being able to escape a single day in a small town. On the surface the story it looks like a situation comedy with Murray's character living the same Groundhog Day over and over. However the further you go into the movie you get some true and believable character development. The fact Bill pulls it off convincingly as well as with his classic entertaining wit is what makes the movie shine.     Don't think of the movie as just some lesson to learn and take with you. While it does have that they don't preach it to you. You figure the lessons out along with Phil (Murray), and that makes for a rather deep experience. The movie at its core is a comedy, and it's such a good comedy it's rating among the top comedies of all time by various film associations. It's not just a comedy either as it also has a healthy dose of romance in it. So much romance that it can pass off as a \\"chick flick\\" for those who are into that. So I guess you can say Groundhog Day is a romantic comedy/Twilight-Zonesque/morality play.     The other actors do great as well, including co-star Andie MacDowell, supporting actors Chris Elliot (as the cameraman), Brian Doyle-Murray (mayor of the city) Stephen Tobolowsky (old high school associate) and others. The movie was directed by Murray's cohort in Ghostbusters and Stripes Harold Ramis, which makes me wonder if the role was made for Bill. Production itself is very solid. You won't find it winning awards for costumes, sets or special effects. At the same time you won't find any production values detracting from the story; they only serve to enhance it.     This 15th Anniversary Edition will be digitally remastered (overseen by Ramis himself) and will include a host of special features including:    - Commentary by director Harold Ramis (not sure if it's a new commentary or if it will be the same commentary from the last Special Edition DVD)    - The Study of Groundhogs: A Real Life Look at Marmots    - A Different Day: An Interview with Harold Ramis    - Making of Documentary    - Weight of Time documentary    - Newly discovered deleted scenes    The Weight of Time documentary was in the Special Edition DVD, but aside from that and the commentary this DVD has all new special features. The fact there are deleted scenes on this edition is enough to make me very curious on what we missed.     This movie is a must have. Any Bill Murray fan should be required to see this movie. As far as which version to get I would say the 15th Anniversary Edition, at it is the best bang for your buck. If only they didn't use such an overly airbrushed picture for the cover. That is about the only thing about this DVD that stinks.
B000002MIY|5.0|Nobody doesn't like this CD.     If you're driving from Maine to LA - this is ONE of the CDs you gotta have..    Show up to the next great party with this as the undiscovered gem and every one will think you're quite the audiophile.    This CD is every bit AS GOOD as Nightfly.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Timeless classic holiday film. Gives you a real family holiday film. Not the\\"made up family\\" stuff.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|After seeing this lady on PBS and then just having to get thie CD, I am a true convert!  While I'm not crazy about the first cut on the disk, I am mesmerized by the remainder and have intrigued my co-workers with new choice of music in my office.  Loreena has a most ethereal and soothing quality to her voice.  I cannot wait to acquire more of her music.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|Overall I really enjoyed this movie and disc.    The movie is something people will either take or leave as it returns the original flavor to the Die Hard movies.  There is very little substance but tons of action!  Often mindless, over the top action... which reminds me a lot of the earlier Die Hard movies.  I honestly liked Die Hard with a Vengence better, because it went on a little more story and was carried by Samuel L. Jackson and his chemistry with Willis.      Your mileage may vary.    The disc itself is a solid presentation.  Nothing about the features and content will blow you away, but it's not lacking in extras.  As has been said this is not the director's cut of the movie, but honestly if you didn't know that it wouldn't affect your opinion of the movie.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Annie Lenox has never let me down and this CD delivers all of her best and more. Just buy it , put it in your player and enjoy, you wont be disapointed.
B0000028TN|5.0|This was my intro to George Duke, what a great album!    Whether you like Braziliam music, jazz,rock, or fusion you'll enjoy this relaxed yet intensely produced effort by multi--keyboardist, vocalist Duke.  Everything about the CD is perfection including the song order and guest musicians Airto, Flora Purim, and contrary to another reviewer Milton Nascimento (he's on one of the last tracks, I believe).    Crank this one up, put on your sunglasses, open a Corona and enjoy a wonderful jazz-rock Brazilian-tinted experience!  Then do it again.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|We watched this video with 12 of our friends after the Thanksgiving Day feast.  It kept us interested and entertained throughout the movie...a difficult task after consuming 1000's of calories.  We'll have this movie as a new Thanksgiving Day tradition...though I have watched it 3 more times since this Turkey Day.
1592289444|4.0|This book is incredible, incredible not as a true story that is.  I must say, after reading this book I was intrigued with the subject matter and went on to read other non-fiction books about the Gulag system in the USSR (the best of these is the Gulag Archipelago by Solzhenitsyn and Gulag by Anna Applebaum).These two books are much more accurate.      The Long Walk is not a true story.  There are no records of such people mentioned in the story as existing, and more importantly, nowhere is there any record of a group of soviet prisnors entering India.      This does not mean that the story has no meaning.  It is a story of survival and a story of legal manipulation and savagry on the part of the USSR under Stalin.      There is controversy surrounding this book, as you can find on the web.  Read this book for what it is, a cleaverly written and exciting piece of non-fiction, and nothing more than that.
B000PKG7I4|2.0|This is the first album recordered before \\"Back to Black\\" but released afterward in the US.  There was a reason.  Some (that's some, not all)very weak orchestrations with percussion (bamboo sticks?) right out of my son's pre-school band.  Suggest sampling and downloading tracks.  BIG  fans will like this CD, but it is a prequel to the more pop \\"Black\\".
0143038419|5.0|I picked this up at an airport to have something to read on my flight.  It initially appealed to me because it was about travel and a personal and spiritual search.  I couldn't put the book down.  I absolutely related to her in so many ways, causing me to tear up several times throughout.  I finished the book and then told everyone I know how much it changed my life.    To those people who gave it a negative review--just look at the numbers of positive...she must have affected many, many people...she's even touring the country to speak about it in the spring.  If you have ever questioned religion, want to find spirituality, feel lost, have trouble with love...Read this book!
1878424505|4.0|This book was given to me by a friend along with FREE YOUR MIND: the Four Directions to an Awakened Life-All I can say is that 'four' must be a holy number-both authors provide dynamic insight into the power of our thoughts to free us from depression and anxiety-a great new year gift combo!

He couldn't believe how many DVDs came with it.  We will have to make a day and watch them all.  Anyone who is a Sci Fi fan should definitely get this. It's amazing!!
0751532711|3.0|i was plesantly suprised with this book, it was easy to read and enjoyable. it suprised me that i liked it becase i dont really care for these types of books.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I loved the fact that there was cooking involved, & that it happens in Paris, such a beautiful city....I was a bit squimish of the fact that the HERO of this movie, is a RAT!!!! I don't like mice, so I like rats even less...& he acted like a rat...He was NOT cute & fussy, like other Disney characters...That took a bit of getting used to.  But the movie was charming, I enjoyed it!
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Great finale to a wonderful show.  It's definately worth buying the season and watching them in order to understand the characters and their struggles and triumphs.  The final season was as unexpected and believable as each of the previous seasons with a surprising yet satisfying finish.  I only wish they would do a season VIII.
1592402038|5.0|Lynne Truss has succeeded in bringing the droll subject of punctuation to life, in a style that I can only begin to give credit to here.  The author writes in an aggressive style that reveals her beyond-passionate belief in the importance of correct punctuation.  This author does more than write, she convinces the reader she's on a mission.  At times you can even feel the author's anger over misuse of punctuation rules.      Ms. Truss uses many amusing illustrations of bad punctuation to make her points.  After reading those illustrations, I was appalled that while I could see many of the errors she was pointing out, some escaped my brain altogether (you'll see why I was appalled when you get to my last paragraph).    While many may think correct punctuation is somewhat of a trivial nature (and maybe it often is), Ms. Truss points out to us through one example that comma placement in a significant biblical verse has indeed caused a tremendous interpretation difference among various religious denominations.  If I dare say it, this interpretation difference is truly of biblical proportions (read page 74 of the book to see what I mean).  She uses many other examples to show that a change of comma here, or a missing semicolon there, can lead to a major change of meaning for a passage.    If I haven't already made it too clear, I do recommend this book for a fun read.  I can also recommend it for your professional bookshelf, as I'm a high school writing teacher.  I believe this book can be used as a tool for showing students, in a fun and insightful way, why we should trouble ourselves to observe the laws of proper punctuation.  I plan to refer to it often in my work.
B000VSBX34|3.0|Starring the Beatles, Help! has one of the best soundtracks of all time. Well reproduced in DTS 5.1, the title track, Ticket to Ride, I Need You, Another Girl, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away, and The Night Before never sounded so great! Musically and cinematically, the video sequences of the songs are classic Beatles and make up the appealing portions of this motion picture.    As for the rest, the plot had potential, but bad acting and poor dialogue, both of which were apparently due to lack of effective directing and production, marred what could have been something substantially more than just a campy masterpiece. The way that the perpetual fight and chase scenes were laid out indicated to me that there were those in charge who were looking for a cheap product that they could use to bank off of Beatlemania.    To make a longwinded criticism short, think of the worst Avengers episodes you have ever seen, especially the post-Diana Rigg ones. By comparison, this movie is arguably more inane. And I believe that had the Beatles been a much less talented quartet, their careers and legacies, both on screen and on stage, might not have endured. Forgive me if these words are harsh, but I tried to find the slightest merits other than the musical numbers and kept coming up short. Oh, the tyranny of unreason!    Still, the Beatles' music will always be the greatest, and, again, in 5.1, continues to flourish throughout the new dimensions and formats. Long live Ringo, John, Paul & George!
B000UFAURI|5.0|In the mid-90's, I saw the Foo Fighters on the \\"Color and Shape\\" tour.  At the time, I was particularly discouraged by the state of live music.  I genuinely felt that the time for drums and guitars had ended, and that I should \\"gird my loins\\" for the next wave of musical expression, as previously exemplified by early `90s bands such as EMF and Jesus Jones.<br /><br />Attending this show singlehandedly reinvigorated my belief in rock and roll.  Eloquently enough, nearly a decade later I still find the Foos engaging.  The Foo Fighters are a band that has inexplicably stood the test of time in the same way that U2 and Peter Gabriel did in the early 90s.  While their reinvention may not be as obvious as their predecessors, it still situates them as one of the great and longlasting bands in the increasingly fickle musical landscape of today.<br /><br />The beauty in the new Foo album lies in the way in which it navigates dynamics, songwriting, and energy.  Even in its mellower moments, the \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience, & Grace\\" brims with a subdued tension that is only relieved by explosive energy.  The way in which Grohl and his cohorts navigate the dichotomy between soothing lullaby and devastating intensity within song form (in the micro) and the overall album (in the macro) expresses a compositional maturity that belies the \\"rock\\" format within which they are categorized<br /><br />For the careful listener, \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience, & Grace\\" is driven by subtle melodic polyphony.  We're not talking counterpoint here, but the interplay between bass and lead vocal on \\"Erase/Replace\\" and rhythm guitar and vocal on \\"The Pretender\\" exhibit a certain compositional depth.  To get much more complex would question the Foo's status as \\"rock\\" music.<br /><br />And undeniably, The Foo Fighters' new album is, to its core, rock music. Who would have thought that, out of the ashes of the band that defined the `90s, a band that defines \\"rock\\" music through the strength of their vision would continue to be both relevant and eloquent?  Perhaps the one criticism that can be leveled is their use of repetition and dynamic build-up for climax.  Several songs on the album use this technique.  However, there are also songs that are just loud, and others that are just, well, less loud (read: guitars are not distorted).  Overall, it creates a relatively diverse acoustic environment.<br /><br />The lowdown:  Here's where melody, songwriting, and raw energy meet.  I have had this album in my car for almost a month now, and I'm to the point of feeling guilty about removing it.  I seem to enjoy it every time.levant and eloquent?

031286504X|5.0|Great all around. Suspenseful. Grips you right up to the end, and you'll be surprised.<br /><br />What didn't come across to me before buying the book is that \\"I Am Legend\\" is only the first 80% of the novel. The remainder is a series of unrelated short stories. I was confused and tried to link those stories to the main material at first; then I realized that they were separate works.<br /><br />The short stories are worth the purchase price alone, they're interesting, thought provoking glimpses into other worlds. Their subject matter ranges from humor, to war; from surreal, to outright horror. Each one is self-contained and leaves your imagination free to turn the story around in your head afterwards.<br /><br />Very satisfying read.
B00079HZUM|4.0|***1/2 2004. Directed by Richard Eyre. Subtle and smart variation about the paradox of the actors who must express feelings they don't sense. Two years before shooting [[ASIN:B000NIVJFY Notes on a Scandal]], Richard Eyre already delivered a little jewel. Recommended.
0618680004|1.0|Appealing to Richard Dawkins for insight into religion or religious beliefs is like asking George W. Bush for his views on evolutionary biology. What little insight can be gleaned from Dawkins has already been said over 2 centuries ago by David Hume. But Dawkins, who revels in his own iconoclastic rhetoric, seems to glory in his attacks on religion and the people it produces.      Unfortunately, Dawkins' examples of the mainstream religious believer is neither accurate nor helpful in illuminating the problems of religion.  The book is basically an extended \\"straw man\\" argument misrepresenting anyone who has ever held a notion even remotely sympathetic to religion.      Although the style is entertaining, Dawkins' rhetorical skills-which are amazing- stands in an inverse relationship to his intellectual depth. Ad hominem arguments, non sequiturs, and false dichtomies litter the pages and draw the reader away from any substantive point he might have made. Logical fallacies are substituted for the hard work of academic rigor and fairness.  The book is a shallow, poorly reasoned attempt at giving himself some intellectual credibility in a field he knows nothing about, nor cares to educate himself about.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|This is Annie's finest solo album to date - eleven killer tracks that showcase the range of her songwriting and voice.  Annie delivers the goods and then some.  Listen to her stretch her bluesy voice on \\"Love Is Blind\\" and \\"Ghosts In My Machine\\" and you'll wonder why she didn't try this kind of stuff sooner.  This album is packed full of hits you'll never hear on the radio, but won't regret buying.  Also featured here is the charity song \\"Sing\\" featuring Madonna and a host of other female stars, all joining their voices to to bring attention to the African AIDS genocide.  \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" showcases an artist at her absolute peak and does not disappoint.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|This was probably the awfullest movie I've ever seen.  There is no plot, the dialog is forgettable (such as it is), the camera work was probably designed to hide a non-existent or low-budget set; besides that, it gave me vertigo; and scientifically, the idea that the movie was centered around was totally absurd.<br /><br />Imagine thinking that an atomic bomb - even one as \\"big as the island of Manhattan\\" - would have any effect on the sun (if it were dying) whatsoever.  Obviously, the script writers had not a single clue about the sun, how it works, how big it is; geeze, that stupid ideas is like talking about a flea crawling up the back leg of an elephant with rape on its mind!  Ridiculous!<br /><br />I can only say that I sat through it because I was having a foot massage...
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I bought this CD today and when I played it every song I listen to sounded different. Then I relised that this is top music and awsome singing from phil collins who is older than his last tour which was The way we walk 1999. The good thing about this is that they sing all there classic songs like turn it on again, no son of mine tonight tonight tonight and invisible touch. There is a new version of throwing it all away. to finish it off they finally sing the Carpet Crawlers song LIVE This is a awsome CD and I recomened this to any genesis fan.
1905236042|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! It teaches young ones about yoga and breathing with great illustrations. This is an awesome book for parents and children to bond with as well. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who have children!
B00074CBMY|4.0|Joe Cocker can still make an entertaining album. Great mix of songs!    I like the arrangements of many of these songs, and Joe Cocker with his huge talent is able to use his more limited vocal range well.    The main complaint I have is that some of the instruments sound programmed and sampled. But overall worth owning and listening to.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Mona Lisa Smile starring Julia Roberts tries to be an inspiring film about young women making a difference in society but it fails to deliver that message. Robert's performance isn't so motivating especially since she's playing a college professor, her character doesn't teach the girls any valuable information, she preaches rather than giving them heartfelt advice. The supporting cast falls flat as well especially Kirsten Dunst but Gennifer Goodwin does shine in her role. Don't expect much from Mona Lisa Smile, feminisism is a more powerful tool than this film has to offer.

B00005JPNW|4.0|Lyra Belacqua (Richards) is an orphan.  Her only living relative is Lord Asriel (Craig), a powerful and respected man.  She lives at a college, and one day Ms. Coulter (Kidman) is there attending a meeting.  Ms. Coulter picks Lyra to take a trip with her up north.  Although excited to see the ice bears, she is reluctant to leave when her best friend Rober (Walker) is taken away by the Gobblers, a mysterious group of people stealing children.  Before she leaves, the Master of Jordan College gives her an alethiometer.  She is told it will reveal the truth of things to her, but she must not tell Ms. Coulter about it.  When life with Ms. Coulter turns out to not be not what she expected, she runs away to look for her friend Roger.  Lyra though, may be the child of the witches' prophecy, and destined for greater things.<br /><br />There is more to \\"The Golden Compass\\" than this, and it all moves pretty fast.  In fact, the film could have used an extra 15-20 minutes of running time to feel less rushed.  Religious undertones from the novel have all been removed, and it will be interesting to see how they continue to pull this off if the final two films in the trilogy get made.  Richards is good as Lyra,  bringing her sassiness and enthusiasm from page to screen successfully.  Kidman is perfect as the evil Ms. Coulter.  Craig has limited screen time but gets the job done as well.  Aside from the running time, the other problem is the lack of an ending.  The end was chopped off to give it a happier ending, and presumably the footage will show up in the next film if it gets made.  Without it though, the film feels a bit incomplete.  \\"The Golden Compass\\" is not a movie for everyone, and fans of the book may find themselves disappointed.  Still, it is worth seeing.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I saw this concert in Las Vegas in September, 2007 and enjoyed watching this DVD just as much as, if not more than, watching the live concert itself.  This DVD comes very close to replicating both the visual and audio impact of the actual concert.    Celine Dion gives a super performance, but the concert is much more than just the vocals - - the songs are woven into an elaborate Las Vegas style stage production.  The concert venue, the Coliseum at Caesar's Palace, was built specifically for this show, which opened in 2003 and closed in December, 2007.  The arena has 4,000 seats placed in a semi circle around an immense stage.  The seats are positioned so that no seat is more than 120 feet from the stage.    The stage production was arranged by Franco Dragone, a Belgian film and theater director.  Before \\"A New Day,\\" he directed the Las Vegas Cirque De Soleil productions of \\"Mystere\\" and \\"O.\\"   It is therefore not surprising that dancers perform during virtually every song.  The troupe has about 60 dancers, but they rarely all appear on stage at the same time.  The dancing is accompanied by magnificent stage effects, which feature, among other things, a tree sprouting from the stage; dancers gently dropping from the rafters on swings and other props; a man riding a bicycle into the sky (much as ET did in the movie); dancers floating above the stage in large picture frames; floating dancers pushing floating street lights; and, last but not least, a grand piano complete with a piano player floating above the stage floor.   This DVD does an excellent job of capturing both the dancing and elaborate staging, while not compromising the video of Celine Dion performing.    Celine sings a total of 18 songs.  The set begins with seven of her biggest hits: A New Day Has Come, The Power of Love, It's All Coming Back to Me Now, Because You Loved Me, To Love You More, I'm Alive and I Drove All Night.  She then sings the less familiar \\"Seduces Me\\" and \\"If I Could.\\"   This is followed by her biggest French language hit \\"Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore,\\" \\"I Surrender,\\" and an Italian language song \\"Ammore Annascunnuto.\\"  Following this, she sings two Frank Sinatra songs: \\"All The Way\\" and \\"I've Got the World on a String\\" (during which she is accompanied in part by old video of Sinatra singing.)  Next is \\"I Wish,\\" \\"Love Can Move Mountains,\\" and \\"River Deep, Mountain High.\\"  The finale is the theme song from Titanic \\"My Heart Can Go On.\\"  Celine's voice is clear and powerful throughout the show and she delivers each song with perfection.    There are several bonus features of interest on the second disk in this DVD set: the first is a behind the scenes rundown of the entire show, starting at the point where Celine leaves her Las Vegas home and is driven in a limo to Caesar's Palace.  The feature follows pre show preparations and, while the concert is in progress, shows some of the back stage activity including costume changes, performers running to get in the correct position for the next song and a depiction of how dancers and stage props float across the stage and down from the rafters, etc.  The second \\"extra\\" tells the history of the production, starting with Celine meeting Franco Dragone and the development of the idea of Celine performing a long run engagement in Las Vegas.  It then details a series of significant events, such as designing and building the theater, recruiting and auditioning cast members, and opening night in 2003.  The information is furnished mostly through interviews with Celine, her managers, Dragone, and cast members.    The bottom line is that this is a great concert DVD.  If you enjoy Celine Dion's music, you will not make a mistake buying this one - the performance is mesmerizing.
B0002X314C|5.0|Seriously, it's one of the best debut albums I've ever heard.  Almost all the songs are standouts.  Definitely worth the cash spent.
B000AMMSQC|5.0|Finally, there is a production of Swan Lake that doesn't absolutely depress me or put me to sleep, if you can imagine such a thing.  Unlike La Scala's production of Giselle, the orchestral score is outstanding and if you are a Maxwell Parrish fan, as I am, the sets take one back to a time of mythical bliss.  Quite frankly, this production fits the story line of Swan Lake as I have always imagined it should be in my head.  I have seen Fonteyne's and Makharova's performances and Baryshnikov's choreography and all three left me numb . . . in fact, I couldn't finish watching any to the end (we were live for Baryshnikov's premiere).  I am not normally a Zakharova fan but she hit the part right on, and I still say that Roberto Bolle is underestimated for his technical skill.  What a thrill and delight to see these two performing together, plus the corps de ballet were near perfection.  Now, I can enjoy watching this over and over again.  And I must confess--for those who have read my other critiques--the camera person has not been at fault on my recently acquired DVDs for cutting off the footwork of the danseurs; my remote control had reset my plasma screen for zoom viewing without my knowing.  Now, I have had the satisfaction of going back and watching the performances of La Scala's Giselle and Bolshoi's The Pharoah's Daughter again without the stress of having the critical footwork chopped off at the bottom of my screen.

B0006J28L4|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this film, \\"Malcolm X\\" -- I saw it several times at the theaters when it came out in Japan around 1993 and now again, on this two-disc DVD special edition -- I still come to the same conclusion: This film is, for me, by far the best and most important movie that has ever come out of Hollywood.    It is the story of one man's journey through life, but it is much more than that: It is the story of a family, a society, a nation -- indeed the world in which we all live. As its foundation, the story of Malcolm X is as American as apple pie and the U.S. flag, but it crosses cultures and transcends national boundaries to speak to the strength of the human spirit as a whole.    I would like to thank director Spike Lee and all those persons who invested their time, energy and resources to see this film to completion. The original struggle to make this film only makes it that much more meaningful and appreciated these many years later. The heart and soul that the filmmakers and financial backers gave to this film shine through after all this time like the sun. Though essentially snubbed by the reigning Hollywood masters of imagery, this film is truly one for the ages and it will pass the test of time where most other Hollywood productions fail. To Spike and the \\"Malcolm X\\" filmmaking family: Thank you for creating this film and presenting it to the world.    To those who are thinking of buying this two-disc special edition of \\"Malcolm X\\": First, pick up a copy at a bookstore or a library of the book \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\" written by the real Malcolm X and Alex Haley, and read it through. Then, buy this DVD. And after that, if you've got a mind to, go out and make history by changing the world around you in a positive way. That is the way to keep the spirit of Malcolm X alive forever.

B000RO9PXC|5.0|Of all the live shows I have had the opportunity to listen to, this is my favorite of the Doors. A lot of the reviews complain about Jim slurring words and being out of control but this is much of what Jim became as he and the Doors evolved. You see all sides of Jim in this performance but the second show is not to be missed. The concert gives you a true feeling of what it might have been like to be there live and it provides a true feeling of the times. Jim talks about politics, democracy, astrology and you even here some of his poetic side. The sound of the band is quite clear on most of this recording and I have been happily cranking this one up on my morning commute the past few weeks. If you are a true Doors fan, this performance is one you do not want to miss.
0143038583|5.0|I really loved this book. Parts of it will make you want to spend extra on better quality foods even if you don't have the money or the prep time. I worked on farms in highschool and we raised pasture animals. I knew about grain feeding but didn't know the reasons behind it and while I had heard of factory farms in theory...I never saw one. The closest we got was seeing factory slaughter houses. In agriculture class they paint a much more benevolent picture of American agriculture. It was great to see a different perspective which makes a lot more sense than what I was taught in school.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|hello-mine is more of a question-based on the 'product information' on SM 3 (only)-the technical information says= aspect ratio is 2:40:1 which is LETTEBOX (black bars on top/bottom) of a WS TV.  BUT when I click on the SM TRILOGY and check the 'product information' it says-number of discs=3, aspect ratio 1:85:1 which is WS but NOT LETTERBOX-so no bars on the top/bottom    can someone who owns the trilogy please answer this before i decide what to purchase if the trilogy is 1:85:1 or is not.  thank you
0060855924|5.0|Terry Pratchett has become one of the most popular authors alive today and his popularity is richly deserved. But not even with his fertile mind could ever have envisaged the heights to which his Discworld series would rise. This book first published in 1982 is the start of the Discworld novels and to a degree it is amazing that these books have achieved such popularity.    You would think that a fantasy world full of trolls, zombies, witches, vampires would be an alien concept to most readers. Werewolves and dwarves in the Ankh Morpork city watch. Wizards running a university. All this to come in future episodes. Surely this style of writing would have a limited readership? but no the books are loved by anybody and everybody and are read by people who would not normally allow fantasy fiction on to their book shelves. This is the Discworld of terry Pratchett.    This first book in the series is about a wizard who is plagued by spells that don't always work and if they do, they do not always achieve the ends he had in mind. His meeting with Twoflower a 'tourist' makes for hilarious reading.

B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw this movie this summer, because my brother was going through a magician phase and watched every movie he could find that included magicians. It didn't really appeal to me (not then, anyway). But as I watched, it caught me up in its web, and as I sat there entangled, I couldn't hold back my amazement.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece of a movie, in writing, in casting, in acting, in suspense, in directing, and in setting. The story is of two rival magicians: Alfred Borden and Robert Angier, originally partners but now bitter enemies after a tragedy that ripped one's life apart. Now they are out to sabotage each other's careers in whatever way they can, desperate to become the best magician in England. Angier is the showman, while Borden has the ingenious ideas, and when Angier sees Borden perform an underproduced but mind-bogglingly brilliant trick -- \\"The best I've ever seen\\" -- he becomes obsessed with learning and copying the trick.<br /><br />Angier travels to America to visit Tesla, a great inventor and rival of Edison, to see if Tesla can help him duplicate Borden's trick. He does duplicate it, but differently, and this is where the film begins to get more complicated.<br /><br />The meaning of a good trick, as Michael Caine's character tells us, is not about learning how it's done. \\"You don't want to know the secret,\\" he says. \\"You want to be fooled.\\" And The Prestige fools us, all right.<br /><br />Illusions, tricks, and twists swirl around the final act of the film, where nothing is as it seems, and deaths abound -- but are they real? Or are they just another illusion?<br /><br />In fact, what in these two magicians' lives *isn't* illusion?<br /><br />Are there any secrets in either Borden's or Angier's lives that don't have double secrets underneath? Secrets are part of the magicians' trade, and these two deal heavily in them -- and fatally.<br /><br />In that sense, I suppose this story could be considered a tragedy. It is an amazing film, a masterpiece in storytelling, and performs a final devastating illusion at the end that will leave the audience reeling from the impact, ready to watch it again.<br /><br />Rating: Masterpiecellusion at the end that will leave the audience reeling from the impact, ready to watch it again.    Rating: Masterpiece
038533348X|5.0|I read Cat's Cradle back in the mid-'80s when I was in high school, and I liked it. On a whim, I dug it out to see what I'd think of it now that I have a few decades of pessimism under my belt. The verdict: it held up quite well, and I remembered why I went on a Vonnegut spree 20 years ago.<br /><br />This is not a book for everyone, especially those who prefer \\"feel good\\" fluff. This is a dark comedy, and such things are an acquired taste. Likewise, this is not a book that you read for the plot so much as for its character studies and (especially) its social commentary.<br /><br />Some of the impact of this book will quite likely be lost on younger readers who are not hip to the social circumstances of when it was written. Much in the same way as new viewers of Citizen Kane or readers of On The Road often go \\"what's the big deal?\\", Cat's Cradle is best enjoyed if you take into account what was available (and \\"acceptable\\") by comparrison in its contemporary setting. Certainly, America has its share of sardonic authors blasting the complascency bubble (Twain and Bierce, for instance) but Vonnegut shrewdly skewered the copascetic bubble of the early '60s in a way that was either shocking or refreshing, depending on your mind-set. Such things have increasingly become the norm, but Vonnegut was at the vanguard, and I think many authors delving into dark comedy and social parody take their cues from him.<br /><br />Vonnegut's prose is a pleasure to read, full of wit, wry descriptions, and a \\"voice\\" that just flows off the page. This is also a quick read that quite likely will lull you in and make you want to go just one more chapter before stopping for the night.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000U7169M|2.0|Hilary Swank's acknowledged acting talent was totally wasted in the inane satanic film \\"The Reaping\\".  The flick's promising introductory scenes quickly degenerated into an aborted attempt to combine religion with occult to produce a frightening storyline.<br /><br />Swank plays Katherine Winter, a professor at LSU who had previously been an ordained minister.  Her bailiwick was investigating alleged miracles and debunking them based on scientific fact.  Swank had lost her faith when doing missionary work in the drought ravaged Sudan, as both her husband and daughter were killed by superstitious local tribesmen.<br /><br />Swank was summoned at the university by Doug Blackwell a teacher from the bible belt hamlet of Haven located in the bayous of Louisiana played by David Morrissey.  The water in the local river purportedly turned to blood and Morrissey came to Swank seeking her council and an explanation.  Swank ably assisted by Idris Elba playing Ben was soon confronted by plagues of frogs, dying livestock et al in the cursed town.  The explanation for these plagues were put at the feet of a 12 year old girl Loren played by AnnaSophia Robb.  According to the townfolk she was an incarnate of Satan himself.<br /><br />Using computer graphics which were incredible, in particular,as the town gets attacked by grasshoppers, the plagues continue.  The plot however degenerates into a half baked Satanic cult story that had it's origins in the town.  Swank gets immersed into the histrionics as her actions propagate a continuation of the phenomena as the film concludes.

About 1 hour and 45 minutes. What I like to do with the last man on earth type of movies is imagine what I would do if I were the last. It's interesting to contemplate. Would have liked to see Smith do more exploring of the city. They made it look pretty real. Very enjoyable movie. Check it out.<br />Steve
B000VWYNOG|4.0|I can't help but wonder what the hell they were thinking when I see a Van Morrison-compilation without \\"Tupelo Honey\\" on it.  There is a longer 37-track version of this compilation floating around out there somewhere, and that one does paint a more complete picture of Van the Man, but anthologizing Van Morrison is always difficult, kinda like making a Bob Dylan-compilation: There are just too many songs to choose from, and most of them work better in their original settings.     There is no denying, though, that this CD contains some wonderful music. Van Morrison is one of the finest composers and arrangers ever to play R&B, folk, jazz, blues, rock and country (and quite possibly the only one to do it all at the same time), and so it's hard to see how a CD with 21 of his songs could be a total miss.   And it isn't, of course. \\"Still on Top\\" contains classic songs like \\"Wild Night\\", \\"Domino\\", \\"Brown-Eyed Girl\\", \\"The Healing Game\\", \\"Bright Side Of The Road\\", and several others, and the sound is excellent (even if the liner notes aren't).     But I still think that most of Van Morrison's songs work better in their original context. To me, taking songs from 15 different albums and squeezing them together like this doesn't make a really cohesive listening experience. And if it's really Morrison himself who has made the selection, as Amazon claims on this page, he has short-changed some of his finest post-70s albums something terrible.     So this is not a great compilation. It's great music, mostly, but not a truly great (or necessary) compilation. We need a box set instead...

0783240236|4.0|Time has a way of qualifing our initial assesment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980.) Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded as a solid craftsman but not an artist; in the 1950s many of his films, most notoriously VERTIGO, were received with lukewarm interest.  In the 1960s, however, attitudes about his work began to change, and with that came a major re-evaluation of his films.  Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics; some films that had received tremendous recognition at the time of their release were now seen as somewhat over-praised.<br /><br />To a certain extent this re-evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics: THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal.  Just as it took some thirty years to fix VERTIGO's position in the Hitchcock lexicon, so may it take fifty to arrive at a final summation here.<br /><br />According to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a \\"bird attack,\\" and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS.  (Although technically based on the 1952 novella by Dauphne du Maurier, the story and film bear little relation to each other.)  The story developed by Hitchcock and Evan Hunter concerned slightly wild San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who becomes infatuated with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and whimsically follows him to his home at Bodgea Bay as a prank.  Not long after her arrival, however, she is attacked by a seagull, and although her injuries are slight she is quickly, albeit somewhat unwillingly, received by Mitch and his circle.  One attack soon leads to another, and before very long Melanie, Mitch, and the entire community are under seige.<br /><br />THE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks.  Two of these are particularly famous.  While Melanie sits on a bench outside the grade school, her attention is attracted by a flying bird--and she turns to find the playground's jungle gym covered with crows, assembling for an attack as the children leave the school.  Later, when the birds attack the town itself, Melanie is trapped in a telephone booth, a helpless witness to the horrors around her even as the birds begin to batter the glass that protects her.<br /><br />But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself.  Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps.  It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film.  This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole.  Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one?  Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room?  Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be?<br /><br />Hitchcock apologists tend to justify these and many other loose ends in the film by stating that THE BIRDS is intended to have an open-ended structure without resolution and that the random and often incomprehensible nature of the script is intended to reflect the random and incomprehensible nature of the bird attacks.  A typical argument in favor of the film also notes that the film is driven by themes instead of plot points.  Well-- maybe.  But I'm an \\"art film\\" fan myself, and I can't see it.<br /><br />In the final analysis, THE BIRDS is more akin to modern ultra-commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art-film, with the action and adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow.  Even so, while THE BIRDS has major flaws, it is so crammed with inconographic moments and visuals that it is impossible to completely dismiss the film as a commercial wallow pure and simple.  At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way.  I offer my own experience as an example.  I first saw THE BIRDS on television when I was a teenager, and although I thought it was entertaining enough I wasn't particularly impressed.  The next morning, however, I opened the living room curtains--startled a flock of birds perched on the outside window sill--and I was scared half to death.  And that's cinematic power, nothing else.<br /><br />The DVD presents the film in excellent form and includes several bonuses, most particularly Hitchcock's darkly humorous movie trailer and outlines of a deleted scene.  Final comment: it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerand adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow.

B000056HE9|4.0|For a Christmas classic long on charm, the 1947 THE BISHOP'S WIFE had a remarkably troubled history. When the film originally went before the cameras it starred noted actress and Academy award winner Teresa Wright in the title role with co-stars Cary Grant as the Bishop and David Niven as a slightly wayward angel--but somewhere along the way Wright ran afoul of director William Seiter, who, for reasons that have never been clearly explained, fired her. This in turn brought down the wrath of producer Samuel Goldwyn, who looked at the film, didn't like what he saw, and fired Seiter.<br /><br />Goldwyn brought in director Henry Koster, who looked at the film and very strongly felt that Grant and Niven were in the wrong roles--and it took some time and effort to convince the two to make the change. Then, by the time shooting was set to resume, Wright was visibly pregnant and was replaced by Loretta Young. In consequence of these changes, there wasn't a scrap of film that could be salvaged from the original footage, so the film restarted from scratch at enormous cost. As a result, and although it was well received and did good box office, THE BISHOP'S WIFE was never the great financial hit Goldwyn had hoped: it was so deeply in the red before it opened that even the best attendance couldn't do more than recoup its cost.<br /><br />The story is simple but charming. Episcopal Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) has become so consumed by the wordly demands of building a new and very expensive church that he has effectively lost touch with his faith--and, not incidently, his wife Julia (Loretta Young), who is increasingly unhappy in the marriage and therefore presumably open to temptation. Their difficulties come to a head as Christmas approaches, but to their good fortune they are visited by an angel with the improbable name of Dudley (Cary Grant.) Handsome, suave, and able to show Julia a good time, Dudley soon incurs Henry's jealousy, and through this Henry comes to appreciate Julia and rediscovers his own spirituality.<br /><br />Like most Christmas-oriented films of its era, THE BISHOP'S WIFE is less about serious theological issues than it is about whimsey, and while some may consider the result shallow it is nonetheless a truly charming bit of Christmas cheer. The three leads are memorable, with Grant a standout as the slightly devilish angel, and they are strongly supported by the very entertaining performances of Monty Wooley, Gladys Cooper, and Elsa Lanchester. The script is witty, the direction even if not greatly inspired, and the whole thing adds up to a highly entertaining two hours.<br /><br />THE BISHOP'S WIFE was remade in 1996 as THE PREACHER'S WIFE, but the result was lackluster; gentle charm is not among the strengths of modern Hollywood. As for the DVD release of the original, it is at best so-so; the transfer is on the dark side, a fact that tends to take the edge off the film's emotional brightness. Even so, recommended just for the fun you'll have watching three of Hollywood's classic players execute a lightweight script with considerable grace and, yes, Christmas charm.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerd rediscovers his own spirituality.

0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki revolutionized the field of personal finance in 1997. Since then many exciting new books and personalities have emerged. However, I cannot think of a better book to begin with...and I've either read or listened to them all: Brinker, Bogle, Buffett, Danko, Dent, Drucker, Edelman, Gross, Langemeier, Lynch, Orman, Ramsey, Siegel, Soros, Swensen, Tobias, and Trump (to name a few!). I've learned from them all. But none provide the 30,000 foot view from above that \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" does. True...Kiyosaki does not mention specifics; however he does reveal the simple equation for achieving sustainable wealth:    {Financial Independence = [Passive Income + Portfolio Income] > Expenses}  {Financial Independence not= Earned Income > Expenses}    Financial independence simply means not having to work for another paycheck. So, the money generated from the assets you own pays for your living-expenses. Do not misconstrue this as a program for living frugally and reducing your expenses, such as in the book, \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\" Instead, Kiyosaki encourages you to increase your means by acquiring assets that generate passive and portfolio income without you having to continually work for it. But a word of warning from Robert Kiyosaki, \\"If you do not have a strong reason, there is no sense reading further. It will sound like too much work\\" (167). If you choose not to listen to Rich Dad, then Kiyosaki advises you to invest immediately for retirement, because the longer you wait the more difficult it will become.    The Rich Dad view of money requires you to adopt a completely different perspective regarding the relationship between you and your money. To become wealthy you must adopt the mind-set of the rich. You must suppress your middle-class notions about money. For example, you must understand that money is necessary for survival, and the life-long pursuit of money resembles a game. Some are oblivious to the game, while others feel they can opt out, but the truth is that you're either playing the game of money or being played by it. You improve your game-playing ability by understanding the rules by which the rich play. When it comes to money, there is no shortcut; you must improve your financial literacy:     \\"A person can be highly educated, professionally successful and financially illiterate. These people often work harder than they need to because they learned how to work hard, but not how to have their money work for them\\" (66).     Many people spend their lives trapped in the \\"rat-race\\" because they were not given the chance to develop their \\"Financial IQ\\" either in school or at home. Kiyosaki writes, \\"Financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise:  accounting, investing, understanding markets, and understanding the law\\" (103). This includes learning to improve your time-management and cashflow, how to organize smart people, how to raise money, and how to see opportunities with your mind (rather than with your eyes). You can begin improving your Financial IQ by reading books on the subject, and by seeking out experts in the field.     The rich understand that taxes and debt are your two largest expenses, and they do everything legally possible to avoid them. Thus, the rich not only make more money than the poor and middle-class do, but they also keep more of what they make. The rich make more money by using their paycheck to buy assets that create new \\"passive\\" and \\"portfolio\\" income streams, which are taxed at 15% and 0%, respectively. In contrast, the poor and middle-class use their \\"earned income\\" to buy liabilities, which generate no income. So, while the rich spend money to make money, the poor spend money only to lose it, and the middle-class buy liabilities that they mistakenly believe are assets. The rich also take advantage of C-corporations. By owning nothing, but controlling everything, the rich take advantage of lower corporate tax-rates, as well as the added benefit of paying taxes only on those revenues left-over after expenditures.    In conclusion, open your eyes. Use your brain and exercise your Financial IQ. Then, you will find investment opportunities all around you. Kiyosaki prefers real estate investing. He'll buy a house, keep it for no more than 7-years, and then avoid paying taxes on the sale of the property by reinvesting the proceeds into a larger property through an IRC 1031 exchange. He also takes small companies public on international stock exchanges, and then exits his position within a year. However, choosing what to invest in is rather immaterial. You will choose according to your interests and talents. Most importantly, seek to improve your Financial IQ so that you can improve your facility in converting earned income (i.e. wages) into passive and portfolio income (i.e. because of better tax-treatment) by buying passive-income generating assets.
