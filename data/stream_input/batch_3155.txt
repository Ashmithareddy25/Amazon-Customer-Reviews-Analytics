006202406X|4.0|This will be my first review EVER.<br /><br />Why I'm writing this review? Because before I read the book I found out about the many disappointed readers.<br /><br />Still, I decided to read the book. Only because I loved so much the Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />I can't deny that this is the worst of the three books. But, that does not make it a bad book.<br /><br />You have a good beginning... a regular middle and a strong ending.<br /><br />It is a solid ending? Of course not. If you look for wholes in it, you will find many.<br /><br />But the ending its real, it may not be the happy ever after that some people were hoping for... BUT ITS REAL....<br /><br />I don't love it... But I respect it. STOP COMPLAINING.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|When the opening credits played to Nights in White Satin, I was done in! To have a creative pair like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton collaborate again is like getting a big gift with a bow on it. We couldn't wait to open it and see what treats we had in store! This time it's a high-concept comedy.<br /><br />Late in the 18th century, handsome young Barnabas Collins was the object of unwanted affection from a witch who, out of spite, turned him into a vampire, had him enclosed in a chained casket and buried for 196 years in the New England woods. After a construction crew unearths the casket and cuts the chains in 1972, he is free to vamp about and quench a powerful thirst! Along with seeing that his once-grand family estate has fallen into ruin, Barnabas is nonplussed by horseless carriages, McDonald arches and asphalt. There are endless opportunities to show that our hero is indeed, a stranger in a strange land.<br /><br />These folks make it fun:<br />  * Johnny Depp (&#34;Sweeney Todd&#34;) is courtly and confused. He has lost the love of his life, so he isn't above a little diversion with that seductive witch.<br />  * Michelle Pfeiffer (&#34;New Year's Eve&#34;) is the current lady of the house, trying to hold together the family traditions and a nearly bankrupt fish-packing company.<br />  * Eva Green (&#34;Perfect Sense&#34;) is that evil witch who was deter- mined to have him for all eternity, now she will settle for ruining the Collins family fortune and reputation.<br />  * Helena Bonham Carter (&#34;The King's Speech&#34;) is the tipsy doctor/ counselor/psychiatrist (I couldn't tell) who seems to live in the Collins mansion.<br />  * Bella Heathcote (''In Time&#34;) is both Barnabas' true love from his youth and the family governess in 1972.<br /><br />Some samples: Because they chose to set this production in 1972, the movies on the local marquee are Superfly and Deliverance. Karen Carpenter sings Top of the World while Barnabas tries to see how she got intothat accursed box! He finds a lava lamp endlessly fascinating and is shocked to see that one secret chamber in the family &#34;pile&#34; is full of macramé. When Alice Cooper is hired to entertain, Barnabas takes one look and says &#34;That's the ugliest woman I've ever seen!&#34; As a red convertible approaches the Collins' mansion, the theme from A Summer Place sweeps through the theater.<br /><br />This is a reminder that the Depp/Burton team is alive and well, despite some third-act problems which they camouflaged with lots of CGI and blowie uppie stuff. The screening audience was noisy, appreciative and highly entertained, so the sequel that seems to be hinted at, will also do well. My DVD from Amazon arrived right on time!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This is a great sequel to &#34;Monsters Inc.&#34;  It tells how Sully and Mike meet, and the challenges and struggles they went through to get to Monsters Inc.  There are great lessons in this movie for young and old alike.  I've watched this movie twice, and it was just as fun the second time around as the first.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Well, it's almost like a constant &#34;cliffhanger&#34;, not knowing who's going to be killed off next. Choices that are being made stray from the usual relationship dynamics of an apocalyptic theme series. I haven't been this excited about a TV series in a long time.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|A few of the songs are real throwaways. However, several other songs are very good. Not her best work by far!
B0055PMJMW|2.0|I expected much more from a Connelly novel. It didn't have that &#34;can't wait to turn the next page&#34; excitement I am use to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am so ADDICTED to this game..I have earned over 2million coins, bought every character and board and costume and still have over two hundred keys....my Hugh score so far is 11195675 and I only had to use one key...LOVE this game!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a fun game the only reason I gave it 3stars was because there are bugs that have been reported and all you get told is to uninstall and redownload which causes you to lose all progress which can not be restored.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This is the best Iron Man out of them all.  The writing was great.  Robert Downey, Jr. plays this incredibly flawed character so well, you can't help but to love him, weaknesses and all.  It really makes you want to wait for Iron Man 4 (which I understand Downey isn't willing to make).  Loved this movie!
B00GI8AMI8|4.0|Enjoyed the game.  Nice point-n-click.  The puzzles were pretty good and straightforward.  Can't go wrong for 99 cents.  No hidden objects which is a plus in my book.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Works really well on my 1st gen kindle fire. Haven't tried multiplayer yet but I hear it has probs on 1st gen iPad so I'm not sure how it works on older kindle fires. Really enjoying it so far!
B004CM8TKU|2.0|Tried to stick with this because I'm a &#34;Whovian&#34; but it's so bad. There is no real science fiction in this at all and these people are so incompetent and idiots to boot. I can't seem to suspend my belief any longer for this series. It could have been great being a knock off from Dr. Who but the writers blew it. Unless the next couple of seasons got their act together... But I will never know because I can't make it through this one.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Probably the best bang for your buck processor out there for gaming.  Easily overclocked with a good MoBo and cooling.  One google search will provide a lot of evidence for this processors ability to be overclocked.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The best book I've read this year! Anything about the Holocaust is going to be sad, so be prepared. I enjoyed the story and learned something in the process. It makes me want to research the topic more. I liked the author's writing and plan on reading more of her work.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is frustratingly addicting.  Sometimes I have no clue what  is happening, but I continue playing until I run out of time or life.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Corporations do not have a conscience.  Their job is to make money.  If the margin is there after paying the public relations consultants, settlement and legal fees, then it is cost effective to ruin a few families lives.  It is the price of doing business.  In individual needs to do like the animals in the forest when a wildfire is approaching - run!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|PRISM didnt disappoint, it is different from the other CDs but still brings a variety of music. None of her music is truly all the same and I love that
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Compelling.  I just hope that they will make season 3 available to Amazon Prime people soon.  Do you know what I'm saying, Amazon?  If you think I would pay for season 3, you've lost your mind.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|A different kind of zombie movie.  Far, far less gorier than the usual so the at least half the focus is in locating &#34;ground zero&#34;, and therefore an actual, more plausible cure.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This novel brings to light the horror that is North Korea through fiction.  How else can anyone ingest its reality.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|totally addicting......as soon as one episode was done we couldn't wait to start the next.....get ready to lose sleep...its hard to stop.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|It had a very slow start. But once it got going it was an entertaining book. Will it be a movie?
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I'm giving this game 5 stars because I do enjoy hidden object games that include different types of mini games. (Find the difference, find the pairs, unscramble the words etc...) But honestly I could do without the &quot;story line&quot;! I just want to play the games! Thankfully there is a &quot;skip dialogue&quot; button that appears when you push MENU. The down side is that you have to push the button for EVERY new challenge! But besides this minor annoyance, this is a fun hidden object game with the ability to zoom in and hints if need them. And today its FREE! Can't beat that price!!  ;0
006202406X|1.0|I wish I hadn't read this book at all. Completely ruined the whole series and the desire to watch the movies. Someone must have peed in Veronica Roth's Cheerios when she wrote this book. Awful!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read.  Always amazes me what can go on in a courtroom.  Lawyers are a different breed.  Characters are interesting and the end is a surprise.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game....plays great on my kindle. Can play this for hours. Thank you and yourfor such a wonderful game.
0792839749|5.0|DVD was perfect. It was in brand new condition. Arrived just fine, even to my APO Box. Very happy. Very.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very good for all ages.  It keeps me occupied for hours. Trying to beat my friends and having a race to see who gets the farthest first..
B004LROUNG|5.0|Fast moving and fun. Character development top notch and side stories wrapped up in a professional manner.  A great novel.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|An awesome app to have when you don't have much drive space. I have it on all of my tablets.<br />Love it! Thanks!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good read.  I enjoyed the characters and could not wait to find out what the secret was……John Grisham does not disappoint on this one.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is a movie you will want to watch over and over and over and over again! Okay, the sequel opened in theaters this weekend, but in order for you to understand the sequel, you must see the original &#34;Hunger Games&#34; film. (Especially if you have not read the books, okay?&#34;
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love Bruno Mars' music.  I am not his demographic, but it does not matter.  Very happy with this purchase.  Would have liked a version without the need for the 'parental advisory' stamp, but it is what it is.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Choppy writing but the characters and he story keep you engrossed. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to read a romantic drama with a hint of x-rated story line and delicious excitement
B008OOYALE|5.0|Absolutely love all the story games. I would like TeamLava to bring monster story and empire story to Amazon app store. For now I am able to only find them on my phone would enjoy having them on my Kindle Fire.
0143124544|4.0|Enjoyable read.  I'll definitely finish this one as the character's lives are deeply engrossing and I didn't want to stop until the conclusion of the book!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's a good game and its the best game ever but it needs to make it easier to earn money
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|&#34;After Earth&#34; is a visually striking film about a boy's coming-of-age story. It happens on a far-off planet and the interaction between the father (Will Smith) and son (Jaden Smith) if wonderful. If you love science fiction films, monsters, and stories that tug at your heart strings, then you will love &#34;After Earth!&#34;
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app helps me with my homework because I rate this app4 stars it is very help full and now I know what 4,589 times 99 is!!!!! :) &lt;3
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun app and great way to kill time, and big game. For a free app this can' t be beat. Watch out deer!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played. Trust me. You'll be very satisfied. It requires a lot of patience by the way.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I got this from Netflix for my kids.  This is one of the best family movies I've seen in a long time!  We enjoyed this movie immensely.<br />I will be buying our own copy!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good read. Another creative story line. I'm looking forward to seeing how the movie will compare to the book.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Super fun  best app ever when i get bored  i just star playing and I'm not bored bored  i strongly recommend. it just go to and turn settings the air plane<br /> game off
B00902AKK4|1.0|This is a horrible app it wont let me download it. Can someone plz help me! I mean it says my app is pending but when i try to fix it, it wont let me.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Since the appearance of The Walking Dead zombies have been a hot topic. I think it is pretty clear that this film uses that situation to its advantage, but the similarities end there. World War Z brings to the table a few things I really enjoyed. First, these are not your typical zombies, none of that slow relentless walking, here we get zombies that are fast and agile, with relentless being the characteristic that makes the former really scary attributes. I also liked the suspense injected in the plot in terms of what is causing the zombie outbreak and how to battle it. But most of all, the cinematography is truly visually stunning. It is extremely hard to describe with words the enormity of this production, you will have to watch it to understand.<br /><br />The story is entertaining enough and Brad Pitt does a very good job in his role as a UN investigator that had retired but is forced to jump back into the fray to get protection for his family. There are many situations in which you will find yourself on the edge of you seat since you know a zombie will jump out soon. There are several gruesome scenes, but it being a zombie movie I assume you could have guessed that.<br /><br />I won't say this is my favorite movie ever, but I do think it has some qualities that make it worth watching. It is certainly different than anything else out there. If you are not too squeamish, I think you should give it a try.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Oh the pain! The pain! Each of the intertwining characters deal with so much that at sometimes the reader can't bare it yet, the heartache of missed opportunities, difficult circumstances and beautiful writing keep carrying you on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, I enjoy it very much. It is appropriate for kids and adults. Great graphics and level ideas. Poopaye! ;)
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|It plain sucks,they tell you game is free and you play few levels then they say if you want to continue you have to pay .THAT'S BULL
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Really enjoying the gameplay. Would definitely recommend to anyone. Fairly fast-paced for this type of game without having to pay for extra items.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush because it's a lot like subway singers and I love that game and minion rush also has really funny minions.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman knows what scares us - really scares us - & uses it to make a very human (not horror) story. He's a master.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This was better than I imagined, full of action, suspense and good acting.  I enjoyed the struggle our young hero had in proving his ability to not just command but to truly lead.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|The best and bad parts are:<br /><br />Good<br />- best search<br />- Stick to subject when search<br />- big screen<br /><br />Bad<br />- stops every so often<br /><br />- when click sound down, screen goes white<br /><br />Hope you agree with me!!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I enjoyed it. Quirky and fun. It's like solving a continuous puzzle that takes patience and thought. Graphics and characters are cool and whimsical. I recommend to everybody.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is to my mind the greatest storyteller of our time. The story is enthralling from word one and the plot follows the transpiring events and revelations flawlessly. Quite simply a masterpiece of modern lawyer based fiction. The guy who really brought the lawyer fiction genre onto the scene is still undoubtedly the master.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I love this game a lot. It is really cool . You get to make your own characters .Make homes for people , kill enemies,survive , craft ! And it  is so o o Adicting!<br />  JUST AWESOME !!!!!!
B000055ZB8|5.0|I did not purchase this DVD on Amazon, but I soon will. I just wanted to say that this is the version that is available on Netflix. I was looking for this version in particular because of the soundtrack - The Silent Orchestra does an amazing job at reinforcing the atmosphere throughout the movie, and it is the reason I prefer this version over other versions of Nosferatu.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Fully appreciate this book, the research and rationale behind the diet which is so easy to followFeel so much better following this simple food plan
B00992CF6W|5.0|Because you can practically do anything you want with the amazing block range and all the possibilities of houses and anything really!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I'm giving this book 3 stars because I love the first two books to Divergent and I really love the story, characters, ... but in this book I felt as if veronica was rushed and pressured and just wrote to make us have feelings. this wasn't her writing. and the ending left me empty and cold.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is great. But you do the same thing over and over. Don't buy it if you like subway surfers.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Can't get enough will play for hours can't wait to see what's nextVery fun great way to kill time and animals
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a awesome and fun game to play. I play minion rush a lot and it is very fun to play
0811879542|5.0|This book is so much fun. This book is great for pre-readers. Grand children LOVE IT! Highly recommended. BUY IT
B00CPLGGXM|4.0|Major upgrade from an A4 5300 Trinity apu, which was locked except for the OC Genie with MSI mobo. Overclocked this right away to just under 4.9g without any issues whatsoever! Not reporting any heat or major wattage issues from CPU-Z (idle is only at 1.2-1.3 or so), and BIOS shows at idle its around 28c, but ramps up on the BIOS screen to 40c rather quickly for some reason Not a major concern, just seems wierd. AMD Cool n Quiet feature is enabled, and no stability issues. BIOS update to recognize Richland from Trinity took no time at all, but thats more of the mobo manufacturer than AMD, and yes, need to do this if you are swapping from the Trinity line. Do have a Corsair H80i installed as well. Dock 1 star because I'm not using the onboard gpu, and won't Dual Link with my dedicated Radeon HD 7770, looked all over at tips and tricks and such to no avail. Upgrading RAM to higher mhz as I heard this apu really shines then. and I'll see what kind of oc i can get from there. For me it was worth it.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. It is the story of a fifth grader who suffers from a severe facial deformity. The book is absolutely fascinating in that it is told from the first person perspective of multiple characters who are affected by the disease, including the main character, his sister, and several classmates and friends. This tale is a heartfelt, inspirational story of the true value of kindness.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love survivalcraft Demo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I very much love this game and I want to play it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />my name is nuna<br />I am 11<br />I like to listen to music very very very much
B003V9OCIS|5.0|An amazing movie showing how we humans strive sometimes. This is a great testament to how little mistakes can sometimes get big, and how important planning is. The other thing that is important is a fearless pursuit, and we so often depend on those that went before us.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was magical and genius. I would recommend it to anyone at an age wanting a very good book to read.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|This is the most power packed led lantern I've ever had or borrowed.  This has more power/light than any of the larger lanterns I have used.  I read the reviews before purchase & saw comments on the difficulty of installing the batteries?  I had no difficulties at all - you line up the slots & turn. That's it.  I also saw negative comments about the little green light that blinks to let you know where the lantern is during a power outage - I guess I don't understand that as I have smoke alarms that have a flashing light MUCH brighter than this lantern.  I would recommend this over any other lantern I've used.  It's a &#34;mighty giant&#34;!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|bought this book thinking it was supposed to be something great with characters and sexual encounters. found this not to be necessarily the case. written for beginning high school level reader
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is nice. Like graphics. Would like it more if I didn't need to spend money to keep progress going forward.
B001R0XNSI|4.0|Extreme quality for the cost. A little heavy for shirt pocket carry though. Incredible stout device which will fall under the radar of suspicious EDC self defense.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so excited my kindle finally came and now I'm excited to play on my kindle HD...this game is so addictive.
1451666179|4.0|Allie Brosh is very funny as always and I've been looking forward to this book for months. It's funny, it's enjoyable, and it's a quick read. My only complaint is that it includes a lot of the material that's already on her blog, which I've already read many times.  The book is a mix of old and new, and given the book is a fast read as it is, the amount of new material goes by way too fast.  I'm glad she published a book and hope it does well, but can't help but feeling a bit disappointed there wasn't more.
0811879542|5.0|bought this book for my grandchild. thought he would like the simple story. and he did. loved the color and movement from page to page. great book for any little one's own library
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Of everything that was depicted as &#34;Bad&#34; in human history through this movie, Where was Obama care. Talk about some thing that takes over your life and all future generations.Not to mention becoming a slave of the state. Tom And Sharon Get A Life.
B0064X79JC|5.0|It is hard to explain.<br />I am yours. No matter what.  Drive is me, a good guy and stuff.  Drive rocks!! :D
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|So I am gonna say that I have been a big fan of the gangstar series since Miami vindication, I.have gotten all the games and I finally got Vegas. Very amazing game, great voice acting with the voice talents of Sean schemmel the voice of Goku which I am a fan of too. But now for the review.<br /><br />The latest update looks nice and all but it lowered the performance quite a bit. It lags freezes and crashes a lot on my KFHD 8.9. Before.the update the game ran fine. A few crashes but now it crashes too frequently please fix this in the new update. Thank you.<br /><br />~MrSoHot
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Much better than the original Castleville...not dependent on other players so far.  My only complaint is that Myra doesn't often want to buy what you need to sell which can really slow game play.  All in all an enjoyable game.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|finally a chance for this series to redeem itself, left wanting for something more in the way of characters and plot. not that sexy or engaging. high school level reading. glad there is not a third book
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Mixed feelings about this book. Could not wait to finally see how this series ended. I was hoping happy . But no. I also felt like this book was not in the same league as the first two. This book made no sense to me and was a chore to read.And I honestly do not think this will help the movies at all. I just saw a preview for the first movie and now I am not sure I will see it. I mean I can see the authors point in not having a happy ending, but that does not mean I have to like it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The grammar is horrible. The editing is worse. The story is childish and unreadable. I do not understand the fuss! I read better written, steamier romance novels when I was in highschool.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|this game is pure awesomeness but before you download you should go to miniclip.com and play it to make sure you like it
0385341008|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  It's rare that you can really connect with the characters in an epistolary novel, but this one pulls it off beautifully.  Lyrical language and engaging plot.
B000JQTWPO|2.0|bought this for a book club selection. not my era of reading material. i am sure that the leader absolutely loved this, but found it very time consuming to read.
B00C7607BC|1.0|the color is drab I expected blue ray to be BRIGHT very disappointed the content of movie is still happy
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I love this book plot and expressions and use of animals as explaining a difficult situations. This book made me go back to reading pleasure.
1591391105|5.0|I read this book every time I have a promotion, and I highly recommend this book to my subordinates and peers who have a promotion.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|If you love quirky British humor, then you'll love this series.  This is Hugh Laurie at his best, although the show is really stolen by Stephen Fry as Jeeves.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|thought this book might be more interesting than the first book, but it actually was about the same. not much more in the way of character development or plot
0140143505|5.0|I have watched this a dozen times and never get tired of watching it and loving Anne Bancroft in it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a bit slow in the begining but kept you intriqued. You want to find out what is in the letter..When you finally do it makes you think about how you would handle it. Even after reading the book, I am still not sure what I would do. Lots of characters effected by one action.
B00GJ8IY28|5.0|First off, being American I am not a Robbie expert, just know some hits. I can imagine this is shockingly different to some fans! I about flipped when he started singing &#34;I wanna be like you&#34; from &#34;The Jungle Book&#34; however it is a really well done album. He can obviously afford great players and studios etc, and the singing is simply pleasant and relaxing. THAT is hard to find these days, so 5 stars for execution and for guts.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|This is a really entertaining movie.  My daughter and I watch it every so often.  The quality of the Bluray is great.
B000005B0U|5.0|The songs are classic!  It's a missed and lost wonderful composition of blues' artists!  Except for 'Riders of the Storm&#34;
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit has worked perfectly for me.  It creates a folder on your iPad and places all imported photos in it.
0385486804|2.0|My daughter had to read this in high school, so I picked it up again. I thought now what I thought originally. The book began and ended all right, but the middle was God awful boring. Krakauer is a great writer, but his own experiences, opinions and biases color everything he does, which is annoying, since he writes what is supposedly non-fiction. And I kept wanting to go kick Chris's trust fund, spoiled, arrogant, whining butt. He loved nature, yeah, but he had no respect for it. The people who glorify him should save their praise for someone who has done something more novel than run off unprepared into the wild and starved to death. It's selfish to die doing what you wanted to do, people. It's self centered because it means you only care about yourself and not the friends and family you leave behind, which Krakauer never seems to be able to see, although he seemed to have a bit more sympathy for the old man who wanted to adopt \\"Alex\\" than he had for the rest of Chris' friends and family. And while I think this was probably a thrilling magazine article, as a book it had way too much filler, and why it didn't have more pictures instead of going off on tangents so much I will never understand.
B008NXL8IO|5.0|Well written and researched explaination of temperment.  Extremely informative and easy to read. The author clearly sets out on a path of discovery for herself and emphasizes the positive component of the introversion.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Almost impossible to believe this was Gina Carano's debut effort.  She didn't deserve an Academy Award, but she definitely deserves more lead opportunities.<br /><br />The plot itself is entertaining...and she's mixed with some great actors (I especially liked Bill Paxton as her dad).<br /><br />If you like action adventure, grab this.  It'll be one you'll want to watch every once-in-a-while.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|EMOJI IS A FUN GAME TO PLAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A GIRL WHO LIKES TO USE EMOJI FOR TEXTING. :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very satisfying novel with a very original epilogue that I loved. Very realistic depiction of the compromises of marriage and the trade-offs we make for the sake of others.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I love this book. I entered the world of Alma Whitaker and I lived with her all her passions. It made me weep to finish this novel but a new passion for nature and plants has arisen. Thank you Elizabeth Gilbert for this gift!
0399161287|5.0|\\"The day that guy took my glasses and put them in that gas tank was the last day I went to school. That was the end of my formal education. I was seven years old and I just never went back to class.\\"<br /><br />I am always fascinated to read about other people's lives and hot d*mn Mike Tyson is truly a fascinating human being. To read in his own words what life was like growing up for him not only made me feel sorry for him but it helped me to understand why he chose a profession that is all about violence and being an alpha male. Tyson's life was truly headed for destruction until he met the legendary, Cus D'Amoto.<br /><br />(Will need to go to my blog to read the passage that appears here: [...]<br /><br />The above passage is just one example of how hilarious Mike Tyson can be at times. Overall though, I believe his story reads as a tragedy. I say it is a tragedy because even though he will be known in the history books as one of the absolute greatest boxers to ever live, he is still to this day fighting demons of his past.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes we like to conceive of lust as love because we think it feels so good it has to be love. Love is sacrifice, love is worth dying and killing for, history proves that. But, we must have some kind of moral compass in our journey through life. All enjoyment is not good enjoyment.\\"<br /><br />We are reminded that at the end of the day, no matter how high our social status is in this crazy world, love is what we all want. Whether it is to truly love another human, to have another human truly love us, or to simply love ourselves. Undisputed Truth was so much fun to read on so many various levels. Whether you love him or hate him, respect him or think he is a piece of trash, Mike Tyson is a polarizing figure and he has told his story which is one worth reading!!!!
B00AFZ86C4|5.0|Awesome price for an underrated group.  I got introduced to them 30 years ago when someone who lost an album I lent them gave me Tomcattin' to replace it.<br /><br />Not sure how I would categorize the style...southern rock is probably closest...but they aren't going to sound like Lynyrd Skynyrd, 38 Special, Molly Hatchet, etc.<br /><br />It's worth getting this over any greatest hits album...you'll get all the hits and won't miss some other gems.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun wish it was just a little more complicated though but really fun!!!!! I loved where you had to use your brain the whole time great game love it!!!!!
B00G70K1HY|5.0|This wolverine movie is a happy addition to the marvel universe and the best Hugh Hackman x-men movie ever . Don't watch the original version , only the unrated version is the most violent comic movie to date . We are talking all kinds of slashing , impaling , slice and dicing in wolverine , enjoy
B001EN71CW|5.0|There is nothing but good here: good performances, good writing, unforgettable characters...<br />I can say nothing that will be better than what others have said already and more eloquently:  this series should never have been cancelled and was one of the biggest mistakes FOX ever made.  Still makes me sad and angry 11 years later.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome going to watch the second movie and read the second book. Well I hope the second movie is good.
B00ECKKCRK|5.0|Black Label Society is one of the best rock bands around (in my top ten...maybe my top five).  This album proves it's not because of great producers.  In the studio or live...amped-up or acoustic...they are always great.<br /><br />I kind of wish that Wylde's language wouldn't go south here and there...but, let's be serious, one can't expect church lady behavior out of a group that looks like a biker gang.<br /><br />But, boy, can this biker gang play guitar!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I played the Facebook edition and enjoyed the characters and graphics. This is even better as I don't have to rely on other players to achieve goals.  Looking forward to playing through all the levels.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Such a refreshing style of writing. I loved that the book was from the male character's point of view but also was written as if we were friends and he was confiding his story. Although Drew was clearly a player, he was also a lovable character and you couldn't help rooting for him to get the girl.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|So funny  from a 8year old so assume r then I lagged so hard I carted f gang y g so dumb forking dorking
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the game it is so fun it can distract you from bad thing and also it kinda gets you stress but also you get addicted to the game I remember when I first played an  I was so mad but then I like the game
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is a perfectly executed movie.  Obviously, it's genre may not appeal to you...but if it does...just grab it.<br /><br />My six year-old loves it...and mom and dad kind of like it too :-)

B003XVYLDU|4.0|I like Kurt Vonnegut, and this is the first of his many novels. He gets a lot across in little snippets.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive and fun game.  Would recommend to anyone. Challenge your friends high scores on Facebook! Hard to put down. The king of all time wasters!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Highly addictive and really fun! There are lots of stages and plenty of power-ups to collect, along with a variety of minions to choose
B005EPKS8A|5.0|Please check out my earlier rating for another Blues Brother's album...it holds here too.  Punch line?:  If you like blues, buy this album.
B00FFERTUK|5.0|The Best of Nickelback Volume 1 features a strong range of this band’s rock hits across the span of their career.  There are a range of popular and fantastic songs on this compilation such as “Photograph”, “Rockstar”, “Savin Me”, “If Today Was Your Last Day”, “Far Away”, “Lullaby”,“If Everyone Cared”, and “This Afternoon.”  My first Nickelback collection was “All The Right Reasons” and was purchased by my husband as a birthday gift for me around what I believe was Autumn 2007. However, many newcomers to the music of Nickelback would also like many of the songs on this collection.
B004GNFSO0|4.0|We take so much for granted here in the US...This guy had troubles and persevered through a situation we cannot truly understand.
0761174192|5.0|Exactly as anticipated. Prompt delivery. We have had Cat Calendars for 5 years now. The photos are great. Every cat lover will enjoy.
B003YWUTKM|2.0|The musical equivalent to Rambling incoherent speech, and  downright annoying to listen to. Gilmour had to be drunk when he signed this deal.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I loved the Forgotten Garden.  But this was not The Forgotten Garden.  It was a great story written very well by Kate Morton.  However, I thought it was endless.  Blah, Blah, Blah.  But that why we can skip and move on.  I liked this book but I didn't love it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Thanks for the early delivery, wanted to get this for an in law and was glad they have it. They really love marvel and I know they will love it , I'm excited to see how they react
B0067R0APK|4.0|I miss the snow rain info being easy to find.  But overall hsppy.  The layout is easy to use.  Wish print was larger.  .
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|so ... asbalways I read the reviews and it was awesome.  so I downloaded it .. awesome.  the only bad thing is that it takes up 55.4 % of your kindle
B009RH973I|5.0|I really like this case for my Kindle Fire HD (2012 version, not the October 2013 version Kindle). My Kindle fits perfectly, and it feels strong without a lot of bulk, but enough where I feel it is protective. The back of the case is hard, where the front is very soft and the strap is easy to secure but not loose. The color (pink) is very pretty. Everything that needs to be exposed (ports, speakers, etc) are perfect.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was a WANNA BE great book.  However, I agree with the hundreds of reviewers.  This was actually 6 books in one.  The first 55% of the book was wonderful.  No- wait- outstanding.  However, the remaining part was  totally unrelated to the story.  It was actually additional novels that had no bearing to the original characters.  I didn't think the last 30% of the book would end.  The ending???? A BIG LET DOWN.  I loved Mr. Hosseini previous novels.  However, this truly a wanna be of his prior work.  I've recommended this book to friends on an individual basis but not to my book club.  Worth reading, but be prepared to skip a lot of parts in the last one third of the book.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Very fun game love all the new things they have its very fun for kids and teens!!! Btw must play
1885167776|1.0|I just read this book. What a bunch of nonsense this was!!! Haha, I am laughing now as I think about this writer. Obviously, he has missed scores of opportunities in his life by sticking to his \\"One Thing\\". Haha, just what is his one thing? People are more than one things and what they do is more than one thing. I would not recommend this book to anyone. This is extremely narrow viewed, stupid and a con. Don't even bother wasting your time on this guy's views. He is totally off base and doesn't know what he is talking about. Follow your own path, successful people are usually multi-talented in many areas of their life and approach their life on many levels and in many avenues. If you are happy in your life then you are going the right way--most people can evaluate their own happiness. You don't need this guy's views to tell you any different. If you followed his \\"One Thing\\"--it's a guarantee that you are going to miss out ON MANY THINGS!!! Don't bother letting this guy lead you down the wrong direction, he still hasn't figured his life out yet, and it's obvious in his book...Kelly Cyr [...]\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you mr Howey, thoroughly enjoyed that.  Keep them coming and congratulations on breaking through.  Can't wait to purchase more.  Do raise your price though, definitely worth it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great page-Turner!  Easy read and well done.  Kept my attention.  Characters were very relatable and real.  Loved the intersection of the story lines.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a pretty fun game I like that you can keep progressing I just don't like the in app purchasing
0316322407|5.0|A inspiring life's story about a very brave young lady and the parents,who showed by example, how to be courageous.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I really liked it. Great acting, story line, and all. A really balanced movie. I highly recommend for all who enjoy sci-fi and mutant-oriented movies.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Great fun for the whole family and for all ages. Really funny and adorable. One of the best animated films.  Creative and imaginative.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|I have to honestly say this is the WORST ending I've ever seen in a series that for the most was extremely well-done. I can only hope that it was intended to be a lead-in for a spinoff show where crucial issues are resolved, and a satisfactory conclusion is reached; otherwise, the way in which the story ended is from my viewpoint meaningless.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I've always liked the Stargate tv shows. Atlantis is just as good as the original. If you're a scifi fan watch it, you won't be disappointed
0385537131|5.0|It lived up to my expectations.  Another interesting novel by John Grisham, this one 30 years in the making!  He is a favorite of mine and he did not disappoint.  great writer.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is such an excellent book! It peaked my interest from start to finish. Recommended it to my mom, who is in her 70's and she loved it too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This novel REALLY makes you THINK!  The whole time I spent reading I kept asking myself...&#34;what would I do?&#34;  Well written with characters that you feel are friends of yours.
B008JFUS5A|4.0|Catching Fire is a good movie on its own, but a bit of a let down compared to Hunger Games. Catching Fire slowly builds the tension between Catniss  and President snow as the rebellion inspired by Catniss begins to grow. The problems with this movie at least in comparison to hunger games  are:<br />  The build up is to long it is almost half way through the movie before there is any real action.<br /><br />  No real character back round on the competing tributes means the audience has no connection or feelings for them, they are mostly back round noise in this movie; no moving Rue type moments in this go around.<br /><br />  In Hunger games, Jennifer Lawrence was awesome as Catniss, in Catching Fire not so much, just didn't feel as connected to her character.<br /><br />Those flaws aside this is still a very watchable movie and a great story that focuses more on the political behind the scenes drama  then the physical violence of The Hunger games.  worth  watching.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|i was really disappointed with this new novel from Khaled Hosseini.<br />the previous books were so good and so touchy, but this one was just ok.<br />the beginning of the book was pretty good, and in the middle got a little boring and confusing.<br />in the end...just really plain....i almost didn't finish it, as i lost interest in the middle.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album is the most intimate. Gypsy will surely be one of your favorite songs. Dope will get you in Tears. Sexxx Dreams will make you bump and grind. Swine will make you rave!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very Great book. Maybe not for younger kids  reading it to understand the movie good to read before the movie
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Interesting oases followed by deserts of boring. Just as you are drawn into the story, it suddenly takes a dip, and you find yourself  pushing through pages of minutiae. The characters of the plants are more flushed out than those of the people, all of whom are rather stiff and one-dimensional.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I loved it but after awhile it got boring to be in the same world so I try to up date it but you have to go though a million drug to do it.<br />Oh and it really needs to stop asking me to up date it every time I go on it.
0767802470|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time when it was released in theaters in 1982.  It was stunning, I saw it in German with subtitles and hearing the crew speak German gave it a real sense of authenticity.  I was in the USN at the time and though I was not a bubblehead  I had spent weeks at sea and believe me, once you've been at sea for a while things change.  The stuff that this crew did were not that different than from things we did to amuse ourselves.  Of course we had far better living conditions, but you get into that cycle of go on watch, eat sleep get up and go on watch and that seems to be what your life becomes.  I went and saw it again and the man sitting a few seats from me was obviously shaken while watching it.  After the movie I learned that he served on a U-Boat, we went to get a drink and he told me that the movie was good, but painful because it brought so many memories back to him.  He recommended that I read a book called &#34;Iron Coffins&#34; by Herbert Werner, one of the few U boat commanders to survive the war.  Sure this movie is an eye opener but a lot of people have no idea what war is like or what being at sea for months at a time does to you.  As far as authenticity goes, it is down to the last detail.  A few years later we were at Kiel week to celebrate the opening of the Kiel Canal, and I was talking to a German sailor and he told me that the original series was 6 hours long.  He took me to see it at his friends house.  War movies rarely show war for what it is, cruel, boring and miserable.  This is one of the most revealing looks at war that I have seen,  And I've been in 3 wars.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I Loved this book and did not want to put it down at all. First jodi luckily book I've read and I will read more now
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|Bryson is very skilled at flashing these events before us and letting them fall into place.He is adept at finding ironies; in fact, he uses the word \\"ironic\\" extensively. We've read about these happenings before, especially Lindbergh's flight, as single events, but never all bundled together and juxtaposed so neatly.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am by no means a cat person, I say this because all the other similar books listed are what I'd call &#34;cat people books&#34; This book made me feel hopeful that everything in life happens for a reason, that anybody can overcome any situation and that positive energy will transcend every aspect of your life if you let it. Cat or no cat this book made me feel like I can do anything if I put in the work. Loved it!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is not challenging enough.  It is rather easy to win the game most of the time.  What else can a per say?
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I enjoyed most of the book and at times it was quite exciting, but it just seemed derivative.  Maybe because I have read most of Grisham's lawyer books, Sycamore Row seemed at times almost formulaic and familiar.  I also thought there was some moralizing like in his previous books.  The ending seemed quite weak.  But all in all I would recommend it as an airplane read.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Sort of interesting but too much histrionics in some parts. It also tends to drone on in the middle and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use and works for so many things that the clock on the counter is long gone.<br /><br />No more worries about travel clocks, alarm clocks or missed meetings!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Lots of fun. Very addictive. I am getting so addicted to my kindle my husband is getting jealous. Love my games and books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Oh my gosh, the minions look just like they were in the movie! This is awesome for all ages, the only problem is that you'll have to buy those coins. If you liked the movie, and you like temple run and subway surfers, this game is SO for you.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of my fav King stories of all time. Anyone that lived in this time would def  agree it strikes a chord
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King at his best in a short... absolutely impossible to put down single.<br /><br />Oh my, it made me long for the home state in the worst way, yet wonder what in the world had happened to the turnpike at the same time. The book follows happenings along the side of a closed little area of road known to and passed along by so many of us.<br /><br />It lets the imagination just run like a wild thing and follow along in the most amazing way. What fun!<br /><br />It is always good to have a book in my hand and this was no exception!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|This is their best album ever.  I have been a Tegan and Sara fan for over 8 years now and every single one of these songs is amazing.  My favorite is &#34;I Was a Fool.&#34;  The song is brilliant.  The music and the lyrics are so perfect.  Everyone needs to listen to these songs.  Closer, I'm Not Your Hero, I Was a Fool, and Now I'm All Messed Up are my favorites on the album.  I promise you will not be disappointed with this entire CD.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|It's funny, but predictable.  If you like Jennifer Aniston boys, you'll love this one.  Some of it's a little corny, but it is a one time watch movie.
B001BANK32|5.0|Kindle version is great some people say kindle books have slight errors, this edition is perfect as I have read many King books on my Kindle
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|I absolutely love this album!!!!  Their first is album was very nice, but this one is stunning.  Charlotte's voice is far more beautiful than before and I enjoyed her solos more than I had anticipated.  Jonathan is a stunning tenor as always.  His solos are breathtaking.  O Sole Mio takes on a saucy verve that is wonderful.  Looking forward to the next album here.  Repeat, repeat, repeat on the iPod for weeks.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Katy is delightful and charming. Her music tells a story most can relate to. The performances are colorful and cute.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|It was too far out there for me. I LOVED the first Season and the 3rd season but this one was just weird and to much stuff going on.
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|I love this album! It's so dark and the songs are so catchy. My favorite song is &#34;I hope you suffer&#34;. The album was worth the wait!
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|What a great story! Well made and superbly directed. The black and white film makes it even more compelling. Enjoy!
0738735027|5.0|I received these as a gift and love the cards, but they didn't come with the instruction book:(. The box was sealed so it  didn't fall  out and I would really like the instructions. I received the missing instructions and  am very happy.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I LIKE ALL THE JESSE STONE MOVIES.  I HAVE WATCHED THEM ALL SEVERAL TIMES.  I WASN'T FOND OF THE LAST ONE WHEN STONE LEFT MASSACHUSETTS(?).
B0099G4Y26|1.0|This album was so dissapointing! I thought her last album was bad with at least a few songs I loved. This one sucks!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is totally my fave game right now. I don't know  one person who has played and not gotten hooked.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Wonderful, I couldn't put it down. Never ending adventure. Looking forward to reading the whole series. As good as any I've read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|nice challenges, not too complex where you just go away frustrated. if I w<br />ould say anything it would be to use less Colorado puzzles and to change up the music (or be able to play your own)
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Best album I have bought in years! I love every song! It's filled with so much passion and hope. If you are a fan you will love it! It's their best album in my opinion
B008JGSM6G|5.0|IT is a good thing for my brain but I think the game is a little bit more than I think it is not the full story of the game
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Fun, challenging and great characters. I can't seem to put it down once I start playing! I do wish they had better buy options, more &quot;gems&quot; for the money spent.
B003MXB4FC|5.0|My new favorite movie!  Love the humor in this movie and see why it has become a cult favorite. so funny!
B000I8ERVC|5.0|Great idea.  Take everything you got.  Make one big score.  Buy some sweet motorcycles & keep riding free to Mardi Gras.  Riding free, partying hard & living.<br /><br />But every time the urge comes to do just that I remember an interview with Peter Fonda where he said the key to the movie (my words probably) was a scene near the end when they're kicking back having accomplished all they set out to do & sitting on the precipice of the future; thinking back on the adventure, Captain America couldn't help but think he missed something;  'we f*@!ed up', he said to Billy his faithful companion, shortly before they rode off into the sunset.<br /><br />Fonda said it was something like they should have stopped to live with some of the people they met along the way because they were really the ones who were living.  Kind of like the end of East Bound & Down.<br /><br />Side note - I love that 70s movies don't always have happy endings but tell real 'life' stories.
B004UID2LC|3.0|This one is kind of limited and all ready picked items are sad.  It is like, &#34;Well lets just grab this to post up and like it or leave it.&#34;, needs a little work to make it a little more user friendly.
B008JFUQ3O|1.0|I didn't really care for the 1st one however I thought it was wayyyyyy better than this turd. The only best parts were the minions which if u end up watching you'll see why. Also Try's spy partner was a nice addition but it didn't do much for the plot.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Kids set up Fri with spy chick gets married,secret bad guy thrown in mutates minions too purple and then everyone lives happily ever after. You knew gru would marry Lucy right from the beginning.<br /><br />END SPOILERS.<br /><br />If u were a fan of the first give it a go but otherwise I say slip it. Predictable. Boring and cliche.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Game of Thrones is just a fantastic series. Love the sets, the actors, the stories of the characters. I think that alot of the nudity is completely gratuitous and offensive, but obviously not offensive enough to keep me away!
B00E8G5H6Y|5.0|I have all the previous four seasons on Blu-ray disk... This set is a great addition to my collection.  It's a fan must have
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I didn't know Abraham Lincoln' got kicked in the face when katttttttnisss or should I say fatness pooped on him
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Awonderful insightful story, well written from the perscpective of person who is experiencing the devastating effects of alzheimer.  this story tells of the effects on the person and those around her.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This series has been addictive for me, and the first season was fantastic. Once you watch the first season, you will be compelled to watch the rest.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Game is ok once you figure out how to make the items you need.  Will continue to play for now.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Without a doubt...the most unique and entertaining electronic card game ever! Tons of action, challenges, and variety! Love it! A MUST have on every road trip or any other place when you need to entertain yourself. Awesome commentary throughout the game.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|This is an excellent feel-good movie. It has all the ingredients for light but satisfying entertainment. The acting is top-notch, there is humour, as well as moving moments. When Peter Gabriel's song 'The Story of Us' starts up, it always brings a lump to the throat.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. there are different modes so its not just bagging groceries. It gives hours of entertainment. A great buy. so addictive
1442337966|5.0|I absolutely love this. Very powerful messages are on it. It has five CD's with various topics and I listen to them repeatedly. The uplifting messages will calm your soul and give you a positive outlook on life. When I first received it I listened to the five tracks the same day. I enjoyed every single one of them and I keep going back to them on a regular basis. The only difference now is that I will select which track I want to listen to each time depending on how I am feeling on any particular day. I always walk away feeling very inspired. If you have ever had moments of discouragement or felt depressed in any way this will definitely be the antidote that you need. I would recommend this CD to everyone. It is also available in books if you prefer to read it for yourself versus listening to someone else reading it to you.
B00ED1QYQ6|3.0|This is a review of the most recent (2013) CD release from \\"Real Gone Music\\" of The Lords Of The New Church's 2nd studio album, \\"Is Nothing Sacred.\\"<br /><br />First, a short bit about the album itself - INS is The Lords most radio-friendly and stylistically diverse record, with their most relatively popular single, \\"Dance With Me\\" as well as their cover of \\"Live For Today.\\"  It's also the bands most balanced release in that all four members made significant contributions.  There's a few punkier, harder rocking numbers like the excellent \\"Partners In Crime\\" as well as darker, slow burn songs like \\"World's Without End\\" (which my friend and I used to heckle the band to play every time we saw them between '83 - '87).  There's even a bit of reggae with \\"Johnny Too Bad.\\"<br /><br />But it's \\"Dance With Me,\\" a track they later revisited via re-recording and remixing several times throughout their roughly 7 year career that defines this album.  Unfortunately, this release like the previous 2003 Track Records release contains the 1985 re-remix that is sonically much denser and suffers in comparison to the original 1983 album version which has only seen CD release on the original IRS Records Lords INS CD (catalog # 75039) which is long out of print and tough to find.<br /><br />Otherwise, this release sounds very much like the 2003 Track Records remaster, however it does not include any bonus tracks which is unfortunate.  A big plus though is the new liner notes and graphic layout of the booklet which includes several images of the various 12\\"/7\\" single sleeves and a few nice photos of the band from the era the album was recorded.  Like the other 2 new 2013 reissues of The Lords albums, the slightly different UK album cover is represented in the tray graphic.<br /><br />If you are a first time buyer of this or the other 2 Lords albums newly released by Real Gone Music, I highly recommend all three albums but this one is the relatively weakest (imo) of their studio releases.I give this one a average score mostly because it covers no new ground as a reissue and fumbles the ball with not including the original recording of DWM.  This one will appeal most to those listeners interested in the more Bauhaus/early Cult gothic genre.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this app is so cool I love it so much you should really get it. I love it get it
0877180121|2.0|Certainly not the easiest piano course. I was looking for something to get my 4 year old started on the very most basics. (Counting, black notes and white notes, finger numbers, etc.) This was a little too advanced for her. I decided on going with the Bastien Primer books. I am MUCH happier with them. This is probably like a level one piano book instead of a primer.

B00ED1QYSE|5.0|This is a review of the most recent (2013) CD release from &#34;Real Gone Music&#34; of The Lords Of The New Church's self titled debut album from 1982.<br /><br />First, a short bit about the album itself - This album was The Lords first album and is one of those rare debuts from an early 80's rock band that is a solid, great listen from start to finish.  Featuring former Dead Boys front man Stiv Bator, original Damned guitarist Brian James, bass player Dave Tregunna and Nicky Turner on drums - this band was pretty much the ultimate punk supergroup.<br /><br />The Lords debut album sound still remains fairly unique, especially the way the album was mixed with heavy reverb and compression that gives many tracks a sort of gothic surf guitar vibe.  Like a few other great punk bands that (at least appeared to be) in it for the long haul like The Clash, The Lords took the simple, raw hate stare of punk and refined and matured that sound and style without losing the genre's basic appeal.  They touch on many influences, from The New York Dolls to Jim Morrison to Apocalypse Now backed by the tribal, Killing Joke-esque drumming of Turner, the clear, clean bass of Tregunna and James' chiming, sharp guitar.  Fronted by Bator's snarling, acerbic vox, as said in Scott Schinder's essay on the band in the booklet, this is the band's defining statement.<br /><br />The minor downside of this release is there's no extra tracks such as relevant B-sides (Young Dont Cry, Girls Girls Girls) or the pre-album single versions of Livin' On Livin' and New Church included.  The 2003 Track Records release at least included the two B-Sides.<br /><br />Otherwise, this release sounds very much like the older Track Records remaster, however the big plus is the new liner notes and graphic layout of the booklet which includes several images of the various 7&#34; single sleeves and a few nice photos of the band from the era the album was recorded.  Like the other 2 Real Gone Music reissues, the tray graphic includes the alternate UK album cover.<br /><br />If you are a first time buyer of this or the other 2 Lords albums newly released by Real Gone Music, I highly recommend all three albums and this one is the by far the best of their studio releases.  I give this one my highest score because it is a genuine classic of the genre despite the fact it is a no frills release.  This one will appeal most to those listeners interested in the old school Damned/Goth/Punk style that the band members came from.graphic includes the alternate UK album cover.<br /><br />If you are a first time buyer of this or the other 2 Lords albums newly released by Real Gone Music, I highly recommend all three albums and this one is the by far the best of their studio releases.

031623480X|5.0|Easy to read book.  You just can't put it down it is so very interesting.  My sister bought it first and I just had to have my own copy. I was reading hers .<br /><br />Really see now how what you eat affects your whole body and your brain power.  I have been mostly  gluten free for several  years.  I am 119 lbs. and 5' 5&#34;. I was ranging from 135 to 137 lbs for several years. I have had issues of IBS in the past and that is when I knew gluten affected me. So I changed my eating habits 3 years ago. My sister was amazed how I still have not gained back the weight.<br /><br />I tried to explain to her about the evils of grain but not until she read this book did she clearly understand .  She has been on a mostly gluten free diet for about 3 weeks and also stopped drinking sodas. She has lost 10 lbs in 3 weeks. She is drinking mostly water with her meals now as I do.<br /><br /> My husband is reading it now. He is buying groceries now more compatible with what is in this book. He especially paid attention to the part that says - If your stomach is big around the waist then your brain becomes smaller. Dementia is just waiting around the corner the older you get. That scared him and me. I have been using for myself gluten free noodles made with corn for a while.. Now he is starting to like them.<br /><br />This book has given me new knowledge about all grains , the truth about processed foods, low carbs and low fats. How gluten is hidden in ingredients under different names.  Amazing how following the information written in this book can actually alter your state of health along with alleviating some diseases such as IBS, inflammation in arthritis, depression ,headaches, diabetes, epilepsy ,insomnia, overweight and obesity, Tourette's syndrome to name a few. . . A must read book.<br /><br />This book is written by a well respected well known neurologist .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Like the first person narrative of the incarcerated lawyer. Twists and turns along the way, typical Grisham surprises,  great read!
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Such good actors but we did not finish due to the nudity and language that I believe was not necessary and not welcome in my house. I respect my family enough to turn it off.

B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|takes to long to get to the fun gets boring because of over tasking boreing thats just me its got great graphics exploding digital sound graphics overall great game just not for me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. I  really like it except for the fact that it is hard to complete the missions and money and those coins things are hard to come by.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|is the best movie ever based on one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Jodie Foster is great!
0307719774|5.0|I really like this little book; it's thought provoking, fun and usually only takes a minute of two for me to answer the questions each day.  I've almost gotten through a year now and I think I will like this book even better when I can look back and chuckle, cry, or just reminisce about my previous year's answers.  I bought one as a gift and one for myself.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Started off a little slow but was a great historical fiction piece and really developed the characters well.  Can't wait for the movie.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This story may not be history, but after seeing this movie, you will certainly question the history as currently written.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|A nice game to play<br />5 out of 5<br />It is also very addicting so prepare all those who download this game
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I'd seen and heard the promos and was excited to get this CD, but it seems to me the songs I heard in the promos are not on this CD, I'll donating it to the thrift store.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|Love Def Leppard...This dvd is great...Can't wait for the next one...I go to all their show around my home town..
B008JFURII|5.0|Great movie as a stand-alone or as a follow-up to RED.  This did not disappoint on any level.  Just the right blend of action, violence, crazy genius and humor, friendship and plain fun.  I can hardly wait for RED 3!!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Good historical 'fictionalized'version of Pearl Harbor. Nice romance set amidst panic and chaos of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the USA into WW2.
B002XD8KEU|1.0|This movie is trashy, it promotes immorality as pinnacle of life, and doesn't show the misery that lifestyle really brings.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is amazing the vehicles are awesome and the wars are awesome I would recommend it to anyone who like these games
0307346617|4.0|This was a pretty good read. It was recommended in an article I read so I bought it. I liked the style, in other words, the way the story flows, the way the characters are interviewed, the description of places. Don't let the movie discourage you from reading this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is great. its awesome I can get it on my kindle. most game apps just give you a trial period but this one you get the whole game. I didn't think I would like this game but I was bored so I got it. now if I'm bored I can play it. this is one hard game to put down once you start. now I play even when I'm not bored.. thumbs up.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|My gosh was I pleasantly surprised by this grand and glorious production. You do not want a second rate<br />DVD collection..you want this one in it without delay.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and have loved every one…but 'The Secret Keeper' for me is by far her best.  Laurel worked hard to put together the pieces of her mother's history to come up with the answer for the crime she (Laurel) witnessed as a teen.  Twists and turns and a very satisfying ending.  Definitely a page turner.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Why not attack the monsters from high altitude in the air?  One good 1980's-era laser-guided bunker-buster bomb dropped from 50,000 feet by a 1960's era bomber and you'd be done.  Why not use your sword weapon that cuts these monsters in half at the START of the battle rather than waiting until you're out of every other option?<br /><br />Pile improbable solutions to easy problems over and over and you have this *AWFUL* movie.  Just terrible.
B004XZR63M|4.0|I believe that it was an enjoyable book to read along with the concepts you gain a lot of lessons and general knowledge to self improve and an individual and financially.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|For the girl who has everything except enough storage space to hold it all. This bin is a great gift for both kids and parents. It comes shipped folded down very small, but it can expand into the tote shape as seen in the picture. The artwork is delightful and will compliment a healthy toy collection. Great gift!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Limited broadcast distance; should be good for 50 ft; only good for 20 ft.<br />Recommend wireless extender (Actiontec) Actiontec WCB3000N IEEE 802.11n 300 Mbps Wireless Range Extender
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele's music is wonderful, her voice exceptional.  I love to listen to her sing, and listen over and over without getting tired of hearing her!
B00DEFW998|5.0|Very nice addition to versify my music library. Some very nice cuts with the addition of Nora Jones & also some good examples of East Indian music.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app!  I get a new Bible verse to start the day.  The search feature locates scriptures when I can't remember where to find them - which is too often, unfortunately.  The only thing I would like to see added is a way to save the bookmarks and notes to the SD card or someplace so I can restore them to my phone.  Every time my phone has needed to be replaced, I've lost all of my bookmarks and notes.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|pure entertainment if your on the bus or to a relatives I enjoy this game :)<br />Mabey a little bit better starter cars but its fan and enjoy able
B00ENV1HPY|4.0|If you love Mazzy Star, you won't be disappointed. This album of new songs is a new version of her work...not a completely new approach, but simply a new version of the same sound.  I don't tire of Mazzy Star, and find it just as satisfying as the other albums in my collection.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I loved this book. One of the few books I would read again!  One of my favorite lines was when Rudy tried the suit on and the narrator said his shoes let him down.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is my second favorite Bond after Sean Connery. If I remember correctly Ian Fleming's original Bond was hard drinking and hard living. A character Daniel Craig plays well.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Very good product. I bought this case about a month ago for my iPhone 5S. So far I am happy with this case.
B00947N6UG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and would watch again.  The story line reminds me of the Santa Clause 3 movie with Jack Frost.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Being retired I usually read a novel in one or two days... But this novel took me four days.  Grisham technique of character development and story line brings the reader right into the story.  I just wanted to stay longer into the world created by the author.  Nice Job !!!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I don't recall this app ever working. Either it isn't maintained at all anymore, or the developer is just putting up an app to put one up.
0143122916|2.0|This is an important book that ought to be published and read by as many people as possible. It’s important primarily because it sheds light on the hideous labor camps and human tragedies in North Korea, which maybe now will be slightly more known to the public and to policy makers.<br /><br />Writing wise, I think this book doesn't live up to high standards. The writing is fairly mechanical and uninteresting. The author didn't manage to squeeze even one drop of empathy from me toward Shin, the protagonist. Moreover, his political analysis that accompanied Shin’s story was shallow, and oftentimes tended to be sweeping generalizations in a few short lines.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book, and although not well written, it ought to gain as wide exposure as possible.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I thought Tom Cruise was becoming a has-been.  After seeing this movie, Tom is definitely not a has-been.  It's nice to see him in action again and making good movies.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|Game Is great it's worth the money but one thing that it needs multiplayer then the game is unbeatable it's like a gta v mobile but just needs multiplayer
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Stephen King is famously quoted for saying that if you can't get the scares the traditional way you go for the gross out. Well, that can be said of the original Evil Dead, and 'gross' is present once again (and in spades) for this reboot.<br /><br />It's hard judging a reboot against an original because no matter how diligently you try not to, you're going to compare the new one to the original. Was I a fan of the original? Yes. do I believe many reboots are not necessary as they can never produce the same feeling? Yes again. In spite of these facts, is this reboot worthy of the Evil Dead nameplate? Yes once again.<br /><br />Evil book? Check. Cabin in the isolated woods? Check. A group of young people who are clueless as to the fate that awaits them? Check. Dark humor? No check. This is a much darker take on The Evil Dead franchise and it works. Take the scene where possessed Mia is chastising her brother for leaving her with their sick mother years before. The scene is more akin to Reagan's spirits trying to weaken the young priest in The Exorcist than to the cackling zombies of the original Dead.<br /><br />I did mention the gross out stuff and it really is an impressive film for horror aficionados who like their gore to be real, actual stuff rather than computer generated effects. Somewhere Tom Savini was surely saying 'Wow, that was terrific, I wish I'd thought of that' about many scenes. It does go a bit too far on the gore though when it really isn't necessary.<br /><br />The pacing was great because of the more menacing quality of the entire process. It felt more grueling because the director allows you to be there completely for the moment and processing afterward, rather than jumping too quickly right to the next scene.<br /><br />All in all Evil Dead can stand alongside the original as it meets the targets the original film established and then some. 4.50 stars<br /><br />Now I can't wait for a remake of dead by dawn...dead by dawn!!!!! ( I know, even I can't believe I just typed that. That tells you how gratifying this film was as a horror movie)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great! The best I've read in a while! Such vivid imagination from the author. Definitely two thumbs up for you!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|What can I say....Yeah to Thor!  I already have watched it three times.  Can't wait to see the second movie.
B00G4CXHSK|1.0|I wish I didn't even download this game. I deleted it after I played it. It's too difficult and you die easily. If there was a zero star I would put that.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game,Slenderman is dead to me XD when I play the street level,I always leave the house until the end...I always die there....the game scares me  a lot,but i am a scaredy-cat XD SLENDER MAN?!?!?!Y YOU NO SHARE BROKEN TV?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? XD
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the story, part one and two. Great writing, suspenseful and hard to put down. First you route for Amy, then Nick... but was disappointed in the ending. I didn't feel satisfied. Somebody deserved a more brutal outcome.
B00AEFY66U|2.0|Although a classic, it was very slow and boring.  I expected more of a mystery plot of the Gatsby character.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best fighting game I ever played. I love the robots, graphics, and the moves. You need this app
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Good book. Movie was good too.  But I dislike being forced to add 14 more words. etc, etc, etc.etc. etc. annoying.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game and I love it I would.recommend it even an adult would have fun with this game
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I was skeptical about this movie [at first].  But, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I sang along with the cast.
B00G9QLP9Y|1.0|Maps are fine, but no directions from one place to another? That seems pretty basic. Makes it useless to me. I'll be deleting.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway surfer is the same as temple run. But with a different theme.<br /><br />Temple run- your character running away form a sceleton monkey that is trying to get you.<br /><br />Subway Sufer- your character is running away from a fat police man. All because your character did graffeedee on a train.<br />BUT ON HOLIDAYS SUBWAY SURFER ALWAYS CHANGES THEIR THEME AND IT IS AWSOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|greatly in enjoy this game but it is so addictive.  I play this everyday on my lunch break.  Getting some friends addicted too.lol
B009NF54ZE|5.0|Great game to sharpen your mind. The game has three different types of puzzle. One spot the difference. The second is spot the pair's and the third is a word puzzle.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Wow.  There are a lot of really intense reviews about this movie.  Please remember that we all have the right to have an opinion and I am not trying to make any one change their minds or believe the way I do.<br />First, the movie is very one sided.  Having said that, it is important to see what is happening and even the one sided approach can spark conversations that will lead to much needed changes.<br />Second, Sea World had an opportunity to comment.  They declined.  That speaks volumes to me and leads me to believe they may have been less than honest. I would have liked to have heard their &#34;side.&#34;<br />That being said, you cannot completely discount the accounts of the persons who were actually involved with these particular animals.<br />I believe it is a sincere and horrible tragedy that these animals have been captured at all, ever.<br />I think this movie is worth a viewing and a conversation.  I gave it 5 stars for the POSSIBILITY that it could have a positive impact on how we see this magnficent animals.  Orcas, also known as &#34;killer whales&#34; are actually dolphins.  And to date, there has never been a recorded &#34;attack&#34; on humans in the wild.  I think this important to note. In fact, the just the opposite as with smaller species of dolphins. And they have unique &#34;personalities&#34;... not unlike humans. I am fortunate enough to live in Oregon and not far from where we hosted Keiko (Free Willy) for some time as they attempted to &#34;rehabilitate&#34; Keiko enough to release him.  Sadly, that ended tragically. And in Keiko's case, I wish they had never released him.  Clearly he was very deeply imprinted on humans and sought out gentle contact with them even after his release. I believe that while Tilikum and Keiko were both orcas, they are were clearly different in temperament. I don't think you can discount temperament either.  Sadly Tilikum has proven that he has the capcity to harm and the willingness to do so. Further,  I was shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.  You can walk off the street and apply to be a &#34;trainer.&#34;  If you can swim, have an appealing personality and physical appearance, you're in.  No real education, no real training, not even a high school diploma.  Disappointing.  However, to me that puts more of the burden of responsibility squarely on Sea World for the safety of their &#34;trainers.&#34;<br />I hope that if you chose to watch this movie that you do so with an open mind and heart.  It's NOT a perfect movie.  I wish there had been more information from the &#34;other&#34; side, however, the film still has value in my opinion.shocked to hear that the &#34;trainers&#34; at Sea World are NOT trained or educated at all.

1878424114|5.0|A must have book. I try to read at least one chapter everyday. The best book I've ever put my hands on
B00ADQPB50|5.0|First season i enjoyed very much, however ASYLUM is alot better than the first season in my opinion. Its addicting suspenseful and creepy. The story line is incredible. Some comments i saw on this was that there is too much going on, sure there is but you don't loose track of where you left off and does not confuse. It's a great story and well connected. A must buy for anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE MINECRAFT PE!!! The only problem is that i wish that you could breed sheep and stuff.

B0010VHXOE|5.0|Life In Slow Motion is one of my top 10 favorite albums ever. David Gray writes some interesting songs and very heartfelt music. Every song on this album has a meaning to me and when a musician/band does that it makes the listen even better. Favorite songs on here is &#34;life in slow motion&#34; and &#34;disappearing world&#34;. David gray is one of the best songwriters in the past 20 years its just sad he doesn't get the recognition he deserves as a songwriter,singer and musician.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Teamviewer is extremely easy to set up and use. I can view and control my office computer from my Nexus tablet. While it takes a bit of getting used to the navigation, once you get the hang of it, it works quite well.<br /><br />It's hard to beat the price of &#34;Free&#34;.
B0050OMJIW|5.0|Full of wonderfully dark humor. The part about crabapples is utterly hilarious. The only downside I can think of it that it does have a tendency to jump around a bit, and doesn’t make for ‘easy reading’. In fact, it took me three attempts to actually get into it, but it was the best thing I did. Persevere with this novel, and you are in for an absolute treat.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have spent my money on something useful like a beer. I'm cocking my head and biting my lip whilst trying to figure out why people told me to buy this.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|Kind of hard to follow and understand the story. Computer math geeks might like this movie, worth watching for free.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|This movie was one that could keep you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. The actors in this film sure made it look like reality.
B0031R5K72|5.0|Love, love, love! I can't really add to what's already been mentioned but this book deserves 5 stars. A must read.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fairly certain no one with an IQ over 120 could tolerate this book. Probably explains why my mother reads these things.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is candy crush what more can I say? It is just like all the sugar addiction hype everyone needs to play for hours and hours on end. lol.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I truly love everything that Doris Day sings or acts in. I am so glad it was released. She is absolutely wonderful whether she sings or acts..Her fans would enjoy this cd.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|With the proper time and knowledge you can get good tones out of this pedal. Great for the price, might get more Behringer stuff in the future.
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|The PS4 polls its devices every 5min or so, Just leave the USB charge cable connected and they will run all the time while watching movies on the web or disk, That is the only thing I found that requires a little insight, During gaming they are fine. Just set the audio options on the PS4 to DTS and they don't cut out.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The only problem I have with th e game is the fact that you have to pay in order to move up levels with coins that are in fact very hard to obtain

B00DJYJPLO|5.0|Excellent sequel to &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; and &#34;Before Sunset.&#34; Although less romantically idealistic than the previous two films, it's more believable for viewers who are aging along with these two talented actors.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited forever for this game!I could not download it on my phone and it really pissed me off. I have a Kindle Fire HD and did not think it was ever going to be available for it but lo and behold I have it on my kindle now and cannot get enough of it! A VERY BIG THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Makes me appreciate where I live.  Should be required reading for everyone, to be reminded what America is and how blessed we are.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really love this game. it totally challenges your brain while trying to find clues.  so far so good and I'm only on floor 5!!!!!
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|I bought this game because of its good reviews. I wanted a game that didn't take long to play and wasn't too hard to learn. It works really well as a casual game. It was surprising that given the small number of cards can have such variety in gameplay. I have to say it's the most fun with at least three people.<br /><br />On the plus side, it comes with a nice red velvet bag that carries all the cards and cubes.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|One of my favorite series so far. Plenty of action, sex, drugs, and violence. What more could you ask for in a &#34;historical drama&#34; !!!???
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|So awesome to know I am not the only person to feel the things I do. I laughed, I cried.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The app works great most of the time however it freezes and acts up I just updated it and before I could play I had to restart my kindle because the app kept freezing and foreclosing
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It was a well written book.  It was easy to love the characters. It's a much different book than I normally go for. I'm happy I did.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I can't say enough go how wonderful this product is made. I bought a two pak of similar pens at t-mobile and they lasted less then a month. I've had this one for going on three weeks and the only one I use is still in new shape. What's really great about this pen is that it has three tips to use, each on smaller than the last. Even if you wore out one at a time it would take you a couple of years. The trick is not to mash them down, just a light touch is all it takes.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An exciting ,Sci-Fi with lots of action that tells not only a story  but put the characters personality into the flow of action to give it  significant human interest. I found the prologue to be a great introduction to this book.
0451417704|5.0|Daniel Suarez has written another great thriller. As in his previous ( which I highly recommend ). The story is plausible, where technology, science and the real world come together. This shows how government is watching you. Call it fiction or truth its kind of scary.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Documentary was interesting and informative. It will make all viewers think about the whole food industry. Perhaps it could make some positive changes to the food culture.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is an awesome read and I can't wait for the sequel. The characters are fantastic and I especially enjoyed the photos that are included throughout the book.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|perfect packaging great shape the product was like new.<br />I was very happy with the speed and condition of the product I purchased.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Interesting book.  The premise is a bit suspect, but if you accept that, then the story follows along well.  It was good filler reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! I play it almost every day!!!!! I just love it its so easy to play but fun!!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I loved this book. Just when you think you have it figured out, it turns on you again and again. I didn't see the ending coming until the last minute. Great thriller!

B001CDZZI6|3.0|This small book covers 34 strengths. Things like Achiever, Learner and Developer. You complete a assessment online and are told your top 5. Then you can look through the book to read a few pages about each strength. Along with simple tips. I liked the first part of the book where the author writes about a multiplier effect with talent and work.<br /><br />Talent for what you are doing (1-10) X work (1-10) = results (1-100). Instead of just looking at it as: work = results.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book is the way the website and book code works. Each copy has one code that can be used to take the assessment one time. So if you want to let your spouse use the book then you have to buy another book or buy a code on the website. I personally read the book 5 years ago and wanted to take the test again. No dice.<br /><br />So beware if you're buying a used book because the website code will probably be missing.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Yeah, I loved this one too! It is really awesome as well. What can I say, I love mythology and I love a good adventure! Don't worry I won't spoil anything for anyone.
0451232852|1.0|I bought the paperback. The type is so small it was not pleasant to read.<br /><br />I threw the paperback book away, I did not know they made them so small.<br /><br />I probably will not read the trilogy
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you eat food, you need to see this movie. It goes behind the scenes of how our food is produced without getting too graffic about it. We saw it in a movie theater before buying the DVD and it cause several discussions among the viewers in the lobby. We realized how much we had in common. This DVD has aditional bonus extras as well. For the record the PBS &#34;NOW&#34; program ran an excellent introduction about this movie. Unforturely the &#34;NOW&#34; program is not part of this DVD. Check with the PBS site for availablity.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Really enjoyed this series... though the storyline seems to be awfully close to the hunger games at times, it's quite well written and enjoyable.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Awesome book! Really gets you hooked in for the next one and the next one. I ended up reading the whole series in a matter of a few weeks. Loved it.
B005PK1G76|4.0|good buy, good price.<br />Maybe if the middle compartment had a way to close via zipper - would be best - since my husband likes to leave his car keys and phone in there w/o telling me when we're out shopping, and then I usually go fold up the stroller and place in the trunk w/o knowing . Good way for his phone to fall out and break, or us to lose his car keys in the parking lot!  Lol.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Yet another view of World War II.  The characters come alive in this gripping historical novel.  A real page turner that's hard to put down.  I'm anxious to get the third book in this series by Ken Follett.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Touted as a sequel to A Time To Kill there is a heavy rehash of past characters and events that have little to do with the developing story. An easy to read Grisham novel but not a real grabber.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved it! I can't wait for my kids get old enough to read these. I think it was a very interesting story and I really got into it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I am so glad.<br />What a fantastic read, I finished it in a week.  I am a dog lover and this book made me laugh all the way through.<br />Must go on the wish list..!!!

B00FXMGI0G|3.0|I just watched this movie an hour ago, and I can barely remember anything about it.<br /><br />Oh, wait. It's coming back to me. Bruce Willis is Moses, an aging ex-spy. He's Retired but also Extremely Dangerous (R.E.D.). He's trying to settle down into a comfortable home life with Sarah, one of the most annoying female characters I've ever seen on film. She's played gamely by Mary Louise-Parker, who normally I love, but the character herself is written as this inspid tag-along who constantly causes trouble with her ignorance, but then throws a fit when Moses doesn't want to include her in the espionage or give her a loaded gun. And when she DOES manage to assist with the spy stuff? Why, she does it all by kissing people or being sexy, letting the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think of her: dumb but hot. Her constant bickering and whining with Moses is meant to be funny, but I found it annoying.<br /><br />Moses is joined by an old co-worker, the scatterbrained Marvin who is played perfectly by John Malcovich. He basically steals the show every time he's on the screen. Together, Moses and Marvin must figure out who has recently revived in the public eye an old, failed mission they undertook long ago. Something called Nightshade. Along the way they will encounter a seductive Russian agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones stoutly refusing to do anything even remotely resembling a Russian accent), a brilliant physicist (Anthony Hopkins stealing the show as much as Malcovich), old friends (Helen Mirren openly refusing to take any of this seriously), and old enemies (Lee Byung-hun as a one-note Korean contract killer).<br /><br />These actors all throw themselves into their roles with goofy abandon, providing the only real treat of the film. It's fun enough to watch them mug and smirk their way through the script. The story, however, is uninteresting and vague when it should be its clearest, with the stakes never fully clear for the first half of the plot. By the time things start to make sense, it becomes hard to care too much about the plot, which always feels secondary to the explosions and constant gunfire anyway.<br /><br />&#34;Are we supposed to care about these characters?&#34; my girlfriend asked in the last third of the movie. &#34;I mean, they sure are killing a lot of innocent people who are just doing their jobs.&#34;<br /><br />That's true, too.<br /><br />I'd probably rate the movie higher -- it DOES just want to be a loud, firey, shoot-em-up -- if the dialogue had been tighter, but most of the script reads like a cheesy sitcom. I kept expecting to hear muted trombones quacking after every clunky joke or quirky aside. The film does have its funny moments, but those are mostly in the reaction shots of Malcovich and Willis. I don't think a single line even got me to chuckle.<br /><br />As loud, chaotic, and senseless as a fireball, the film dissipated from my memory as quickly as smoke. It was fun to watch at the time, but a lack of meaningful characters, interesting dialogue, coherent plotting, and relatable protagonists made this film, overall, a mostly forgettable experience.things start to make sense, it becomes hard to care too much about the plot, which always feels secondary to the explosions and constant gunfire anyway.<br /><br />&#34;Are we supposed to care about these characters?&#34; my girlfriend asked in the last third of the movie. &#34;I mean, they sure are killing a lot of innocent people who are just doing their jobs.&#34;<br /><br />That's true, too.<br /><br />I'd probably rate the movie higher -- it DOES just want to be a loud, firey, shoot-em-up -- if the dialogue had been tighter, but most of the script reads like a cheesy sitcom.

B00FRMCYQ4|3.0|WARNING: This review contains so-called &#34;spoilers.&#34; I say &#34;so-called&#34; because I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch this film and not figure out what's going to happen, but I guess you never know. So, consider yourself warned.<br /><br />Before I talk about the story, let me discuss what works in the film: This movie is visually gorgeous. I don't watch a lot of animated films, so it's sometimes breath-taking for me to sit down with one and see just how far computer rendering has come since the last one I saw. The detail and perspective and just overall look of this movie is fantastic. Also, as a children's film, the overall plot is simple enough, the various jokes cartoonish enough, and the pacing revved up enough to keep a kid's attention for the film's 90 minutes. You'll also probably have kids clamoring for the inevitable line of toys (racing accessories sold separately?) that this movie seemed designed to market.<br /><br />However, if you have a kid that thinks too hard about stories, or if you're just an adult looking for some eye candy, the film is a weak, watery, predictable mess. Let me count the ways.<br /><br />1. Our main character is a snail who has named himself Turbo. Turbo has an unstoppable desire to be fast, hopefully someday fast enough to join the Indy 500. His brother, Paul Giamatti, rightly thinks this is a stupid dream, and grows ever frustrated as Turbo constantly puts himself and other snails in danger with his head-in-the-cloud fantasies. Other than this, Turbo has no personality traits at all.<br /><br />2. In a (suicidal?) malaise, Turbo accidentally gets sucked into a street racing car and is given a nitrous oxide bath, he develops the ability to move hundreds of miles an hour, and also gains headlights, a car/shell alarm, and a pretty powerful radio/sound system. Should we ignore the disturbing implication that Turbo is only able to achieve his dreams with the help of magic speed juice? Should we ignore the logical problems with a snail suddenly getting blinkers? Let's.<br /><br />3. Turbo is discovered by a struggling taco salesman, a chubby Mexican guy (sigh) named Tito. He runs the taco business with his level-headed brother, Angelo. When Tito discovers Turbo can move hundreds of miles an hour, leaving an unreal, blue phosphorous trail in his wake, he tries to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500. Angelo disapproves, giving us our movie's first theme: brothers suck. That's right, even though Turbo has an unreal, otherworldly power, neither Angelo nor Paul Giamatti are impressed and still think Turbo is a lost cause. This is where the movie started to lose me. I mean, come on. I just willingly allowed that a snail morphed into a tiny car. Now you want me to believe that this is not going to be a big deal to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD?<br /><br />But of course it's not, because otherwise the movie wouldn't be able to hopscotch neatly through every &#34;follow your dream&#34; cliche in the book, including fighting against the people who are constantly saying &#34;you can't do it.&#34; But, of course, Turbo COULDN'T do it. Not until he got injected with that powerful chemical that ... oh, yeah. I said I was going to ignore that.<br /><br />Ahem.<br /><br />So, encountering resistance every step of the way, Turbo finally makes it to the Indy 500 to race alongside his racing idol, Bill Hader (doing the best job out of any of the actors). Turns out Bill is secretly a jerk -- surprise, surprise -- and tries to kill Turbo during the race in front of the whole world. There's a huge pile-up in the process, and Turbo's shell gets cracked and -- uh oh! -- he loses his magic powers right at the end of the race! But what's this? Paul Giamatti finally believes in his brother, and he delivers a big speech about how the power was in Turbo all along, and Turbo inches across the finish line under his own speed, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the livid Bill Hader.<br /><br />And I call &#34;boo.&#34; The movie tries to shoehorn this message of self-empowerment at the end as if that was what it was meaning to teach all along, but it makes absolutely no sense in light of the rest of the film. &#34;Follow your dreams no matter what anyone says! You have it in you!&#34; the movie pretends to be saying, while subtly adding &#34;as long as you get a little help from a wishing star and glowing blue fluids.&#34; There are so many other plot turns and twists, so many other story avenues that a mutant speed snail movie could've taken, but this film takes the safest, oldest, and dumbest one of all. And it doesn't even do it consistently! At the end, for no reason other than because kids will certainly want it to happen, Turbo has his powers back. How did that happen? Who knows? He also has a cadre of snail friends with different morphing shells that didn't exist before. Why?<br /><br />Oh, that's right. Toys.<br /><br />A brainless, shameless attempt to market merchandise alongside a moral message that the movie only half-believes in, TURBO is only enjoyable on the shallowest of levels. Oh, and -- I can't get past it -- I'm pretty sure it's the first pro-steroids kids' film I've ever seen.4;boo.&#34; The movie tries to shoehorn this message of self-empowerment at the end as if that was what it was meaning to teach all along, but it makes absolutely no sense in light of the rest of the film. &#34;Follow your dreams no matter what anyone says!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|The last book (5) of Game of Thrones series was hard to put down.  I enjoyed it very much. The only comment I have is the reader was left wondering what happened to some of the main characters.  With all of the story lines available  to the author I would love to see one more book to bring closure to some of these characters  we can always hope. Jim Johnson
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Wilde has the rare, uncanny articulation that allows him to express complicated ideas and emotions which many have lived, but few have been able to mold into something concrete from the misty grey subconscious. The writing is eloquent if somewhat (and ironically) immodest. Irony? Or was he writing to himself?<br /><br />Some passages run on inexcusably, stringing more thoughts together than this mere mortal can digest in one pass, and there are occasional embellishments and elaborations in the narration and that do little to add to the story, but the dialogue is so strong that all is forgiven in the end.

B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|All of Gary's books are a must read for any serious course student. Especially DU. This books takes forgiveness to a whole new level. It makes you think about the people in your life and what lessons they are there to teach you.

Thank you Gary, Arten, And Pursah for keeping me on course.<br />God is.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game. Fun and addicting. Free is pretty nice price for this one. I recommend this game.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|The original had a great story with cheap special effects.  This one has a cheap story with great special effects.  The beginning was good, but it seems like they lost creativity towards the end and substituted out-of-place monsters and big explosions for content.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Mr. Aslan sees right in the beginning of his book a great importance of Jesus during his lifetime because of the Testimonium Flavianum, which is of course a falsehood. The fact that Jesus is only mentioned twice in Historiae by Flavius Josephus is the proof that Jesus (if he ever existed) was not important at all and that he is probably a product of fiction.
B001H1SVO8|1.0|I am Jacks Swollen appreciation of Amazon for carrying this movie. Read the book. Better yet, sit back with some frozen orange juice concentrate and order up a signed first edition to read when the lights go out...

0316201561|5.0|Twins Alex and Conner fall through a Fairy Tale Book their Grandmother gave them and starts them on a quest to get home. Along the way they meet their favorite Fairy Tale characters and some not so favorite (the big bad wolf pack for one). I found this book to be refreshing and delightful. I loved the different take on the characters like Red Riding Hood being self centered, Goldilocks on the run from the law. I had a hard time putting the book down and truthfully read it in a day. If you want to read a book that is a change of pace from what you normally read give this book a try.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great story from John Grisham. Bringing back some great characters from one of his best novels. A great mix of the Old South, and the justice of a modern generation.
B005DOKK7Q|4.0|Bought for my new 2013 paperwhite as it was on sale. About an inch longer and a half inch wider for paperwhite. I don't understand why amazon discontinued paperwhite version of this sleeve. It looks very nice.

B008KOTNVA|4.0|I've been in and out of a number of Mac laptops, iPods, and towers, and built a few computers. I wish I'd had this kit a long time ago, because there was always some fastener that had a weird slot, or was smaller than what bits I had. I finally bought this because I desperately needed the tri-lobe tip to remove a battery in a Macbook Pro. I don't think I'll have any more problems within finding the right bit! Quality of the bits seems quite good, and there's certainly an amazing variety of extremely small tips (who knew there was such a thing as a triple-zero Philips?). My only con is that the bits themselves are smaller than any other set I have, so I can't use them in any  handle but the one they came with. Really wish they had come with an adapter to address that. And one small nit: damn near impossible to get a bit out of its rubber holder one-handed, so pull out the ones you need before you get started. Otherwise, they're just what the doctor -- or the fix-it guy -- ordered.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It so good to read that again and my favorite part is when Greg yell his lungs because he thought chicken pox
B00GD9F59S|5.0|It was the to end to the series, the book grabs you by the heart and takes you on a ride. This book is to die for. A one sit read ,like forget school, quite your job and drop the kids at grandmas. The end is amazing and will make you cry in a good way, I love this so much.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Not as good as the first in the series.  Great WWII plot, but not as interesting from an international perspective.  Follett fails to build up the same endearment to the original characters' children as I felt for the main characters in Fall of Giants.  Those characters all make cameos in Winter of the World- which made me just want to read more about them!  A little unsatisfying from that standpoint, and sometimes the plot seems contrived.  I could tell in the first chapter that the German characters were going to deal with Nazi persecution of homosexuals and the disabled because of strategic &#34;hints&#34; the author gives. Usually, Follett is a little more subtle! And really, the main American character happens to be in Honolulu the day Pearl Harbor was bombed? Could have been more nuanced, but all in all a good and entertaining follow up.  I can never put down this author's books!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The graphics are good and certain actions are animated. Great game to play.  Some hidden  objects are very hard to see.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A spell-binding story of a young girl, abandoned but only to a better life during war torn Germany.  A book for ALL ages, well written and carefully woven with characters that will stay with you long after you have closed the book.
B004LROMSO|1.0|I bought this series because I like the Camelot story. But I was shocked to see nudity and sexual situations not fit for family viewing. This series should have been rated R.

0307592731|5.0|How terrific it is to accompany the author as she takes the physical and emotional journey across the Pacific Crest Trail. So well written-- that the reader almost  comes to experience the  heat  and the sweat, the frigid cold, the  blisters, and the incredible weight of the back pack too.  I loved the ending as well, quite fitting and a relief to me.
0316067598|5.0|This is an excellent book by a Navy SEAL.  When you read the book you learn about what it takes to become a Navy SEAL, and all about the Operation Redwing disaster.  The book is a very honest account written by a true American Patriot, Marcus Littrell.  Littrell shares the pain he still experiences due to the loss of his very close, SEAL friends in combat.  I highly recommend this book.
B0085776BG|3.0|Good movie if you are willing to suspend your knowledge of history and military protocol. This movie, of course, is a hugely agenda-driven offering from the Hollywood elite. They are today probably wishing Obama could call in a squadron of &#34;Red Tails&#34; to fix his AHA problems (amongst others).<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there is little reality and little history here, but if you are looking for fighters, bombers, machine guns, bombs, and faux heroes...you might like this.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this for my husband.<br />He says it feels comfortable in the hand; the thumb buttons take getting used to but after a few days it's really nice.  He's never used a gaming mouse before, and as far as I know hasn't used any of the extra buttons... but he does love the &#34;breathing&#34; light.<br />I hope to get one for myself soon - my hands are smaller than his, but it feels comfortable to me too.  I don't think I'll be able to use the frontmost thumb button, as it's a real stretch for me to reach, but he has no trouble.<br />His old mouse was corded, but mine is cordless, and when I use his new mouse I don't feel any drag of the cord along the desktop.  It doesn't seem to catch on all the stuff it goes past, or get hung up at the desk's edge.<br /><br />As neither of use have ever used a gaming mouse, we can't compare to that, but compared to normal mice it's sure a step up.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|If I could buy a copy of this for everyone I know, I would.<br /><br />I'll just settle for buying a copy for everyone I love and I'll press it firmly into their hands and look them in their questioning eyes say, &#34;Just listen. There's more here than you think you know.&#34;<br /><br />This young woman and the entire &#34;system&#34; bringing her talent to me here gives me so much hope for our future. It really affirms a world worth living in, worth bettering, worth working for.<br /><br />Just listen. And then just try to remain hopeless, sad, and motionless.<br /><br />Five stars could never be enough.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|great show and my 6 year old daughter loved. It's a very beautiful story and I love the Scottish accents.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Action packed....riveting.  surprises around every corner. A must read.  Just when you think you know what's coming the story takes another direction.
B00GO8Z8H2|2.0|I think it is odd that the Proms concert is so old. There is a Doctor Who Proms concert each year, including 2013, so why not show it? Also, I think it is ridiculous that the specials about the Doctors pre Eccleston aren't here.  Without them, it isn't much of a 50th anniversary collection.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I’m a big Star Trek fan and so am having a lot of fun watching these movies.  The cast is great and Benedict Cumberbatch was spot on.  However, I can’t help but feel that in some ways his rendition of Khan was a  bit similar to his rendition of Sherlock Holmes (BBC Production).  In some ways, not all ways, of course.  Maybe that’s just me.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Such a talented cast and an amazing story line. I will watch this movie again and again.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Clever show - every episode had us laughing.  It didn't lose momentum from one season to the next.  Love it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It's a heartbreaker.  The first time I've seen the human side of Afghanistan and the lives of the women there.  I have read the kit runner and actually read this book before, but needed to read it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|&#60;3 i love these books... Hopefully the movie is just as good :) There a must read for every one...
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|I really enjoyed the pictures, and the new content is funny. But there is too much of the blog in the book, so I felt like I had already read most of it. The blog content is funnier than the new content. Still, a wonderfully amusing book.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A wonderful alchemy of old knowledge and new knowledge and the power of friendship.  A unique and original set of circumstance and character wrapped around classic storytelling.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome awesomeness awesomely awed by the book and I am obsessed with the series of The Hunger Games<br /><br />Udhchchcghrhchdhdud handcuff Uruguay height h fungicide bdhxhdfjfjfjd
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game, and I actually like it better than the FB version.  Graphics are great and a nice app to relax with.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It's convenient,  easy and simple. Instructions is easy to follow and steps are simple. Great app! It is worth try!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I think they should match players based Internet speed. I don't have all day for people to make a play
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed by this third book in a creative and enjoyable series.  I found the plot flat and the characterization confusing.  The continuity from the first two books was lacking-I was really hoping for something more!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game recommend it a lot great graphics different robots doesn't lag and its great overall. Get it its worth it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is really a necessity where I live. The weather is always changing. This is a great one,I use it often.
B003BZXHX8|5.0|Oh how she can sing, and this recording is a very intimate setting with no less than her husband, James Brolin present.  She not only sings but reminisces about her beginnings - a must have DVD if you are a true Streisand fan.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is amazing over all but some bug fixes would be nice to speed up the loading and glitching. You should get this app but don't uninstall just because of that:-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game it's not too difficult but challenging enough to keep you interested a great game for the young horse lover
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a blast. Very addictive and enjoyable. This is a must have for great light hearted fun. A++ get this one
B006ZPJWBM|4.0|His voice is just as good as it was at the start and some of the &#34;duetists&#34; are surprisingly wonderful
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Great song finder. Had this on my phone. Much better on tablet with the ability to get and store the songs you find
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is probably the best puzzle game that I have ever played! You start out with a mysterious safe with mysterious things on it and you end up finding mysterious things in it! I don't want to give anything away, though I got this as the free app of the day one day, but I would have gotten it anyway. The thing is that the logo of the game says the word &quot;Epilogue&quot;.&quot; If you don't know what that means, it means the ending of a story. You'd think that this app is the ending of a series of app s. I assure you that it isn't! It just means that it HAS an epilogue. Anyway, it is also a little spooky because this is one of those things with spooky music playing while you play it. You could just turn the music off, but I didn't do that; the music ads to the mood of the game rely well. Just don't dare play it at night, for it adds to the spookyness. I did that, but I liked it. You have to be a person who likes mysterious things where you don't know what's going to happen next. Our someone who likes scary stuff. You don't even have to be either of these two types of people to enjoy it, though. It is the best game for all agree. Don't worry, though. It's not one of those puzzles that are impossible to complete, but it's not too easy, either. That's one of the things that I really like about this game. I got to finish the whole thing, even the epilogue. I did have one troublesome thing, though on that one, but it turned out I just had to start it over and fix my mistake. They're might even be a possibility that this is the best game that I have on my Kindle other than Minecraft. Overall, The Room is a very mysterious game. The makers of the game said at the end when you win that they were going to melt The Room 2 at the end of 2013, and I really want to buy it. Oh! And also add a P.S., you have to read the notes in the game that you will find. Some people are lazy and will just skip them, but no! They are important. Also, remember to pay attention to every thing. That is my tip to you. I hope that you will get The Room at that you can enjoy this game as much as I have. Goodbye!hat is my tip to you. I hope that you will get The Room at that you can enjoy this game as much as I have. Goodbye!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Had a grand time playing with this app. My family all agreed that this one was cool, and that is rare.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read many of John Grisham's books and this one tops them all -- well, not all of them.  It helps to read &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; which makes this one have more meaning.  He is an excellent writer, easy to follow.  Maybe &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was one of his best.  It's hard to pick only one.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|A 50 year old trekkie nerd. Helpful to be a trekkie to follow the skewed time line plot but a Great follow up movie to first one in the new series. Can't say much more without spoiling it.
B00B2TUF62|5.0|Decided to randomly buy this at a hot topic today and I have to say its one of the better albums I've listened to this month definitely worth the money and if you buy vinyls like me you'll enjoy the unique vinyl color and excellent sound. c: give this one a 5 out of 5 for surprising me in the best way.
B0099RFVXQ|2.0|Too many unbelievable, physically impossible things take place in this movie. This movie was a lazy writer's dream - action hero stuck in a sure-to-die situation? No problem - simply ignore the laws of physics and invent any goofy thing you want to get them out of it. Just plain stupid.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. it is so cute and fun 2 play! the new update is amazing, though slow. does not work well with no wifi: it freezes. other than that is an amazing (times 100,000) app.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Very entertaining, At 50 I enjoyed playing it on my son's tablet, so got it for myself on my kindle fire HD. Good time killer.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|I really like this album  it's classic JT  mixed modern sound, album came out perfectly from suite and tie to tunnel vision this album is great you have to listen to it at least once
B004GYY714|5.0|I' m rating this 5 stars so new users may see this review, but I cannot recommend the current version of TuneIn.  The latest incarnation of the app does not work on the Kindle Fire.  Prior to the latest update, I had been successfully using TuneIn for over a year.  As of November 2013 update the app is VERY unstable.  It does not even start!  Don't waste your time with this app.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love it. Very addicting. Playing it on two different Kindles! Just like a good book&hellip;I cant put it down! Almost as good as Jewel Legends: Atlantis
0316204366|4.0|I agree with Mr. Chabis: The overarching thesis of &#34;David and Goliath&#34; is that for the strong, &#34;the same qualities that appear to give them strength are often the sources of great weakness,&#34; whereas for the weak, &#34;the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty.&#34;
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Third is an awesome game that is always fun and also the most popular love it when you get it is an awesome event
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm not a person who reads a lot but I could not stop reading this book. Amazing in so many ways.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Now works on my Galaxy Note 3! Not just for tablets, anymore.<br /><br />Many hours of time can be wasted, I prefer  to think of it as created, using your imagination to create your own solution to the puzzles. No wrong way to play.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|typical grishm. gripping, credible, immensly readible. I hadnt read any of his books since Painted House (which I loved) and I was not disappointed with this oneha
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Sigh.  I just love the Chromecast so much.  I basically use it every day and it makes not having cable - but still having a television - seem so much more bearable than a sad tv that never gets used sitting in my living room.  I wish that they would develop more integration of the casting so that more video playing services worked as well as their Netflix and YouTube integrations.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, talk about a burn and soreness! Warning - may cause nausea if you over exert yourself. Awesome DVD. Even after a month you will find yourself still developing and shaping. Definitely recommend.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is long enough to really feel like an epic. Great puzzles and storyline! Can't wait for the next one!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|engrossing, shocking, disturbing and very difficult to put down. beautifully written. Liked it so much I sent a copy to my brother in Australia
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love having this app.  It helps with everything from balancing the checkbook to figuring out my weight watchers points.
B0001US62I|5.0|Mickey Rourke (BODY HEAT, SIN CITY) stars as a small-time detective who gets involved in a missing-person case that will take him to places he could never imagine, and might just shatter his soul. We go along w/ him as he uncovers clues to the identity and whereabouts of his quarry. His client, played by Robert DeNiro, is dark, mysterious, and increasingly malevolent. Lisa Bonet is irresistibly sensual in her role as the film's femme fatale. Much has been made about the &#34;infamous&#34; love scene between Rourke and Bonet. Too much, really. While graphic (I suppose), it certainly is integral to Rourke's character's downward journey, and besides, it's fairly short (whether cut or not)! Anyway, if you enjoy the supernatural-noir sub-genre, w/ movies like LORD OF ILLUSION, THE NINTH GATE, etc., then ANGEL HEART should definitely be a treat...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Your books are awesome!!!!!! This is the best book I have ever read!!!!!! I HOPE YOU WILL WRITE MORE OF THEM !!!!!!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book so much I would recommend this book for teens and adults because it seems more like something they would like and their is more sexual things in the book but other than that the book was just so great and your hearing this from an 11 year old who does not like to read and for me to read this every day is amazing can't wait for last book
B00AXIZ5WC|4.0|The Savage Garden was just what I was looking for in a book about carnivorous plants.  It covers a short history of what biology/botany has thought about the plants, the different kinds of plants, and cultivation.  It was useful that it contains a generalized section on tips and methods for cutlivation, and then a lot of specific information for many different species of plants.  A key to the enjoyment of the book is D'Amato's obvious love of the subject and many, many years of experience growing, caring for, and propagating many different varieties of carnivorous plants.  This book is very much aimed at the lay person who is interested in growing these strange and wonderful plants in their own home or garden.
B007K8ILUQ|5.0|Finally they released the master director's third film 'Fear and Desire' on Blu-ray. You can see the early signs of the 'masterpieces to come' of the great genius 'behind the camera' in this rare screen work. Makes a great Christmas gift for any die hard fan of the legendary director, Stanley Kubrick. They, or you won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|loved it I saw the movie premiere on the 21st it was awesome but I read most of it but not all before I read the book again since I was younger when I first read it the movie kinda ruined it but not all the way
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. From the first listen through I fell in love with it, and each consecutive pass has me falling more in love with one of the songs. Katy perry is extremely talented and has continued to evolve as an artist. This is a fantastic album
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Hated this book. The same tired plot over and over, the narrator changes without the slightest difference in voice...  The ending is horrible and unjustified.  This book really shows that all Veronica Roth is is a kid who had an unoriginal idea for a book in college and no real writing ability. This book will kill the film series, too, if they don't drastically fix it. Don't waste your money!
B000002GGU|5.0|The Bryan Adam`s CD reckless has one great song that is always very meaningful and pure bliss to listen which is the song Heaven. It is uplifting and inspirational and lifts your mood when you listen to it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Ouch. Where do you begin with a compilation of ongoing exhilaration:  from sadness to pain to anger to despair to hope...?  How like today's madness!  ...and so, life love, death, and the insanity of war and useless grief continues in a crazed humanity observed by God and His angels wondering when people will figure it out.  As with Life of Pi, a superb read.  I can hardly wait to read another book by this author.  My hope is that the movie can do justice to The Book Thief.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I had a good time reading this book.  Rumor of the movie piqued my interest in the book.  Now I can't wait to read more of Ender's story.  Alas my reading schedule is full for some time.  My only complaint is that the book is too short.  Are Kindle books abridged?  I hope not.
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|Very nice game though on the kindle there is no undo button and the interface often makes it easy to do a move you don't want. Other then that a good mix of puzzle with rpg if a bit repetitive and straightforward
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|I only have one app on my kindle and it is saying I have a lot of stuff on my internal storage. but I deleted all of my music and videos and books and newstand so you need to fix this game loft
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun! But sometimes it seems to miss when I know I didn't. Is frustrating, but I can't stop. Lol!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the best book in the trilogy. A great read always keeping you in suspense. I would read it all over again :0)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|very fun worth trying like temple run cool graphics doesn't get repetative its addicting and challenging I like it a lot
B005OZE9SA|3.0|Another reviewer said \\"build quality was excellent\\" Well, it's not excellent, or even good. Try popping the case open -- build quality is actually pretty lame. Plastic TRS jacks? C'mon Focusite, spend another $5 on decent jacks! I own this item as a second interface, and it sounds and functions alright in a pinch, but the experience is not the same in comparison to quality gear. This is a consumer box that serves a limited purpose in a home studio, or in listening to music or movies through your PC. As soon as you have the extra scratch, it's time to move up the audio interface food chain: check out the Sound Devices USB Pre 2.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Can't wait for more levels.<br />Wish they would make more soon. So fun.<br />Addictive and relaxing all at the same time.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read. One of those books you look forward to getting home from work so you can keep reading!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was used to a 3 button mouse for my PC and really needed a new one...this is by far the best option for the beginner/intermediate gamer. It can be fully customized making it the best gaming mouse I've ever used! 6 out of 5 stars if I could.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Zusak is a gifted writer worth reading.  Learning to love and be loved makes life worth living and zusak shows us how.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its a really fun game, but it does has some glitches. Every now and then the games freezes briefly and it freezes my kindle. It also turns itself off every great now and then or it lags. Other than this though I thoroughly enjoy the game. If they could fix these small glitches this game would be awesome.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|Long and elaborately contrive. Beautifully written if u like a long overdrawn period mystery that fits together in the end masterfully.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|excellent book about life, friendship, love, human fallacy, human strength and being able to move on from those awful things that sometimes make life what it is.<br /><br />I will be reading this author again.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I run my own business and I was in a bit of a sales slump. I have great coaches, training and tools, and others in my position have succeeded where I have failed. I realized the problem must be internal, with me, so I picked up this book.<br /><br />I read it in a week, meditated on the parts that struck a nerve with me, typed up the wealth files, declarations, and millionaire mind actions and implemented the actions immediately.<br /><br />The results so far? In the past three days I have closed over $5000 in sales, am ready to roll out a new product and I'm just getting started. Thank you T.

B00C6B9PX4|5.0|Al Pacino in Scarface. Should I need something else? I love it. One of the most greatest roles that Pacino has made.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This book was engaging initially but the ending was rushed with too many loose ends. Did anyone else read this in the Kindle version and get the gnawing feeling that this could not possibly be the full text of the book. It felt like the detailed notes to an interesting novel, but not complete.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I SAY THE SPECIAL ON PBS 3 TIMES, SO I WANTI  ED TO BE ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD EVERY SO OFTEN. I ALSO ENJOY HIS SONGS. I HAVE JUST ABOUT ALL HIS CD'S.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I did enjoy the novel, though at times I could see the plot lines coming. What made the book the most interesting was the 'what ifs '
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I like this app. It's free easy to use. Lists your equation along the screen.turn the device to panoramic and its scientific.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|Patti Smith has a nice writing style, and it is such an amazing slice of cultural history. I confess I don't know many of the people she mentions, and had no idea she had a relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. But it has been a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, fun game!! Very challenging, definitely makes you want to come back and play again and again until you beat every level. Would definitely recommend to EVERYONE!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it keeps me busy when I need something to focus on other than the everyday chores. and its something I can enjoy kids playing with the kids as well.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It is an awesome game and now there are dinos so it is even funer than it used to be.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Tarsem is a marvelous writer & director. This is a masterpiece. Visually stunning with an excellent cast. Lee Pace & the little girl are captivating together.
B000AMJC2K|2.0|The arm hinge bolts do not stay tight when you pivot or swivel the arm, so the claim that you can &#34;push your display out of the way when not in use&#34; is not true unless you want to keep a hex key handy to tighten the bolts every time you move it.  Also, the raise/lower mechanism is very tight and difficult to operate and the total height when lowered to the lowest setting doesn't match what Ergotron lists on their website for product dimensions, so I cannot use it as I expected to fit under a roll-top desk.
B008JFUS0U|5.0|EPIC - for sure ..<br /><br />We loved this movie even more so than the first - which was excellent in its own right!<br /><br />Loki was amazing and Chris as Thor is just perfect!<br /><br />Loved the way they got more into the other characters in the Asgardian universe and cant wait for PART III - and thei delving into other realms even more !<br /><br />Bring on Hela and Ragnarok !!<br /><br />SPOILER &#62;&#62;&#62;<br /><br />Why the Hel would Loki give awat the infinity gem after all ??? UNless its part of a bigger plot of his - or he truly feared for his life ?<br /><br />hmmnnnn<br /><br />something to ponder till Thor III<br /><br />kal~
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I was put off at first but as I continued reading I couldn't stop.  My heart ached for not only the main character but many of the others.  I looked forward to the narrator.  Sad story and very sad time in our history.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|I am a Will Ferrell fan, so I knew I'd like this the first time I watched it, but didn't  realize I'd love it. Not the typical movie he is in. The storyline is really good, the acting superb, and the cast (some of my favorites) is fantastic. Definitely (in my opinion) worth watching and owning.
0307730700|5.0|I'd never heard of Eric Blehm when I picked this book up. I found him to be an exceptional storyteller and, from what I could tell, a thorough researcher.<br />I had also never heard of Adam Brown, though after reading this I'm stunned by that. This is a man who was thoroughly dedicated to God, Corps, and Country. A family man of fierce loyalty and worthy of admiration. If you don't know Adam's story, do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: From Adam's humble beginings in a caravan family he carried himself to high school athletic fame, only to become a wreckage of a human being. With some very tough love from his family, and a whole lot of dedication on his part, Adam eventually found his way to the love of a good woman and the career of his dreams. A man who adored his children and fought fiercely with his Brothers-In-Arms, Adam became an example of the American Dream and the Story of Redemption at once. I am completely in awe of what this man was able to overcome and accomplish. We should all be so fortunate to put as much life in twice the years as Adam was able to do in his too short stead on Earth.<br /><br />I received a copy of Fearless through Waterbrook-Multnomah's Blogging for Books program in exchange for my honest review of the work.
B009GEH5NG|5.0|PIERCE BROSNAN IS GREAT IN THIS MOVIE.<br />DEFINITELY ONE OF HIS BEST FILMS.<br />VERY EXCITING TO WATCH.<br />THIS WAS ALSO HIS FIRST 007 MOVIE.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Lots of beautiful pictures for the puzzles. Lots of freebies. I would give this app 5 stars if it didn't have so many glitches, but when it's working, I love it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's so much fun!  I tried to avoid playing the game because my friends couldn't stop playing it, but I finally broke down.  I'm glad I did.  This candy doesn't cause cavities!
B009GEPBA0|5.0|VERY EXCITING EACH AND EVERY MOMENT.<br />KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.<br />AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE MOVIE-GOLD FINGER.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game. it is very fun. it is a great down time game. A + + . I even got my 75 yr old mother hooked.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|nice game to wind down with at the end of the day. challenging and fun. difficulty increases as you progress
0399157573|4.0|Cornwell never ceases to amaze me!  Great story.  The beginning finds Dr. Kay Scarpetta in bed, sick, after being at the Newtown disaster.  Some of the reviews I've read were put off by this but I found it to be very personal and an important part of Kay's character.  Scarpetta is, of course, hauled out of bed by Marino to a murder scene.  There are some flash backs at this point that were a nice touch about Kay and Marino's past.<br /><br />The chapters about the first crime screen moved very slowly.  Too much about Kay's concerns about Benton (her husband) and his overbearing boss.  Kay Scarpetta worries too much and if you know the character at all, this is normal.  It's just that I don't want to hear it over and over.<br /><br />The book really get's interesting once the body is taken in for autopsy.  WOW!!  I always wish I had a dictionary by my side but I don't want to stop reading to look something up!!  The state of the art technology Cornwell describes is amazing.<br /><br />The book really picks up at this point and the next few chapters surrounding the second crime scene and discovery of one of the &#34;bad guys&#34; is fast paced and fulfilling.  I really enjoyed the end of the book.  Cornwell takes us to Florida and we have time with Kay's  Mom and Sister.  This personal touch was wonderful.  Too often Cornwell's books have too little of this side of the characters. Some good old fashioned personal time with Benton would be nice!<br /><br />All in all, well worth your time.  I think I may start the series over.  I kind of miss the early books with Marino as well as my favorites, Black Notice and The Last Precinct. Cornwell will always be at the top of my list!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is a great game to everyone its a little addictive but its just like a real fun game should be
B000BRBA8S|5.0|Truly amazing film. This movie deserves 100 stars not only 5.<br />To me Wong Kar Wai stands as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors in the world.<br />He is a master at what he does. I cant think of any other movie director, who is still alive, and<br />is making films that are so powerful and elaborate in romanticism.  2046 is a movie with a genre of its own.<br />Watching this movie is like reading a poetry.  I do not know why, but his movies; especially &#34;In the Mood for Love&#34;, &#34;2046&#34;, and &#34;As Tears Go By&#34;, remind me of Russian novels written during the Romantic Period by the famous: Dostoyevsky, Gogol, Lermontov, or Tolstoy. The way the characters intertwine with each other, their emotions, longings, cries, are shown in such a profound manner that it is just unbelievably beautiful to watch.<br /><br />These days, NO movie director is able to show on screen two people so deeply in love with each other like Wong Kar Wai does.<br />Watch 2046, but before you do that watch first In The Mood for Love, which is a pre-equal to 2046. Watch and be rendered senseless!
B00FLDG5BE|1.0|Video and sound quality horrific! How could this thing pass quality control?! Constant noise on the screen and on several tunes the audio/video is out of sync! I own the previous Crossroads bluray and expected an equal experience with the 2013. Oh no.........Was this an elementary school project?
B003L77G6A|5.0|A fun light hearted show that I think most ages can enjoy - ranging from a tween to those in their 60's. You have your laugh out loud moments, fun dorky witted times, and even weird creepy moments (thanks to Howard). Amy is a wonderful addition to the already loveable cast.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to the story.  Held my interest all the way through.  I would recommend the 3 books to my friends.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|What can I say...like so many other people I'm addicted to this silly game.  This version works well on my Kindle Fire HD 7.  I haven't had any glitches so far.
B000JMKO3C|3.0|Good book to read with an easy natural flow. Definitely gives you much to think about like life, madness and the struggle that one goes through to balance it all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read all three books and saw both movies!  The book kept my interest all the way through.  I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what was going to happen next.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|This book can be summed up in one sentence.  If you want to make new friends you have to meet new people.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|This is a great debut cd by this newly formed band out ashes of creed.  Great cd  pick this up as well it also  features the theme song of WWE superstar edge on it as well

B00EPH8SBM|5.0|It's a great movie.  Saw the show in NYC this fall.  Not usually a fan of musicals, but I had seen this film years ago.  If you get a chance to go to NYC and see it do so...if not watch the video it's a really good movie.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|it was free so I got it-it is an immature love story which I would normally never read-very usual and obvious

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Intriguing and different. The hidden objects are hard to find and present a good challenge. I like that I can earn rewards rather than buy them. I just started and am eager to see what's next.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not Ready For Prime Time.  I installed chrome cast on a laptop I keep in my home office.  The wifi router is in the same room. It worked fine with the TV set in my daughters room which is about 20 feet away.  I then moved the Chromecast to another TV set in a downstairs bedroom.  The distance from the Chromecast device to the router is now maybe 35 feet.  I got marginal. Sometimes it would connect and other times it wouldn't.  I had zero results when trying to run it from the laptop downstairs. It did work somewhat from my iPad and my iPhone.  The other problem I had is that there was a lot of re-buffering required which is not usual when I'm running movies from my laptop.  Like I said above it is not ready for prime time yet.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|Great collection. The book includes some amazing artwork as well as hand written lyrics. Great to see a full version of the Live and Loud performance.
B004K4IZ54|2.0|Movies are in great shape. Case was broken before it was shipped. This drives me nuts, i keep my movies in awesome condition.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Too many characters. Story too complex. Difficult to follow main characters actions, motivations.slow. Would be better to show progress of main characters. Thanks be to God that I do not live during these times.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|It clearly shows the intent to defraud the public by knowingly bundling bad investments on loans that they ( the banks) had no intention of managing.  They kicked the can down the road, paid off the Fed and the bond rating agencies to artificially hold these bundles at superior ratings to their actual worth, thereby allowing pension fund boards to invest in these misrepresented and over valued investments. The collusion in the defrauding of the American public trust should and I hope yet will be deemed criminal!
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|My grandson loved to play with this dragon and the wings that moved.  Great Idea.  We had our Christmas early since he lives in Maryland.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really liked this movie!  It wasn't a traditional romantic comedy.  It was kind of serious at times, but also had some great jokes.

B000SFD21Q|5.0|The book is very detailed, and yet easy to read.  I like the way the book is organized; it give details on the ways exercise benefits subcategories of the entire population.  I also love the Kindle reading system.
B00280LYIC|5.0|There is no bad content and it it's not boring at all! This book is for all ages and genders.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|When I first started playing the game I was in love with it couldn't put my kindle down I would play all night long.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|This app will not let you play an album or playlist.  It will only play one song.  It may play it over and over but allowing an album or playlist would be better.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|Lots of nice options, like ascending volume, wake up to any music, multiple alarms, etc...  I bought the paid version to avoid some adds that I didn't want to see (or want my son to see) on the free one.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I loved the first GT raceing it was fun but this blowers it out of the water GREAT graphics and controlles and fun multiplayer
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This battery is terrific.  Small but powerful, the built in micro USB cable is great.  I use this to recharge my Phone, iPod, WiFi device, everything except my iPad.  It goes everywhere when I travel.  This is a terrific bargain, get one if you have devices that need recharging.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really good game I would recommend this<br /><br />Cons:the minions in the background don't have a lot of work into it<br />Pros:the graphics are awesome<br />It has different levels and bosses<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars!

B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Love this movie.  Out of all the Bond movies this is one of my favorites.  Bond shows the wear and tear on his psyche as he performs his job.
B00GQ1FTR6|3.0|Well, I'm happy to say that, at long last, Episode 6 (Season 4) has brought some of the freshness to the series that it has sorely lacked for the last two seasons. The first two seasons of the Walking Dead (the first, in particular) were brilliant. Somewhere along the line, it seems to have lost its way. Now, with the narrative of the former cult leader Brian starting from zero, adopting a family (or rather, having a family adopt him), inadvertently finding a little girl whom he treats as his daughter, etc. things have gotten interesting again! Bravo!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What is there not to love about a classic Michael Jackson album. The music is as catchy as it was 30 years. This is Jackson's legacy.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is a page turner of a good book. There was nothing of gratuitous shock value; everything belonged on the page. I just finished a so-so book where the author used notable events like suicide, cradle robbing, drugs, and  a handicapped child. However there was no story. I loved this book. Do you think that Molly and Jack stayed together?
B005NFJAT4|5.0|As a Gettysburg battle fan I have watched this great film over and over. The acting is excellent. It doesn't feel like a 20 year old movie.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I won't be long on prose. Truly a beautiful mystery. It didn't feel like fiction one hoot!<br />So many twists and turns. Page turner!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book left me in tears. It was so amazing and this is definitely one of my favorite books of all time
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I disagree with almost all the reviews here.  I have read the book and seen the first movie. yes this is a departure from the book which is really meant as a warning to future generations.  While that still exists here, this movie takes liberty to twist the plot and the focus with the traveler evolving from a man of thinking to a man of action. To someone who tries and cannot change the past to one that accepts this and devotes his effort to changing the future.  The sets are beautiful, Guy Pearce is wonderful as the main character and the supporting cast is great as well along with a beautiful score.  If you can get over the fact that this is not meant to be a faithful interpretation of the book than there is plenty to like in this movie...
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Fans of the show need this to complete their collection. 5 disc set gives you plenty of Walking Dead action in between seasons.
1603420398|4.0|Always looking for a new technique book and this one will fit the bill any time I wish to try something a little different.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An amazing recount of the sacrifices made by Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell and his fellow countrymen. A truly inspiring tale.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|I first became conscious of Joan Jett in 1981 when, on MTV, I began seeing the video for \\"I Love Rock And Roll\\". In the early part of 1982 it became a monster hit rather quickly. As an 8 year old I remember thinking that I didn't know any girls like Joan Jett at school. Tough, edgy, wearing black leather, with a ton of attitude. I didn't know she had been in The Runaways. I didn't know \\"I Love Rock And Roll\\" was a cover song. I didn't even know about her debut album. All I knew was I felt weirdly drawn to Joan Jett on a primitive level. Of course her cover of \\"Crimson And Clover\\" was next, not as big of a hit. I also remember seeing the video for \\"Do You Wanna Touch Me\\", which again, was a revelation to me (Joan all clad in an animal print bikini). And then, well, she just faded into thin air. That was, until 1987 when she re-appeared on MTV with \\"Light Of Day\\" and the following year a mini-renaissance with the back to back hits of \\"I Hate Myself For Loving You\\" and \\"Little Liar\\". And then, back into the void.<br /><br />I normally listen to an artist's entire catalogue before writing a review, but in Joan Jett's case, obtaining her back catalogue is rather difficult, and I'm still cobbling it together. And, she's had quite a bizarre career. Multiple record labels, ups, downs, long gaps between albums, etc.<br /><br />So here is \\"Unvarnished\\", over 30 years after \\"I Love Rock And Roll\\". Amazingly, it's good, as Jett (age 55) still delivers straightforward rock and roll. \\"Unvarnished\\" is tighter, lighter, more concise, and more personal than 2006's semi-compilation album \\"Sinner\\" (four new tracks plus 10 from 2004's Japanese-only release \\"Naked\\"). On \\"Unvarnished\\", Jett addresses fame, media saturation, bad relationships, life, death, weathering hard times and looking for heroes. It's 10 brief songs and one short album, just like the good old days, just like albums should be.<br /><br />Now, there's nothing new here, and Jett doesn't mess with her formula, and that's just fine because she still brings heart and soul to her type of rock and roll, and that's all we fans really want. I don't think we expect Jett to pull a prog rock turn or go all rockabilly on us. No, Jett has always been about pure rock and roll. \\"Any Weather\\", \\"TMI\\", \\"Soulmates To Strangers\\", \\"Hart To Grow Up\\", \\"Reality Mentality\\"--these songs have hit potential if only there were still a place for Jett on MTV and radio, but, no, times have changed and now we have to deal with and accept Avril Lavigne as the closest thing to Jett and that's not saying much. Let's face it, there really isn't anyone like Jett on the music scene right now. I don't see one single female strapping on a guitar and rocking out with edginess and attitude. Instead we have Katy Perry singing \\"Roar\\" or Lady Gaga singing \\"Applause\\" which is more like Madonna than Jett.<br /><br />I normally compare an artist's latest work with their past work, but in the case of Joan Jett I'm going to have holes in this section that will later be rectified as I obtain her mid-career work and the hard to find \\"Good Music\\", \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Pure And Simple\\" albums. Also, I don't really feel like paying 30+ bucks for \\"Naked\\" just for the six songs that don't appear on \\"Sinner\\". So here is a rough comparison with ratings to be filled in later:<br /><br />1980 Joan Jett (Bad Reputation): Four Stars<br />1981 I Love Rock And Roll: Five Stars<br />1983 Album: Four Stars<br />1984 Glorious Results Of A Misspent Youth: Four Stars<br />1986 Good Music: [Unheard]<br />1988 Up Your Alley: [Unheard]<br />1990 The Hit List: [Unheard]<br />1991 Notorious: [Unheard]<br />1994 Pure And Simple: [Unheard]<br />2004 Naked: [Unheard]<br />2006 Sinner: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 Unvarnished: Four Starsjust fine because she still brings heart and soul to her type of rock and roll, and that's all we fans really want.

B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Very fun read. I love how witty Dawkins is and how straight-forward he is. He doesn't beat around the bush and isn't afraid to say what he is thinking. Raw and honest critic of religion.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|Justin Timberlake remains a guilty pleasure. Why a guilty pleasure you ask? Well, for one he started off in a boy band making manufactured pop music. Then he graduated to aping Michael Jackson and Prince with a different type of manufactured pop/r&b/hip-hop/dance music. Then he found Timberland and began making yet another type of manufactured hip-hop/dance/r&b/pop hybrid music which was pretty clever a la &#34;Sexyback&#34;.<br /><br />Still, you can't hide the fact that Timberlake has a thin, reedy vocal that lacks heft and depth. Couple that with his adolescent, cheesy poser pick up line lyrics, and well, he just remains a guilty pleasure. This year Mr. Timberlake bombards us with not one volume of music, but two. Now, it should be no surprise to anyone when I say that a double album is a double-edged sword. You better bring your A-game or it's going to come off as a bloated vanity project gone awry. Well, Timberlake and Timberland didn't exactly bring their A-game this year. I can poke a hole in the party by pointing out that both albums fall prey to something I absolutely hate--excessiveness. And I mean 80 minutes per disc if you bought both the deluxe versions. 70 minutes per disc if you didn't. And to top that off, most of the songs exceed 6-7 minutes. I'm sorry, but Timberlake and Timberland are no Genesis, Yes, Rush, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer (all prog rock bands who knew how to make 6+ minute songs great).<br /><br />Now, you can argue that this is avant garde r&b/hip-hop--something cutting edge, something experimental. But, at the same time, you can just as well argue that this is a bloated, excessive, over-indulgent flop. If they edited the songs down to one album it might have been great, and arguably experimental at the same time. Instead, what you have is two volumes of mediocrity with some interesting ideas peppered throughout.<br /><br />I don't understand these four and five star ratings. I mean I've listened to a ton of music over the years, so I am coming from the angle of already experiencing long-form songs, experimental songs, teen pop, Michael Jackson, Prince, etc., etc. Maybe I'm jaded, but these two volumes are just not that great.<br /><br />You want to debate which volume is better? I say they're both about the same give or take some songs, give or take some extended noodling bits. I suppose someone might argue that both of these albums are amazing, but I'd say, well yes, if you want to lower the bar to the fact that Timberlake started off in a boy band, and so these two volumes of music are going to look like crown jewels next to that.<br /><br />My opinion is that Timberlake needs to ditch Timberland and start over. He's gone as far as he can go with this sound. If he wants to grow up and last he's going to have to make drastic changes. I think that sticking with Timberland on production for these two volumes was playing it safe. Yes, that's right, you heard me, playing it safe. These two already did all of this on 2006's &#34;FutureSex/LoveSounds&#34;. This is just more of that. It's uneven, at times wince-inducing. The lyrics are blas&eacute; and really, the songs are beginning to sound a lot like the parodies he does for Saturday Night Live. Get out of here while you still can. Save yourself.<br /><br />And finally, Timberlake is no Michael Jackson. MJ had real talent and originality and truly transcended his boy band beginnings, plus he had Quincy Jones as a secret weapon. Timberland is not even close to Jones. Timberland recycles the same tired beats and production values.<br /><br />So, why three stars you might ask? Well, it's okay. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not four or five stars, people. There are some interesting tracks here like &#34;True Blood&#34;, but it goes on far too long at 9 and a half minutes. Then there's the MJ rip-off, &#34;Take Back The Night&#34; which, to its credit, is catchy. &#34;Murder&#34; is interesting and perhaps &#34;Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)&#34;. However, &#34;Cabaret&#34;, &#34;TKO&#34;, &#34;Drink You Away&#34;, &#34;You Got It On&#34; (Prince rip-off), &#34;Amnesia&#34; and &#34;Only When I Walk Away&#34; are all average, middling, at times weak, filler tracks.<br /><br />&#34;Not A Bad Thing&#34; is the best track here. Reminiscent of his boy bands days, it completely plays to Timberlake's strengths, but too bad it's attached to a hidden track that's just average. Forget about programming the best track then. Also forget about downloading the best track because you'll have to accept the inferior hidden track against your will.<br /><br />So, I say nice try Timberlake, but at 32, married, you come off quite immature and in need of a serious make-over musically. I hear you want to do country music--please spare us. Your strength is pop music, where you began. Your strength is ballads or heartfelt mid-tempo ballads with some occasional forays into dance music. Why don't you get a different producer, sit down and really concentrate on your song writing and song craft, and try seriously stretching the confines of what you do best instead of aping other artists you adore? I can't believe at 32 you need a kick in the pants already. Oh well, who am I to criticize, your music keeps selling millions and hitting number one, so who cares, right?<br /><br />Here's how &#34;The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2&#34; compares with Timberlake's other works:<br /><br />2002 Justified: Three Stars<br />2006 FutureSex/LoveSounds: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 The 20/20 Experience 1 of 2: Three Stars<br />2013 The 20/20 Experience 2 of 2: Three Starsant)&#34;.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|A fascinating evening of music as shown on PBS. We bought this CD because we greatly enjoyed the program on PBS. Mr. Bonamassa is versitile and accomplished. After watching the special and listening to this CD, we went on to purchase several other CDs by Mr. Bonamassa. His music includes something for every taste--from exotic instruments to the most elementary melodies played with extraordinary flourish.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Plenty of reviews so I'll be brief and cover perhaps some different angles. The heroes of this book are the children. The only praiseworthy adult dies in the first few pages the rest of the story allows us to appreciate him. While the book shows the many adults' dark sides, we suspect (hope) they have some redeeming features. Ms Rowling merely gives us the pleasure of living with their ids, as Freud would call their dark streams of consciousness.<br /><br />Finally the book has a Harry Potterness about it in that the children are magical and overcome the grownups though not always the other children.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Loved both discs and did not have all the video noise on my blu-ray BUT i could not get it to play with the DTS sound.It wouldn't play when you pressed surround it just froze on both discs.I just pressed play finally just to watch it before i send it back.Loved the show and can't wait to hear it like it should be.Hope no one else has this problem
B00ESW4TJ4|5.0|Unless you are crazy about immersive panoramas and willing to grant the Theta the kind of unconditional love normally reserved for puppies, spend your money on something more reliable. I'm thinking pork belly futures.<br /><br />Everything negative that you have read about this camera is probably true. Please understand that I love this camera to pieces. But I'm not a complete idiot. Here is my take on the worst problems.<br /><br />Internet Connectivity and Image Accessibility<br /><br /><update 1/30/2024><br /><br />Wow!<br /><br />The Android and iOS apps can now share images to their device's<br />Gallery. The images can be uploaded To Google+ And shared or not according to your preferences or Google maps if you've allowed GPS location info to be transferred from the phone and are comfortable with public view.<br /><br />On Google+, viewers can look at the necessarily distorted static images or switch into the full 360 immersive mode.<br /><br />I think that this represents real progress in just a couple of months.<br /><br /></update><br /><br />What I consider to be its worst problem is correctable in software: Ricoh Pentax have not released code in any form (source, binary, app, servlet, library) that allows for the independent display of the .jpg images produced by the Theta. Currently, the only approved way to get an image on the internet is to use either Ricoh's free iOS app or Microsoft's Photosynth app to push the image to Ricoh's servers at theta360.com. Having done that, one can link to the page on which the image resides (not the image itself). Let's say that you have a blog and want to show someone a 360 degree view that you've taken. In your blog text, you'd insert a link to image page on theta360.com. Having clicked that link, your reader is then directed to the Ricoh server and can readily navigate via touch or mouse around your image. Unfortunately, the reader is also subjected to any decorations or ads that Ricoh chooses to weigh down the imagewith. For some people, this will be a dealbreaker. You are completely at Ricoh's mercy. What happens if -- perish the thought -- this $400 misunderstanding isn't the huge hit that Ricoh hopes it will be? How about they shut down the server and you're toast? Won't happen? Right.<br /><br />Let's take the case that you're trying to write a review of the Theta and have uploaded a conventional .jpg that is a highly cropped  extract of a 360 image that shows how unobtrusive the camera mount is. Amazon encourages the reviewer to add notes to the image. Suppose in  your note you want to add a link to the whole glorious picture to show how tiny and unobtrusive the camera stand is. Well, you cannot, because Amazon don't allow links to images in this context. Nor should they. They don't want to depend on a third party (in this case theta360) who could offer unreliable service, or change the content of the link to an ad or pornography or whatever. The obvious solution is to upload the whole image to Amazon.  Oops, you can't do that because Ricoh only supports links to the page on which the image resides. And Amazon only allows images.<br /><br />One solution is for a Ricoh to register a specific extension for the Theta's images, say .sir which would stand for spherical image Ricoh. Then they could offer operating system level drivers or browser extensions or server side support for that extension which would handle the image rendering. This must sound very tedious. I wouldn't be talking about it if a Ricoh had properly dealt with it.<br /><br />Image Quality<br />I got hooked on digital panoramas in the late 1990s. I think that the camera I was using then produced two meg images. The stitching software I could find allowed for stitching together an arbitrary number of images to create a long strip of up to 360 degrees. There was no concept of stitching together two bands along their long axes. So the product of a fair amount of effort was a skinny vertical or horizontal photo.Even skinnier if you cropped the scalloped edges. In contrast, the theta quickly delivers a complete 360 degree image. Whatever stitching that is done is hidden from the user. In my experience, banding that occurs where the two hemispheres is subtly or non-existent. Finger scrolling through the image on my iPod is exciting. Maybe I'm easily amused, but I just love it.<br /><br />What isn't exciting is the image quality, which is terrible, probably worse than I was getting with the cameras available to me in the nineties. Particularly in the interior shots, the digital grain is like marbles. I'm pretty sure that the software that makes the exposure decides to boost the ISO film speed equivalent rather than extending the exposure. This is crazy. There out to be a setting that asks if the camera is on some sort of support. If it is, i can see no reason why the software that drives the camera cannot increase the exposure time. If the sensor is like that on any other digital camera I've seen, keeping the ISO low should yield profound improvement in resolution.<br /><br />Another IQ issue that is a little trickier is exposure latitude. Almost be definition, any 360 image is going to have a wide range of illumination, often beyond the capability of any sensor to capture in a single exposure. If the software was told the camera was on a support, it could make several bracketed exposures and not have to clip highlight and shadows.<br /><br />If subsequent releases of the firmware and/or software manage to improve the image quality, the Theta could be a dream come true for anyone interested in panoramas. It is so simple to use that real estate agents could generate their own virtual tours.<br /><br />Usability<br /><br />Few experiences in life are more pleasant than running crisp software that is smarter than you are. Conversely, hardly anything is more galling than what I will call arrogant but ignorant software.  Theta app, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.<br /><br />Running the camera remotely from an iOS (and on 29 November, Android, if Ricoh's announcement holds true) app is brilliant if you happen to have an iPod or iPhone. What isn't great is communicating across a public wifi network hosted by the Theta. Initially, this makes sense. Achieving a connection to a known SSID is something that we all know how to do. The password is engraved on the bottom of the camera, invisible to all snoopers except those with a tripod socket fetish. what is inconvenient is what happens when you start using it. For me, the normal workflow is to take a shot or two and then upload them to the internet. This means that you are constantly toggling back and forth between your normal WiFi connection and the Theta connection. The acronym for this condition is PITA. Far better for them to have used an ad hoc connection which can coexist with a standard connection and avoid swapping altogether. I'm not sure, but I think miracast is an example of what I'm talking about.  Also, AppleTV and ChromeCast.<br /><br />Every time you want to upload an image, you have to log onto FaceBook. This is automated, but what if you don't want to be a member?  Tough.<br /><br />Since I first wrote this review, the Android version of the Theta app has come out. It is pretty much a duplicate of the iOS version.  Disappointingly, it omits even the primitive exposure adjustment available in the iOS app.  However, it is much better at assisting the user in swapping between WiFi connections to the Theta and the Internet without leaving the app. It also lets you rapidly shoot pix without transferring them to the Android device or even viewing them. Depending upon your workflow, this is probably an improvement.<br /><br />Prominence of Hands, Tripods, and Other Camera Supports<br /><br />For me, this is a non-issue. Basically every frame the Theta exposes is its own selfie. Otherwise, they'd call it something like Theta 359.  If you're holding the camera, at least one hand, foot, mouth, or other body part is going to show up in the image. I prefer to use an unobtrusive support. Along with the camera, I ordered two small tripods, a mini CCTV stand, and a D-ring which screws into the tripod socket and can be used with monofilament. So far, my big favorite is the CCTV stand ( [[ASIN:B00009WBYX Panavise 845-246W Deluxe Micro Mount (Cream)]] ). In my opinion, its color and shape blend in nicely with the stub of the camera that inevitably shows up in the image. While it comes with a nice ball head, most tables and suchlike are level enough that I don't need it. There should be a shot of the setup in the product images.<br /><br />Case<br /><br />The Theta's body otherwise sleek body is of necessity dominated by two exophtalmic half orbs -- the lenses that together give it the capability to make panoramas.  Ricoh provides a cute but insubstantial case which probably keeps the dust off but offers virtually no drop or shock protection. I think that Ricoh should spring for the couple of bucks a custom Pelican case would cost them. In the meantime, don't be stuffing your Theta in no overhead bins.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Ricoh Pentax joins two companies with a long history of innovation. I am desperately hoping that the shortcomings I've discussed are mostly 1.0 software problems that can be addressed in upcoming releases. The pressures to bring out a product in time for the holidays must be enormous.<br /><br />In the meantime, this pioneering nanoniche camera is a source of endless fascination for me and others afflicted with immersive panorama syndrome. People who are just looking for the occasional panorama would be better and less expensively served by virtually any smartphone.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt isn't a prolific author, she only puts out about 1 book every 10 years but it is worth the wait. Her characters are detailed and many-layered. There are usually plenty of unexpected twists to the story. This is no exception. You really feel for Theo and the challenges he's faced with.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|read it in one day; i only put it down a few times but i just had to finish it
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The character development in this book is amazing.  You really get a feel for who the characters are and it's amazing how GRRM can create a story where oftentimes there is no clear cut good guy or bad guy.  He makes characters you love turn to characters you hate and turns characters you hate into characters you love when they enter or complete their redemption arcs.  Amazingly entertaining read from beginning to end and no shortage of eventful reading.  I was blown away by how captured I was by the story and was amazed at how many moments I made exclamations out loud.  Couldn't have impressed me any more than it did.  A great read for any fantasy lover...or book lover for that matter.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|As a facebook page admin I have to say it could be better; I think it could be a part of facebook and not a different app. Although, it is a really good app to use for managing your facebook page or pages.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a lot of action and likes a hero that does what others only think about.  I have enjoyed all the Jack Reacher novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that you don't need internet or facebook to play this game, However It is also great that you can connect it with facebook. I also love that it syncs with my facebook account so that if I beat a level on facebook or this app it syncs to the account after i re-connect it to facebook. It's also a great time killer, I am still on level 49 and I am not sure how many level there are in the world i am in and the entire game.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have read and will read anything Lee Child writes. I have loved all the Jack Reacher novels. I still think that us fans are ready for him to settle down and have some commitment. He won't be young forever.
B006RXPYQ4|3.0|This movie is good to watch once, but I doubt I would want to see it again. The main thing I did not like about it was the monsters. I did not think they were scary, and actually they were somewhat corny. Yet it was far from the worst movie I've seen.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was Stephen King at his best. Great characters, and an interesting and suspenseful story line. He always maintains the ability to catch your attention with in the first few pages, and then you can't put it down.
0307596885|5.0|Read the stories and then listened to the audio. Have read all of Munro's stories, re-read most of them and listened to many of them. Munro has been a favorite for decades and get copies of her books for other folks. It doesn't get any better than this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The tie in to John Grissons first book and I believe his best was great especially because I know the area
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Fun. You can challenge yourself with this Chess game.Not just your easy board game. The program seems to be programed to win. So if you want easy this may not be for you.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This was fun to watch and the action was great,not so much for acting ,but this was still good to watch .
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Magnificently written, insightful, useful. Duhigg provides a journalist's eye for valuable details and a scientist's passion for research to provide not just an explanation of how habits shape us, but a means for anyone to transform their lives by rewriting their old habits and forging new ones.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is just what I needed. I've spent my life savings on this game. now I have -400 in the bank. thanks candy crush!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The is one of the most delightful tales I have ever seen.  There are just so many human stories that change during the telling.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B004DSX5B6|2.0|I was looking forward to adding this multi-tool to my collection which includes a 1st generation Leatherman Wave. I wanted this tool to be my backup, however when I was disappointed when it arrived. The quality and workmanship is only about one step up from cheaper $20 multi-tools from Wal Mart. The tools are very tight and hard to fold out. Also the lock releases have a gritty feel to them as if there were sand or something trapped inside. Bear's included &#34;survival guide&#34; is a OK addition, but could be more detailed and informative.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* All the tools can be locked into place. To fold any of the tools back you need to engage the release.<br />* Nice rubber grips on the sides provide a sure grip and feel good to hold.<br />* Pliers are spring-loaded.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* The Philips head screwdriver is oddly shaped and is difficult to use.<br />* The main blades are only about 2 inches long, Too short for hard survival use.<br />* The multi-tool itself is rather bulky and takes some effort getting back into the included nylon case.<br />* Not as well constructed as a Leatherman product
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun! Love being able to update to special versions. This is personally a great game for kids that like temple run cause it pretty much the same thing except it's easier and way more fun1
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|First, I never received the code for Netflix that I am sure was stated I would receive when ordering.(yes, I see the offer seemed to have expired three days before I ordered, but I am sure it was still listed on the device page.)  Second, with the cord required to power the device, the design is stupid.  Why not make a presentable looking box that can be hidden or displayed on a shelf.  Third, it has issues.  It took three tries to get a Netflix TV show to play on it last week.  It would start and then stop saying it couldn't play on this TV after I had just watched a different show.<br /><br />Waste of money without the Netflix offer.
B009SZALHA|5.0|I&#34;ve always like Ms. Lauper  but this album is superb from start to finish! More blues Cyndi! Well worth the 10 bucks.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Took too long to start city. Had to buy credits to get anywhere. Credits didn't show up for two days.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just love it! Even with the sad ending this season was good! I can't wait for coming season 4.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I enjoy the game, however sometimes it will restart by its self. It takes to long loading. But other than that it's fine.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I am very disappointed with the &quot;New&quot;look for the Weather Channel. The pop up stuff is extremely annoying. The sight is very limited for anything except the current temperature and sometimes the forecast. The radar rarely works. But for free.
B00243FQFA|5.0|This completes my Stargate Atlantis collection. I have already watched the whole season and I will be sure to watch it again in the future. Loved it.
B0065RIJ3W|1.0|Taken a couple of aquaponics classes to find this book rife with misinformation. Blueberries grow great in aquaponics systems. Just a cookie cutter &#34;for dummies&#34; book. Not super helpful
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|My daughter received this for her birthday and she is very happy with the cd. It is nice to find just what we want on-line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I began this book thinking it was only going to focus on S&M and sex, but it does follow the characters lives and has an actual plot. I think this book has been misrepresented in rumor and the common consumers view. That being said, it is extremely descriptive and I would only recommend it for mature readers (say 14 or 15+). I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a truly captivating story. I could not put it down, and finished the whole thing within two days.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Loved the book but not crazy about the way it ended.  But I guess it had to end some where
B001QL5MAA|4.0|A very awesome read. It started out slow but part of that was do to the creativity in constructing the context for the book. Persevering was well worth it as the story picks up pace as you gain familiarity with the characters and reality in which they live.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love being able to control Netflix and You Tube on my high def televisions using my phone or tablet.  Easier than doing it through game consoles.  VERY easy to set up and use.  Great picure quality.  I have bought 2 of them and will soon be buying 2 more.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|As usual well written and kept me up way to late at night. My only complaint is I don't have another Preston Child book to read now.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|How can one review one of the great classics of all time? Loved it. Enjoyed it just as much after having read it as a boy.
0316255580|5.0|Nice book to pick up when there is not enough time to read an entire picture book.  The photos are great and help to start conversations with the listener.  Can be appropriate up to ages 8 or even 10 .
B005LAIGWS|5.0|Action movie - what more do I have to say? I like Nicolas Cage and I like action movies and this movie is a great combination of the two. The movie also has good values regarding good versus evil.
0061906220|5.0|I had no idea of the fans of Pete the Cat until we read this.  We looked up the publishers web site and saw or listened to the other books in the series.  We've probably read it 50 times and because of its repetive text, my grandson loves to read it to anyone who will listen.  It's a great series and will be ordering others.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider Solitaire is a great mental game similar to Mahjong. If you like to keep your mind fit play this game and Mahjong along with Luminosity and a lot of reading. These type of games along with regular Solitaire will spice up your mental life and keep your mental state alert.  Happy playing.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|You'd be hard pressed to find a more enthusiastic fan of Eric Clapton and the musicians that join him at the crossroads guitar festival than myself. I own all the previous crossroads festivals on blu ray and DVD as well as all of the other Eric Clapton concert videos that have been made commercially available. I was also at one of Eric's shows from his tour earlier this year, so I have a good idea of how things should sound.<br /><br />My home theater consists of a 2012 model 55&#34; Panasonic plasma TV, a PS3, Denon receiver, and Rotel amplification for a pair of bowers and wilkins 685 speakers.  My TV is professionally calibrated, and my speakers are tuned to my listening room using audyssey calibration. My remarks on the audio and video quality of this blu ray are as follows-<br /><br />Video- Very sharp and clean image. Contrast is fantastic, and the clarity of the image can't be faulted. This concert was shown in movie theaters, and the image quality would be right at home at an IMAX theater. This is a presentation only possible due to the high resolution available on the blu ray format. No doubt compression artifacts and noise will be seen in the DVD version due to the limitations of the format. There is an incredible lack of grain and noise despite the dark conditions around the performers and stage. The editing and camera angles are difficult to fault, with plenty of close ups of the feet work of the individual guitar players. You get a wonderful impression and understanding of how the musicians are communicating on stage. Video quality is 10/10.<br /><br />Audio- What a challenge for the producers to mix the sound! Often a half dozen guitar players are performing simultaneously, along with many other instruments and yet the mix was not crowded or busy. When I was at one of the shows on Clapton's tour this past year I was stunned at the unreal clarity of his vocals in a live setting. Honestly the best I've ever heard a lead vocal sound at an indoor concert.That same impression comes through on the blu ray. Turn up the volume and hear the crystal clear sound of Eric's voice on tears in heaven to hear an example. The uncompressed DTS-MA audios a revelation of beauty. Bass notes are full and clear, vocals soar with punch and dynamics, and every instrument is mixed to perfection. I'd imagine with a proper amplification system this concert could be re-played and with your eyes closed you would believe you were actually at the concert and not at home. I own perhaps 100 concert blu rays and DVDs and have heard plenty of poorly mixed junk. This concert tops mayer's where the light is, Clapton's previous crossroads 2010 festival, the clapton and winwood concert, and Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds at radio city in terms of audio quality. It's spectacular, and sets a new standard for concert blu rays.<br /><br />What about the concert itself? In my opinion, this is the best overall package of performances from any crossroads festival. The musicians are all extremely comfortable and their playing is especially inspired. I was introduced to some new songs and artists and reminded of why I have such a deep love for blues and rock music. These players all have music deep down in their soul and their playing and singing comes from deep within themselves. It's a refreshing reminder of where great music comes from and the uniquely human expression that flows from live musicians unaided by technology. It's all about the music, and you can sense from every performer that they are kindred spirits with one another. Highlights include Robert Cray. The Allman Brothers, John Mayer, Gary Clark Jr... Actually the whole concert is one enormous highlight reel... nothing should be skipped... it should all be savored.<br /><br />Best $20 I've spent all year. I'll be watching and listening to this for the rest of my lifetime
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I thought this movie was okay and I own it but after seeing the movie, well lets just say I really don't need to keep it in my collection.
6305428050|5.0|This is a classic. Loved it since I first saw it &#34;a few years back.&#34; I particularly liked the blues scene.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Mahjong Deluxe 2 is a game that requires thought and a nimble mind. If you like playing solitaire type games that test you metal skills then this is your game. I am enjoying this game very much. When I was very young, my mother had a real Chinese Mahjong set and I used to play it then. Electronically is really great too. Similar to the game of Domino in a way at least to my way of thinking.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Haven't seen it yet because I am looking for a video on demand option. Does anyone know if and when this will happen? And where, if not here. I prefer to purchase through amazon as I have always been happy with their service. Above the board suggestions only please.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app does what it is supposed to do with out any fancy stuff. Very intuitive. You Don`t need to be a computer geek to use it. Keep your Kindle Fire running smoothly by using this app. Would recommend this to my friends and family.

B00GH4R95C|5.0|Though I may get slammed by purist and without having anything but the deepest love and respect of Christopher Reeves. I absolutely loved it!!! It was nice to see Clark Kent done in this manner. It was updated very well and loses nothing of the emotions which made the original Superman made me feel.<br /><br />It would be remiss of me not to say this as always Superman is Hot :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I didn't care for this book at t he start, like a few of the other AN books I've read I found the beginning to be a little slow. It spreads up nicely toward the middle, and I didn't want to put it down. It's great to see how Danny turned out. Abra is a great character, and one tough girl.<br />Overall... I liked it better than The Shining!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really a fun concept for Ice Age. Whether you watched the movies or not its a good game building your own ice age zoo
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved this book.  I am a woman in my 40's but I could totally relate to this college aged characters.  I am a huge fan of Rainbow Rowell.  I totally appreciate her character development and her stories always bring me back to my teen/early 20 days of angst but, in a good way.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|has limited lives, relays on having to have friends. Got boring before I even got to level 30. I have found other types of games like this one which require nothing but for you to play

0316055433|4.0|Theo Decker presented himself as a whiny kid without a clue, and he stayed that way for hundreds of pages, through which we hear his excuses, his weaknesses, and his poor attempts to rise above his situation. It isn't until the very end of these wonderfully written pages does Theo finally emerge a wise and remarkable character. The wait was worth it, the writing beautiful and compelling, and I'm so happy to have been a part of Tartt's story for the weeks it took to finish this lengthly book.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I really enjoy using this product. I play FPS and MMO's I didn't have to do anything except install the software. As soon as I started WoW it auto-binded everyhing. Also play BF3 on it. Great product

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The Doctor keeps getting more lively as the years go by. 50 years ago, the Doctor was an elderly grandfather encountering the Aztecs. But as of 2005 he is looking middle-aged in this incarnation and has a fun friend, Rose Tyler. Rose has a boyfriend Mickey, but the Doctor keeps calling him Rickey. Most fun is Rose's poor mother, with a daughter who keeps gallivanting off in space and time. This season is lively stuff for the Brits, compared with their Aztec days. (Although the BBC Radiophonic Workshop did a better job with the theme music back then.) The &#34;Father's Day&#34; episode from this season has interesting &#34;space-time&#34; considerations. The Doctor this season is Christopher Eccleston. He is the &#34;2005 Doctor&#34; and voted third most popular of the ten. The show does not take itself too seriously and injects humor throughout (especially with Rose's mother). Keep 'em coming, Doctor. You rock!
1593272200|4.0|(review softened after discussing some points with the Mr. Kerrisk)<br /><br />It is true that the book is well-written, the examples work, and the Linux API is explained in detail. This is a unique documentation source.<br /><br />BUT... Do you think that you will enjoy reading (and carrying) the 1.5K pages book? I guess that 99% of the time this is not the book for you. This is a good book to be used as a reference but in my humble opinion it is not a book that will please the reader who wants to go from cover to cover.<br /><br />This book is more detailed than the man pages, but it is as pleasant to read as the man pages themselves. If you enjoy to read the man pages this is a book for you.<br /><br />For the average POSIX/Linux/Unix programmer the Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment from Stevens is a much better choice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fascinating writing. Good story line and great character development. Do I dare say stimulating? Fell in love with Grey just by his description and it continued throughout the whole series!
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|The Rekindled Affair is a short yet thrilling tale of lovers who reunite after 45 years apart. I admire how the author has created an enviable attachment to the couple's past and present lives, and the mature relationship that co-exists in the story. This is just the right kind of book when you need a break from all the hustle-bustle of life and enjoy a moment of love and endearment.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|These men make beautiful music and enjoyed listening to them. They captured my heart. Great harmony. Carlos' baritone is heart throbbing!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|David Baldacci brings back the team of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, former secret service agents that lost their government positions, and became private investigators. Taken as a whole the book is typical Baldacci, taut, action oriented and guaranteed to keep the reader glued to the pages.  The only slight deviation is the manner that Sean and Michelle are introduced to a conspiracy that reaches to the very highest level of U.S. government.  A young boy contacts them indicating that he was advised that his father was killed in Afghanistan, but then receives an e-mail from him the next day.  A bit far fetched that a high level team of private investigators would jump into such a case for no real remuneration and no real facts.  But accepting this we are treated to one of Baldacci's better books and a plot that is totally engrossing.<br />  A scheme to discredit the president and assassinate him provides the basis of the conspiracy and is unfolded in well done writing.  A bit more romance unfolds between Sean and Michelle with the use of Sean's ex wife as a source of information and the entrance of some jealousy on the part of Michelle.<br />  It is a given that the prolific Baldacci will utilize the two private detectives in a future novel, and it is sure to attract his readers.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Loved the 007 movie. It was well written and good plot. Characters were interesting. Plot was suspenseful and fun to follow.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I love this movie. The soundtrack is awesome. I got the movie in just a couple of days. That was great.
0782008372|4.0|Highlander: Director's Cut 10th Anniversary Edition is a great movie with a cool and innovative fantasy storyline. This is the original that spawned countless sequels. The ideas of that there can only be one is awesome. I enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am extremely sad to see this book come to an end but still it was a very fun ride. I hope someday that someone else is able to create such a magnificent book once again. Let the dragon once again ride on the winds of time.
1594202273|5.0|I got this book out of my local library and finished it in a couple of days.<br />The day I returned the book I went  online to Amazon and ordered a copy which I began reading again as soon as it arrived.<br />This is the only hard cover book I've bought in the last 20 years.<br />The fact that we're still here in the USA in spite of the handling of our own nuclear weapons is simply amazing.<br />I believe that our nuclear weapons prevented a heating up of the cold war, but this amazing tale of the many, many near disasters within our own borders is truly frightening.<br />If you are ever in the Tucson area, make sure you visit the Titan Missile site which is now open as a museum.  You actually get to explore the whole installation including the control room and you get to view the silo, and a decommissioned Titan missile (all 103 feet of it) from the top and bottom of the silo.  This book becomes very real if you've been in the inside of the Titan installation.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I love this app it's amazing and is almost like a real piano .. If you are looking for a free piano and other instruments (on this app) I definitely recommend this app
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the game it gives me great joy when I out score my friends I wish the time did not run out every time you play and have to wait to get enough time to enjoy a good session is there a way that can be done

B009LQKHIO|5.0|A wonderfully written story of loss, heart ache and love. An easy read for a cold snowy weekend. I will definitely be ready the next book in this series!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Watching Jessica Lange at work is enough by itself to keep me watching this show - with Kathy Bates added to the cast, it can't be missed.  Show is full of great characters, drama and is well-acted by all.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Plot was intriguing as  hints were given and later materialized as facts in further plot development. Movie challenged viewer to assemble and determine hints relevance in later stages of plot development.
0875428940|5.0|I love these cards! The artwork is wonderful andit includes a great booklet with influential interpretations for the different cards. It also arrived much much earlier than I expected. At least a few weeks before the predicted time. Arrived in amazing condition as well. So much fun!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I loved playing this game on Facebook, but I love it even more on my Kindle! It runs differently than the Facebook version I played(the original version), you don't have to worry about crops dying on you, so you don't have to be on to it 27/7...
B00DD49R0E|4.0|While the sequel isn't quite as much fun as the original, it is much better than many animated (and live action) sequels. Fans will appreciate two new characters: Lucy the spy groupie and El Macho. The picture and audio quality are superb in this release.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was enjoyable! Not sure whether kids would find it too challenging. I think it is great for spacial reasoning and executive planning. Sort of a crossword puzzle without words! i plan to tell my pre-teen about it. Thanks for a game that adults can play!
B000003RCY|4.0|Great debut album from the Germans.  Strong industrial metal with heavy riffs and techno.  I loved it and the next follow-ups are even better.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Great
0307346617|5.0|Max Brooks tells a great biography of the ever fought zombie wars.  Not a one story driven book, it takes accounts through history and interviews of what it's like for different countries, governments and people do to fight the pandemics.  I loved this type of storytelling as it made the material seem real.  Any of these interviews/accounts could be applied to any type of pandemic apocalyptic action in the world, it just happens to be zombies.  Don't waste your time with the movie.  This is the real deal with proper story and old fashioned slow moving walkers, biters, and a few surpise sprinters.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|This novel was just too long and tedious to keep my interest.  I found the first half of the book to be much more intriguing than the second half.  In the end, I was so exhausted reading about this tortured soul and his bad choices that I really had to push myself to finish the book.  I'm assuming Theo's self-destructive tendencies were meant to mirror the dysfunction he learned from his father.  This reader was left to believe by the final pages of the book that the bleak Theo was not able to find his way off of his ruinous path.  And I really didn't care.
0345529057|5.0|I honestly have yet to read these. But I ordered them and I do not regret this. Not only is it a good deal but they came clean and unharmed. (yes I bought physical copies because yes, It IS worth it). They also came before the delivery date and everybody loves that! It was like opening up a present. GET THEM IN PHYSICAL COPIES.
B00E9PMMX0|5.0|I have been searching to show my son what we grew up with.  This is the average price for non-collector editions.  I didn't read it close and was pleasantly surprised that it came with separate disks for both Blu-ray and standard DVD.  Haven't checked out any of the extras, but even after all of the years, still the most awesome series I remember from my childhood.
B00ESNDQWY|3.0|It's hard to get so excited about such a melodramatic start of a new firm.  Really, is that how lawyers do it?
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Hansel & Gretel is a new twist on a old story this film was great and full of action  I must have watched this about 50 times so far this is a must have.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Best game ever it's very fun!!! Love the graphics! This game is fun to play its like going on an adventure! Reaching different levels and rescuing people is great!
B005LAII44|5.0|I love this movie it's a fast action film if you like the first G.I. Joe movie this is a must have I thought it was great I watch it a lot.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|Different take on the first Iraq War....<br /><br />A lot of typical Army ridiculing s*** like almost every other Mad Sergeant Yelling type movie...
B0090SI4OC|5.0|From Stephenie Meyer the creator of worldwide phenomenon ( Twilight Saga ) comes this  daring and romantic thriller based on the new York Times #1 best seller novel. Saoirse Ronan Is the best I have followed her film's when she was a little girl I fell in love with her this is a must have Look for her new movie's like Byzantium and Violet & Daisy and How I live now.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is the best game I ever played on my kindle<br />and I look toward to more games just like this one<br />but more than that this game will be perfect for people that are really int robots, fighting, and crushing someone's head off
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is fun! I love how it changes with the holidays and seasons.It helps you learn better hand movements.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If a book can make me cry that much, it deserves 5 stars.  Tris' ending was not a surprise based on prior books and her quest to understand the meaning of true sacrifice.  Too bad you low stars didn't get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun and based off of two movies.<br />Despicable Me helps you add subtract. and review what. u do.
B003VWU2WA|2.0|I'm amazed that this product, with such promise, is such a letdown. First, the packaging is maddening. I had to resort to a razor knife to get it out. Then it's unintuitive - I plugged it in and NOTHING happened. It wasn't recognized by my new Mac with OSX 9. So I finally find the teeny &#34;manual&#34; that tells me to go to the website. I download the driver, only to rind it's unsigned, so I have to specially allow it run on my system. Then... it runs as an app, not any kind of a system driver that would hook deeper into the system as a volume control or ???. Then, somehow it switches modes from a volume control to controlling my web browser scrolling. Great... now I realize that if you're in a web browser and want to adjust volume quickly (like a Flash video starts blaring), if you're in a window, the PowerMate is now scrolling up and down, not controlling volume.<br /><br />Color me unimpressed overall, and I'll look very, very carefully at Griffin Technology products from now on. This product just isn't a Mac experience at all. Someone must do something like this a lot better. I'm probably going to try returning this because it not working as a volume control when I'm in a web browser just sucks.
B007NZDES0|5.0|No one I believe loves her style more than me , I own a little bistro in buffalo New York , swing from the vine bistro and when ever I put this DVD on my guest stay longer and she adds a element of classic Sade style if you like her you'll love this worth every penny... Enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The most addictive game I have played.  Would be nice if the power ups were a little bit mire affordable though....
B0028K31CE|3.0|I really like him seen him in concert twice worth every penny, altho I did enjoy the album I would suggest maxwells hang out suite you'll really love that its a little sexyer than this, ... But pretty wings is my personal theme song , had to buy the cd when I heard it, Maxwell fans will still enjoy it
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Rented on Amazon instant video, the stream was great and of course we've loved the movie for years.<br /><br />But if your thinking of renting this, just buy the Blu-ray and you can view it instantly for free while you wait for delivery (I bought it afterwards and that's when I found we could have seen it for free if I had bought it a few hours earlier. I thought we had the DVD but we only had it on VHS)
B0042RUMIW|4.0|It's sting... Enough said his style is his own and this time he adds a touch of raw and class sting fans will enjoy it I play this DVD in my cafe and people seemed to enjoy it.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good movie but completely different then wait I was expecting of a &#34;media trying to tear down a hero&#34; type movie but instead it was a deep character study.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I Just loved this movie , initially it was for the kids when I seen it at the theaters ... Must admit altho I bought it for the kids I watch it for me, these cats are so sophisticated and savvy and the music and dancing in it is ADORABLE!!!... Antonio bandaros ,and salma hyack perfect together... Buy it and love it your cheeks will hurt from grinning so hard...;)
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the app!  It's fast, light on memory, accurate, reliable, and FREE!  Doppler Radar, accurate data, virtually unlimited number of locations on list, and more!! You rarely find an app in market for free as good as this!! Plus, they constantly have updates for the AccuWeather app in market to update!  Really hells me with my facebook weather page, Local Vincennes Weather! Keep up the great work, and Stay Weather Savvy!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Regardless of your profession, this book gives insight to Resistance; that thing which will try to block you in the pursuit of your calling. A must read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I am enjoying this better because I can keep up better...doesn't have 100 tasks at a time...ok maybe I'm slow but I can play it for shorter times and enjoy it more.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a fun game kept my daughter busy.  Couldn't get her off of it. Would recommend to anyone with smaller kids.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Fun to use, easy to use, and interesting. I only wish it had more lengthy videos - most of them are under five minutes. I would rather watch something the length of a television show, or a movie.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|This movie was absolutely AMAZING! Followed the book, and there was always action. I loved the hunger games (in catching fire)-so intense. And FINNICK; he's awesome. You wouldn't regret getting this movie. The only part I was mad about, is that they didn't show Haymitch's hunger games like in the book; that frustrated me. Other than that, there are no complaints, this movie was fantastic!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thought about the characters in this book for weeks after I finished this book.  It also made me question all the decisions or non decisions I have questioned.  Thought provoking, warm, funny.  One of the best books I have read. Recommended it to anyone who will listen.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Game is fun but stopped working for a couple months. I deleted and tried reinstalling and lost everything. Hopefully it will go quicker and be easier to level as they continue to update.
B004LUS390|5.0|This is one of my new favorite apps! It is very easy to use and is a lot of fun. I have used other sketch type apps before, but they do not compare to this one. Autodesk did a great job on this!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game however when u lose a certain number of times u have to wait 30 minutes before getting more lives.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to install.  Great alternative to subscribing to movie channels. YouTube videos are great to watch on a big screen!
B00GO8Z8H2|5.0|This movie is a grand telling of the beginning of Doctor Who. David Bradley's performance as William Hartnell is heartwarming. It especially gives the audience an idea of the problems that Verity Lambert had as the first producer of the program with a very small budget. It truly honors the people who began the program so many years ago. Then there is \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" a fantastic way to celebrate the show's fiftieth anniversary. Matt Smith and David Tennant are excellent. John Hurt is superb. The program sets the Doctor off with a new purpose for his travels; a new thread for the upcoming eighth series. And it pays respect to the show's past.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I really like this album. It's very different from everything that sounds on the radio now and it's very well produced. I have many favorites. Among them are Aura, Do what you want, Venus and Gypsy. But the other songs are &#34;Dope&#34;! Highly recommended
B00CKH9WOQ|4.0|Very nice doll, she's extremely cute but her hair is extremely oily even after washing which is a bit of a put-off, and one of her fore-arms pretty much falls off it's so loose...
B004SKJTY6|4.0|I liked it!  Great acting!  I learned something about English history.  No wonder they won the academy awards.  Highly recommended
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book held my interest throughout!  It was well written and the descriptions were in great detail and the emotions were very well expressed.  I would highly recommend this for young adults and adults interested in the real Germany prior to and during WWII.  I believe it depicts it in graphic detail.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and great to have on hand on short notice. I use it on daily basis and is very useful for grocery shopping.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham has long since proved to be a splendid storyteller.  Sycamore Row underlines that talent with this fascinating tale of the settling of a will.  Grisham has managed to incorporate surprise and sudden turns into this usually boring task of estate settlement.  Keep 'me coming, John.
B00377E5SG|3.0|If you've seen the original Sabrina movie, it's hard to watch this one and have it live up to its predecessor. Besides this, it's a great modern version of the original, and still adds its own original twists.
B008J4L3E6|1.0|Mary Higgins Clark has lost her edge. Her earlier books were brilliant and kept you engaged from the first page. Her earlier works eg \\"a cry in the night\\" still gives me chills but this book, i struggled to finish. Had to actually stopprd reading it a few times! I dare say this book was a waste of money and time!
B002ZG98ZA|3.0|Case was not actually a blu-Ray but a DVD box labeled blu-Ray but disk does play in the blu-ray player.
1476727651|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan since I was a child,, over 40 years ago,,, I have read and love all of his books.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Only wish there were more episodes and seasons of this fantastic show. It's a tragedy that it was cancelled too soon.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The action was not just in the end but throughout the movie. They also did a good job of character development. There was even humor.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever. I need more FLUFFY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I hope they come out with another one because I am definitely addicted
1455521310|3.0|Very good read.  The storyline and plot move along at a reasonable enough speed but I am getting tired of the touchy, feely,  emotional baggage that keeps coming up about Michele.  This is getting a bit old.  We get that she had a hard childhood.  You have beaten that horse to death.  Move on already.  And please explain to me why two very handsome and healthy young people who obviously think the world of each other, have only had sex once in all their dealings together.  This is not natural.  You need not turn it into a romance novel,  but get serious,  they should have a relationship.  Overall Baldacci is a great writer and this is a good book, once you get past the squishy stuff.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Suspense, action, mystical power and coming of age insights. This book has it all. The non-stop action makes it impossible to put down. Lucky for us, the other two parts of this trilogy are also available:<br />[[ASIN:B00DIMXTBO Outin (The Inner Movement)]]<br />and<br />[[ASIN:B00G6Q29KQ Outmove (The Inner Movement) Book 3]]
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|Too hard to win fights. Guess you have to spend$$ for a strong robot. Only won the first sparring fight. I un-installed it.
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|I was very disappointed to see that the case had multiple scratches on it. It looks like it was used. It came with skins to put on the inside of the case, but the purpose of me buying a clear case was to show off the color of my gold 5S.  I'll probably keep it because it was inexpensive and I'm too lazy to send it back. However, I won't buy anything else from them.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Where are the different weapons for these suits? They all have the same handbeam is that it?! It's like an arcade game with no storyline. Iron Man dies to easily, system critical error. Very repetitive and you have to spend a lot money to get the good armors. Your always in fly mode. The special weapon has to build up energy and you only get 1 shot, if you don't die first. The game is really just eye candy for robot freaks.
1416550550|3.0|Secret garden for adults. Not a great writer but she juggles the different eras really well. Book club LOVED it
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|A weird and funny game. Must have for kids! Clay monsters and a barrage of colors keep then enthralled for hours. And daddy too.
1451688091|4.0|Long but wonderful The movie took only a small part of the story It's really as much about Seward as Lincoln Bring on Teddy!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|book two does not disappoint, better than fist in series, can not wait to see movie and read mocking Jay.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!!! i love the way they make the graghics every one in the world needs needs to play it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game I have played would recommend to all my friends and family who love horses as much as I do!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my new favorite book and if you want an awesome book to read you need to read this book.
B00C1040TO|2.0|I have a Kindle Fire and this app doesn't open consistently and it is very confusing to work. I wish I could get my money back.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Best way to view my home collection from anywhere, as long as someone doesn't run off my computer or unplug the router.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have a limited budget for apps and while I love this game,it can be frustrating that some levels seem created to be impossible to get you to do in-app purchases.  On the other hand, I like the challenges to earn extra bonuses.
B004W48QFG|4.0|provided exactly what I was looking for to use the Kindle at work from one of our remote facilities and not have to kick someone off their workstation.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins really outdid herself! The book was amazing and very well written. I very highly recommend it. Excited to finish the series!
B00B2FLDRQ|4.0|Do you know a workaholic with a good sense of humour you care about? Get him this one.<br />When asked if there is anything he regrets in his life, my dying father replied: I had a good life, but the one thing I regret is that I did not enjoy my life enough.<br />This is a truly nice fine read. Well written with a great sense of humor.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I fell in love with Augustus Waters right alongside Hazel.  Two cancer patients, these two star-crossed lovers cope with realities that no child should ever have to face, but they do it with wit, intelligence, and honesty.  The characters were more truly human than some real people I've met.  LOVED it and laughed through my tears.
B002RI9YCI|5.0|An absolute gem. Warm and witty. Great language. Great build-up. Perfect Christmas present (you don't even have to be a royalist to love this book)
B00BAXFECK|3.0|Well written with great detail, but very little action or intrigue. Writer gives you a very clear picture of the people and the place, you can feel it and see it. A depressing story and I kept waiting for something to happen, for the story to move forward.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my children absolutely love this game!!!!!  They each take turns playing and it even helps my youngest with his math.
B00821OX98|4.0|love this series, unfortunately I just cant get enough and the seasons are over, please help a junky out and send me more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to sit down and play when you're bored as heck but it is very time consuming and can catch you up in it very fast.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It is the worst game I have bought.In the first place I won't spend money to play then the timing is so fast when you get to level 13 you can't win . Personally I hate it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great Case study of people.  loved reading about the south.  Made me think of me own racial heritage and what I think of people.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|dont waist your money when you can get bloons td battle for free because the fifth version sucks dont waist money or coins
B003YL4LYI|5.0|these are the greatest books ever written EVERY ONE IS BETTER THAN THE LAST CANT WAITE FOR THE NEXT ONE
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Game locked up forcing a re install. Once this happens you LOSE all your progress and MONEY spent , with no way to recover.great game ruined by its own developer.I want a refund
0451205766|5.0|One of the best reads ever. This should be on everyone's must have list. I breezed through this book and have lent it to multiple people. Even having seen the movies multiple times the book as always beats a movie.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|This game takes forever to download ... it's been  2 days and it got to45 percent then 50, but then it started all over and it made me so mad. If you want this game you might have to get ready to wait.
0312360258|5.0|I love this series. I've read them over and over. Theres something about the series thats relatable to the characters and it just makes it fun to read
B00G23VD6Y|4.0|The season is off to a fairly slow, albeit dramatically strong start. The character development is still top notch! I can't wait to see what this season has in store for the group. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I watched episode 2, &#34;Infected&#34; on the Amazon video player, in HD, and it absolutely sucked!!<br /><br />Let me repeat: the HD Amazon video player is horrible! Even when it buffered, the video took quick pauses every 3 seconds. It really ruined a lot of the drama in the episode, and because of this, I doubt I'll ever buy anything with Amazon video ever again.
0062082353|4.0|was a good read, and after his murderI thought I owed it to Mr Kyle and his family to read about his life.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Steve has been an inspirational leader, this book proves it. A compelling biography from the man that changed the way think about life!<br />Think Different ... He did it!
0517548232|5.0|Outstanding lesson on economics and should be required reading for  anyone in high-school, and a new lesson or reminder to those in Washington DC!!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Ok, I know ads are part of the deal for free apps, but the freakin' movies you have to watch before skipping them are locking up my kindle fire HD. Deleting app.
B0058YPGSY|1.0|SERIES HAS BECOME SO VIOLENT AND TWISTED CAN NO LONGER WATCH, HAD TO GIVE THIS AWAY SO SORRY BECAUSE IT USED TO BE GREAT...DEBI

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|simply put if you downloaded the previous version of this game you will absolutely love this version it is a bit different but the changes are great. some items in the game do cost real money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun.It always changes settings.You just go to the store and update it.It also has really cool characters.My favorite is Tasha.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I bought this for my teen for Christmas. He was thrilled!  Loves Santana. If you love Santana this CD shows off his talent!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really liked the game.It is exactly what I wanted.It is fun for all ages.If you want a game for all of your kids to play this is perfect.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great writing along with a captivating story line.  Another Grisham classic that is difficult to put down.  Easy to root or the underdog.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|If you want to experience this music as it was meant to be heard... MONO is the only way to go. Next best thing to to vinyl.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|plays decent for me.  pity some can't read that it was one free game.  great for travel game to keep the kids quiet
B0027BOL4G|5.0|BUY IT. I also bought FOODMATTERS, HUNGRY FOR CHANGE, FORKS OVER KNIVES, FOOD INC., SUPER SIZE ME, FAT SICK & NEARLY DEAD, GOT THE FACTS ON MILK, and TAPPED.<br /><br />First I cut way, way, way back on sugar (not completely ought though.) I lost about 10 lbs in about 3 weeks. Then I bought a &#34;Hamilton Beach&#34; Big Mouth Pro Juicing Machine. I lost 20 lbs the first week doing the detox method (juicing fresh, almost all organic veggies and a little fruit.) I was not hungry, though I still had some cravings for sweets, steak, etc. It is important to know that I never let myself get hungry. I drank the 16 oz juice 3 times a day for 21 days snacking on cut up fresh veggies when I felt the need. My weight loss stalled a little, then slowly started moving again. It has been 6 weeks now and I currently have lost 40 lbs., went from a 38&#34; waist to a 34.&#34; My shoes are now laced as tight as they will go and are now slip-ons. I feel & look healthier. I have a better attitude now and my doctor took me off most of my meds. He said over time, I may get off them all.<br /><br />Honestly, you do have to have drive, enthusiasm, and determination. However, you do NOT have to be hungry and want to make sure you are not hungry. Otherwise you trigger a starvation involuntary bodily response to store fat due to the bodily perception of food shortage. This is only one reason why ordinary DIETS DO NOT WORK!<br /><br />Are you tired of your life as it is? Hungry for dramatic change? GET BUSY! I am NOT sorry I decided to change.<br /><br />P.S. - Look at the following Books: &#34;The Juicing Bible&#34; and &#34;The Big Book of Juices.&#34; I found them helpful.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great movie for the holiday.  I haven't seen this in a while.  One of the classics if you want to enjoy comedy over the holidays.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Limited time you get it for free. It said after the weekend I had to pay for it, no thanks!
B008JFUPPI|2.0|So that is where Rooster Cogburn ended up?  In this movie.  Not funny, not interesting and phony.  A writer somewhere is going to be punished by the movie sprites for this stinker.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I can't even get the thing removed right off my Kindle. And it takes your pics upside down. I just didn't like that thing. Might work better for someone else.
B0087HT36U|4.0|.....can not put it down......simple, addictive, Waiting for Age of Cowboys for about a year.  The seven second ad is not a issue
B0000JCFPE|5.0|Put together a fun basket of things from 1992 for a birthday present!  This was one of the most popular movies that year.  Perfect!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this  game , it is so cute especially the minions this game is great for.kids all.over  the world
B00AEBB86A|5.0|Making a Christmas basket for a big Mark Wahlberg fan!  Was able to get lots of his movies for great prices!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome, addictive, fun, I love it. It's super fun, my little cousin likes to play it a lot. Keep it up!
0783226845|5.0|Put together a fun basket of things from 1992 for a birthday present!  This was one of the most popular movies that year.  Perfect!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game even if there is no red stone and if the zombies want to eat my brain's but it's good to wake up and punch a creeper in the face and wear butter armour.I love that their are no squids in pocketed edition and pigs are so cute I just like every version of mincemeat I'm sort of sad that their are no ender men
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Making a Christmas basket for a big Mark Wahlberg fan!  Was able to get lots of his movies for great prices!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|A had this app before but then deleted it. I recently downloaded it and it's still the same. It's easy to use with simple setting that make it fun to play. However I wish a could use strategic moves like castling.
0525478817|5.0|I don't know anything about this book...my daughter wanted to order the book so I bought it for her...I think she liked the book so much though that she wanted the hardcover version of the book...so it must be a great book.  She's 14
0671449028|5.0|I really like this book. It is a board book so it is easy for my son if he wants to turn the pages. The story is sweet too. We like reading this one at night.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I thought this product worked pretty slick.  I had never used one before, but once i got the device put together it literally took a minute to lightly score the bottle, then poor hot water slowly over the cut, then run cold water over the cut.  If that doesn't do it, just repeat.  I got a nice clean cut and had to do minimal sanding.  I was really impressed for using it for the first time.  Don't even bother with the tapper.  Just put it back in the box.  There are probably better cutters out there for more money but this one was very effective.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Great movie, I have to say my favorite of all the live action Supermans I've ever seen.  There is a bit too much CGI destruction for taste, lasting too long, but the drama and characters were entertaining and fresh.  I enjoyed the Sci-Fi feel of the show, which suits the origin story just fine in my book.<br /><br />Be warned the Ultraviolet version of &#34;downloadable content&#34; is a borderline lie.  You have to install special software, apps, etc.  It is not a portable mp4 or mv4 movie that you can load into iTunes or stream to your tv.  I am now forewarned about this unwanted version of the movie that I will never use.  I'll buy the non bundled version going forward.
0307352153|5.0|Well written... Very insightful. Learned lots. If you feel you &#34;don't fit in, or outgoing &#34; find out why in this read.
0596809158|5.0|The R Cookbook is an excellent tool for getting things done in R.  It isn't comprehensive, but I doubt that is possible in a language like R.  What it does do is show the reader useful methods that are critical to getting things done efficiently in a problem-solution approach well suited to the obscurities of R.
0544104404|5.0|Experience is the best teacher, Marty Dutcher uses his years of experience to write his new book, How Children Succeed. Commorn sense, easy to read Marty goes strait to the point of raising children successfully today - character. While times may change children with strong character will be prepared to make the necessary adjustments to find happiness in their lives. I highly recommend this book. The heart of a truly wonderful teacher shines through. Thank you, Marty!
0670023329|5.0|This is one of the most harrowing books I have ever read.  I ended up loving this kid and admired his zest for life.  It was so encouraging!  There were times when I was sick to my stomach, thinking, &#34;How could one human being do that to another?&#34;  But then this is North Korea.  I had the book sitting on my car seat, my 16 year-old son grandson picked it up and couldn't put it down.  I ended up buying another copy for him.  He loved it!<br /><br />It is a great book.  Better, because it is a true story,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a great read from a child's and death's different perspective. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
B004LROUNG|5.0|True work of art!  Totally absorbing and enjoyable. Interesting to see behind the scenes of Tort Law. Much humor included.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I liked everything about this book...the depth of personal processing, the humor, the vivid picturesque captivating scenery both geographical and interpersonal, the honesty and passion and heart....all of it moved me and left me indelibly touched and more evolved as a better woman and human being.<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars for it's all-encompassing scope and power and recommend it to all.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A very good book I'm glad I read it. It brings back some of the old Tom Clancy novels I'm so fond of.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Some of the best writing....there were moments where I was amazed at what I was reading and feeling. A gifted writer. Love the story.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Brilliant.  Couldn't stop reading the book. Finished it in 3 days. A must read!!  John is the man.  Wish I was writer.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|They have turned what was a fun game into what now requires money to play.  If you don't spend your money you have NO chance of competing.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|It is hard to believe this has been around long enough for an anniversary edition, because the music is still so fresh and interesting. I'm glad I decided to replace my ancient, marginally-playable cassette with a digital version.  The bonus tracks are interesting; some are good for a listen or two but I really enjoy the demo of Homeless.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon Cross!  There really is no end to his love for Eva or what he would do to keep her safe.  This is the third installment of their story.  It keeps getting deeper and darker. I am in awe of their love for each other despite all the turbulence in the relationship.  Reading this you are run through every emotion possible and in the end you are in awe that they can keep it together!<br />However it just ends and you will realize there are 2 more books planned in the lives of Gideon and Eva.  While you are excited to read more about them you will also be dumb struck cause the book just ends.  Period. The. End,<br />BOO!  I was a bit angry cause I hadn't heard she was writing more till I finished the book.  That will not stop me from buying and consuming the rest of the series though!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally it's on Kindle been waiting forever. Now we just need more of your games, give us more of the saga games please :)  And thanks for making them free!
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Jim Carrey was still in his prime + Cameron Diaz looked SMOKIN'!!! It was an enjoyable whacked out comedy as are most of Carrey's movies.If you like his style then you must see this.
B00GFOIUVQ|4.0|its a great game i enjoy playing it takes a bit to level up in the game and ots fun
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was very touching and inspirational all at once. I related the most to the character Tess, due to her shy personality.<br />The ending made me teary-eyed.
1419705644|4.0|Very cool book.My kids and Uncle 58yrs old loves it.It's a must have for any Adventure Time Fan.Must buy.Jake,Finn,and more.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love this new album. If you liked Katy's last album, this one will be slightly less pop-esque, but definitely enjoyable. Favorite songs so far are Unconditionally and It Takes Two.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|FUN GAME. Passes time. Can't upgrade storage easily. Level up quickly. Wish didn't have to use so many crowns for the Dragon.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am not crazy about the business model that requires money for game pieces.  I understand the purpose but don't personally agree with it.<br />great game to unwind with.  Easy and fun to play.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|it's like terraria for the PC but on your tablet! the controls are a bit clonky but you get used to it. 5 stars
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|THERE IS NO LIVE VIDEO ON DVD.<br />With that said, why would anyone pay<br />over $60 for this. When will someone release<br />a complete live show of the band in their hey day?
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|I had read the book about this man years ago. Finally a brilliant artist made it a visual masterpiece. I reflected on what my ancestors endured. Between anger and tears the director brings to you a real life story. Definitely an award winning product.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game looks good i want it but  seven bucks really is it worth that much? want it so bad i wish it was less
B00BAXFECK|4.0|However some parts dragged on a little. Author's certainly talented in her ability to bring things and characters to live with her descriptions. However I found her characters a tad too painfully exaggerated.  Overall, however definitely loved the read.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|great as the free version but more games to play.  Gives a person something to do when waiting for an appt.  Keeps you sharp and challenges your skills.
0061692034|1.0|Don't waste your time, thought I would read a masterpiece and continued in despair despite wanting to shut the book down after 200 plus pages.<br />Boring, boring, boring will never read a Richard Ford again...........
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My daughter says it is hard to tell which candy is the jelly because there are so many different candies in the game.  otherwise it is a fun game.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I liked this far more than her memoirs.<br /><br />Engaging story, strong characters. Great way of putting you in their minds...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because the minion makes a bunch of funny sounds and there are so many costumes available. There are a lot of obstacles to dodge and the minion does something different depending on which one he hits. The fun is endless and it is a great game for kids.
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin is a no brainer. Every record they ever produced was epic.<br />This one is in my top 5.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing, just amazing. You can't not love this book, it's incredible. It gave me a lot of insight on life.
B00124FQCK|5.0|There are a lot of purist Sabbath fans that trash this album. (Ironically one of the songs is titled Trashed) I am a die-hard Black Sabbath fan of the original line-up but I still love this one. Disturbing the Priest and Zero the Hero are tracks that should not be missed.<br />Ian Gillan's voice makes this album wicked and cool. Iommi's guitar is haunting...Get it.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|Beautifully acted, directed, and shot. Simple, elegant, intimate. I was surprisingly impressed and delighted by this film - a beautiful portrait of human fragility, vulnerability, and the power of love and acceptance to heal and transform.
B007SGM084|5.0|It's really more of a love story than a real domination-submissive story.  There is actually not that much in the way of sadism or masochism.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|It is such a stupid book!  Why would the author have death be a narrator, that makes no sense at all  and it is also very depressing.<br />The concept of death is not something that he should write about,  since he has no knowledge or concept of what it is.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book touched me like no other I dont think a movie can come close! It was extraordinary to me
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever!! I highly recommend this game to anyone!! If you are someone looking for a game that will keep your attention.. . this the game for you! THANK YOU MOJANG!!!!!
B0017I1IZA|5.0|Love this series!!!!!! Just another amazing story! Read the book on a day that you can spend hours reading because u will not stop.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My son loves this face paced racing through game.  Grab the bananas as you go and avoid obstacles.  My fingers and eyes just aren't fast enough for this game.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I'm learning Italian and it's so fun. I even find myself practising during the day without the kindle. Suits my learning style perfectly.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Using this app to learn to play.  It has helped me to remember which pieces can move which way.  It is much more patient than my family.  LOL
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Sucked me in, pulled me along, toyed with my emotions......  Excellent!  Of course, there are many stories yet to be told.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis gives probably the greatest acing proformances of all time.  Tommy Lee Jones was beyond exceptional.  Every acting role in the entire movie was brilliant.  The only flaw was the ending.  All I can say is Steven Speilberg needs to rewatch Roman Holiday.  What a wonderful movie.  But Argo had the great ending - although the ending was a historical lie.  The great great ending was there for Spielberg.  He just blew it!
B00005LK94|4.0|For many years I was longing to watch this movie and at last I got it through Amazon.<br />There is a message here in the movie which can be translate to our life.<br />It has wonderful cinematography. Whole family can watch together and specially if you have<br />teenage children and get inspired!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|A king role with mastery at products and negative polarity of tyranny.<br />Insecurity from being an adopted child which had formed many chief features with self-realization at the late stage of his life.  Very interesting personality.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Return to Kingsbridge with even more interesting characters than in Pillars of the Earth.  Meet Caris, Merthin, Ralph, Godwyn, Gwenda, and Philemon.  From their youth to middle age and beyond, the story moves along.  If I wasn't reading it walking on the treadmill, I was reading it on my android phone every chance I could get.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|Bloons td 5 is fun and its just boring at the begining rounds but fun when you hit round 102 I wonder if there gonna make a 6th bloons td<br />AND PLAY MMMIIINNNEEECCCRRRAAAFFFTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B4VSUBA|5.0|It's a great movie lowed on VHS love it even better on BLU-RAY.  The picture is amazing on the disk I have the original VHS bought it in the early 1980's but it's deteriorated  over the years had to grab it from amazon. Picture and the sound is superior compare to the VHS also the price was great. Thanks amazon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome in 0.8.0 there will be beats and you can make soup and the red dye when your done farming them and there will be carrots and potatoes  and one you have a carrot in your hand pigs will fallow you and there will be tall grass carpet<br />and minecarts with rails and beats are not in xbox or pc unless you get a mod mine craft is awesome 0.8.0 will come out on December fith for ios and the 12th for android I highly recommend minecraft pe and I'm 10 years old
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I hated the ending. it killed the whole series for me. other then that it was good. not as good as the other ones though.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A great follow up of the first book. I recommend this book to anyone over 10 years old . Cannot wait to read the last installment.
B003Y5H5AG|1.0|Cd did not work. I hate to order dvds and when they come they don't work. Won't order it again.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|The app, even the paid app pushes adds it could have been a good alarm clock otherwise. I had to delete it
B002BIULQ2|5.0|Great movie! I really enjoyed this &#34;flashback&#34; of Miley Cyrus back when she was Hanna Montanna. she needs to tone it down.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Excellent Read! very informative and uplifting, kept me interested on every page. Will recommend to all my reading friends. Thanks Malcom!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Great movie. I love the Marvel stuff so I will be anxiously awaiting the release of the second installment on DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is simple fun and always coming out with updates you will never get bored but if you do don't delete it  soon it will update can't wait to play once it is done updating . I love this game I want to say aware job to the creators of this game =)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love the Lord of the Ring trilogy and hence the Hobbit trilogy would be a logical choice. I saw the movie in a theater and knew right away that I had to have the DVD. The whole package.(Blu-ray/UltraViolet/DVD) is definitely worth the price. Blu-ray is the way to go and having a digital copy I can keep on my laptop for those layovers at the airports makes it worthwhile. I recommend this movie.
B0000256VK|5.0|You either love this album or hate it. Me, I love it. Fell in love with it the very first time I heard it, and now decades later, I still love it. This one has some real magic weaved in between the notes...
B00136RV66|5.0|This music is so awesome!  It takes you right back as John Dunbar becomes Dances With Wolves, as he makes friends with Kicking Bird and as he looses his beloved Two Socks and Cisco. Even if you don't like the movie or haven't seen it, it's beautiful music.  .And for sure,  if you love the movie, you have to have this album!  Just get it and you'll see!
B00F91SCXC|2.0|blah, this movie was blah all the way. Who knew world war z was a buddy movie between brad pitt and a bald one armed israeli commando girl? actually that sounds more interesting then what you get here.<br /><br />Though to be fair, I listened to the book on tape and was expecting something even a little similar to the book. I think they barely read the book before they put this big-budget pandering-to-the-common-denomenator film together.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very nice graphics, challenging yet still easy to play.  One of my favorite games.  I will keep this app for a long time.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|Great acting, great scenery, well-scripted and a good plot.  If you like George Clooney, this is one you should see.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Allows me to connect my Firewire 800 external HD to a new iMac. This negated the need to buy another external HD and works flawlessly.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|My son who is 9 put this together, he loves Ninjago, he loves Legos. You just can't go wrong with Legos, they are always coming up with great stuff that is a lot of fun.
B00BKZUVGM|3.0|The 3rd book could not capture the energy of the 1st books in the series and the concept lost its charm
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The relationship with his boyhood male &#34;lover&#34; is the only real relationship in the book, notwithstanding his betrothal and &#34;true love&#34; interest.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Gameloft please update it! I love this game but update it please!!!!!<br />Make it BIG! Add more cars,guns,boats,plains,make Rio bigger!<br />:) i love u gameloft also add more people,and change the DICS to something else that the DICS! Make this as close as u can to the grand theft auto. :)
B0024CEY36|3.0|I love Follett, but this book is one of his &#34;just ok&#34; books. I probably would not order it again, but it was interesting, definitely not as interesting as some of his trilogys, or his Jackdaws novel.
B007XNTDPA|4.0|Good story well written. Just enough intrigue to keep you reading. Will recommend it to my son. Love John Grisham  legal dramas.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Funniest running game I have played. Better than temple run and subway surfer. I highly recommend playing this amazing game
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Great Music.  Lana Del Rey needs more respect.  So few people out there that can actually write and sing and come up with unique stuff.
031623480X|5.0|Very informative, yet controversial. Well written. Really makes you think about the foods we eat. I will definately make some different choices.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So much fun and the weapons are good and the is the real game not the fake ones that people make
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Only played through six levels, but incredibly fun! Would definitely recommend this game for anyone who enjoys shooting stuff without actually killing anything.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraia is a adventure game with great a great crafting mechanics and a combat system that can't be matched. Battle fearsome creatures and build a home for NPC's that you can trade with. Also craft a variety of armor and weapons. But when you enter certain biomes or go underground to mine the music will change, sadly the music overlaps and just gives up having a variety in what the music should change to. A little bug but with inevitable updates it should be fixed. This is a must buy.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I gave this book a rating of 4. One would think of numerous reasons why the marriage would not work.  I was glad to see it did work out. If you are looking for a good book to read, this is it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like it. Almost better than SimCity on fb. Easy to play and understand. Just wish money would accumulate a little faster but it does not take too too long to bigger. Definitely a time killer game.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|It was quite different from what I had expected. For one not very knowledgeable as to the origins of Superman, other than common knowledge, I thought it was a great new take on his history. I would definitely watch this again. It would be a great purchase.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is the best hunting game I have played in over 10years. I will recommend this to my friends. The graphics are so life like. Great job to the developers.
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|I just started getting into this show. I've been meaning to start watching this but I've been putting it off for a while. It could be better but you could absolutely tell it was made for tv. It could be a lot better! I did expect more out of the show, but hey, I am only about 4-5 episodes in so maybe it will get a bit better and more action packed.
0345347951|5.0|Clarke, of course, is one of the Big Three in science fiction, the other two being Heinlein and Asimov. These gentlemen, while not necessarily the best writers, or even the best storytellers, and certainly not on all occasions, are generally agreed to have the greatest influence on the subsequent development of the field over the past half century. And this book is widely regarded as one of Clarke's two most important books, along with _2001: A Space Odyssey_. Keeping in mind that it was written in the early `50s, in this edition the author also went back in 1989 and rewrote the first chapter somewhat, pushing the setting farther into his own future -- and he still was not sufficiently optimistic when it came to making technological predictions.<br /><br />The first section of it also is the peak of one of SF's key tropes: \\"The sky was full of ships.\\" Not an alien invasion, that is, but the sudden demonstration to humankind that we are not alone. In this case, the aliens take control, however. They don't interfere much in human affairs, actually, except in the matter of weapons development, active warfare, and cruelty to others. But in those matters, they save the Earth from itself, and apparently just in the nick of time. Creativity suffers, especially in the sciences, and many people are upset by the loss of their \\"freedom\\" to make disastrous decisions, but humans in general rapidly enters upon a Golden Age of peace and plenty.<br /><br />But that's just the beginning of the story. The Overlords, as humans have quickly come to call them, may be benign dictators but they have a deeper purpose in taking control of Earth. Because homo sapiens has begun to evolve in possibly dangerous ways. And when it all resolves itself at the end, you may find it a bit depressing. Clarke is better known for intellectual engagement with the reader rather than galloping action scenes or overpowering drama. This is a book to think about and to reread every decade or so.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy this game on computer or kindle. The daily tournament is a great feature! I play it daily
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is not anything you would probably just sit down and play. I look at it as a game you check on after every now and then since there is a lot of waiting to do in this game. You get to decorate, cook, have visitors to talk with, and you can leave tips at other peoples' restaurants. You check it every now and then to serve food, and it gives you a guide for what to do. Although there are a lot of things that have something to do with gems, which is basically money that you buy with real money and that you have to wait on food to cook a lot. But other than that, it's an awesome game.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|If you were not able to see them when they toured recently you missed what might have been one of the greatest jams of all time. As Still said.. it took him a long time to pull off this gathering. And what a gathering it is! Stills looked trim, fit, healthy and very, very focused on his music. He jammed like a young kid and he was on fire. Seeing him with KWS was amazing. KWS literally attacks every rif as it was the most important of his life. There is nobody like him out there. And he seems to really enjoy the audience he plays for. Humble yet attacking each rif.  Both of them jam as good any any ax players of any time. Stills would pound away and then seamlessly pass the ax to KWS and visa-versa for an amazing gig. Add Goldberg and you have a phenomenal trio. Goldberg goes way back and he hammers the keyboards with so much feeling. KWS is just the best out there today (my mumble opinion) but Still still has a lot to give and he shows the kid a thing or 2. Wow. I really hope they do more collaborating together. This album is one for the ages. A definite collectors item for those of us that appreciate hard driving rock and roll and blues.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app gives me all the information I want and some I didn't know I wanted! Fantastic resolution on my Kindle Fire. Love it!
B00ED2EMJQ|5.0|Excellent recordings. Glad to have additional BBC sessions on disc two. This is a significant improvement on the original CD production. Buy with confidence.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The author takes you on a journey which starts out intriguing but the further you travel with her the most discouraging it gets.  I disliked all of the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought to play Google Music All-Access through my receiver, so it works perfectly for that. Daughter can play Netflix from her iPhone-5 through it, so that's another plus.<br /><br />For $10/month (I got in while it was $8), Google All-access lets me listen to brand-new just-released music, as well as stuff going back decades. I can store the tracks on my device locally, so when my cell phone has no data, or my tablet has no WiFi, I can still listen to anything I want.<br /><br />With the Chromecast, I can then stream that music through my receiver and listen to it as great quality.<br /><br />The ONLY thing this won't do is stream music you have &#34;sideloaded&#34; onto your device. It'll only play what it can stream directly from Google's servers. I think this means that you would have to upload your &#34;owned&#34; music to Google Music, and then listen to it from there.<br /><br />This is only necessary with groups like Led Zeppelin, who do not seem to be available from Google All Access. Yet. But I did upload my Led Zep to Google Music, and I was able to play it from there, so... no biggee...<br /><br />The ONE thing it won't do well is play music or audio directly from Google Chrome on my laptop. It breaks up like a bad Bluetooth connection, or speeds up and skips.<br /><br />It also won't play 1080p type video directly from my laptop through Chrome, saturating the poor little thing with bandwidth. Not sure if it's the Chromecast, Chrome on the laptop, or my WiFi, but at 300Mbps on Wifi, I can't see that as the reason.<br /><br />Plays Netflix great at 1080p. Go figure.<br /><br />Does OK streaming the Chrome browser to the TV with a bit of lag, but it's nice to display web sites to the TV - or maybe even a projector in a conference room. Be aware that for corporate or other business use, DHCP would have to be available, and whatever you are streaming from would have to be on the same subnet.<br /><br />Can't say enough good about this, for $35, it's cheaperthan a Bluetooth adapter for my receiver, and it does SO much more.

0316074314|4.0|Eleanor Catton won the Man Booker Prize with this novel in 2013, and in the process won all sorts of superlatives. Catton is the youngest novelist ever to win this prestige award, and THE LUMINARIES is the longest novel ever to take the prize. It may also well be the most enjoyably readable Booker prize winner since A. S. Byatt's POSSESSION in 1990, which (not coincidentally) was also in part a Victorian historical fiction and was also written in densely lush prose. Catton's novel echoes the sensation fictions of the decade in which it is set, the 1860s, but the scene here is New Zealand: in a boomtown near the famous gold fields, a large assortment of characters (including two Chinese men and one Maori) attempt to piece together the events that have led to a disappearance and to a death. Since sensation novels were predecessors of detective fiction, the reader must also figure out the determining narrative that involves gold smuggling, murder, prostitution, mutilation, opium addiction, and a very dramatic seance. Catton's larger point (revealed almost wholly in the novel's final fifty pages) is that mysteries and fates are often predetermined by parties outside our ken, as her complex plottings both narratological and astrological underline. Whether or not these tricks are ultimately mostly a lot of fuss and bother for diminished intellectual return, THE LUMINARIES is still a great deal of fun, with rich prose, fine characters, and an enjoyably complex plot.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I won't be specific to avoid ruining the plot for someone who hasn't seen this yet, but I was disappointed that the writers reused a character from the older Star Trek series and movies. Couldn't they have been more creative and come up with a new character. I also didn't think it was accurate that the Enterprise was able to land and take off again from a planet. Why would they need the transporter or shuttle craft to go down to a planet and return on board?<br /><br />Otherwise the special effects were great and except for the flaws in the storyline mentioned above, it was a good movie.

1476727651|4.0|A worthy sequel to the brilliant and timeless The Shining, Doctor Sleep answers the question of what ever happened to little Danny Torrance. Readers get a glimpse into a young Danny's life after the Overlook, but the majority of the story is devoted to Dan and his Shine after his alcoholism caused him to hit rock bottom. Just as young Danny found a mentor and savior in Dick Hallorann, adult Dan is given the chance to return the favor when he connects (as only those with the Shining can do) with young Abra, who he discovers is far more powerful than he could ever imagine to be.<br /><br />And it is that strong Shine that causes Abra (and those like her) to be the target of a terrifying clan of travelers that call themselves the True Knot. Though Doctor Sleep is probably better classified as \\"paranormal\\", any bit of \\"horror\\" it holds within its pages are due to the True Knot members who torture and kill children to sustain themselves.<br /><br />Full of damaged, yet strong, characters, Doctor Sleep is, on its own, a satisfying read, but also provides readers the rare treat of closure on a well-known literary character.

B0027MJU00|3.0|I read Sharp Objects before I read Dark Places. Sharp Objects impressed me. Dark Places not quite as much.<br />I will not go into a synopsis of the plot, since many other reviewers have already done so. I'd rather focus on other areas.<br />First of all, Ms. Flynn's writing abilities: There is no doubt Ms. Flynn has a way with words and is an absolute master of the simile, and not too shabby with a metaphor either. I've never read anything quite like it. However, a great simile is like a chocolate sundae, delicious but much too rich to consume one right after another. I'd have enjoyed this story more if she'd been just a little less generous with the similes, sprinkled them throughout like treats. It got to where it seemed she was following a hidden formula; perhaps two regular sentences and then a brilliant simile, then one paragraph without any, then three regular sentences and another brilliant simile, etc. Because of this, some of the writing seemed contrived and actually pulled me out of the story at regular intervals. This author has a very unique style and is able to paint images with her words. I have to say I enjoyed the experience of her deftness with the craft of writing unfolding before me as I read.<br />The story did keep me engaged although very few of the characters were likeable. Diondra's tendencies were particularly vile and dirty (her self-centered cruelty, letting the dogs crap on the carpet and not cleaning it up, leaving animal remains in Ben's locker, drinking and drugging while pregnant, etc.) I noticed that some reviewers felt the characters were not well-developed. I'm not sure I agree with that; I felt they came across very clearly. I'm also undecided about whether there has to be some kind of fundamental change in a character's personality by the end of the book. I know it's a formula that many readers look to; they long to see a character transformed by the experiences in the story. However, it it true that some people in real life manage to avoid deep and lasting change in themselves no matter what happens to them. I know a few folks like that; experiences that would make or break someone else seem to leave them in pretty much the same state they were in before. So, I can't complain that Libby doesn't seem to change much by the end of the story, other than she becomes temporarily motivated to get out of her bed and do something. She seems by the end of the book to pretty much confirm that the Day family is full of bad seeds.<br />Plot: It is true, as some other reviewers have said, that for a mystery fan this book will probably disappoint because of slipping in a different killer after giving nearly no clues. Mystery fans will think that's unfair and lazy. The plot was, in places, very believable. In others, not so much. But it was a decent enough plot, in my opinion. Not stellar, but good enough.<br />Editing and proofing: This is one reason I felt compelled to give this book only 3 stars. Self-published books and indie authors are scrutinized and excoriated for punctuation errors and the like, while traditionally published authors seem to get a pass. It should be the other way around. I am not a grammar cop or member of the punctuation police. However, in a book by a best-selling author, traditionally published, I expect to see proper use of commas, semi-colons, etc. This book is rife with punctuation errors. And while I love the sentence fragment, when used judiciously, it can certainly be jarring when overdone. The other error I noticed was that it seemed Patty's parents were named Day, when I assumed that was her married name. I'm thinking her maiden name probably wouldn't have been Day also. But maybe it was. Or it could be an editorial error. Because this book was traditionally published and therefore presumably endured multiple edits, I have to hold it to a higher standard.<br />Research: I never mind at all if an author takes artistic liberties with geography, but I do believe that factought to be stated somewhere in the author notes or at the end of the book. Liberties were taken with the geography of Kansas.<br />In conclusion, I believe this author is a standout talent, very unique, definitely dark, and unquestionably talented. I look forward to more of her books and hope that the publisher/editor will pay a bit closer attention in her future work.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!! I can't hardly put it down.  Only wish you could purchase more lives than 3....it feels like you wait forever for just one more Life....but I love this game!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Ms. Flynn got me hooked on her writing from the very first paragraph. She has an unusual style. I won't go into a summary of the plot because that's been covered by other reviewers. I will just analyze my response to the book.<br />First of all, I liked this story better than Dark Places. To me, it felt less contrived. Sharp Objects kept me engaged until the very end. I wouldn't really call it a mystery; not sure exactly what genre this book fits into. The writing is very different, well-done. After reading &#34;Dark Places&#34;, however, it seemed like the main characters could have almost been the same person. However, that's okay because it was definitely interesting. I do wish there had been at least one or two characters who were not wretched human beings. I know everyone has a dark side, but there are some genuinely wholesome people in this world, just seems none of them made their way into this novel.<br />Ms. Flynn comes up with some really brilliant similes. I am impressed. And her descriptions are so vivid, they bring up instant mental images. She is really quite talented in this regard.<br />The characters aren't really likeable, but then, there is no rule that says books have to give us likeable characters.<br />I had to give this 4 stars. Why? Because I simply got caught up in the book and kept turning pages. I look forward to reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; someday.<br />This is not a happy story, but I found it compelling. I think the author did a great job on it and hope she branches out in her future work, doesn't get stuck in this exact same type of book. I'd like to see how she handles some other genres.

B008M721MS|1.0|This app does not work outside of the United States on Kindle Fire. I tried it at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam recently using the Wifi connection that is freely available. Every other app on my Kindle Fire HD recognized the fact that my Kindle was connected by Skype didn't. So it was totally useless to me. I'm going to uninstall it as I sure don't need something that doesn't work.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I'm not sure why all the negative review.  Sure there are few flaws with the story, particularly where did the genesis ship come from?  But the scenes of clark kent with his father (played by Kevin Costner) are great.  Those scenes play on underlying tones of prejudice and discrimination in the world.  And I really liked the emotions between adolescent Clark and his father.
B004XQO8VO|5.0|I used to own this on VHS and had to buy a Blu-ray copy.  It's a fun Sci-Fi movie for your collection.
055338595X|2.0|I waited for a good year for this book to come out.  My reasoning is Martin was named as the Tolkien of our time which is a funny review for his writing.  Which leads me to the other books in his series that we purchased  WALMART.  The other four books we own are normal height for a paper back around six inches.  I had the opportunity to purchase the hard cover for about the same amount that I paid for the paper back from you because I got the faster shipping to have it delivered on the release date as a surprise for my fianc&eacute;, who has been very upset with the delays in printing for the paperback version.  One on the main reasons we didn't buy the hardcover was that it was expensive but more important to me was the fact that we had all the others in paper back and I did not want one book that was hardcover and bigger than rest.  After purchasing the paperback version from you imagine my surprise at the finding out the paper back version you sold me was the size of a hardcover.  There was no indication of that when I searched for it on your site.  Furthermore I spent close to 30.00 dollars to get the book here as a surprise and fast when I could Have waited one day and bought it at walmart for around 9 dollars and it would have been the same size as all the rest.  I am disappointed with the purchase for those reasons.  delivery and ease of use for your site was good,  the book arrived on time for the schedule you gave.  We are even glad to be able to finally read the book to hopefully bring closure to a series that is hyped way more than it is good.  Alas there are more books to come in the near future so we will have more books to buy.<br />Merritt
B00GLX0Z8C|1.0|Stupid movie with a dumb premise.  Language and innuendo / sexual content included to try to make it funny (?)<br />Very sorry I spent the $5 to rent it.  Sad for Jennifer Anniston that she stooped this low to make this garbage.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Only a very recent fan to the series, but found this to be quite good for the short running time. Don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say that if you've ever enjoyed watching either the classic series or the current series, you'll want to see this.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|NO SPOILERS!<br /><br />It isn't often that a sequel outdoes it's predecessor in nearly every way, but The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, does just that. Granted, sequels have the benefit of not having to establish the world and characters, but that's what makes Catching Fire so unique. While the world is setup, as are the core set of characters, the story still leaves so much to be explored, as well as introduce wonderful new characters.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' novel increases the size and scope of Panem as well as the dramatic events bubbling under the surface in the districts. Director Francis Lawrence steps in for Catching Fire (and the two sequels, Mockingjay Parts 1 & 2), and does an extraordinary job. The movie never feels rushed, or too slow, and takes its time to build the tension. Panem now feels huge, and more of the Capitol is explored. Coming off the success of the first film, you can clearly see that the nearly doubled budget ($140 million) was used to it's full extent (sets, costumes, visual effects, special effects).<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss (no surprise there) and there are a few key scenes where Lawrence allows her eyes to speak volumes of emotions. The supporting cast in this film gets a major step up as well thanks to the help of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffery Wright and expanded roles for Elizabeth Banks and Donald Sutherland. Donald Sutherland in particular stands out as President Snow. Snow fumes hate and anger every time he is on screen, but Sutherland buries it and portrays it just through intense stares and devious smiles. While Hoffman's role as Plutarch Heavensbee isn't as fleshed out as much as it should have been, it's established that he's smart, cunning and strategic. Snow trusts him and that's all the power he needs.<br /><br />Visually, Catching Fire is a big improvement over The Hunger Games. Threats in the arena looks significantly more real than in the original (I'm thinking of the bad CGI mutts). The CGI is much improved and the sets and visual effects are just as impressive. The new arena is beautiful (filmed on Oahu) and the threats are very real. The practical sets for the arena, as well as natural landscape give the film a real sense of danger and immerse the audience into a world that feels authentic.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, the pacing is nearly perfect. Slowly building the shrouded tension in the outlining districts, amping-up the consequences for each character and demonstrating that under Snow's hate, no one is safe. By the time the film reaches the climax, the audience is gripped to their seats and reacting to each dramatic event in real time with the characters. Simply put, Catching Fire is high on the list of my favorite films for the year.<br /><br />*Note for parents: It's as violent as expected and definitely not recommended for very young kids (of which there were quite a few in my audience), but the violence mostly takes place off screen or is perceived.he CGI is much improved and the sets and visual effects are just as impressive.

B00E5N8E6K|5.0|Awesome! Excellent! I saw this in the theater and it is just as good at home. I love that they added all kinds of bonus features to the DVD that you didn't see on the movie screen. You get to see them perform as their alter ego , Dead Flatbird and I enjoy this very much then again I'm very partial to Def Leppard! I highly recommend if you are a Def Leppard fan.

B00CW6OENY|5.0|Its hard to make a popular character into a movie.  Obviously Tom Cruise is not Reacher.  But whether or not you are a Lee Child fan, the movie is worth watching for a couple of reasons.<br />Tom Cruse does a good job of creating his character.  He is believable.  He makes the most of the twists in the plot that make it so interesting.  I would watch a sequel starring him.<br /><br />Rosamund Pike does a superlative job.  She is obviously fascinated and replused by Cruze.  In fact, the whole ensemble made it work.<br /><br />Except for a gratuitous car chase and fist fight, you could kind of believe it, about like the book.<br /><br />It's even worth watching more than once.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Love the book because it is a second look into Ford County Miss and real life in a small country town.  If you loved A Time to Kill you will love this one also.  I can't wait for his next book.
B00BWQW73E|4.0|There are some factual inaccuracies and the author over embellishes in prose to ratchet up the drama of certain events. That all aside, the book reads well and will offer any reader who wants to understand Amazon's culture and success a great starting point. In the end, I happen to agree with Jeff Bezos remarks that this story is too early to tell. While a lot of Amazon's core businesses have matured, the next set of new business lines in its portfolio have barely started and in some ways, the company hasn't even begun Day 1.

The characters, while doing some awful things, seem to relish their roles, while no one in the US version seems to be having fun. The plot is different enough to make both worthwhile.  Note that the subsequent seasons have different names, but the plot follows.  They do all show up if you search \\"house of Cards\\". Just look for Ian Richardson, the lead actor.  Subsequent seasons are titled \\"Playing the King\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\".

B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's been several years (books) since John Grisham has held my attention and interest in one of his books to this level.  I couldn't figure out whether he wasn't writing as well as he had before, or if I was just sick of his anti-death penalty, anti-pharmaceutical company rants.  This books definitely redeems him.  Keeps you hooked from the very beginning - and just when you think you've got it all figured out.....definitely buy this and enjoy John Grisham again!

B00BD99JMW|4.0|I'm not going to tell you what happens in the book, because I think you should read it yourself.  Instead, I'll tell you what I liked and what I didn't.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />  -My favorite characters were back:  Tris, Four, Christina, Johanna, Cara, Uriah, Zeke.<br />  -My two favorite characters to hate were back:  Peter and Marcus<br />  -Nobody in these books is perfect or perfectly evil; they're all a mixture of varying degrees.  I think this is one of the main<br />  reasons the characters felt so real to me.  Pretty much everyone makes a huge mistake at some point.<br />  -There are a couple of plot surprises along the way.  I frequently get tired of knowing what's coming.<br />  -The ending.  I know a lot of people are complaining, but first of all, I didn't expect it, and second of all, it was different.  I cried<br />  and then I grieved.  But I grieved with the remaining characters, which made it seem real.  In fact, the end is what made the<br />  book good for me.<br />  -I liked what Tris and Four learned about love, not just romantic love, but especially familial love.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />  -There's an awful lot of traveling from place to place in this book and I got bored with that.<br />  -I don't like switching perspectives.  While I enjoyed the short stories from Four's perspective, I much prefer Tris' perspective for<br />  the purposes of telling this story.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This was a great follow-up book to Time To Kill.  Completely different story - a lot of tie ins. It certainly keeps you turning the pages to find out the real truth behind it all. Grisham is still a masterful story teller.  Read it - you'll enjoy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham knows the South.  In Sycamore Row he once again explores racial relations in rural Mississippi.  He takes you on a journey with some memorable characters and makes you look in the mirror and face your own prejudices and beliefs.  With his words he brings to life attitudes and actions of people who are shaped by their culture but look within themselves to find the humanity.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Transformers, Iron Man, and Star Trek all mixed up into one movie. BAD ASS! One of the best super hero movies ever and I can't wait to see it again. Great acting and effects.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Tense and well written.  Appealing characters in unusual German wartime setting. Good narrative balance yes  yes, yes.  Read this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At the surface, this book is a simple story of survival in Nazi Germany, but the Words and Language used to convey the story make this a brilliant, extraordinary, and poignant novel showcasing the power and transformative nature of language.  Making this book into a movie is just wrong. READ IT and use your mind to take you on a journey that images on a screen will never be able to match.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've seen some of John Green's YouTube videos, and at first I thought his Author's Note was some sort of tongue-in-cheek extra but I quickly realized this wasn't any sort of fictionalized version of his life.<br /><br />I didn't now anything about this novel except that it's going to be a movie starring comedian Mike Birbiglia. It was thanks to a tweet of Birbigs's that I downloaded this and I'm so glad I did. No clue how the film'll turn out but the novel is amazing. Cliché as it sounds, it made me laugh. It made me cry. It was a super quick read and I'm so glad Birbigs was cast in this so I had a chance to read it sooner rather than later.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Love, love,loved this book! I had recently turned to yoga myself, and was reminded that this boom exists and immediately knew I had to read it! I suffer from anxiety issues and am at a bit of a spiritual/religious crossroads and this book has kind of become my &#34;holy grail&#34;, no pun intended. I fully intend on reading the rest of her books!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|It's just as great as the desktop version! i found no problems in it. the game ran smoothly, & the levels did get harder & harder
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is really good I can finally search my own song like roar Katy  perry or Hollywood undead this is the best I recommend it to everyone. Thumbs up and 5 stats
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally awesome game! the minions were so cute, & it gave you multiple scenes that you could race through. Totally fun & worth it
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Sooooo much fun. Don't need energy and easy to level up! Great graphics too!  Easy to catch on and one touch action settings. Pulls you in
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun, & works just great on the Kindle! it wors smoothly, & constantly giving fun challenges. i really like it
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|There is way more stuff to do in this game it is the best on the app store. I have this on my computer and Xbox now it is pocket addition. Simply the best.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a great version of this game. I was hooked from the start. I haven't been able to put it down.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Easy way to spend a few minutes from your day. It's nice not to need others to play. I like that it's separate from the Facebook, great stand alone.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is my review. I consider more words in definitions for more information. I like it because it gives you information of a lot of words.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a wonderful page turner. This book has helped me through much of my recuperation from surgery. Suspenseful, thoughtful, and right. These are adjectives that describe this book. And Seth Hubbard, it was the right thing to do!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|thanks for getting it on my kindle. I didn't get to play for a long time because there was no kindle app and now I can waste my time freely. gotta love candy crush
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I am a big Grisham fan, but I found Sycamore Row was not his best work.  I found the plot very predictable.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Alan Jackson's smooth deep voice and the fiddle and banjo licks are spot on. This album is a great addition to my collection.
B00FXMECS6|3.0|The plot was thin, the characters seemed burned out on the concept.  They just weren't very enthusiastic or at least they didn't seem like it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Older version of this type of game. It's just ok. Nothing great. Good time killer for brainless nights. Would recommend newer version.
0812993292|5.0|So wonderfully, wonderfully written.  Everyone will find a bit of themselves in Harold...he is everyman.  Great story and so intuitive in regard to human nature.  This book sets itself apart, not your run of the mill reading material.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's puzzling yet hooks you early on.  Even when you find yourself stuck on a level, you get mad at yourself, not the game!
B008JFUPOY|5.0|We watch this movie 1-2 times a day! Yes I know.  You would think I would get tired of it but I really enjoy it.  But most importantly, my boys (ages 3yr & 20mo) absolutely LOVE this movie, hence the daily viewing. When I ask them what they want to watch, 8 times out of 10 its &#34;Monsters DVD&#34;!!  I bought this one because I wanted to make sure everyone had a copy to keep them entertained when needed, grandma, great grandparents and us, the digital copy is great when we're on the go and I need to keep them entertained, ie grocery shopping.  EXCELLENT choice!!!
B00E5N8DGG|4.0|Very high quality and good editing. It's good to listen to tracks the guys from Sheffield didn't play live since 30 or something years. Joe's voice changed a lot during these  years so songs like \\"Stagefright\\" or \\"Run Riot\\" sounded forced in its vocals.<br />The whole Side 1 of \\"High 'n' Dry\\", and \\"Rock Brigade\\" are the highlights of this Blu-Ray.<br />A must have for us Def Leppard fans competing directly with \\"In The Round In Your Face\\".
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|My KIDS loved this movie! I thought it was cute, but what I think doesn't really matter, Mom was not the intended target.  I have 2 boys, ages 3yrs & 20mo, they were so engrossed, and stayed quiet for the entire thing! Which by the way is AMAZING.  It is one of their new favorites.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|The simple, predictable story line is bolstered by the sometimes witty dialogues.  I wish Ms Sparks would ignore the sex and focus her burgeoning talent on greater plot development and more conversation.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Controls and menus take a while to get used to but all in all its a great port. Local wiFi Multiplayer works across kindle iOS and android platforms
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A friend was playing it I liked it I downloaded it...challenging and interesting....I had some fun.  Requires a little bit of thinking and some require lots of thinking...
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book!! Really wish I want forced into entering this review just to turn the page. 19 words or more
0399255370|5.0|Such a fun book ... and very creative premise.  The illustrations are great and the &#34;letters&#34; so clever. I love this book!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is fun. I do wish that there was not so much that you have to buy but it's fun all the same.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|It's funny and cute.  A different way to explain what goes on after one passes on.  We watch it all the time.  I even have it on my laptop and watch it whenever I need a good laugh.
B00G4SS24I|5.0|*My review was originally posted on joursdemusique.tumblr.com*<br /><br />  Sky Ferreira’s “Night Time, My Time&#34; is an album that I wasn’t really looking forward to, as I’m not a big fan of pop music and I normally just bash people when they recommend me pop music, but one night, I stumbled upon Sky Ferreira’s single &#34;Everything is Embarrassing”, which I fell in love with as I heard the drum machine kicked in and at that moment, I felt as if I was on the set of a John Hughes movie and I was in love with the song. I’ve been waiting for her debut album to release ever since and I have to say, I wasn’t expecting this album to surpass my expectations, but it did and I love it.<br /><br />  The album starts off with the track “Boys”, which to me, is the perfect track to open up this album with, as it displays all of the sounds that are presented in the album and I believe with this song, you can tell if you’re going to either love or hate this album.  After the intro, the album presents itself as a grungy pop album, as it takes inspiration from what the indie music scene as showed off in the past years and well, I believe that “Night Time, My Time&#34; is better than anything that is part of the indie music scene. I’m not going to go into too much detail, but I’m not the biggest fan of &#34;indie&#34; music and I think that most of it sounds the same, but Sky Ferreira is able make the &#34;indie sound&#34; actually sound diverse here and each song feels different from the rest of the other songs. Speaking of diverse songs, there are two songs on here that totally sound as if they’re ripped from a Cyndi Lauper album and those are &#34;24 Hours&#34; and &#34;I Will”, which are actually two of my favorite songs presented on the album, as I am a big fan of 80’s music and these two tracks really do take a 180 degree turn from the rest of the album, though the rest of the album holds up to these songs as well, but if you’re a fan of80’s pop music like I am, “24 Hours&#34; and &#34;I Will&#34; are the two tracks that you’ll want to look out for.<br /><br />  I really don’t have much to write about this album, as I love everything about it (though I do wish it would get a physical release) and you can hear that Sky Ferreira put her heart into this album by telling the listeners all of the pain she has been throughout her whole life (which is shown visually by the album cover) and I think with the closer track (which is named after the album), she ends the album on a positive note and she is ready to move on with her life, just as the listeners are ready to hear about the next step in her life. The album doesn’t try to make you care about Sky Ferreira’s troubled past, but you do end up caring about it, as each song is a tale of another chapter in Sky’s life and she is able to tell the listener her story on a unfamiliar road for pop music and believe me when I say this, that is what makes this album so special. The album is filled with spirit and that’s what makes music so special, so I do suggest that you don’t let this album be ignored, as it’s a hidden gem in an excellent year of music.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|It's a too bad, sad that it's the end of Iron Man but it's run it course.  It has it's funny moments and of course the same kind of humor at in all the other Iron Man movies.  I really like it and I have it on my laptop to watch when I'm between shifts
B003O86FMW|3.0|good read so far. interesting but i like the movie must better. im more of a visual person. ! great read once again
B00BQ4NLC8|3.0|I really me joyed this book. All the characters are flawed, and in their flaws are thus more &#34;human&#34; than is sometimes the case in literature.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun. It's good for kids and adults who want to  take care of horses but can't or don't want to take care of horses.<br /><br />P.S. I'm just doing this to get gems.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very fun and easy version to play. Tiles are easy to read and gameplay is seamless. Would recommend to anyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I think that this game is awesome and if you have not played then I recommend that you should. Iron Man 3 Is one of the best games that I have played.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like how you get to explore  and get to see different things in the game and I think that is really cool.
B00FLNQBTK|4.0|I actually went into this thinking I would probably be disappointing, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Predictable acting from Aniston and Sudeikis, but it works great with the kids (some great performances from all the supporting staff).  Sudeikis' trademark cynical and sarcastic humor really pops in this one as a result.  Story line?  A new twist on the cliche drug dealer chase theme, but that's what it's supposed to be.<br /><br />I'm picky...don't listen to the haters on this one.  Perfect movie for a family movie night :-)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love the graphics and the gameplay. I like how it gets more challenging  when you progress through the game, but it's never too hard to play. This is for all ages except for the blood and all of that.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A real page turner that will hold your interest.  It proves that a woman CAN change a man!  With love anything is possible.
B007V65R54|5.0|Very well done.  Bayesian statistics has always seemed just not quite clear to me.  This book is worth reading for Nate Silver's explanation of that alone.  Though a small part of the book it all makes sense to me after reading it.  And has allowed me to read other books and make some useful sense of Bayes theorem.  Now I am not saying I am ready to go apply that.  But I understand in principle why it is important.  Also don't misunderstand, this isn't the key purpose of the book.  It is only a part of it and needed to understand how Nate Silver manages to make good predictions when others don't.<br /><br />His method of exposition was very good as well.  Much easier and more interesting book on the subject than you might think it would be.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|When I downloaded it, it said that I had to delete 81 megabytes of my space.Why?Just why?That is a lot of space!
1594202273|4.0|Far too much time spent on the incident at the Arkansas missile silo. No discussion of situations involving Pantex in Texas and the White Train which delivers nukes to the explosives piers at Kingsport, Bangor, and Groton. Is their record spotless. I hope so but wonder.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Great soundtrack!  Great movie!  The stars can really sing!  Let it Whip!  I did not realize at the time that Ester Dean WROTE the Rhianna song S and M, so its cool to see her sing her own version !
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I would have given it  five stars, but I think some of Tartt's descriptions got a little tedious. Could of been fifteen or twenty percent shorter. Having said that, like a lot of writers after building a great story she rushes through the climax.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|The song of the summer, I just wish they liked Stephen Colbert a bit more, although I don't see how they would have performed live anyway.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Always nice to curl up and watch hours of Star Wars.  Even the young grandsons enjoy watching the movies, and constantly want to &#34;borrow&#34; the movies.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I have several old AC adapters so the only way to make use of them with the new macbook air was to purchase this.  Annoying but it gets the job done, when buying apple its best to buy the real stuff--as knockoffs often don't work and are not reliable.
B00005ML1O|1.0|In VERY small print at the bottom it said it was a region 2 disc. So thanks for nothing. I can't even watch it.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This CD contains all of his hits, as well as some not so well-known songs.  He is a truly talented musician, and I was glad to add this CD to my collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is one of my favorite games to play on the phone yuo should get it it vafy fun and intsraning  it is cheep  to buy  i love it
B001684L0A|5.0|The key to making historical people real to us is placing the best actors and writers together. John Adams is one of, if not, the best mini-series I have ever seen. Paul Giamatti is perfect as the intensely patriotic John Adams. How wonderful to see the matter-of-fact selflessness of our Founding Fathers who gave everything for the cause of freedom. John Adams will keep you engaged and mesmerized by the intensity and accuracy of our humble beginnings. John Adams is a keeper.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|It have a new firmware that put it to USB DAC. Overall sound is very enjoy for longtime listening, no color or boomy sound.

B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a great game. I only have a problem when it freezes. I wish I would win more. Lol fun for quiet time
B00846REIS|3.0|Compared to 50 Shades, it was predictable in many ways but provided a few new twists to love and compulsion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game but there's is some ishose like it has a hole lot of ads then it is the best game ever if u Fox's the ad problem
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham kept me in suspense throughout the book.  I love the way that he writes a story.  You are always anxious for the ending, but feel sad when it ends.  Can't wait until his next book.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Great book! Easy to understand, easy to follow, direct and essential for all small business owners. I highly recommend this book.
031623480X|5.0|This is an important book, almost on a par with Uffe Ravnskov's and Malcolm Kendrick's books on the cholesterol myth, and Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride's books, the one refuting the diet-heart hypothesis and the other on \\"gut and psychology syndrome\\". The author is telling us that if we continue to eat as we are doing - living on a diet of grains and carbohydrates, we will destroy our brain and develop Alzheimer's or another form of dementia. Or we may develop diabetes (because of the carbohyrates), which in itself doubles the risk of Alzheimer's.<br /><br />We need to get rid of our bread and exchange it with butter and eggs. Saturated fats and high cholesterol are not the problem. We need to adopt a high-fat diet, including saturated fats. The author explains how our food choices can bring inflammation under control by changing the expression of our genes.<br /><br />The two biggest myths are 1) a low-fat, high carb diet is good and 2) cholesterol is bad.<br /><br />It turns out that many of us, though not suffering from celiac disease, are in fact gluten-sensitive. The author is of the opinion that this \\"represents the greatest and most under-recognized threat to humanity\\". Gluten triggers \\"not just dementia but epilepsy, headache, depression, schizophrenia, ADHD and even decreased libido\\". Gluten, and a high-carbohydrate diet, for that matter, stimulates \\"inflammatory pathways that reach the brain\\".<br /><br />Cholesterol, far from being the villain of the piece, is one of the most important players in maintaining brain health and function. \\"Study after study shows that high cholesterol reduces your risk for brain disease and increases longevity.\\" High levels of dietary fat have been proven to be the key to health and peak brain function.<br /><br />As also pointed out in the afore-mentioned books, statins are death-bringing, since they reduce your cholesterol level, and cholesterol, also LDL, the fallaciously termed \\"bad\\" cholesterol, is a critical brain nutrient, essential for the function of neurons, and plays a fundamental role as a building block of the cell membrane.<br /><br />Chapter 2 of the book is devoted to gluten's role in brain inflammation. Many people with debilitating symptoms such as migraine, bipolar disorder, uncontrollable shaking, and so on, experience great relief when eliminating gluten from their diet. The author considers gluten a modern poison.<br /><br />We now know that we can grow new neurons throughout our life. Something called BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) plays a key role in creating new neurons and protecting existing neurons. Calorie restriction is an epigenetic factor that turns on the gene for BDNF production. Also physical exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, targets the BDNF gene, reverses memory decline in the elderly and increases growth of new brain cells in the brain's memory centre.<br /><br />The consumption of ketones, found in coconut oil, gives significant improvement in cognitive function in Alzheimer's patients (see the books of Bruce Fife). Ketosis (acquiring energy from our fat cells), instead of the process whereby we acquire it from the carbohydrates and protein we eat, is a healthful condition.<br /><br />There is much valuable information in this book - life-saving information, if you follow Dr. Perlmutter's advice, that is. We are told of the power of fasting, and what fasting and ketogenic diets have in common. We are advised to take DHA capsules (DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid), reservatrol, turmeric, probiotics, coconut oil, alpha-lipoic acid and Vitamin D.<br /><br />The final chapters are devoted to \\"A new way of life, The Four-Week Plan of Action\\". The focus is on food, exercise and sleep. We are provided with meal plans and recipes.<br /><br />My only reservation is the author's apparent ignorance about the dangers of microwave ovens. He also recommends that we eat canned tomatoes, whereas the illustrious Dr. Mercola (my hero) warns us to stay well clear of these, since the acidity in tomatoes can provoke leaching of the harmful BPA (biphenol-A) in the lining of the can into the food.<br /><br />But, notwithstanding, to sum up, I would highly recommend that you read this well-written, highly informative, ground-breaking book. The information it contains is basic, essential and perhaps live-saving.l clear of these, since the acidity in tomatoes can provoke leaching of the harmful BPA (biphenol-A) in the lining of the can into the food.<br /><br />But, notwithstanding, to sum up, I would highly recommend that you read this well-written, highly informative, ground-breaking book.

B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This is game is overall stunning with great control system. Not to mention that on the Kindle Fire HDX is looks magnificent. All in all it is a great racing game for any type of gamer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Best, most awesome game found. I have been playing this game a long time on my computer and aneroid phone. Was disappointed when it was only available on the iPhone. Then when I saw it was finally available on my Kindle I couldn't wait to download it. So happy now.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had a bunch of things with unknown origins and could find no other programs that did the job.  this program really works.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME! I am so glad to finally be able to enjoy this very addictive and entertaining game on my kindle. AWESOMENESS!!!!
0671449028|5.0|Purchased this book along with Moo, Baa, La La La as a baby gift because they are favorites of my grandson.
0061122416|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite books. I purchased this one as a gift. This is my third purchase of this book and probably not the last
0694003611|5.0|Purchased the book as a Grandmother Shower book long with the 5 piece Goodnight Moon Melamine Mealtime Set.  Most children enjoy Goodnight Moon, so need a copy at Grandmother's house also. Am very happy with both purchases.
0529064847|4.0|bought for our RCIA group - they are perfect for giving out and carrying to and from class - will definitely buy again
067144901X|5.0|Purchased this book along with the Going to Bed Book as a baby gift because it is one of my grandson's favorites.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|Ok I love this game on the Pc so when I saw this for kindle I had to get it. But now here comes the bad news for me......I go to download this game because it's $1.99 but every time I go to hit the install button, I keep on getting the saying that there was an error and that I need to try again, so again and again I try and try but it keeps on giving me the ERROR. I'm not proud of this. Amazon if there is anything you could do to help me please do!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Usually I don't get apps that copy temple run but this was good if you like despicable me and like temple run or subway surfers get this app also parents need to be careful because it is so easy to buy stuff so mabey they need to make it so easy
B005I548B4|4.0|Very  good love his books will certainly buy more can' decide which one yet so I'll just keep on browsing
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found myself not wanting this book to end. I even tried to slow down my reading so I could savor the twist and turns!!
0316227706|5.0|I bought this as a coffee table book for the whole family and everyone loves it - kids and grandparents alike.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Action packed, no fluff, down and dirty shooting and fighting. Not for kids, Chuck Norris was kinda corny. Good movie.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I like the extensive detail used in Dust. And I think it's a good forward touch to return Marino to the Police.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book broke the norm, as it switched between perspectives of two characters, unlike its predecessors. This gave the book a disjointed feel from the beginning. Alas, it seemed to be an uninspired plot device lending itself to a predictable and unfulfilling end to this series. The end to the previous book of this series made me highly anticipate the release of this book, but what was built there became a wild burst of plot that went in many different directions-- none of them great enough to capture my full attention.
0307951154|3.0|Having learned that the next book &#34;Police&#34; is a continuation of this story, I decided I had to read this one.  Needless to say, I wish I hadn't.  All the violence and drugs are nothing too excessive or over the top, but, the physical pummeling that Harry takes during the book are just so over the top.  Is this guy the world's greatest masochist or does he just like being shot, stabbed, strangled, etc.<br /><br />Anyone but a TV or novel Detective (who had more than two brain cells left) would have given up and crawled into a hole (pun intended) long ago and pulled that sodden grass over his/her head.  Only psychotic writers would allow anyone to get this physically broken.  Hope the next is better.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B00006IR5S|5.0|I love all the sound tracks from the Harry Potter series. I have all 8 now. I recommend and especially to us Harry Potter fans and collectors.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|I never saw the film in theaters, so maybe I'm missing something about the grandiose-ness that doesn't translate to a TV screen.  On the other hand, I would assume that character development and plot would make that leap, and in that case, this film has none.  NONE.  I don't care about Lois, I don't care about Perry, I don't care about Zod or Clark or ANY of the characters in this film.  The performances are leaden and emotionless.  The plot isn't really undeveloped: as a reboot of the franchise, it's still a great concept.  However, the writing seems only to serve the special effects; it's as if the CGI people said &#34;Hey, here are a bunch of sweet shots!  Put some dialog in between 'em, willya?&#34;  Nope.  Splashy effects and Dolby surround sound are great, but not even THEY can completely drive a comic-book movie.  Gotta have real dialog and character development.  I'd rather watch Christopher Reeve - hell, I'd rather watch GEORVE REEVES! - in this role any day of the week.  I don't think it's the fault of the cast…it's the fault of a sheep-minded public who accepts garbage like this while they mindlessly chow down a garbage pail full of cardboard popcorn.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! The hunger games are such adventures! So excited to see the movie! Then even better read the next book! Write more hunger games Suzanne Collins! Your the girl on fire!
0062101897|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter at Christmas last year and she loved it!. It was quite beautiful, and heavy! It had to be since there was everything in it that you could possibly want to know about Harry Potter. Beautifully bound with lovely illustrations and photos in an oversize coffee table book. The only drawback is you need to sit a table to look through it due to its size and weight.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. My 7 years old grandson loves it as well. He was helping me find then clues. Just not enough levels on the free game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting, fast read.  Loved how the characters lives all intersected.  I was sorry when it ended.....wanted to know a bit more....
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love this game. Just not enough levels on the free version.  My 7 years old grandson even enjoyed it and help me play it and find the clues.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|If you're looking for a movie with more style than substance and likes to think it's smarter than it really is, this is the movie for you.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Meh. Olympus has Fallen was a lot more campy fun. This was so oddly paced and never really gelled. Waste of talented actors.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Everything bad about this movie you've heard is true.  It looks cool.  Super cool.  Too bad the story isn't as original as it pretends to be, and just feels half-baked.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Just dumb.  Really goofy re-write of the superman story and poorly acted.  I'm not a movie snob and like many of the &#34;cartoon/comic genre&#34; flics, but this one is just bad.  If you feel obligated to watch it, may want to wait for it to go to Prime, which I'd bet won't be long.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|It's about time a superman movie is taken seriously . All the other movies were more of a comedy then a great action pact movie. The bad guy is all so great . You almost hate to see him go out that way . After all he was only trying to save species. Superman was as torn as any mix race kid . That just can fit in one or another . Over all the movie is worth the rental.
B0016K40KY|2.0|This movie received excellent reviews in its time, but unfortunately, it comes across very outdated now.  We didn't even finish watching it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Amazing cant wait to the next chapter and how they tie it all together . Because it tantalize you with hints of we're aliens came from. Yet the aliens once again destroy another species leaving more questions then answers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game the minions are hilarious and the bananas are great but my favorite part is the fluffy unicorns !
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Hum... Ok what is really the danger on earth ? Cuz I didn't get it . Don't they have weapons . And why they ship looks like they gather different sail from every yacht? That's where ? Oh! Earth . Wow the animal at the end looks like a nerd candy . Ok and what was they using it for ? I'm confuse
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a nice escape from the world. Challenging yet doable with perseverance.<br />The music is complimentary not distracting. The graphics are great on my Kindle Fire HD
B00ARAO720|2.0|Another bike movie that don't make sense a waste of film and star power. Poor actor this is one of those films he will care to forget & regrets
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|I've been a STP fan since the first time I heard them.  I've always thought that their sound changed significantly between albums, and generally not in a positive way, although I always come around to the new stuff.  This did not happen with their new lineup.  I am completely blown away by this music. It is definitely STP, but its the best STP I've ever heard, period.  All my other 90's bands have degraded over time, but STP is rock solid. I can't wait until they release a new, full album.
B007BLCGNU|3.0|Very informative . It's amazing how much my history books missed out . If they would've shown me this movie when I was in high school I would've found it interesting and would've pass my social studies class .
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|Trying to get strikes and spares by maneuvering the Polar  bear keeps the game interesting. Polar bear's antics after each trip down the lane are hilarious!
B007SSDS24|2.0|The aliens looked more scare the the humans . You see they octopus selves at the end and almost want to go in the movie and beat all those who was scare at an alien which was not scary at all . If this would've happen in real . Life we would've use the aliens to power are grids .
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret has the potential to tear many lives apart. Lots of secrets, twists and turns. And karma coming back to bite you!
