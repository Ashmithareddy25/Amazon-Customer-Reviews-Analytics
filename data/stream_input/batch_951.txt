B002IVLH60|4.0|I've been a fan of Pearl Jam for a long time. They'll never reach what they did with Ten. There was just something about those songs, and most of the b-sides and soundtrack songs from those sessions. The sound, the guitar solos, Eddie's passionate vocals. They'll just never top that. Fortunately for me, they don't have to. I really liked VS, and the actual songs on Vitology were great as well. Unfortunately then came No Code, and they just weren't the same. Sure the next few albums had some great songs, but overall Eddie sounded bores, especially on Riot Act, and there were WAY too many filler songs. Then came their self titled album, and Pearl Jam seems to be back on track.     Which brings me to this one. One of my favorite things about this band, is that you can't completely know what to expect with each new album. This is the second in a row I've really enjoyed. Eddie's passion seems to be back. Sure he doesn't have the voice he did on Ten, but that's ok. He still gets points for effort.     There aren't a whole lot of songs I love, but there are quite a few I really like, and the songs together work as a whole, if that makes sense. This album has a very different fell to it, from any past PJ album. It sounds lighter.     Gonna See My Friend - 9/10 - This one's a faster paced song, for them. It's probably the heaviest song on here, or at least one of them. Definately one of my favorites on here. Nice guitars, nice vocals.     Got Some - 8/10 - Another up-tempo song. The chorus is a little better than the last song. Still a good song though.     The Fixer - 8/10 - Similar pace to the previous songs. I like the vocals in the verses. The chorus doesn't do a whole lot for me, but it serves its purpose.     Johnny Guitar - 6/10 - This pace is starting to get redundant now. That's probably part of the reduced rating for this song. Overall it's ok, just not my favorite. There's a cool guitar part in there somewhere.     Just Breathe - 9/10 - Very folky sounding acoustic song. I love this oen. The vocals are amazing. I can't quite give this a perfect rating, but in time that may change.     Amongst The Waves - 7/10 - Another slower one. It's a pretty good song, but I can't think of anything special to say about it.     Unthought Known - 6/10 - The intro reminds me of Wishlist. The vocals are good, but this song just doesn't do that much for me. Hopefully it'll grow on me.     Supersonic - 8/10 - This one's a faster song. It rocks as hard as anything on here, and I enjoy it.     Speed Of Sound - 8/10 - This one's a slower song, and different from anything I can think of Pearl Jam doing. I think this one's going to grow on me more in time.     Force Of Nature - 8/10 - This one's faster than the last song, still more of a mid-tempo song. It's pretty good, just nothing special.     The End - 7/10 - This one's another acoustic song. It's not quite as good as the other one, but it's still got its moments. I like the main riff.     Overall I find this to be a very enjoyable album, albeit a little too short. There's not a song, in the same category as Once, or Footsteps, or Inside Job, but still there's plenty to enjoy. If you're a PJ fan, then what are you waiting for? Get this album.

B00000JY1X|5.0|I only discovered the Magnetic fields a few years ago, but they have quickly become my favorite band.  Stephin Merritt is a god among men.  I don't say this lightly.  I love all kinds of music.  But the Magnetic Fields is like nothing else I have in my immense collection.  The diversity and range of the music is staggering.  But one thing I have learned in sharing their music - you either love them or hate them.  There's very little in between.  I love them.  And if you can only own one album or simply want to break in for the first time, buy this one.  But beware, it may start a massive addiction like it has me.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Super performance by the band across a great selection of vintage Nightwish songs. Tarja steals the show as always. Can't help but wonder how soon the band will re-unite.

0151013047|3.0|This is an interesting little novel about an educated Pakistani who studies at Princeton and lands a job in a lucrative management consultancy in New York. The story is told as a recollection from a Lahore cafe at dusk.<br /><br />The small boned structure of the novel gives voice to a number of contemporary themes concerning the plight of clever Pakistanis who seem to embrace the American Dream but fall out of love with their adopted country in the post September 11 malestrom. The story is thickly slathered in allegory - Erica, the wealthy New York girl, unattainable as she grieves for her deceased childhood boyfriend, represents the glittering allure of the New World. She toys with Changez, the protagonist, in a manner that brings to mind the ill fated Syyid Qutb and his experience of dance hall America in the 1960s - experiences that were in many ways the forerunner of the contemporary crisis of modern Islamic masculinity. The mix of lust and frustrated difference enforced by pretty, wealthy, miss American youth on sexually charged young men from the Middle East.<br /><br />The plot is nicely paced with enough tension to hold the reader's attention, though the style is a little too finely honed to generate the heat such themes require.<br /><br />A fine little novel, attempting to mine a rich seam of contemporary political crisis. Though perhaps it will come to be seen as more of a stalking horse for greater novels yet to come on these subjects.
B001TODCII|5.0|Awesome movie.  Fast action from the beginning.  Liam Neelson was the perfect cast for this role.  After his daughter is abducted in France, the rest of the movie is about he methodically tracks down those involved, gets more information to help him find his daughter, kills those involved and of course, ultimately gets his daughter back.  Highly recommend.
0385504225|5.0|It's clear that some of us are Dan Brown fans and some aren't. I'm a fan and thought this was better than DaVinci Code. (I also thought Angles and Demons was better than DaVinci.) I really enjoyed reading The Lost Symbol.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Immune to an infectious virus that turns kills and turns survivors into monsters, the sole survivor in New York City struggles to live a somewhat \\"normal\\" life as he valiantly struggles to find a cure.  When he does, he must make a choice between saving himself and saving the world.
0312427646|5.0|This book was a delight.  As a fan of the Royal Family and most especially the Queen.  The book brought to life the life of the Queen and how her Government tries to hold her close to the vest to even restrict her level of intelligence to prevent her from raising the level of intimidation she causes.  It is also sad to me that she has no one close to her to express herself and to tell her amazing story.  When someone like Norman gets close the government removes them to increase their power.  What I liked was that the book showed a side of a woman who has been so removed from the world that if the opportunity was created for her to gain insight to \\"normal\\" life, she would not hesitate to experience it.  The book is very real by the examples of both The Queen and her Consort sneeking out at night to just have a night together with \\"common folks\\".  Also with the push to place William on the throne as the Queen approaches her 60th year there, it is feasible that she could write a book about her amazing life her point of view.<br /><br />The book immediatly grips you and tugs at the strings of your heart for the sacrifices the Queen makes in her position.  It also grabs at her fiestiness and awareness of her role she is an expert and far smater than she is given credit.  Mr Bennett grabs all of the splendor and power of being a royal as well as its isolation, and how something as simple as a book can open a world undiscovered by the reader and feed the mind with lives yet unrealized.  The book is a beautiful testament to the joy of reading from Royal to serf and the doors that are unlocked through books.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|It is surprising to see the number of naysayers among the reviews of this filmed version of Puccini's beloved LA BOHEME singling out the very elements that allow stage works to become transferred to the film medium (lip syncing, closeups of cinematic details, uses of both black and white and color, etc).  What seems to be overlooked is this chance to see the two leading interpreters of this opera in wide distribution for those who cannot see them in person. As a film this version by Robert Dornhelm works wonders with the intentions of Puccini's bohemian lovers living on little but their love of the arts and for life in the Parisian garrets in the snowy wintertime.  He introduces moments of Paris in the snow in black and white, much like old animated daguerreotype, before the brief overture begins and keeps the flavor of the action moving seamlessly while adding additional elements of information using the same format.  He offers some visual information about the passion of the lovers that allows him to reference these moments later in the story when memory brings them forward.  All of this makes the opera more than opera: these elements make this a fine movie.<br /><br />But the true pleasure of this film is the glorious singing and acting of Rolando Villaz&oacute;n and Anna Netrebko as the lovers.  They are gorgeous to look at, magnificent in their vocal interpretations, and extraordinary actors.  And close behind them is the camaraderie of the entire cast, especially Nicole Cabell as Musetta, George Von Bergen as Marcello (vocal by Boaz Daniel), Adrian Er&ouml;d as an exceptional Schaunard (vocal by St&eacute;phane Degout), and Vitalij Kowaljow as Colline.  The involvement in the story is solid and wholly believable and this is a cast of 'minor characters' whose presence is constantly felt and appreciated. Bertrand de Billy conducts with a sure hand.  In short if anyone can watch this version of LA BOHEME with a dry eye, then perhaps they are not giving the power of Puccini a chance to be extended into the cinematic techniques required of really excellent filmmaking.  Grady Harp, December 09e extended into the cinematic techniques required of really excellent filmmaking.  Grady Harp, December 09
B001C1066E|5.0|My grandson is in first grade. The school asked that the kids bring their lunch money in a small coin purse. I was looking for something that would be cute, suitable for a boy, and not too expensive. This fit the bill. I can't really comment on the quality as they live in another state and I had it sent directly to them. However, my daughter said it is really cute and my grandson just loves it!

044024238X|3.0|Took me a bit longer to read this book than some of the other books I have read recently, simply because when I put it down I didn't have the urge to pick it back up. The book was around 370 pages and it wasn't until I was 1/2 way into it that it became interesting. But I will give it 3 stars out of 5 because with a plot like this (lawyer, housekeeper, men, scandal, etc), it took a while for SK to lay out the background for the character and the story. Once it was developed it became more interesting. I would say it is a 'good' book, however in my opinion it wasn't an 'excellent' book because the novel seemed to lack oomph. I too once had a booming career, yet have since changed to a more laid-back lifestyle (and, like the main character, I'm also trying to learn how to cook!), so I can relate to her. But I felt the author could have used more imagination and dug deeper in order to develop metaphors and stronger meanings. Being from the States, I also found it a tad difficult to understand some of the terminology (\\"hoovering,\\" for example).

Sure, some of the things the 3 main characters do may be a bit unrealistic but I was laughing the whole way through it and will be handing it off to one of my friends to read.
B0026P3G12|2.0|After watching the initial video of Susan Boyle, my expectations were much greater than the album provided. The only cut I truly like is the title cut of the album. Her Inspirational choices were not to my liking, they were simplified versions as though it was too hard to remember the words??? I wish her all the luck in the world. She's a very deserving sweet lady, but I don't see that a second album is in her future.
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|Susan Boyle is an extraordinary development in the music world.  This album is a natural follow up to one of the most amazing events ever witnessed in a talent show.  Who will ever forget the faces of the judges in the British rendition of American Idol, when she began singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and the mixture of awe, shame and joy in their reactions.  This album is a pure joy and reflects Susan's deep faith Christian faith.  I am so glad that Simon didn't attempt to change the real Susan and let her be herself.  I highly recommend this album to Amazon customers.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Great read, very well woven story that keeps you wondering & guessing from page to page. looking forward to reading the second book but already feeling disappointed that there are only three books from this author, such a shame that he is not around to see the success that is \\"The Girl\\"
0553278223|5.0|The exploration and colonization of Mars by humans is told alongside the depopulation and extinction of Martians in this collection of coordinated short stories by master sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury.  The Martian Chronicles will not be remembered in the annuals of sci-fi writing for amazing new technologies, weapons, aliens, or bravery.  It will be remembered for the desperation of the Martians to preserve themselves, the classic (on Earth) destruction of native peoples because of introduced diseases (and remember [[ASIN:1590171586 The War of the Worlds]]?), the arrogant aggressiveness and moral poverty of the stewards of Earth, and the classic \\"history as written by the victors\\" ending.<br /><br />It's enough to get one addicted to sci-fi, even though these stories date from half a century ago.<br /><br />I also have an old cassette of [[ASIN:B000M9NE5C Leonard Nimoy]] reading \\"Usher II\\" and \\"There will come soft rains.\\"  These stories, and the others, are haunting, and full of visions of mind control issues and future outcomes fueled by the Cold War.<br /><br />For the serious sci-fi fan, this is an important work.
078513915X|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I may be freak among girls.  I LOVE Pride and Prejudice and I love comic books.  This graphic novel was perfect for me and for many other people I am sure.<br /><br />The story is abridged nicely.  The classic lines that we all remembered reading are there.  The illustrations are quite lovely.  The Bennet sisters are flat out hot in this version.  Even Mary is far more attractive than your normal run-of-the-mill gal.  There were a few times when I did get confused on which Bennet sister I was actually looking at though.  And Bingley's hair changed from red to blonde every once in awhile.  This are all easily forgivable however.<br /><br />If you are a Pride and Prejudice fan you really should check this graphic novel out.  If you havent read the novel and were interested in the story this might be a good jumping off point.<br /><br />The only question I have is why did it take Marvel so long to think about making this?  Younger readers will easily get drawn into more classics if they are presented in this way.  Keep on making them!
0395631246|5.0|I was introduced to this book in a college course based on negotiation. Upon reading and getting more in-depth into the course, I had only wish that this book had been introduced to me in high school rather than College. The authors tackles what is a difficult subject for many into a easily readable text. Other reviews have cited that this book isn't the end all of books; I do not purport that was the authors intent in writing the book. As an introductory into the subject of negotiation, it does provide a well-round approach to the subject from a novice/neophyte. Even if someone wants to get better at negotiation without becoming a master, I think this is a great book to suggest.

0143036742|5.0|A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian is not a very promising title for a novel, but it does grab your attention, I'll give it that. I had passed this book up in bookstores and online several times in the past few years, but finally my curiosity got the best of me when I found it at a University Womens Ass'n book sale last year. And during Christmas week I finally picked it up and read it. What a wonderful book this is! I can easily understand why it has won prizes and been translated into over twenty languages. Because, although this is ostensibly a book about a Ukrainian immigrant family living in England, and about an octogenarian widower who falls for a thirty-something stacked blonde bombshell, and about a festering sibling rivalry between the man's two grown daughters, and about British bureaucracy and ... Well, enough, I suppose. The truth is, this is a wonderfully executed book about human nature itself. Nikolay, Valentina, Vera and Nadezhda are all characters who will resonate for a long time after you've finished reading this book. What starts out to be simply funny and quaint, turns gradually into something deeper and much darker. Family secrets long kept begin to bubble to the surface, as the narrator/protagonist Nadya begins to learn more and more of her family's pre-war and wartime history - unhappy and often brutal stories that her parents and her sister Vera (ten years older than Nadya) have kept from her. There is much here that will make you laugh, certainly. But there is even more here that will make you think about what the human animal is capable of in every respect. Most of all you will learn about what it means to be a survivor, as does Nadya, the post-war baby whose chosen name represented hope for a better future. This is a terrific book. I recommend it highly. - Tim Bazzett, author of SOLDIER BOY: AT PLAY IN THE ASA

I'm still not a big fan of sitcoms and I doubt if I'll be adding many to my viewing roster in the future, but this is the big exception.  I think the show would have been greatly improved if they had tweaked it only slightly.  I know they have tied the show to stage sets to keep the budget down.  And the format means that the lack of visual experimentation means short set ups and keeps costs down.  The point is, I detest the genre, but I still like HIMYM.  Which I think speaks volumes for the quality of the show.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|This Blu-ray version is wonderful.  Led Z at the top of their game, HD, great sound.  Loved every minute.
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|Every winter during the holiday hiatus when there are no new episodes being broadcast of any of my shows, I always try to knock off two or three shows that I've not seen but have had some curiosity about.  Now, I detest sitcoms.  Hate, hate, hate!  I loathe laugh tracks.  I consider them toxic and vile and completely destructive.  And in most cases I hate how stilted the sets are and how unimaginative the camera work is (no sitcom in the history of TV has had interesting camerawork, and I say that even though Karl Freund, one of the great geniuses in the history of cinematography, directed many episodes of I LOVE LUCY).  I watch a lot of TV, but I avoid sitcoms like I avoid infectious diseases.  I love comedy, mind you.  I love 30 ROCK, PARTY DOWN, THE OFFICE, and MODERN FAMILY, all of them comedies and none of them sitcoms, and all among my favorite shows.<br /><br />So why did I try HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER?  Mainly it was because I'd seen a number of TV critics who stated that it was a good show despite being a sitcom.  Part of it was Alyson Hannigan.  BUFFY is my all time favorite show and if you love BUFFY you love Willow.  Interestingly, I don't know a single person who watches the show (at least to my knowledge) and I pretty much decided to give it a shot despite the whole sitcom thing.  Surprisingly, I liked it.  A lot.  Not as much as 30 ROCK and PARTY DOWN and THE OFFICE and definitely not MODERN FAMILY (which might be the best new comedy since ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT), but it was still quite good, with an enormously likable small group of characters.  The laugh track is indeed irritating and, of course, completely unnecessary.  And what is more, it isn't a pure sitcom.  It does a surprising amount out-of-the-studio shooting (though on what anyone who is a serious fan of TV will recognize as the Warner Brothers urban lot, which has been used in hundreds of movies and TV series).  The street shots are on the precise same sets that were used for Metropolis in THE ADVENTURES OF LOIS AND CLARK and New Haven in THE GILMORE GIRLS and the area around the Pie Hole in PUSHING DAISIES.  Plus there are a surprising number of green screen shots.  So the show avoids the static feel that most three camera sitcoms have.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|With a unique title slapped across it's glossy face, \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\" is the sixth movie in the world of adapting the wildly popular book series into blockbusters. I originally saw it in theaters (in a special, chaotic midnight showing, in fact, which will be the first and last one I attend) and thought I loved it. But when I recently purchased it, upon seeing it released into DVD format, and re-watched it, I fluttered down from my cloud and realized it was, sadly, less than perfect.    Being a movie of beautiful cinematography and amazing computer graphics, it is far from being a fail. Do not listen to the parts of the audience who wailed about it being too different from the book- it's called an \\"adaption\\", not \\"an exact replica of the popular book\\" for a reason- it is indeed a good movie. And yet I felt it didn't succeed as well as I expected it to, as much as a HP movie should have.    The movie has some definite slow and dry parts; parts that I admit I fast-forwarded through, since my memories from the silver screening in July aren't frayed yet. There was a bit too much dialog; it ran a bit too long; some sequences were, admittedly, twisted a bit too drastically from the book. Not exactly in a bad way, but in a weird way.    For example, they destroy the Weasley's home in this movie. What?! I was baffled as I saw it collapse before me- well, on the screen before me. And the ending, where instead of Dumbledore freezing Harry motionless, Harry is left capable of stopping Draco and Snape, yet stands below and does quite nothing.     But I decided against complaining, because it is still a winning movie. It has some clever, funny parts- parts that are certainly aimed towards it's chunk of the audience that are teens and young adults- and I love how dark it has gotten. It was filmed grainer, too, and I love the feel it shimmers towards the audience. The actors all did well, I thought, and overall, I found myself shutting off the DVD player with a refreshed sense of easiness, yet not completely satisified.    So as I wrap up my review, I think I can easily say this- not the best Harry Potter movie out there, but a far cry from the worst. A very good one to buy, but perhaps not golden enough to slip the brittle words \\"classic\\" and \\"beloved\\" over it's cover.
B001HN697M|3.0|I've seen all three of the Underworld movies. I own the first and just received the 3rd. I like them all, but like this one the best. They are a must for Vampire and werewolf fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is an on-the-edge-of -your- seat, non-stop action novel that will glue your eyes to your pages. Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job by making a movie in your head.  If you like this book, you will love Catching Fire.
B001GM0GNC|5.0|I'm so glad this concert came out on DVD!  I saw them LIVE during this tour and was blown away!  This is a great momento!
B0026P3G12|5.0|What an awesome cd. so inspiring. A voice from an unknown angel.She has proven the unknown angel can become an inspiring person. This CD proves her talents and hope many more are produced by her.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|this is by far the best book i've ever read!  from the moment i read the first page i was hocked!  its exiting,addictive,some romance but nothing bad,and it keeps you on edge at all times!!  i love this book!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|i love cassandra clare's series, the mortal instruments. in city of ashes, the series just getting better. full of suspence and twists, this book is one of my favorites. i highly recomend it!
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Michael has another wonderful listening album with this one!  I just love his easygoing style of singing!
B0021L8UPS|4.0|December 25th, 2009<br /><br />So many Hollywood movies have crappy ratings here. And some of them definitely deserve them.<br /><br />But this movie was goooood.<br /><br />Twisted. Evil. Exciting. Funny. Kept you on the edge at times.<br /><br />It's also suspenseful.<br /><br />I can't really say much without giving the whole movie away but I'll just say it's about an orphan girl who gets adopted by a decent, if slightly damaged family. Typical really. She's very smart and seemingly well-mannered. But soon enough they find out she has some issues. And she does some things.<br /><br />Like I said,  I don't wanna give this one away but it's definitely a suspenseful movie and has a few twists and turns.<br /><br />This one is definitely recommended.<br /><br />4 stars.
055350259X|5.0|Bill Bryson gave an enlightening history and geography lesson on Australia. My family and I who were born in Australia have seen many of the locations Bill has spoken of. His sense of humor captures the real Australian attitude on life. His presentation on Australian history taught us things we didn't know and certainly were not taught in school. Despite the in depth description of the people, the attitudes, the dangers, the vastness, and the challenges written in his book, the audio version is even funnier and interesting with his feelings demonstrated with humor in his voice. Intoxicated or sober Bill was true to how Australia is and lives...well done.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|My all time favorite DVD - loved it.  Amazon has everything I'm looking for - thank you!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Just a note to say how much I have enjoyed this purchase.  I bought the set for my 16 yr old musician son.  I have been listening with him and realized that the music i'm hearing is tremendously better than when I heard originally (when it came out).    I have heard things that I couldn't hear through those 2\\" dashboard speakers way back when.    So, enjoy.    jerry
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's  CD has been playing since I received it.  The CD is great.
B001O2S7XA|3.0|The track itself is fairly easy to put together and when it's done, you have an initial drop where you start your car.  It goes down into an accelerator that pushes the car fast enough to go up the big loop, then into a u-turn curve and heads back down to the starting point again to do it all over again.  That's it.  You can add a variety twist to this by adding a second or third car and seeing how long it will take before they crash.  This is fun to watch as an adult, but it gets old after 5 or 10 minutes.  The kids enjoy it, but after playing 2 or 3 times, it gets old for them as well and this is with a 7 year old and a 6 year old.    The construction is OK.  The supports for the loop hold it well enough to keep to going, but it does shake alot.  Overall, it works as advertised and I would suggest this for the under 7 crowd.
0385504225|1.0|I agree with some of the more detailed descriptions so I will keep this short. I loved the Da Vinci code, I found Angels and Demons terrifying and gripping. Deception Point was pretty good too. I was absolutely disappointed in this book.  The characters didn't make sense and you can't connect with them.  It read like a stilted movie script.  The ultimate meanings of the symbols was a huge let down.  It read like a stilted movie script.  The ending was weird and awkward.  It read like a stilted movie script!  I almost didn't finish Angels and Demons because the evilness was so overwhelming.  I almost didn't finish this one because it was boring.  I am really glad I borrowed this from the library.
B000JQUKKU|2.0|I bought this but it is some \\"prose\\" edition and not the original book.  There is no \\"page 1\\" that I oculd find.  Very odd. Admittedly I am new to Kindle but all the other books come up just fine...
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought three of these CDs -- two for gifts and one for myself.  Everyone gifted LOVED the CD.  The mix of different types of songs on this particular CD has something for everyone.  Her talent is incredible.  Her vocal interpretations fit with each song and showed the wide range of sound she can produce.  I'm waiting for the next album.  Susan, we love ya.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a wonderful piece of work which has inspired great American films from The Magnificent Seven to A Bug's Life. The new remastered version is a much better copy than previous versions.
B002M27QQK|5.0|Can I start by saying how refreshing it is to see an artist actually release a special edition that really is a SPECIAL EDITION?!  I can't stand it when artists release albums calling it \\"special edition\\" and you can get the same thing 5 years from now at any store.  This truly is a Collectors item for any Lady Gaga fan. I'm so glad I preordered mine before they stopped being manufactured.  The book is beautiful and it gives you an intimate look into Lady Gaga's art and thought process.  You feel like an insider in the \\"Haus of GaGa\\" .  I love the locket of wig hair and the way the whole book is designed.  It is truly special .  My one complaint is the glue they used to hold the book together.  The book is so thick that after my second time looking through it I noticed the glue started to give a little.  So be careful little monsters.  If you are a hardcore fan of Lady Gaga this is a must have.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I had seen this movie so I ordered it for a friend for Christmas. It was a great price.
0792844890|4.0|This movie falls in line with most of the other Mel Brooks movies. It is a spoof on the star wars series but is humorous all the way through.
0143116371|5.0|Ok. Let me confess. I'm a huuuge fan of the blog. This book is a presentation of the best pictures culled from Scot Schuman's blog, The Sartorialist.  It is a visual and stylish delight. Absolutely wonderful to flip through. The photographs are stunning studies of individual style and quite a colorful inspiration. See all those boots and carmel brown shoes in the photos? Now look around, and you'll see them everywhere in everytown. I think Scot S made a strong impact on fashion, by stylishly chronicling it.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|I thought that buying the seasons for \\"How I Met Your Mother\\" would be expensive and trying to find a good deal time consuming. I went to amazon.com though and found the first season for so cheap. I love this show and knowing that I could get it for that cheap, on my college budget made me really happy. I plan on getting the rest of the seasons and hope to make sure that I shop at Amazon for my movies, tv show seasons and books from now on. Thanks Amazon.com!
031606792X|1.0|This was SUCH a disappointing end to the series. In fact if I could have a do over I would've stopped reading after the first book. There was definitely a gradual drop in the quality of Meyer's work. This book was so incredibly jarring, she managed to betray all of her characters.<br />No body grew, Bella was more whiney than ever and Edward became so 2 dimensional I was struggling to remember what I ever liked about him.<br />I think the line, \\"he was both dazzling and dazzled.\\" sums up the quality of this book. I was looking forward to a wonderful conclusion to this world, something that my imagination could dwell in, this book definitely concluded the world for me but to the point that I couldn't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />This book is like a 2 edged sword, you can't not read it because it's Twilight and you need to know what happens, but the reading leaves a terrible taste in your mouth.
B0007TKNII|3.0|I really thought I'd enjoy this movie way more than I did, but by the end I was simply worn out.  I'm used to musicals like Mary Poppins that have some song parts and some prose parts, but this Phantom movie is almost entirely song.  In many places I cannot distinguish where one song ends and another one begins.<br /><br />Still, there's no way to ruin the \\"Think of Me\\" song at the beginning.  It's a masterpiece.  I'm glad it isn't near the end, because if it was someone like me would be too tired of the constant music at that point to appreciate it.<br /><br />I think the casting is good, especially the guy who plays the Phantom, but for goodness sakes, if someone in the movie accounced that he had to go to the bathroom, he would have found a way to sing his predicament instead of say it.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This movie is a treasure for all ages.  The music and animation is beautiful.
B002RSDW8A|3.0|A woman with no direction in a dead end job and life takes to cooking and blogging as an escape. This disrupts what little family life she has. A standard formula has been done better.<br /><br />Other story overlapped is that of Julia. She also is searching for meaning in life and finds she has a unique culinary skill and panache for violent processing of food. This is quit fun viewing.<br /><br />I immensely enjoyed the interspersed sections that display Julia Child (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) as you could see their enthusiasm and depth of acting. This could have been great docudrama. The one-dimensional tripe if the interspersed Julie Powell (Amy Adams) could have been left out and nothing would have been missed.<br /><br />I have only seen the Blu-ray and cannot compare to other forms or media. For the people interested in the media the special features contend the standard as a commentary with Writer/Director Nora Ephron. One advantage is you can fast forward with sound through the Julie parts.<br /><br />See an early Stanly Tucci in \\"Undercover Blues\\" (1993)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000089736 Undercover Blues]]
B0000DJE9R|5.0|Michael Jackson's Number One hits was a great Christmas gift.  My wife is a Michael Jackson fan.  It's nice to hear all of his big hits.  I received the CD in a few days after placing my order.
B000J3OTSM|3.0|There is a story, but this film really didn't need one to enjoy the time spent watching this showcase of the dance.<br /><br />Channing Tatum must have cast a spell over me.  I couldn't take my eyes off of him.  The \\"sweaty\\" scenes where my favorite, except for those nude scenes showing his magnificently masculine body and his exceptional ~~~censored~~~.  Okay, okay... the nude scenes were in my mind.<br /><br />I had a good time with this film.  You might too!
0618918248|1.0|Wow, what a disappointment!! I recently read \\"Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why\\" by Laurence Gonzales, \\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" by Dan Ariely, and \\"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets\\" , by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, and \\"The Age Of Reason by Thomas Paine\\" (all excellent books) and thought this book would dovetail nicely with the subject matter of those books. Instead, what I found is a book that's sophomoric, dishonest, and mean spirited. Dawkins starts with a straw man definition of god as a \\"superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us\\", treats the existence of a God that fits that description as a scientific hypothesis to be tested (how clever), then strings together a string of arguments to supposedly disprove that hypothesis. It's so bad it's embarrassing. It reads like he taped the midnight bull-sessions of a bunch of college sophomores and pasted together all the arguments relating to this topic that he found the most entertaining. Luckily I didn't actually have to pay for this book. If you actually liked this piece of trash, and haven't yet read \\"The Age of Reason\\" by Paine, do it now. Behold the difference between a great book written by a great man and a bad book written by a buffoon on similar topics.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|We saw this in IMAX when it first came out and our whole family agrees this is the best Star Trek by far.  I love having the extra digital copy to put on my Ipod Touch to watch wherever I travel.
B0026P3G12|5.0|To counteract the 1 star review by trolls like J.A. Lebentwitt. He has continuously harrassed/stalked Susan Boyle fans not only on Amazon, but aparently on Susan Boyle fan boards. The one good thing is that is continuous harassment lead Curmudgeon to delete his needlessly vicious 1-star review. 1 less 1-star review and 1 more 5 star review. He is on practically every discussion board for Susan Boyle, not at all self-conscious about having no life. I'm guessing agitating people is his only fun.       As for the album itself, I have listened to the samples on Amazon I feel Susan has a lovely voice, hopefully her next album can be original music and not covers.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD was even more special than I could have imagined.  I'm very glad I had pre-ordered it as I now understand it has been the #1 album now for the past three weeks.  Great work Susan!!  I would love more of her work as it becomes available.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Today, December 25 2009, we were at a Christmas party at a friend's house.  We watched and truly enjoyed the talented Andrea Bocelli.  Having watched it on this day, it has made this Christmas a memorable day.  To those who have not seen it, this is highly recommended and it is worth the money spent.  Now that I checked it on Amazon.com, I feel disappointed that I have to buy the CD separate from the Blu-ray.  It is offered on a DVD/CD combo but quite hesistant since I have an awesome bluray theater system.  But no matter how I decide, this is worth so many evenings when we are relaxing in our home theater room.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|Dexter is still an entertaining series, but season 3 was not nearly as good as the first 2. Like another reviewer wrote, the Jimmy Smits character was pretty predictable.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just love this CD. Susan has such a beautiful voice and I just love all the songs that she sings. I can't wait for her to make another CD, I will buy it in a heart beat.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This has to be one of my FAVORITE books EVER. I know that on the outside it looks like some kind of military book (thats exactly what I thought) but its actually full of butt kicking action (and a little smidge of romance). I've read A LOT of awesome books (The Catcher in the Rye, The Davinci Code, ect. And Im twelve) and really, who CARES if its not realistic. NO ONE!    Plus, what girl dosn't whant to have perfect aim with a bow and arrow? If I could shoot like Katniss... well, then I'd be a happy girl.    All in all,this story of the the sheer power of deternination is a good read, perfect for playful  debates with friends(unlikeTwilight. Eew.), and it just might teach us a little bit about the true meaning of friendship love...
B00005JLR8|5.0|One of the most beautiful, moving films I know of. Touching, sad, heroic all at once. To say more would ruin it. But catch Jim Sheridan's commentary. It's just as deep as the film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was so Happy you had the Susan Boyle DVD for sale. This women is so awlsome and her voice send shivers up and down my spine.I can always  depend on Amazon for the things I want, You have never let me down. I can't wait for the last Happy Potter movie to become available.

B0012GVKVY|3.0|[3.5 stars]    How you take this film depends entirely on how you approach it.     If you expect a faithful adaptation of Isaac Asimov, then walk away. The fact that the icy middle-aged Susan Calvin of the stories has been transformed into a young, slightly ditzy love interest tells you all you need to know. This is a big-budget Will Smith action vehicle, with none of the depth and intelligence of Asimov's stories.    But if a popcorn action film is all you're looking for, 'I, Robot' is pretty good. There are some well-choreographed CG action scenes, and director Alex Proyas gives the film an appropriate near-futuristic setting. Smith as the hero Spooner does a reasonable job in a role that doesn't take him far out of his comfort zone, James Cromwell has a few interesting scenes and voice-overs as Dr Lanning, and Alan Tudik infuses Sonny with an appropriate amount of humanity. On the other hand, Bridget Moynahan is very stiff and unconvincing as Calvin, and Bruce Greenwood is largely wasted as the baddie-but-is-he-really Lawrence.     Basically, the plot unfolds as you might expect, with several twists and turns that are fairly easily anticipated ( Spooner's boss demands his badge and throws him off the case? Never saw THAT one coming, did we....). The final revelation at the end is quite well done, though, and represents an interesting take on the Three Laws. There are a couple of other token attempts to be \\"deep\\", such as Lanning's monologues, but this is relative. \\"Deep\\" for a Hollywood blockbuster will not impress those used to the metaphysics of Asimov's tales.     Provided you're happy to overlook the fact that this is 'I, Robot' is little but name, this film is a fair enough Will Smith vehicle. A fun way to spend a few hours, but don't expect it to tax your brain.
B00005MP58|5.0|I must start by stating that I am one of those women that drank the Colin Firth Koolaid.  He really makes this movie.  Having said that, in my opinion, this is the best Pride and Prejudice adaptation ever.   Every single actor that was chosen was perfect for their role (especially Colin :)  Each time I watch this movie I discover something new.  It has the perfect blend of humor and drama and is very faithful to the book (which is also one of my favorites).  I highly recommend.
0307269981|5.0|Be sure to have long stretches of time to start this book because you will not be able to put it down. the very ending was a bit predictable, but still fit the whole story.
0307454541|3.0|I read this novel expecting a lot given all of the excitement about it and I was expecting too much.  Maybe I am lately spoiled by writers like Peter Matthiessen, Barbara Kingsolver and Colum McCann who can tell a story lyrically and economically (even when the story is over 900 pages as in the case of Shadow Country).  Larsson is a competant writer in need of a good editor.  There are way too many descriptive passages that don't contribute to the novel's character development or suspense. Some of the twists in the story seemed to have been presented for their shock value rather than to help explain the complex psychology of a murderer or a troubled young woman. And I don't think we need one more crime novel in which the male protagonist is sleeping with three women, all of whom (inexplicably) seem to care a lot more about him than he cares about them.  It's a decent book for the beach but I don't go to the beach much.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|One thing that I've never seen discussed by fans or critics alike was the change in John's vocal delivery with The White Album. He, apparently consciously, decided to add a more nasal and less ballsy touch to his vocal delivery. Although his contributions, like Happiness is a Warm Gun (a personal favorite) and I'm So Tired, are as strong as any songs he ever contributed to any Beatles album, his vocals were never the same after this LP. Listen to Yer Blues, which pretty much showcases what would become the standard vocal delivery he used for most of his songs, with The Beatles and solo. A vocal delivery that helped to make his Rock 'N Roll album such a disappointment. We lost one of the greatest Rock voices ever with The White Album. I obviously don't know if the change was totally his idea or if it was influenced and encouraged by Yoko. I have no doubt that she was his soul-mate, but she was a negative influence on his career. I've never understood what the critics saw in her. She had no musical talent whatsoever. If it were not for John, she would be long forgotten. That in itself is an overstatement - you have to first be remembered before you can be forgotten.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|Really a shame they stopped this series! The characters are complex, layered and are slowly revealed as the story unfolds. Refreshingly dark and innovative perspective from an underdog point of view - had Fox continued the series I suspect that it may have faired as well as the new Battle Star Galactica. Unfortunately, management saw fit to attempt to direct the plot far too much \\"trying to cheer it up\\". Lots of potential for increasing depth of characters and plot twists and lots of fun moments that reflect what we all have thought at one time or another when trapped in a challenging situation. Still worth the rent and if you like SyFy it's a fun ride.
0307269752|1.0|I was shocked to discover that this book was so poorly written after seeing how lauded it was by so many. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, wades his way through women a l&aacute; James Bond. Lisbeth Salander (the girl with the tattoo) is able to hack her way into any computer or system anywhere. These are cartoon characters, not real people. It was no surprise to learn that Salander, who mistrusts and hates just about everyone outside her small group falls in love with Blomkvist. This is a warning to anyone thinking of buying this book, if you weren't thrilled with \\"The DaVinci Code\\" you'll find it hard to get through this book. If you thought that \\"The DaVinci Code\\" was excellent, you'll probably love it.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a big science fiction fan, but I don't like the majority of science fiction.  I am a huge fan of Star Trek - particularly Deep Space 9 and The Next Generation.  I watched, Star Trek: Enterprise and Battlestar Galactica (the new one) and was very disappointed with both.  I attempted to watch Babylon 5 and Farscape, but was very bored with the characters.    When friends recommended Firefly I was skeptical.  I tried to watch the first episode and gave up about 20 minutes in (it seemed boring and uninspired).   About 3 months later, I decided to give it another chance.  By the end of the first episode, I was already growing attached to the characters and the setting.  I watched the rest of the show, followed by the movie, Serenity, within 2 days.  The characters and acting are suburb.  The setting and 'verse are intriguing and unique.  I felt that the show demonstrated potential and was particularly good for a first season.    As of writing this review, it has been 1 week since I finished watching Firefly and Serenity.  During this week I have thought back to the show and 'verse many times and even imagined my own adventures.  I have also been very depressed about the premature cancellation (even though it was canceled 6 years ago).  As it stands, the show is very entertaining and enjoyable, but not the best science fiction.  HOWEVER, I honestly believe that if the show had been granted a full 7 seasons (like my favorite Star Trek series are) then it may have stood a good chance at dethroning my old time favorite.    As it stands, however, both the show and movie are excellent and thoroughly entertaining.  I would rate the first season and first movie a 9.1/10 (which will round to a 5 star review at Amazon).
B001QOGY9K|4.0|\\"The Princess and the Frog\\"  (Walt Disney, 2009)  ----------------------------------------  We went to go see this as a family -- Mom, Dad and Disney-addicted little girl -- and we all thought it was pretty good.  The messages of hard work and honesty (and a de-emphasis on magical thinking) were all welcome.  The music was good: ragtime and trad jazz are a breath of fresh air after the cascade of bad pop-soul that have dominated the kiddie movies of the last few decades, and the gal who plays Princess Tiana is a very good singer, Broadway trained and not another dreadful Whitney/Celine/Beyonce soul melissima showboater leaping from note to note without bringing meaning to the words... Thank goodness!  This was actually good music!  Yay.    I do have to say, though, that if Disney was going to make such a big deal about Tiana being their first African-American princess, it might have been nice if they'd given her more than ten minutes on-screen time as an African-American woman, rather than as a green-skinned frog.  The big twist of the story -- having the frog-kiss turn the heroine into an amphibian -- is clever and funny, but still, having her dark-skinned face disappear from the screen so quickly and so thoroughly was a little weird, especially with all the stereotyped voodoo stuff on top of that.  Couldn't they have had their first black princess turn up in, say, Atlanta, or New York?  Or Kenya? Without the bone-shaking hoodoo?  Disney is to be applauded for breaking their own racial barrier, but it still seems a little uneven, in relation to the well-marketed white faces in all the other movies.      Regardless, this was a good movie, another mildly scary but overall un-gun filled animated alternative for parents with little kids to latch on to while they still can.  And the music was fun, too. I wouldn't mind a sequel, with more of the human Tiana in it. (Axton)

That being said, the Firefly series and the movie Serenity are excellent and represents some of the best science fiction of the 21st century.    It is important to note that this movie is based off of the firefly series, and, while an excellent movie on its own right, is best to watch the series first.  The movie does have complete plot and seeing firefly is not required to enjoy and understand the movie.  However, watching the series first will give a greater appreciation for the characters, 'verse, setting, and plot subtleties, making the movie more impactful and enjoyable.

B00005JM02|5.0|\\"Finding Nemo\\" tells the story of Marlin (Albert Brooks), an overprotective clown fish father, taking care of his young Nemoa - first as Nemo begins school, and then after taken by a dentist scuba diver. Marlin's search takes him beyond the Great Barrier Reef into deeper and darker waters, where he meets Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a forgetful yet optimistic blue tang. Meanwhile, Nemo ends up in the dentist's fish tank in Sydney, Australia, along with other underwater captives, including Gill (Willem Dafoe), the group's scarred Moorish idol leader. As Nemo works with his new friends on a plan to escape their tank, Marlin and Dory swim closer, but they'll need more than just fins to get into the dentist's office. We also meet the improbable Bruce (Barry Humphries), a great white shark on a no-fish diet.<br /><br />When Nemo and his new friends realize that the dentist plans to give Nemo to his niece Darla. ready to give Nemo to Darla. Nemo acts dead and is flushed down the drain and eventually into the sea, but this also causes Marlin to believe him to be dead. Dory swims off but encounters Nemo and helps Nemo back to his father. The two, along with Dory, happily celebrate, but their joy is quickly cut short when Dory is caught, along with a school of grouper, in a fishing net. Nemo swims to help the fish escape using a trick taught to him by Gill and the other aquarium fish.

B0013FSL3E|1.0|WALL-E is another beautifully animated Pixar Movie, but a dark boring first half, and barely interesting ending.  This, along with no early dialogue, left the movie with the oomph of a pile of tin cans and meandering trash heaps.  The film's artwork of a futuristic world is well depicted, but WALL-E is alone on the earth and he cannot sustain interest.  Later on, he meets a girl robot, and love blooms - just beeps and squeaks throughout.  Much of it reminded me of a silent film with Charlie Chaplin. Having a cockroach as a friend was repulsive, not cute.<br /><br />Earth has become a garbage heap with a cloud of toxic smog.  Us fat humans have escaped, sent to outer space in a Space Ship that looks like a gigantic Caribbean Cruise ship.  All they do is eat and float around in deck chairs.  This is in the last half of the movie and the simple message is overdone.  The movie had a couple of smiles but the wait for something interesting to happen is tedious.
159448385X|5.0|Khaled Husseini has created another remarkable story, however this time it was in the eyes of two women.  Khaled parallels the lives of two different women, one who was condemned from birth since she was the result of an affair, and one who grew up in a seemingly \\"healthy\\" home.  Ultimately both lives take a twist of fate and have succumbed to the same lifestyle, and the same abusive husband.  This book does a great job at detailing the struggles that Afghani women face, while at the same time integrating the historical turmoil that has enveloped Afghanistan.  His subtle writing style makes the book that much more enjoyable as he does not play-cate to the masses. He does not undermine your intelligence, and leaves you wanting more.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you liked the kite runner.
B0015XHP3G|3.0|This, of course, is a great classic movie, and many of the reviews for this product are rating the movie (and in standard DVD format, no less), rather than the quality of its Blu-Ray presentation.     As far as the Blu-Ray presentation goes, I was underwhelmed. I didn't do a direct compare, but casually watching it, the visuals and sound did not seem any different to me than the standard DVD presentation. The Blu-Ray does contain a  documentary and \\"Out of the Blu\\" Trivia Track that are not on the DVD, but has the same commentary from the director and no additional features.    I'm slowly converting my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, but I'm doing it primarily for the enhanced visuals and sound. This Blu-Ray just didn't deliver that for me, so I'm glad I rented it first.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|After watching this movie/documentary I am (if it's possible) a bigger fan of MJ. Sourounding himself with the best he was given, this film surpassed my expectations! Again I am enthralled by the talent of the man. Having been listening to MJ since I was only a child one year older than him, I followed his career my entire life. Fascinated by every asspect of his life from the Jackson 5 to the present, I was never going to miss THIS IS IT. It did not dissapoint.<br /><br />From the dancers, to the outstanding guitarist and musicians on the set, I am left feeling almost a spiritual expierence. The direction of Kenny Ortega and his crew left an observer to the rehearsals with a sense of family, church, and amazing respect. The craft and artistry it takes to put on  a production this intense was made familar. We got to glimpse into the background of what true talent is.<br /><br />When the final credits were done, I could not stop watching and listening. Only when the spotlight and footsteps of Michael stopped and the black screen was silent did I exhale with great satisfaction. I will be buying several copies and distributing them to the music lovers in my life. No matter what genre of music you enjoy, blues, ballads, orchestral, pop, rock and even heavy-metal, there is not a person that appriciates music who will not respect, enjoy and relate to some part of this film.<br /><br />The important message of love and our Earth must be heard. The filmograghy and personal hands-on ness of Michael in these aspects of preparing for what would have been the greatest concert in the history of music, is sure to be awarded. Remakes of Thriller, Heal the World and Man in the Mirror brought me to tears.<br /><br />When someone inspires with music and actions, as has Michael, it makes one believe, we each can make a difference.<br />Though this reviewer wishes his death had not happened, I am uplifted that (as I believe) he could actually feel each individuals hearts and minds after seeing this. Rest in peace Michael, for you did make a difference.l, for you did make a difference.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Now while \\"UP\\" did not make my #1 Pixar movie of all time (which is \\"Ratatouille\\", by the way) it certainly is one literally uplifting little delight with sparkling animation, lovable characters, and rip-roaring adventure.<br /><br />Carl Frederickson is a retired balloon salesman and widower.  With the threat of urban sprawl and a court-ordered move to a retirement villa, Carl takes ties balloons to his house and takes off for a long-awaited trip to Paradise Falls.  But unbeknownst to him he has also accidentally carried off local scout Russell.  Despite efforts to return the annoying kid to the ground, the two quickly arrive at the intended destination. Convenient? I prefer to consider it plot device, and it certainly opens for the adventure that is the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful, and this is one of those movies that simply look better in sparkling Blu-Ray.  It's a funny, heartfelt, and moving story.<br /><br />And yes, it is worth is to buy the Blu-Ray. I'm not always the biggest fan of all those silly extras, but the documentaries and other production thoughts are nearly as entertaining as the feature presentation.<br /><br />Definitely a keeper.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I am a big fan. It was good for a while then at the end it was a real let down.
B001FB4W0C|3.0|I must put this out on the table:  Supernatural is the ONLY show I have EVER faithfully watched from the get-go. And while I'm not exactly a tv junkie, I do have a number of shows I enjoy.  But Supernatural is where my loyalty lies.  And I still continue in my devotion.  I'm a still a giddy supernatural fan girl.<br /><br />That being said... what was up with this season?!<br /><br />One of original favorites of the series was the individuality of the episodes. Mini-movies, they were.  Overarching plot line?  Sure, super, fine by me.  But this season was heading in more of the traditional serial fashion at the expense of the show's original lure:  various monsters/urban legends/folklore tidbits.<br /><br />I think that is my biggest complaint.  But there are others.  If a show is going to keep up a serial feel, some consistency is needed.  I've never seen so much backtracking, gotchas, and never-mind-about-thats in my life.  So they want to bring in a Biblical and religious twist to the mythology. I don't mind at all.  But pick where you are going with the mythology, keep it in my mind, and stick to it--BEFORE you start making a bunch of episodes.<br /><br />Half the time, I felt the story had no idea where it was going.<br /><br />Were the creators trying to keep the faithful and the unfaithful alike happy? I realize the aforementioned Biblical and religious twist is a dangerous road, and overall I felt like the creators were doing a pretty good job of keeping the religion and spirituality in the territory of story fodder only without preaching religion nor tearing it down.  And on a personal note, the mythology they came up with was so different from my beliefs that it was very difficult to offend me.  But there was time when I felt my beliefs were offended, and I'm sure there was a time or two when others also felt the sting of preaching.<br /><br />But again, it's a dangerous road, and again, I felt overall they kept it balanced.<br /><br />Maybe they spent too much time worrying about that, though.<br /><br />The beginning of the season pretty much states God has personally commanded Castiel to pull Dean from Hell.  Okay.  But then the rest of the season muddies that up.  So what's going on?  Who is good? Who is evil? Who is working for who?  Where the heck is God?  How much does he know?  Why does everyone keep saying different things?  Where is the rhyme and reason here?<br /><br />Religion or anything else they could have used, it's a unfocused mess of direction.<br /><br />Now on to the good stuff. It still is Supernatural.  The humor, storytelling, and character chemistry is alive and well.  The magic of this show is still going strong.<br /><br />Only a few sentences, but I like to think it sums up the wonder and charm of the show.<br /><br />If only this season had figured out where it was going...g of the season pretty much states God has personally commanded Castiel to pull Dean from Hell.

6304712944|1.0|In my humble opinion, this was the movie that started the end of the American movie musical tradition.  It was if Joshua Logan grabbed a rifle and intentionally shot it in head.  What a great shot!  It has taken us decades to recover.  Let's consider the choice of leads.  Richard Harris.  My wife put it succinctly:  \\"Is he a man...or a ham?\\"  The term \\"overacting\\" may have been invented for his performance.  Now, he can't sing obviously, and neither could Richard Burton but Mr. Burton won a Tony for his performance.  The only award Mr. Harris could win would be a Razzie.  And he wore more makeup than Vanessa.  Yes, let's go to Ms. Redgrave.  As soon as she opened her mouth to \\"sing,\\" we started to laugh.  Of course, she acts like she's in a \\"X\\"-rated movie, overly flirtatious and not convincing.  Now, no one could compare to Julie Andrews in the original Broadway production but do we have to go for the exact opposite?  And, then Franco Nero.  An Italian who supposedly did not understand English, playing a Frenchman and could not sing.  Minor quibbles, huh?  The audience bust out laughing when they first saw him on the castle ramparts singing \\"C'est moi.\\"  His singing is dubbed but when he speaks, well, that's the end.  No comparison to Robert Goulet.  These were Joshua Logan's three bullets.  His fourth bullet was himself.  Terrible direction.  What is this staring at the camera supposed to do?  It has been said that Warner Brothers management wanted the original Broadway stars but Mr. Logan wanted these three.  Whether due to scheduling conflicts or money concerns, the salary carrots should have been increased (\\"How do you handle an actor?\\") and filming schedules changed.  This was one of the studio's most expensive productions and designed to be a prestige event.  The mere mention of these three actors should have had Mr. Logan booted from the lot.  Now, the costumes and art direction were certainly worthy of their Oscars along with Alfred Newman's fine scoring.Being an ardent fan of the Arthurian legends, one actually wondered after seeing it if this was an intentional act, to destroy the proud tradition that honored true singing voices in favor of a musical environment of mediocre talents and a tone deaf populace to benefit a growing record industry.

I FELT LIKE I WAS IN ANOTHER TIME AND SPACE TOTALLY MOVED.I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS MOVIE BECAUSE HOLLYWOOD DOES NOT MAKE ANYTHING CHRISTIAN THESE DAYS WHERE ONCE THEY DID. SO THIS WAS A NICE CHANGE AND A KEEPER.ALSO THE VIOLENCE THAT SOME PEOPLE MENTION IS THERE TO SHOW THE EVENT THAT JESUS WENT THRU FOR MANKIND, NOT JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT..

B002BFIN6K|5.0|In addition to being one of the most important composers of the early 20th century to emerge out of Russia, Sergei Rachmaninoff was also one of the great pianists in the history of the instrument.  Famous for his large hands that spaned a twelfth interval, capivating and nuanced melodic textures and complex figurations, Rachmaninoff's playing has always fascinated pianists and music lovers.      This modern recreation - using softwear analyzing his playing dynamics (touch, pedeling, speed etc) that is then fed to a Steineway Grand - seeks to recreate Rachmaninoff's exact style (minus missed notes, good or bad) in modern, quality stereo sound.  Whether one agrees to its relevance and authenticity in the scheme of things, it is a totally fascinating approach from sound science and engineering.    First of all this is a rich collection of Rachmaninoff's solo piano compositions and transcriptions.  I was not so familiar with Rachmaninoff's solo works until this disc and was transfixed to hear each piece over and over.  It became clear why this pianist is so admired.    What I found most striking listening to this disc with no expectations was the exceedingly nuanced and beautiful pianism.  There is a smoothness and a fresh, organic nature to the playing that shows no unnecessary/excessive elaboration, rubato, over pedaling.  Its hard to decribe the effect - the music just seeems to flow effortlessly like a clear stream of water through a tranquil forest.  You don't hear mushed-over textures from excess pedaling (which the composer was known not to engage in) but nice, clear sonorities and distinctiveness of the notes.    Not sure why so much negative press on the sound quality.  From my ears, it sounds equal or better than any of the other 1000 classical discs.  Of course SACD would have been ideal and that is a disappointment (but apparently not technically possible at time of recording - see first review).  The bottom line for this reviewer was that I appreciated thisproject which has really pulled me into the world of Rachmaninoff - both as a fascinating composer and a supreme pianist.   Compositions - 5 stars; Performance - 5 stars; Sound quality - 4.5 stars.
B001OQCV60|3.0|From my wife Sarah: From watching the commercials and reading reviews I understood that this would be a more modern Sherlock Holmes, designed to entertain as most current action adventure movies do. I was fine with that. In fact, the commercials and previews looked funny, witty, exciting and highly entertaining. Unfortunately the movie fell very short of that. Unfortunately they used all of the best moments for the marketing campaign.<br /><br />Ultimately it was only so-so. I think part of the problem was the pacing of the movie. It seemed to drag on without ever becoming really impactful. There were moments when something would happen and it seemed like it might start to get interesting, but then it would go back to dragging. We were just never pulled in for very long. There were a LOT of fight scenes, and while I enjoy a good fight scene, they seemed to just drag after a couple minutes. There were long scenes that didn't seem to add to the story.<br /><br />Another issue we had was that there were many times when we could not understand the dialogue. I guess it was a combination of a lot of mumbling combined with the accents. Or perhaps it was a technical issue. I'm a very big fan of period movies and have no problem understanding that type of accent ordinarily. In fact, I loved Robert Downey Jr. in Restoration. That was a great movie and I understood everything he said. Jude Law is completely understandable in all of his movies. For some reason it was simply hard to make out what they were saying.<br /><br />We are big fans of Robert Downey Jr., and so respect him as an actor. I've watched him over the years and I always hope his movies will be a success. Jude Law is also a great actor, and I've enjoyed his films tremendously. My guess is that the issues with this film are there because of the script and direction.<br /><br />I'm sure there's more I could say, but ultimately this movie just didn't entertain us.<br /><br />Parents should know that there black magic was a big part of the plot.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|Does no one that listened to White Zombie still listen to Rob Zombie? The most common sentiment stated in reviews of this album, both here and by professional reviewers is that this is Rob zombies most experimental album. This is untrue. In fact little could be further from the truth. What this album represents is a return to form. During the 90's white zombie, with Rob at it's helm made some of the best metal in the land. This is a return to that sound augmented with artistic flourishes, by way of acoustic guitar, piano, and in the case of \\"17 year locust\\" even a sitar. Those that got on board with Dragula, or Superbeast won't know what to make of it, but if you did, for the love of god get your hands on White zombies landmark \\"Astro-creep 2000\\" (best album of the year, by numerous music publications, not to mention kerrangs 100 albums you must listen to before you die) before you listen to Educated horses. You will thank me.

1416572287|4.0|Writing a book about physics for laymen can always be a difficult task.  I have read more than I can count.  Books can either be too technical and unapproachable to be of interest to the lay person, or they can be so silly and irrelevant that not enough meaty information is contained within.  As a background on myself, I am an engineer by training, and as a wise man on Magrathea once said, \\"I am a great fan of science.\\"<br /><br />The book itself is geared towards somebody with a decent knowledge of physics and math, but not necessarily quantum mechanics.  I would say high-school level should be fine, but then again, with what passes for high school education, it's possible that it could be beyond some people (some may have issue with words like exponential).  The reader should note that the book is really \\"How to Teach Quantum Mechanics To Your Dog\\" as Physics in general is not covered (and it even avoids relativity).  This is not a negative, but just an FYI.<br /><br />Overall, excellent book---I probably picked up something new in every chapter.  Some of the science was familiar, though I was not aware of all the players and fun stories involved.  For the science I knew, I appreciated having a good way to explain it to friends and family.  As the book progressed, I discovered new things about quantum mechanics which I did not know.<br /><br />You'll learn about how the most often referenced piece of quantum mechanics (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) is also the most misunderstood.  You'll also learn not only about Schrodinger's Cat, but also his many women (who knew physicists were like that?).  The book builds on basic quantum mechanics to discuss some of the more interesting theories---for instance, the many-worlds theory to explain how things like superposition actually work (while Orzel doesn't mention it, the many-worlds theory also helps solve some mathematical difficulties in both cosmology and evolution).  However, no matter what the philosophy you choose to apply to why certain things happen, it does not change the equations, which is the point of the book.  He also discusses quantum zeno (how to stop a quantum state jump by observing it), quantum tunneling, quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, quantum electrodynamics, and some misuses of quantum physics (like quantum healing).  In short, anything quantum you want to know about is likely summarized in this little tome.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the dialogue is presented as a talk between the scientist and his dog.  At times it got a little tedious, but more often than not, it broke up the scientific jargon with conversation, and occasionally the analogies to a dog finding a bunny in the backyard actually seemed to work (or treats in a bag).  I also dug the occasional obligatory Star Trek reference... of course quantum states existing in many worlds would include the evil worlds where the quantum particles all have goatees.....<br /><br />I will knock off 1 star for this----I don't feel the book did enough to explain how quantum mechanics is used in our everyday lives.  Quantum tunneling microscopes are cool, but who knows what they are?  A few pages on lasers or tunnel diodes might have been nice.  There were brief discussions of quantum cryptography and computing, but I thought these could have been expanded.  In addition, quantum electrodynamics started to get a little too technical and deep for an average reader (but it was the last technical chapter, so I think it was well placed).<br /><br />To learn more, I would recommend some of the excellent books by Simon Singh who has an equally approachable way with explaining complex science.  Chad Orzel brushes the edge of relativity, but specifically says he is avoiding it for the purposes of his book.  To read some excellent explanations of relativity and cosmology in a similar voice, you might augment this book with \\"The Big Bang\\" by Singh.<br /><br />Overall, I give the book 4 stars---it is an excellent effort, and I definitely learned quite a bit from reading it.  While I did get it through the Vine program, this is the kind of book I would definitely recommend purchasing yourself.  I removed 1 star because I really did want some more practical applications (and I did feel that the voice sometimes drifted too technical for the average reader), but it is a quality piece of work and will have a place on my shelf by Stephen Hawking and others.reading it.

B0000035E7|5.0|Awesome and edgy. I love this cd. The songs are exciting and mood altering. A great release after a long day!
0451219597|5.0|Am trying to learn as much as I can about WWII and need to research this book to find out how much of the background is accurate realizing that this is a book of fiction. I would agree with another reviewer who found some inaccuracies and some inconsistencies with the time period in which this story takes place but having said that the book was nearly impossible to put down. Interesting premise, well constructed plot, and good character development. Follet gave me a sense of what occupied France must have been like and under what terror the French had to live. Perhaps I am not a professional reviewer but this book worked for me as a gripping piece of historical fiction.<br />Would definitely recommend it to a friend along with Eye of the Needle.<br />Update:  If I am not mistaken BBC has made this into a mini-series that is quite good.
B00003CXDB|4.0|\\"Wall Street,\\" the 1987 film directed by Oliver Stone is a MUST for any serious movie collector to own. It tells a tale that rings true more than twenty years after the film was first released. \\"Wall Street\\" is not a dumbed-down movie, reduced to appeal to the least common denominator. The viewer will have to pay close attention to appreciate the plot and the consequences of the actions undertaken onscreen. If you're a passive individual who wants simply to be told what to think, what to do, when to do it...viz., if you're a walking automaton with not a shred of consciousness, this movie is not for you. Go rent \\"Troll 2,\\" instead. However, if you are curious and thoughtful, if you're interested in questioning what lies within the hearts of people, then give \\"Wall Street\\" a try. You will be glad that you did. The script is intelligent and memorably quotable (\\"The illusion has become real and the more real it becomes the more desperately they want it.\\"). The actors (mostly) lend credence to their characters and run the gamut from the Machiavellian to the vapid to the nobly idealistic. The end result is a lifelike story that ponders the driving forces of human behavior. What makes people tick? Additionally, Stone's use of music is a big plus, particularly \\"This Must Be The Place (Naïve Melody)\\" by the Talking Heads. Eminently apropos.    Why only four stars? My first quibble with \\"Wall Street\\" centers on Daryl Hannah as the conniving opportunist, Darien Taylor. My difficulty in accepting Hannah as Taylor lies not in her physical appearance but rather in that I feel the role required someone with more gravitas, an actor with a more forceful demeanor. I found Hannah's performance to be mild, too mild for the character's disposition. My only other criticism of \\"Wall Street\\" is the subtitle track. It is inaccurate, perhaps from the dense dialogue of the script, but inaccurate nevertheless. For those who utilize the subtitle feature when viewing, it's a sloppy detail attached to an otherwise fine film (NOTE: The subtitle remarks made in this review are for the original DVD release and may have been rectified in later iterations of the DVD.).    \\"Wall Street 2,\\" is presently in production and I am filled with anticipation as well as trepidation about this upcoming second chapter. Oftentimes, it is difficult to equal, let alone exceed an initial performance, especially one as noteworthy as the original. I am concerned that the release of WS2 will detract from what can arguably be considered Oliver Stone's finest film. Fingers are crossed!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It is heartwarming to see the origin of the series -- especially CAPT Kirk. The actors voices sounded exactly like the originals -- with the same dry sense of humor. Fast paced with plenty of action and a good story line. Leonard Nimoy's appearance was a welcomed surprise. I hope there is a sequel.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is extraordinary and what a value with extras, blu-ray and a digital copy. 'Nuff said!
B002VPE1AM|3.0|Cameron put Matrix, Lord of Rings,Transformers,Apocalypto, etc. all in a computer and made a movie for teenagers. Some scenarios (like the floating islands) were STOLLEN from ROGER DEAN who made the LP's covers of progressive rock bands like YES in the 70 years. I saw Avatar  in a analogic room and it had the quality of a DVD. I am sure in Blu-ray the visual will be great. Nothing more than this! The story is too weak ... I think american people should use better their brains or you don't know who put down the WTC ????<br />*** 2010-april ... I saw Avatar today in Blu-ray. I just can say : Great, fantastic, amazing quality video and audio !!!
B002RVCD0U|2.0|<<SPOILER>>         <<SPOILER>>         <<SPOILER>>         <<SPOILER>>         <<SPOILER>>    Short_N_Sweet: a mindless string of action sequences w/exceedingly little dialogue/plot development. A two hour film filled w/too ridiculous to believe stunts. The kicker is Connor getting a 2\\" wide steel bar rammed through his spinal column, & supposedly his heart. It's OK, though... He still walks w/assistance to a far away helicopter, undergoes emergency cardio-thoracic surgery in the dusty wide open desert. Then receives a heart transplant... Yeah, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Bale was great in Batman. His performance here is uninspired & flat. This film is way too short on character/plot substance, & far too laden w/mindless action. I'm glad I only wasted $3.00 on a rental.
B0017HEX76|3.0|I was disappointed in the fact that the entire DVD was in Japenese and I had to use sub-titles to understand the commentary. This detracted from the pretty scenes on the dvd.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Had been looking for this set...last year it was sold out.  It was a gift for my sister who loved WEST WING...also it was $100 less than buying it at Barnes and Noble?  Great value and made my sister very happy!
B002I9Z8B2|2.0|Very enjoyable!  The plot wasn't as original as it's predecessor's but still a good tale.  An old enemy seeking revenge is a story that can never seem old if told in the right way.  With that said, this was told in the right way.  The actor who played Khan was remarkable as a man hell bent on revenge.  The original cast was a pleasure to watch.  And Spock's sacrifice was very moving.  However, the character development/backstory at the beginning regarding Kirk being tired of his Admiral position and missing being out in the last frontier is really getting old.  This was already touched upon in part 1, why bring it up again?<br /><br />As far as the blu ray release is concerned though, and I should mention I'm not digital transfer/restoration expert, but several times during the film, especially at the beginning there did seem to be a lot of discoloration and pixelation upon the faces of certain characters.  Why is that?  Isn't Blu Ray supposed to be the ultimate resolution???<br /><br />So the film in general gets 4/5 stars, and the blu ray release gets 2/5.
B001ED7C58|4.0|This soundtrack is supremely entertaining, even for those not fans of the film itself. The artists compiled represent a terrific crossection of alternative and chill.  Muse's Supermassive Black Hole is worth the purchase alone since it's such a great jam.  But then you get Paramour, Collective Soul & Linkin Park.  Cuts that should be familiar (and appreciated) to just about everyone with a radio.     The tracks by Mute Math, The Black Ghosts, Blue Foundation, Daniel Newman and Iron & Wine are revelations, and have clearly been responsible for those groups increasing popularity since the film's release.      Bella's Lullaby by Carter Burwell is a beautiful chill tune and I have mixed it in with my favorite chill CDs like the Back to Mine and Another Late Night series.    Rob Patinson's track is a bit whiny, but I'm sure his fans love it.  And it doesn't diminish the worthwhile purchase of this soundtrack.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This is an excellent two disk set.  True, the video quality is not fantastic in some places mostly I believe due to the interference of lazers and smoke effects on stage, but the sound is breathtaking.  If you were ever a fan of Pink Floyd you will enjoy this.  The guest appearances by David Bowie, Gram Nash, and David Crosby are icing on the cake.
B0021L8US0|5.0|First of all I loved, *loved* Children of Men for many of the same reasons as I loved D9. If you didn't enjoy CoM then you may not enjoy D9.     Though the beginning starts out slow, the documentary-style interviews really set up the rest of the film. The interviews with Wikus are very character-revealing and let you begin to see how and why he does what he does throughout the rest of the film. The interviews with the other experts set up a realistic environment (but only if you're looking for it, some viewers will laugh off many of the serious interview conversations) and they foreshadow a coming darkness in the story.    Throughout the film I found myself becoming more and more emotionally attached to Wikus. At different points I thought he was funny, sad, scary, and inspiring, a pretty good range for a relatively unknown actor. By the end when he was describing a picture of his angelic wife I was almost choked up, pretty good for a director's first film about aliens coexisting with humans.    Technically the film is somewhat uneven. The explosions are usually very cool to see, especially the smoke clouds with lightning in them, but sometimes the prawns aren't rendered as good as they probably could be. The human explosions are pretty intense and visually interesting but for me a bit too violent and too frequent. Definitely not a movie for people who can't handle frequent and sometime grotesque violence. The other technical aspect that may turn some people off is documentary-style shaky cam. The camera moves aren't nearly as violent as those in Cloverfield and the entire movie isn't shot by a handheld, only a small portion of it, so it may be tolerable for those who had trouble with Cloverfield.    All in all, if you want to see a gritty, original sci-fi shot in a very lived-in world that harkens back to the settings of Children of Men and even further back to those of Blade Runner, do yourself a favor and check out District 9.
B0026P3G12|3.0|The songs on this CD are not sing powerfull like she sing first time on the show.
B000AQJPQE|2.0|My daughter is 4 and really into the solar system, she knows all the planets and this was a gift that we were excited about at first. I have to say that after much anticipation, we were very disappointed. First of all when you put it together is seems really flimsy, like the planets will break the wires they are hung on. Then you put it up and turn it on, the sun is dim and the motor that turns the planets is really loud. And when the planets turn, sometimes they get hung up on one another. The audio CD that comes with it is kind of cool, but overall, this get a thumbs down from this family.
0307277453|5.0|In fact I would suggest it for anybody still on the fence about evolution.  If you don't believe in it, why are you reading this review?  And if you do believe in it, then you already have this book anyway or plan to get it.<br />But if you are in doubt, if the idea of evolution seems strange, or even scary, Neil Shubin makes it easy, even fun, to understand.  You will come to delight in the idea.<br />The chapters deal with the basic building blocks of life and how eyes, limbs, ears and such evolved from fish to mammals, and from mammals to primates, and well, to us.  We ARE primates, after all.<br />Get it and enjoy it!
B002RVZV9K|1.0|Three amazing musicians of different backgrounds get together to share ideas and approaches. Great concept!  This is how this movie was marketed.  Unfortunately it is not what is delivered. 90% of it is looking back with voice overs of the individuals talking about their history and only 10% of it they are actually   together playing and interacting. It's okay but not what was promised in the trailers. Many of the things they express I've seen on youtube and magazines   over the years. Nothing new. I was excited to see the dynamic of them together and was disappointed in how little there was of it. Sony Pictures should be   ashamed of marketing this the way they have. A great idea unrealized and then deceptively presented to make a quick buck.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|As a modern woman, I found the ending of this movie extremely offensive. Why must a \\"man\\" represent the explorer scout so that he can graduate when his mother was clearly available to do the job? And, on top of that, why is a child being rewarded for leaving his mother without even telling her, to go off on some reckless adventure with a geezer who for all we know could be a registered sex offender?<br /><br />I would not rent or purchase this film for my children, as I don't want them to grow up thinking this is (still) a man's world. Shame on Disney for continuing to issue propaganda of the submissive female. It's bad enough that The Womyn's Bible has not yet been accepted as the preferred translation.
B002VECMAY|5.0|I was completely blown away by \\"Up in the Air,\\" which is an outstanding film and possibly George Clooney's best performance yet. (Oscar buzz, anyone?)<br /><br />The movie stars Clooney as Ryan Bingham, a man who makes a living traveling around the country to fire random people in place of bosses who don't have the guts to do the dirty work themselves. Ryan has lived out of a suitcase for years and is perfectly content with that. However, he is suddenly faced with two major hurdles. First of all, his company decides to start managing mass layoffs via video conferencing, which threatens Ryan's up in the air lifestyle. Also, Ryan meets a woman, Alex (Vera Farmiga), whom he actually begins to develop feelings for, which really throws him for a loop.<br /><br />This movie combines a brilliant screenplay that tackles very difficult and personal subject matters with a fantastic cast. In addition to Clooney and Farmiga, \\"Up in the Air\\" features stellar performances by Anna Kendrick (famous for her role as ditzy Jessica in the \\"Twilight\\" saga) and Jason Bateman (known for roles in \\"Juno\\" and the \\"Arrested Development' television series0. The film mixes painful emotions of loss and loneliness with tender and often humorous moments. The result is a very touching film that is timely during this country's recession, and which forces the audience to take a close look at their own lives and reacess their priorities.<br /><br />\\"Up in the Air\\" is one of the best films of 2009, hands-down. This is definitely a movie worth seeing.
B002BFBAWO|1.0|I first heard of this film via the excellent soundtrack and the fact that it was based on an amusement park I used to go to as a child on Long Island. I really wanted to love this film but I thought it was just okay at best - it fell below average as both a comedy and a drama. And by the time the compromise was met the film was over.    As much as is not really the most important thing for a film to have characters that are relate-able or likable or not...these characters were simply pretty hard to care about.     Romantic inexperience or not the James character was just kind of stupid with deep insecurity issues and turned out to be a verbally-abusive jerk to boot (this didn't add depth to the character so much as maker him easy to dislike). Just because someone isn't a man-of-the-world with women doesn't automatically mean that they are completely insensitive and unlikable fools. This kind of deflated things just a bit, and no, by making him unlikable they didn't make things any more realistic. The characters in this film were all somewhat on the self-centered side of things, which made me feel as though it was an adult's version of a teenager (oh, of course the teenage Kristen Stewart character is having an affair with the married Ryan Reynolds character) and somewhat inauthentic. And the whole subplot involving antisemitism was just an unnecessary eye-roller.    The DVD is fine. The special features are average. Oh well, the soundtrack is still great.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|EXCELENTE PELICULA PARA LA FAMILIA ENSEÑA A LOS NIÑOS QUE NADA ES PARA SIEMPRE Y QUE LAS PERSONAS AMADAS NO SIEMPRE ESTARAN A NUESTRO LADO.
B0025KVLSI|4.0|Rushed out at the tail end of what had to have been a hellishly busy year for the band--becoming a worldwide phenomenon does leave you with little free time--\\"Beatles for Sale\\" has a whiff of a contractual obligation about it. But just a whiff: in the album's eight, mostly downbeat originals, you hear a group making their way toward the second phase of their evolution. Call this a stepping stone to \\"Rubber Soul,\\" which would follow a year later. It's up to the six cover versions to leaven the mix with some high spirits. Which they do. And of course, even a transitional LP by this band is going to run circles around the best efforts by many another group. Sonically, it benefits considerably from the 2009 remastering; those 45-year-old productions had more kick to them than you'd think.    This is my first acquaintance with this album in its original British iteration, and so it's a little disorienting to someone with a stateside Beatles fan's frame of reference. As a kid in the mid-1960s, I would have known this as two separate albums--neither of which, of course, existed outside of the U.S. market. Eight of the songs here turned up on the U.S. release \\"Beatles '65\\" (which also included the single \\"I Feel Fine\\" and its B-side \\"She's a Woman\\" along with filching \\"I'll Be Back\\" from the British version of the \\"Hard Day's Night\\" soundtrack) and the rest comprised six of the 11 tracks on \\"Beatles VI\\" (which nicked \\"Tell Me What You See,\\" \\"You Like Me Too Much\\" and the cover of \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" from the \\"Help!\\" soundtrack, and added the B-side \\"Yes It Is\\" and another cover, \\"Bad Boy\\").     I'm glad, then, to finally have this in one piece and hear it as it was originally put together. It's only now, 40 years after the group disbanded, that I'm experiencing their first few albums as they were conceived. Knowing now that the Beatles LPs of my youth were slice-and-dice compilations which the band had no say in, but were put together by opportunistic marketing geniuses whomanaged to squeeze 11 U.S. releases out of 7 LPs' worth of material, I've got no loyalty to the sequencing of \\"Beatles '65\\" or \\"Beatles VI\\" (or, for that matter, \\"Meet the Beatles,\\" \\"Something New\\" or any of the other Capitol Records creations).
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I'm not normally one to write reviews. In fact, I feel guilty for all the reviews that I read and base my purchase on...so consider this paying it forward, for once.    This 4 DVD package of UP is right on the money. A great deal for all the goodies in this set. The fact that Disney included both the Blu-ray and regular DVD is pure genious. Considering that I only have a blu-ray player upstairs, its nice that my daughter can watch the regular DVD downstairs. And with her having her own iPod touch, the digital copy was a heck of lot easier than me having to rip the DVD, then convert, then add to iTunes.     You can't go wrong with this combo set if you're like me and have a blu-ray player, iPod touch and are looking to utilize all this set has to offer.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Susan Boyle's CD debut is mesmerizing ... her signature anthem \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is reinvented, showing just the beginning of the depth & breadth of her musical range. She floats you through \\"Daydream Believer\\", gives you religion with \\"Amazing Grace\\" and brings you to your knees with \\"How Great Thou Art\\". Her voice is controlled and pure, her pitch perfect. In a word, she is divine.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|What is the point of this comic book style caper with ludicrious amounts of violence where the hero should have been killed 10 times over through the violence he has suffered.  The dialogue is minimalistic and the story is a rehash of all the other 3 movies with no real characther interplay - everybody is just acting like moronic automotons programmed to act in a certain way.  Pointless rubbish!
B002VPE1AM|2.0|Never has so much money been spent on a such a small idea.<br /><br />Avatar is a dumb, ham-handed movie relying on stereotypes, oversimplifications, bad dialogue, silly moralizing, and very little originality.  Almost nothing about the film is creative.  Even the plants and creatures inhabiting the far away planet of Pandora are only marginally removed from Earth's menagerie, and, at night, Pandora's forests are cast in a luminosity that seems straight out of one of those dreadful \\"paintings of light\\" by Thomas Kinkead.  For $500 million, you think you'd get more.  Apparently, not in Hollywood.<br /><br />And, I've just described the good parts of Avatar.  Enjoy the candy visuals, because there really is almost nothing else.  Don't expect the slightest bit of subtlety.  We know by now that Cameron isn't capable of it.  As a bonus, there are no real characters to hold your interest, only cookie cutter stereotypes -- like the paper-thin \\"macho Latina marine\\" that Cameron now has down fairly pat.  In short, it's highly derivative, lowest-common-denominator escapism which, I suppose, would be fine, except that it also happens to be hugely preachy at the same time.<br /><br />Watch it for the spectacle, but don't think you're going to care a bit about anyone in it, see a single thing that isn't telegraphed with the subtlety of a moose in the underbrush, or learn a single insight about the nature of good and evil and why human being sometimes do terrible things.<br /><br />As I watched this vastly expensive and infinitely thin movie, my mind kept going back to District 9 -- a film that touched on the very same themes, but with artistry and vision.  If only someone had said \\"no\\" to Cameron and divvied this money up among more worthy filmmakers.  That, however, is the craziest fantasy of all.
B001GCUO16|4.0|This product was delivery in a very quick matter. It was also a great price.
B002OR18HQ|3.0|I have to start by saying that I love John Fogerty and this DVD.  But, I specifically bought this DVD based on a sentence in the product description \\"Also included, in both live and studio versions, is the previously unreleased track \\"Comin' Down The Road.\\". There are two things wrong with that statement: The song was issued as the A-side of a 1973 single (Fantasy F-717) and - more importantly - there is NO studio version included on the disc.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Of all movies, and especially of Audrey Hepburn movies, this is my very favorite. Can I tell you why? Probably not. I do love her character's mischievousness nature! And the movie isn't full of caricatures, they seem a bit more real than in say \\"My Fair Lady\\" and \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\\" Now don't get me wrong, big fan of those as well. But this is wonderful! Doesn't necessarily end the way you think it might, or want it, but it is a satisfying and logical ending. Being in black and white does not detract from the scenery, either. Just a lovely, simply classical movie!
B002XFW4JU|5.0|it was one of those movies that get you and never let go. it's an awesome movie with an amazing package. it came with a miniature version off the U.S.S Enterprise and i thought it didn't come with the movie because there wasn't a bluray to be found...i found it inside the front(Head) of the miniature ship that is in the exact shape of a cd/dvd/bluray disc and it made this package 100 times better! im glad to have made this awesome purchase.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I strongly recommend this movie: the cast, special effects and acting are excellent.  The movie has as a background the historical clash between Islam and Christianity that started since the birth of the former and where Christianity was most on the time on the defensive until the Crusades came about.  Hence it is based on historical figures and the portraits of Saladin the Islamic leader, Balian (Orlando Bloom) and Guy de Lusignan are outstanding.The director took some liberties and there are many facts that are not historically accurate e.g. Balian and Sibylla never married. The plot revolves around the dualism between faith and profit, dualism that was the main engine for the crusades. The bad side we all know it because the media wants to continously remind us of the antisemitism of some of the crusades. This movie focus more on the ideals that move Balian, his father and the people who shared their faith: Jerusalem not as a real city but as an ideal place to strive for: the Kingdom of Heaven. This movie is a must for people who like history, epic movies, good acting and of course Orlando Bloom.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|To follow what alot of reviewers have written, they are a under rated band. You can utube them and listen to one day like this with the BBC orchestra pure magic. Great album.
B00192IV0O|5.0|I've loved everything Black Eyed Peas have done so far and haven't been disappointed with this CD.  So many times I will buy a CD and only found 1 or 2 tracks I like but there is not one song I don't like on this CD.  All the songs are fun, energetic and simply great to listen to. Buying this CD will be a great addition to your playlists.
B000093BDX|5.0|This is the Beach Boys at their best. With few exceptions -- most notably FOREVER -- this 30 track compilation is a nicely packaged package of their best and most remembered songs. The sound quality is outstanding and the inclusion of some mono tracks is a plus. Mono is how some of these songs were meant to be heard which is something that should carry some weight. An outstanding value for ~10 dollars.
0385504225|5.0|I have read the reviews by people who have given this new Brown's work a single star. The reasons? He is thinking about making a movie out of it; his is using a too structured and repetitive writing style; the characters are supposed to be intelligent but act stupid; ideas were stolen from old movies; the ending was lame; etc. Well, that might be the case but these reviewers have been overanalyzing it. My personal view of this book, which I had to force myself to put down from time to time so I would not finish it too quickly, is that it was entertaining, sprinkled with science, history, religion, symbology (of course), twists.... And I did like the end!
0385504225|5.0|Once again Dan Brown has grasped the collective unconscious and written anothe winner. After reading this book you will surely want to visit Washington DC again but, this time, with different eyes.
0767817664|5.0|Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale) finds out his charming next door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a bloodthirsty vampire who is feasting off the women of his neighborhood. In desperate need of help, he enlists the aids of his nerdy friend, Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys), his whiny girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) and an out of work actor, Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell) who plays \\"The Great Vampire Killer\\" on Primetime. Charley's problem is that no one believes him and his time is running out since Jerry is looking for his first opportunity to silence the snooping teenager for good.<br /><br />Directed by Tom Holland, \\"Fright Night\\" offers loads of humor, horror and suspense yet many of todays younger audience will probably find this movie dated. After all, it has none of todays technical wizardry that is CGI. It appears every Fantasy, Science-Fiction and Horror film of today is saturated with it. I personally do not mind CGI if it is well done and in a fantasy element but so far, every attempt to create decent fright effects in horror films have failed miserably and I strongly feel that CGI is aiding in the death of the horror genre. I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to revisit these films. The special effects are brilliant and there is nothing more effective than seeing 3 dimensional beings in terrific vampire make-up. Apparently Chris Sarandon spent several hours in the make-up chair (gotta love those elongated fingers) and I am sure Amanda Bearse and Stephen Geoffreys, the other 2 vampires, did too but the end result was probably worth it as \\"Fright Night\\" is one of the most enjoyable vampire films Hollywood has given us in the last few decades. Just like Joe Dante's classic \\"The Howling\\" and John Landis' epic \\"An American Werewolf in London\\" which still reign supreme as far as werewolf movies are concerned, the same can be said for this gem.<br /><br />The pacing in this film is virtually flawless as the action, horror and comedy are shifted around from one scene to the other and boredom never sets in. The performances are also worth mentioning because the entire cast delivers in spades. Roddy McDowell, who provides his quirky mannerirms and charm, is his usual brilliant self as the doubtful Vampire Killer. Chris Sarandon is effective and charming as the modern day Dracula. A pre-\\"Married with Children\\" Amanda Bearse is also note-worthy. She is pretty enough as Charley's girlfriend possessing all the qualities of the girl next door and all the charateristics of a jealous girlfriend. Once infected however, her metamorphoses is stunning and she is almost unrecognizable as a sultry vamp. That is of course before her final transformation and once the fangs come into play, she resembles a Carly Simon-esque freakshow in need of serious dental work. The young lead, William Ragsdale, also turns in a good performance but his foolish character may have some viewers rooting for Mr Vampire. But where will the horror genre be without these nonsensical teenagers?<br /><br />Those who never lived the 80's will probably be shocked at the amount of cheesy fashion sense draping our actors.

The performances are also worth mentioning because the entire cast delivers in spades. Roddy McDowell, who provides his quirky mannerirms and charm, is his usual brilliant self as the doubtful Vampire Killer. Chris Sarandon is effective and charming as the modern day Dracula. A pre-\\"Married with Children\\" Amanda Bearse is also note-worthy. She is pretty enough as Charley's girlfriend possessing all the qualities of the girl next door and all the charateristics of a jealous girlfriend. Once infected however, her metamorphoses is stunning and she is almost unrecognizable as a sultry vamp. That is of course before her final transformation and once the fangs come into play, she resembles a Carly Simon-esque freakshow in need of serious dental work. The young lead, William Ragsdale, also turns in a good performance but his foolish character may have some viewers rooting for Mr Vampire. But where will the horror genre be without these nonsensical teenagers?    Those who never lived the 80's will probably be shocked at the amount of cheesy fashion sense draping our actors.

B0009GV9LO|5.0|Eva Marton is in her prime in this open air Verona amphitheatre production of Tosca. Add the underrated tenor Giacomo Aragall and baritone Ingvar Wixell fleshing out a delicious Scarpia, and you've got a winner. I encountered this production in the 80s and watch it regularly. Marton was a great Tosca, able to act, with simmering musical intelligence and a huge voice that reveled in telling subtleties. Having just seen the recent Luc Bondy Tosca from the Met, with Karita Mattila singing, seeking solace I turned once again to this venerable version with relief. Say what you might about the transformations taking place in opera stagings around the world - Europe has become a nihilistic wasteland of avant garde deconstruction - the conscious parodies of self-loathing opera designers and directors who hate opera are no substitute for a realistic staging that reaches toward the mind and heart of the composer. I'm a musician with no malice toward progress, but I'm unwilling to beat the currently fashionable cadence declaring opera a museum art simply for upholding aesthetic standards that have grown organically from the art form itself. One of the best things about this Tosca remains the unbuttoned enthusiasm of the beautiful Italian audience, adorned with working class men and women who know and love Art when it flowers with the naturally abundant musical pride and joy that suffuses this first class production. Daniel Oren conducts with affection for all his singers. You can't go wrong!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'll admit that the marketing and build-up for this film was a tad misleading. Anyone who's interested in this movie needs to forget about their visions of a WWII action flick with Brad Pitt shooting Nazis across Europe. This is a meticulous, tense and slow building epic. It's just as much about the characters, the dialogue, and even the Nazis themselves, as much as it is about killing them.     It would be a waste of time trying to summarize all of the memorable scenes throughout the movie in this review space since I would in no way do them justice. There are a handful of scenes that have such a fantastic build-up and establish an amazing feeling of suspense. I feel that the aforementioned \\"build-up\\" to a lot of these scenes is what's most important in the film. Anyone with knowledge of previous Tarantino movies knows that he's a master of dialogue and this film is no exception. The ensemble cast is excellent, with an obvious nod to Brad Pitt. Christoph Waltz's performance as the sinister \\"Jew Hunter\\" has also been getting a lot of awards buzz but there are plenty of others that pull their weight in their respective characters. Melanie Laurent as Shoshanna is fantastic and I also enjoyed Michael Fassbender as British lieutenant Archie Hicox. Due to the large cast of memorable characters, Tarantino is able to weave three separate threads of narrative, occasionally intertwining with one another until they all converge onto a cinema in Paris for an explosive ending.    All in all, this is one of the better films I've seen in years, and easily my favorite of 2009. On the technical side, the Blu-Ray visuals look stellar. There's a lot of quality bonus features included in this package as well. The digital copy disc is bit of a throwaway addition for me, but I guess it's nice for people that would want to watch this on their laptop or something of that nature. It's an irresistible release for any lover of good cinema in the modern age.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I saw this in the theatre in 3D when it first got out.  Since that day I knew this movie was going to be a day one purchase for me.  Pixar has taken themselves to  new heights with the movie UP.      UP has one of the saddest openings of any animated movie I've seen since The Fox and The Hound.  This movie not only makes you shed a tear but also makes you smile, warms your heart and will have you laughing out loud.  There is even some danger and suspense to mix things up a little more.    Young and old will enjoy this movie and so will you.  Don't walk, but run to get this movie.  You will be glad you did.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is such a beautiful and fun story! The characters are so appealing. It's nice to see an old man as a main character too. I think this movie would be great for all ages. I really like the combo disc pack too.

B002ZXGSWE|1.0|I want to like it, I really do. My wife and I have been huge fans of the Stargate franchise since the 1st episode of SG1, and through the latter, lamer days of Atlantis.     I normally would post a long, informative review with a sufficient amount information to help others get a good idea of what the high and low points of the show are. However, all things being relative (to the previous Stargate series), I liken this show to a public restroom. If trying to explain to a person the less desirable points of a public restroom, and given that the listener has visited one on even a single occasion, one does not need to supply an abundance of supporting evidence as to why others should steer clear, nor does the \\"character or nature\\" of the public restroom warrant such attention or justification. But still, a couple of short observations    I'm not saying that the show has NO good points at all, but relative to other Sci-fi programs, it really doesn't. A couple of short observations for those still considering wasting that $1.99.    1. A dark, sappy, self indulging soap opera containing constant social cliches and political commentaries, that merely takes place on a space ship, is not science-fiction.   2. The act of casting a show with almost entirely unlikeable characters, numerous plot-holes, and entire episodes that are dedicated to occupying time while the writers devise ways to further the plot in subsequent episodes, is not redeemed by the fact that it takes place on a space ship.   3. A cast of morally ambiguous characters, having sex constantly with everything but the ZPM, on a space ship, is not science fiction. It's certainly not Stargate.     The show is a cross between Desperate Houswives and Battlestar Galactica, minus the cooler aspects of Battlestar Galactica, and with the drawn out lack of plot development found in the middle seasons of Lost. The sheer volume of sex, drama, whiney/conflicted/angry characters and plot holes, coupled with the lazy writing and reliance on cheap gags like lesbian love scenes, and the token angry black man is mentally exhausting.    If you want drama, sex, social commentary or sci-fi lite, there are other series that accomplish the task much better, and don't claim to be something they are not.
B002FRNCG0|4.0|The new Parmore is finally here. The only question lingering now is \\"Is it as good as Riot!?\\" I'll plead the fifth on that simply because Brand New Eyes is an entirely different entity. BNE doesn't sport as many of the unbelievably catchy hooks like Riot! did so plentifully (is that a word?), the lyrics are stronger this time around, and BNE is just an all around more mature record.<br /><br />I'll be blunt though, I didn't like Brand New Eyes the first dozen or so times I heard it. BUT! Just as I was about to put it away for good I started finding some stand outs. Basically, don't let your first impressions ruin what is actually a really good CD. Don't expect an All We Know Is Falling or Riot! redux and you're already on the right road.<br /><br />A few of the first songs to jump out at me were the powerful opener Careful, lead-off single Ignorance, the chorus-driven Turn It Off, and the absolutely gorgeous closer All I Wanted.<br /><br />All I Wanted, I feel, shows just how far Paramore have come over the years. This is a song they couldn't have pulled off until now simply because of how ambitious it is. The lyrics are passionate, the music is perfect in every sense, and Hayley's delivery is just, wow. All I Wanted is one of those songs where the only way justice can be properly given is by listening for yourself. Careful is that kind of powerful punch in the face opener they've always had as an opener. The only difference this time around is that the lyrics have gotten, dare I say it, a bit emo-y. Never fear fellow emo haters! All Paramore CDs have been classified as emo and they've never really seemed like it to me. So this one miniscule slip up is forgiveable. Besides, it's a great song. Turn It Off, as I said, is a wonderfully realized chorus driven song. The lyrics are fantastic all the way through and the guitar hook is irresistable. Definitely a song you'll be singing to yourself for weeks at a time.<br /><br />The slow songs are started to play a bigger part in Paramore's catalog, and there are two on Brand New Eyes. The first of the two, The Only Exception is good but could be so much better if Hayley would do the chorus just a little bit different. It'll be a song that would be amazing live I'm sure though. The second is Misguided Ghosts. Originally I wasn't fond of this track at all, but I saw them live recently and they performed this song. Needless to say, from then on I have come to really like it.<br /><br />Any missteps? Yeah, but only one. Where The Lines Overlap is just way too upbeat. Not surprised to see a song like this on here though.<br /><br />All in all, Brand New Eyes was well worth the wait. Any Paramore fan I'm sure will agree with me.ere are two on Brand New Eyes.

B002NPUCP8|3.0|After hearing part of Orianthi's first single 'According to You', I thought for sure I had stumbled upon a new singer/songwriter that would prove to be worthwhile.<br /><br />Well, I'm not saying I was mistaken, but I'm not finding myself enjoying Believe as much as I thought I would. Now don't get me wrong, this girl can play a wicked guitar, and by the end of the CD that was the only thing keeping me listening. And, yes, she's got a pretty good voice (a great voice for rock music). So what's hindering my enjoyment? I honestly couldn't tell you. There are some excellent tracks but more times than not they run together.<br /><br />I'm glad she stuck with such a rock edge throughout the duration seeing as how well that suits her vocals. I would actually consider Orianthi more rock than pop honestly, the only true pop quality she sports is her far-too-relationshippy lyrics. Heck, even her ballads take on more of a power ballad feel than a atandard pop ballad. Only proving this fact more is that she put a song sans vocals on here in the form of Highly Strung. Not only is that cool, but it shows how crazy she is on the guitar. Sadly, it always comes back to her lackluster lyrics. They don't ruin any song, but they in no way help her case.<br /><br />Wanna hear the good news? Believe is easy to pick up and listen to no matter what your mood is. No song is bad, Orianthi's voice is always spot on, the guitar solos are tasteful, and you'll actually probably find yourself singing more than a few of the songs long after you hear them. Believe is in no way a bad CD, it's actually quite enjoyable, just don't let all the five star reviews cloud your judgement.

B001OQCV24|5.0|First and foremost I saw this movie about 5 weeks ago tomorrow and this was something that interested me for several reasons -- (1) it caught my eye, (2) the Destruction of L.A. {Hint: California sinks into the Ocean -- The BIG Earthquake Prediction floating out there}, and (3) great cast of actors assembled.    Know to a post back on about 15 November 2009 from Patrick \\"Patrick\\" in New York.  The Character connections were there staring you in the face.  Example: The U.S. President and his daughter have a discussion over the phone where he tells her in not so many words that the younger generation must survive.  Another character interaction is between Jacson Curtis (John Cusack) and Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor -- \\"Serenity\\").  There are tie-ins and the like but if aren't looking as this movie unfolds then what's the point of watching this movie.    As for the prophicies about 2012 out there in the world, which were woven into this film with great care, do I think something can happen, yes.  What that is, I don't know but what ever happens I will be with my family.    I do agree that there are funny scenes in this movie and the one that stood out for me was the limousine behind the 2 old ladies in their 1980's car (those 2 old ladies reminded me of the old Burger King/Wendy's commercial where one of the ladies say's \\"Where's the beef?\\").  As for the politics, greed, back door/behind the scenes dealings was something that needed to be shown in this because it is how our world operates and if anyone thinks the contrary I suggest that you open your eyes and take a good long look.  Yes, movies are flights of fantasy but there has always been real world issues woven into them that gets people thinking.    Of the comments I have read about this movie, I'd swear Sisckle and Ebert were still giving 2 Thumbs Down for good movies.  Why is it that when a great movie comes out people have to trash it and yet when a bad movie comes out people praise it?  That is somethingI could not and cannot understand to this very day.    However, this movie at least for me was great and I would suggest it to others.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman!!!!! It is a classic movie, but not for the faint of heart.
B002SJIO54|5.0|District 9 is art.<br /><br />Spoilers... See the movie before reading about it. The performance of Sharlto Copley as the bureaucrat named Wikus Sharlto is pitch perfect and the entire film was well cast. Great writing and acting here folks. Wilkus is no action hero &agrave; la Tom Cruise or Bruce or take your Hollywood pic. The alien ship, technology and weapons are very convincing. The alien weapons are freakin' awesome. Seriously. As engaging as District 9 is, this ain't no non-stop action flick but when we get to shooting people and blowing stuff up, well I felt very satisfied. The aliens, referred to disdainfully as \\"pawns\\" by humans, resemble our crustaceans. They are very, well, \\"alien\\". They're physically bizarre looking and speak in a strange \\"clicking\\" language. Fortunately people can learn to understand it and the pawns can understand us. These aren't your stereotypical bad guy invader aliens or our angelic Spielberg variety. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of District 9 is the depiction of aliens as very strange creatures surely from out of this world, but at the same time very down-to-earth as well. They are animals like us and have needs (some very comical) and weaknesses and it's fascinating to see the economy developed between human and alien. Some are smarter than others. Doing the film as faux documentary was a brilliant stroke and added a helluva edge. The story mostly unfolds in filthy urban squalor. Distrcit 9 is the name of the camp the aliens are contained in. This science fiction movie is set in Johannesburg, South Africa. Not New York, L.A., Washington D.C. And the setting is crucial to what this highly entertaining sci-fi tale is really about. It's about us of course and it's about what ugly creatures we humans can be. We selfish and fearful humans with our xenophobia and racism and corrupt bureaucracies and greed trumps all morality ethos of the corporate elite and ineffective, corrupt and two-faced governments. There is personal redemption in this story, but when it's all said and done we're left wondering, what next? And I love that.<br /><br />To say some obvious things: Why District 9 is among the best films of 2009 and one of the best science fiction films of all time is because it has the qualities that great films posses. These of course include great direction, excellent script and original story telling, interesting setting, terrific acting, thought provoking social/political commentary, visually striking and highly imaginative sets and effects, good dramatic tension, etc...<br /><br />This movie deserves to be appreciated more and I predict it will be appreciated more in the long-term like so many classic films the public was a tad slow with.in this story, but when it's all said and done we're left wondering, what next?

0805091742|4.0|Drawing from his rich experience and analogies from construction engineering and aircraft piloting domains, Gawande provides a deceptively simple (potential) approach to mitigate significant problems in healthcare delivery.  In the early chapters, Gawande clearly explains the challenges associated with the exponential growth in the  volume and complexity of information and the inability of deep expertise alone to manage that information successfully.  Citing various examples ranging from Walmart's response to Katrina, Keystone initiative/Pronovost's research and WHO's efforts in characterizing patient safety issues in surgery, the author then hypothesizes about the key questions one need to be able to answer to develop solutions for complex problems (the discussion on the differences between what he considers a simple, complicated or complex problem, though short is quite informative). The remainder of the book essentially projects (quite successfully) the use of a checklist approach to identify ways to reduce errors in clinical processes. The author then discusses the two main types of checklists, characteristics of what constitutes a good checklist and some potential challenges of the approach. It is in the last component, one wishes Gawande had not only provoked an interesting discussion, but also prescribed a more definitive approach - while he acknowledges very unambiguously that the \\"codification of understanding\\" needed for developing checklist is not be feasible for all domains, it would have been immensely helpful if the author had devoted more space to discussing that observation and framed some potential research questions. (hence the half star deduction!).     Readers familiar with [[ASIN:0312427654 Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance]] and [[ASIN:0312421702 Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science]] are already exposed to a lucid, logical and entertaining narration style of the author and wont be disappointed with this book either.The well-referenced statistics used in the narration is an excellent starting point for more serious readers investigating healthcare delivery processes.  Overall, a very informative, entertaining and thought-provoking book that can potential re-frame the way one thinks of process models for clinical settings. A must-read.
B002VECMBI|5.0|I don't get to travel nearly as much as I'd like to. I'd love it if I could go to a new city every few months, fly to places I've never been, see all the sites, and all that good stuff. That said, I don't know that I'd want to travel as much as the main character of Jason Reitman's latest film, Up in the Air, an isolated, rootless man whose goal is to reach 10,000,000 frequent flyer miles.    George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a man who is on the road over 300 days a year. He's a master business traveler, who knows all the ins and outs of how to get through security quickly, how to get extra miles and comments on the fact that his goal of reaching 10 million miles is one accomplished by only six other people, which is less than the number of people who have walked on them Moon.     He lives in airports, first class lounges and airplanes. He has an actual apartment near his home office in Omaha, but it's even more sterile and impersonal than the hotels he stays in.    Bingham travels mostly for work, and his job is one I'd not heard of before: he goes to companies that are too gutless to actually fire people and does it for them. He does it in a firm, but not entirely impersonal, way and is very good at his job, and is appalled when he finds out that his company plans to ground him and everyone else and start firing people over the internet.    This is one of the most adult movies I've seen, and by that I don't mean that it's filled with violence, sex or anything like that. No, I mean that it's a movie that's made by adults, for adults. It explores adult relationships from a very adult angle. You don't see lots of big hysterics or grand romantic gestures (and the only attempt at one of those backfires). You just adults being adults.    Everything about this movie works and works well. The acting is excellent, the directing is top notch, the writing is fresh and intelligent. A particularly nice touch is that the establishing shots showing places like Kansas City and Wichita are done from an airplane looking down, as though one were a passenger. It's a nice touch.    This is a completely entertaining and fascinating film. I fully expect it to get several Oscar nominations and rightly so. This is one great movie!

Not having seen the movie prior to a few years ago I now see what I've been missing out on. An entertaining and well produced older movie with a moral slant to it. Sure it's whimsical in places and Santa Claus is not your typical grandiose version you find in modern films. However, there is an innocence that this film has that has long been destroyed in modern christmas movies. I highly recommend every family to sit down and watch this oldie every year. You won't regret it.

1933771690|1.0|I had high hopes for this book. I really did. Biology is the supposed Physics of the 21rst century. In other words, there will be a biologist with the household name credibility of Einstein before the century is out (and perhaps Craig Venter has already filled that role). There might also be a lot of money thrown at making theoretical pursuits tangible (but only if building a weapon is involved). This ideas of biology's rise to scientific preeminence is nothing new, as it has been pointed out in myriad books prior to this one. This book not only fails to be original in this insight, but also suffers from what I like to call \\"postmodern biologist\\" syndrome. It goes something like this:    One: complain about the applicability of physical-like laws to biology, as they offer little explanatory power to real biological questions (e.g. because biology is too complex). This is disturbingly like the social scientist who complains   about the poorly articulated dogma of biological determinism in nature/nurture debates. One might admire their criticism,   but one might also take a trip to the Santa Fe Institute or NECSI for a couple of weeks. Even easier would be to read a paper   from the journal \\"Complexity\\". The insights provided by complexity theory (e.g. emergence, critical phenomena, small-world networks) might help resolve some of the chaos (hint, hint) exhibited by real-world biology.    Two: quantum physics is all about uncertainty, and we'll cherry pick examples of experimental results and strange-seeming natural phenomena to prove it. Instead of using Heisenberg and quantum physics as your inspiration for messy natural processes, perhaps you should turn to Kurt Godel's work, who argued that no system can be described fully using mathematical axioms without a resulting paradox. This seems to be much more appropriate to the kinds of uncertainty one finds in biological problems. For example, one cannot build an organism simply by executing a few billion lines of computer code. You may get a reasonable approximation, but it would not resemble the same organism assembled through natural biological processes. What might be a good heuristic at this point might be a Turing-like test for self-assembly to see what the artificial lifeform is missing. The difference between the two might yield insights into the laws of biology.    Three: when we get done with the first two indictments, let's turn to consciousness. The failure to crack the consciousness nut should give us the evidence we need that the physical approach is not adequate for understanding complex natural phenomena. The main problem with using consciousness as a theoretical coup de grace is that it has rougly the same definition as pornography. That is, we know it when we see it. It's also a straw man, even if well disguised. People who do consciousness research are taken to task in this book for trying to make the problem scientifically tractable. But to do otherwise would not be possible. You have to start somewhere, and even though I am likewise dissapointed in the approaches taken thusfar, I don't view modern consciousness research as worthless.    So, after reading this book, I have no idea what \\"Biocentrism\\" is, other than a general critique of using a physical approach.  This is somewhat disturbing, as it almost opens the door for a mystical approach. Perhaps when biology becomes the paramount discipline, real theorists can begin to unravel some of biology's fundamental laws.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|It could have been great but they were more interested in all the blood and fighting to make it into a watchable film.  I love a good action film but this was over the line.  If I wanted to just watch bloody beating, that this movie loved to show continually, I might have liked it better.  Couldn't enjoy what could have been a good good due to feeling I was watching a how to beat someone movie.

B000VZJMAI|5.0|Hot Stuff! No S**t!  That's what was written on the sign next to Creatures when I went to buy it in 1982 at the Wherehouse on \\"E\\" Street in San Bernardino, California.  I liked Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, Love Gun and Alive 2.  I also think that Music from the Elder is one of their better albums, but Creatures was the one I was waiting for since I heard \\"Larger than Life\\", \\"All American Man\\" and \\"Rocket Ride\\" on Alive 2.  I knew they could do it!  The first time I listened to this record, I had to slap myself to make sure I was awake.  There is not ONE crappy song on this album to break the spell of sheer metal/rock pleasure the listener will experience while playing this album.  The one slow song on this album, \\"I Still Love You\\", is so good that the woman that Paul is singing to should have given him another chance.    Now as we all know, Kiss isn't really a \\"metal\\" band, but so what!  If they had done more albums as superbly as this one, they never would have been compelled to remove the make-up in the first place.  And just to prove that this album was not a \\"happy accident\\", Lick It Up (the first without the make-up) makes an excellent companion piece to Creatures.  Creatures of the Night lives up to all the Kiss hype since 1975's Alive!  Get it now!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar, above all else, is a love story. I'm convinced that this is the reason why many people come back to see it again and again. It is about love in the face of heroic difficulties, but its the connection between the two main characters which lifts the movie above the level of all the other great action / scifi movies we've seen.<br /><br />For those of you who are reading this under the DVD release in November, 2010, I suggest that this release does have much to offer over the theatrical release, especially if you get it in Blu-Ray. The 18 extra minutes add a lot of balance to the story of the conflict between the humans and the Na'vi, before the attack on home tree. It also adds a lot of depth to Jake Sully's motivations to take the side of the Na'vi against Col. Quaritch and Co. To the theologically inclined, there is even some good material in the incomplete scenes, which did not even get into the extended versions. Some of the material on the second and third disks is a bit silly, but we've come to expect some chaff on these sets.<br /><br />For those of you who are reading this under the DVD release of 22 April, I agree with others who are critical of this 'bare bones' release, not in 3-D and with none of the extras we may have been lead to expect. The only extras are alternate sound tracks in Spanish and French, plus Subtitles for the hearing impaired. For a minimal release, I would give the DVD package 3 stars. The only other advantage is that by NOT being in 3-D, certain lighting aspects are better than 3-D in the theatre.<br /><br />Another, somewhat subliminal view of the movie is that it represents all the major stages of life, especially the rebirth of baptism, growth into belonging in the community, marital union, and death. Ultimately, it gives one the sense of a sinner's return to a state of grace in the garden.<br /><br />In order to answer some critics, I am certain, as Cameron says himself, that the story is a gemish of every SciFi novel and film he has read or seen. There is even a hint of 'Return of the Jedi' in that both Pandora and Endor are habitable moons of gas giant planets, similar to the moons of Jupiter.This is not a bad thing. People have been retelling the same story over and over for centuries. The post-Biblical story of Simon Magus was resurrected and retold as the Faust story ever since the fourteenth century.The question is, does Cameron tell it better? I suspect he comes out in the lead by a nose<br /><br />The skeleton of the story is similar to 'white man scouts indians, white man goes over to Indians, white man helps Indians fight cavalry, Indians win'. My dim memory of 'Little Big Man', with Dustin Hoffman, suggests this was the best exemplar of this skeleton. The big advance over that skeleton is based on the Avatar process, and on the one hand, the advantages it gives to Jake Scully to make contact, and on the other hand, the disadvantages, when the colonel back at home base can cut him off from his Avatar body in the blink of an eye.<br /><br />The second leg of this movie is the absolutely perfect technical realization of Pandora and its inhabitants. I don't think that even the floating mountains are original (I have a suspicion these showed up in a Larry Niven story) I am certain the huge trees and the sentient connections between the flora and fauna are not original. But the details of how all these were realized is impecable. I am not well versed in movie technology, but I have seen very good movies, such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator, where the editing, especially in heavy action scenes, is very, very choppy. But Russell Crowe keeps your attention, so you don't care. A slip in filming or editing in 'Avatar' would have been disastrous. But there are no slips. Not one. Cameron and Co get all the little stuff exactly right, even so far as to invent the Na'vi language which sounds both familiar and foreign at the same time. The only 'background' aspect of the film which doesn't POPis James Horner's score. It is 'good enough', but not so good I will run out and buy a CD.<br /><br />The third leg of this movie is the aura of spirituality evoked by the unique combination of story, backstory, and effectiveness of the actors portraying the Na'vi to show how they feel. As Sigourny Weaver said recently, Cameron was able to develop at least three very good female characters in this movie. Zoe Saldana was especially effective in being alternately tough and vulnerable behind her Na'vi persona.  We are used to this by now, ever since Gollum turned out to be the most interesting character in 'Lord of the Rings'. As heroic and inspiring as LOTR was, Avatar is even better, and it knows when to stop. I literally cried through the second half of the film, so taken was I by the evocative spirit of the Na'vi and their environment. This is tree-hugging writ large, very large. I was taken aback when I ran into a passage in 1 Timothy 4:2-4 which warned against itching ears, and wandering away to myths. I can wish that the level of spiritual octane in our religious services and teachings could come close to the artistry being applied here to 'mere myths'.<br /><br />A week after writing this review, it occurred to me that there are mythic undercurrents to this movie, especially in the realization of the Na'vi which dig deep into some of our most basic notions of the divine. In some early Jewish writings, Adam and Eve are described as being clothed in effervescent light (just like the Na'vi) and who must be clothed with artificial clothes when they fall from grace. The Na'vi are still connected to their God, and fight to preserve that connection.<br /><br />The links to classic spirituality and folklore just keep coming. I just discovered, in the title to Howard Schwartz' book 'The Tree of Souls' that this tree was, in Jewish folklore, the heavenly analogue to the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. The author, Schwartz told me he has no idea if Cameron got the idea from Schwartz' book, published in 2004.<br /><br />As an aside, I have to add that allowing for the layers of special effects, Zoe Saldana is simply outstanding in this flick. Give us more!<br /><br />LOTR surprised me, because I thought it couldn't be done, but it was. Avatar did not surprise me, but that doesn't mean it failed, because it simply lived up to expectations, as the expectations were very, very high.ut not so good I will run out and buy a CD.

B001GCUO1Q|4.0|Growing up I watched the X-men cartoon every week and loved two of the characters: Wolverine and Gambit.  In this movie, you get to see both!  The story of Wolverine may not be as fast-paced as some would like, but it does go into how he became the way he did and how a rift developed between him and his brother.  Gambit's appearance is a bonus and I hope we get to see more of him in the future since his character and humor deserved to be seen.    Some may be disappointed on the set up for the next movie about Ryan Reynolds' character Wade Wilson, but overall it's an enjoyable movie for those wishing to escape into the world of mutants.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I won't recap the movie since others on the site have done a wonderful job already. I will just say the film covers 500 days in which a girl named Summer enters a young mans life.<br /><br />I am a 42 year old man, but my 19 year old daughter highly recomended the movie as one of her favorites from the past year. As usual, she was right. Even though it does not have a Hollywood happy ending, you get the feeling that both characters have wonderful lives in front of them, perhaps made better by the 500 days they were in each others lives.<br /><br />As I watched the movie I though this was a movie John Hughes would have made in his prime. The characters and their emotions are so real, and if you have ever had your heart broken you will feel it, that it just oozes from the screen. The music is also great, mixture of old and new, again something Hughes was famous for.<br /><br />It is nice to know in a year in which we lost a master at telling stories of young people, we see the spirit continues in movies like 500 Days of Summer.
B000068NOV|5.0|It is really more for display than it is a toy.  My son was very pleased with it since it was on his list.
0451203933|5.0|I could not put this book down. The encounters these men had to face is just jawdropping. I didn't even know about this War and reading about it made me look into it more. I just couldn't believe a book could be so packed with information.
B0000CC61G|5.0|If you came home one day to find your favorite album of all time missing, how much would you pay to replace it? If you appreciate your music the way I do, the answer would be somewhere in the hundreds of dollars. If some of your favorite albums include King Crimson, Yes, Gentle Giant, or Genesis, take the chance and pay the cost for this CD. As a fan of the aformentioned bands, I can say that Hybris ranks amongst the best of progressive rock. It is an acquired taste, but it will well reward the investment you make.
0446567337|5.0|I loved this book because of the war story behind it. I love World War 2 stories but have not been able to find any lately so I got this one. I loved it and I can't wait to see the movie that comes out. The book I thought was romantic and one of Spark's good novels. I would say that The Notebook is his all time best though.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I missed the opportunity to see this movie in the theaters and was looking forward to the blu-ray release. I was going to rent it last week when it came out on DVD but once again missed the chance when they were all rented out before Christmas. So today at walmart I decided to take the chance and just buy the blu-ray. I'm glad I did! I had faith that with Peter Jackson attached to this movie, plus the original storyline, I just knew it had to be good. Boy was it.<br /><br />The special effects were incredibly realistic. The alien weapons were awesomely powerful and the people exploding was more violent than war of the worlds! So cool. Great movie and thought provoking humanitarian message. Just buy the movie because it's worth owning. You'll want to show this one off to the \\"cool friends\\".
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie. I watched it so much that I had to buy a new copy of it on DVD. I love how it sets place during World War 2 and I believe everyone would love to experience a love like the one they have.
0307474275|2.0|This is one of the most preposterous books I've ever read.  There are so many plot holes, mis-stated and misrepresented \\"facts\\", poorly reasoned out theories that I honestly had a headache from all the times I hit my forehead with my hand. The author name drops a lot of information; I get the feeling though that he doesn't fully understand it, because it's just not portrayed accurately.<br /><br />The book mentions the concept of the \\"preuve de m&eacute;rite\\".  Meaning, the fact that you can solve a cipher proves that you deserve to read the secret.  This book seemed to me the antithesis of that.  If you're smart enough to know the histories involved, and to grasp the concept of reason and logic, you'll know that a lot of this is hogwash.  In which case you may want to run from this book as fast as you can.<br /><br />And yet the book is just fun to read, sucking you right along because you can't wait to see the next preposterous conspiracy he has in store.  Just make sure you keep a bottle of pain reliever next to you for the duration.
0385504225|2.0|As a member of IONS (Institute of Noetic Sciences), I read \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to see how well Dan Brown would write about noetic scientists' consciousness research, about symbolism, and of course, I also read it for entertainment value. I noted that Brown spent quite a bit of time at the beginning of the book setting up the details of the research lab used by noetic scientist Katherine Solomon; however, he never does a thing related to noetic science with this intriguing set-up nor does he connect Solomon's work in any way to the sub-text of symbolism and mysticism running through the book. Brown doesn't demonstrate understanding of consciousness research and I found myself having to read through endless pages, looking for a depth that simply doesn't exist in this book. I usually don't read thrillers and I have not read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". I am therefore an easily-drawn-in novice and I allowed myself to be pulled forward by the action in spite of some pretty gruesome violence and some pretty silly so-called \\"esoteric\\" moments with the Masons. I was expecting a meaningful payoff that never came. Certainly I am now more intrigued by places in Washington D.C. that I now would like to visit, but Dan Brown completely forfeited the opportunity this novel gave him to provide genuine spiritual wisdom/insight and current information on the scientific research into consciousness. Instead, he went for Masonic ritual (yikes!) and then for some shallow statements in the last few pages of the book where he named a few sacred texts and general concepts. However, none of the characters in the book are made capable of providing insight into spiritual practices nor into their research results. Concepts like \\"thought\\", \\"mind\\" and \\"energy\\" are all run together in about 5 sentences as if they're the same thing; how they relate to whatever \\"symbol\\" is found (or not found) is completely oblique. Quite a bit of text in the last few pages is devoted to generalized discussion and then to talking about the Bible as a text providing spiritual wisdom; the character Katherine Solomon exclaims that the Bible contains \\"scientific information\\" when in fact any in-depth student of the Bible knows that the early mystery teachings containing the practices which can and have been researched and that can lead to realization of God within, were taken out of the Bible by the Church and can now be found only in places like the Nag Hammadi Library [...]. Also, Brown's statement \\"The science of Noetics . . .is the study of human thought\\" (pg. 498) is not accurate. I recommend looking into the real Institute of Noetic Sciences [...]. I would not recommend this book to anyone who really wants to understand what our lost symbols are or what they mean. One of the book's themes - that it's a national security threat if the public learns that some of our leaders practice Masonic rituals - is pretty silly.
B002MW50KO|5.0|When I saw the album art and Bob Dylan's name, I knew exactly what this would sound like.  I'm a 50's baby, and came to young adulthood in the early 1970's.  I was somewhat familiar with Bob Dylan's legendary work from the 60's, but as a young man limited myself to greatest hits collections from him.  As the years went by, I never really kept up with his music. Seeing this album's artwork, I was intrigued and read the Amazon description.  To me, it's Bob Dylan re-presenting 20th-Century American Christmas music without a commercial gloss and with a great amount of sincerity and charm.  Never mind the raspy voice.  Perhaps Dylan is in the role of a \\"white Satchmo\\" on this work, with all due respect to the great Louis Armstrong.  It's a big plus to me that the profits of this album go to charity. I'm not a fan, but if I ran in to him somewhere soon, I'd buy him a beer and say thanks for this cultural Christmas gift.
B0029LHW68|3.0|I'm a big 30 Seconds to Mars fan as I loved their last album, so I was excited for this one to come out.  The progression of the band is pretty interesting, but both good and bad.  The more fast paced 'techno-ie' type songs are all mostly really good.  So far, Night of the Hunter is my favorite song on the CD.     My gripe with the CD so far is that the last half of the song list has too many slow and uninteresting songs.  There just aren't that many powerful songs like we had on A Beautiful Like like The Kill, From Yesterday, Attack, etc.  And was it really necessary to have the children chanting in EVERY song?  I think it is a cool effect to use, but you gotta use it more sparingly.      If you played A Beautiful Lie right after this This Is War you would feel like the band completely changed their style.  I like the fast paced electronica inspired tracks, but the slow moody songs just drag on and feel like filler.
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|I can't believe how difficult it was to keep from laughing out loud when reading this book.  Great stuff!  I admit that it was a bit overdone on the smoking issues... got a bit boring at times.  All in all... the humor made me wish I hadn't read the book from cover to cover so quickly.  I wanted to read it again as soon as I was finished... and I did.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|I bought two of these for Christmas 09 so I could play war games with my daughter.  I'm a mechanical engineer and yet assembling this toy takes a PhD and then it just jams.  We managed to get it to shoot two darts, both of which were damaged by the firing mechanism.  It doesn't break down to clear a jam, and then jams again.  The weapon has two guns in one, and neither toy's forward gun worked.  This is the biggest disappointment of the season.  Buy something else.
0375854819|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  I was a late-comer to the series and read Eragon (4 stars), Eldest (3.5 stars), and now Brisinger back-to-back.  I was thoroughly impressed with the first installment especially since the story was \\"created\\" by a 15 year old.  Was not as impressed with the 2nd installment, but it was still an enjoyable read; however, Brisinger was a total disappointment.  I cannot remember a more annoying book (oh wait the last few Terry Goodkind \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" books).  Mr. Paolini has cheated his audience by dragging out this 3 book series into 4 books.  Brisinger flounders around too much and does not really move us any closer to the final battle with Galbatorix than where we were at the end of book 2.  Maybe a big part of my disappointment was that I was expecting this to be the final installment as I did not realize a 4th book was added until I was well into Brisinger.  On the other hand, I would have enjoyed another book if this one had provided us with real character/plot development which for me it didn't.  I will probably skim read the 4th book just to see how it turns out but I will get it at the library - I will definitely NOT PURCHASE IT.
B002SJIO54|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a long time. If you are a science fiction fan, you will love it.
B00158K0S8|5.0|\\"Patton\\" was originally photographed in a 70mm process know as Dimension 150. The Blu-ray version of this title fully captures the clarity and color range of the 70mm release. This isn't just a good Blu-ray for a 1970's film -- it's a great Blu-ray that ranks as one of the best yet released. Fox produced a number of films in large screen formats that, if they received the kind of treatment that \\"Patton\\" has, would make outstanding Blu-ray releases. These would include: \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"The Bible...In the Beginning\\", \\"Carousel\\", \\"The King and I\\", etc. If \\"Patton\\" is a film that you appreciate then do hesitate to up grade from DVD to Blu-ray on this one. The difference is day and night!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|My wife and I started jogging (in mocassins) in the early 1970's, before Adida came out with a green and white runner's shoe with soles as stiff as concrete.  Over the next 25 years or so, we ran through all the latest additions and suffered most of the funrunners' injuries described by McDougall.  Our 38-year-old son, a marathoner, and half ironmaner is training for his first ironman in St. George, Utah, next May.  He too has suffered foot problems.  I gave him this book for Christmas in hopes he can use some of McDougall's valuable insights into runners' physiology, psyche and nutrition to increase his running enjoyment.  That aside, I am an inveterate reader and this book rates right up at the top of the best of the thousands of books I have read over the past 50+ years.  Extremely well written, informative and humourous.  I am almost overwhelmed with the pleasure and valuable information I gained from this read and hope MoDougall writes more. In the meantime, I may reread \\"Born to Run\\" until his next publication.
B00260HH3K|2.0|Unlike those who say they are true fans, the original dragonball series is in my blood. I watched dragonball/z/gt so much i find myself voice acting over the most of the scenes. I did not hate the movie, but they could've done better. You have some people in Hollywood who thinks that you can watch something one time and turn it into a multi-million dollar movie. First of all, where are all of the characters? Krillin may seem insignificant to some people but he did play a major role in Dragonball. Second, Where did this half-assed actor of Goku come from? He did not pass my goku test! LOL. He looks a little like Goku, but what about Goku's personality and dramatics. Third, Goku's father in this movie would've made a better Master Roshi. Sorry Chow yun fat. I waited so long to see dragonball be adapted into a movie and this was very dissapointing. More dissapointing than the 1996 movie version of Street Fighter. I love anime to death and I like watching the live action movies but it seems like they put more work into the low budget versions. Tell the directors and producers the next time they need some help, CALL A REAL FAN!!!
B002N8A14M|5.0|This is a great case that provides complete protection and doesn't take away any accessibility.  I have a tiny arm and the armband fits well (not too big or saggy) and is comfortable.  At first I was bothered that the case itself includes a belt clip which does not come off (or doesn't look like it does, I wasn't able to pull it off) but I found that it actually adds to its portability.  I highly recommend this case.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Just an awesome deal that I could not pass up.  3 blurays for $30.
0786868724|3.0|The book is a breezy, easy read.  (I finished it in a couple of hours on a plane.)  Mitch Albom's (love him on ESPN) writing is a skosh pedestrian.  I got the impression that he churned out the book after his first draft.  The book was mostly bereft of metaphors and vivid decriptions and scenes that jolt a story to life.  It was like watching the story in black and white rather than in technicolor.<br /><br />The story centers on two clerics--Albert Lewis (aka the \\"Reb\\") and Henry Covington who hailed from disparte back grounds.<br /><br />The Reb, a rabbi for over sixty years and a Jewish philospher of sorts, preached love and respect for people to his flock.  Knowing the Reb is to know that hope does not extinguish.  While the Reb's life was settled as a cleric long ago, Henry's rise to become a Christian pastor was unexpected.  He was an inveterate drug addict who fell into abyss after abyss, with each time came a vow to Jesus that he would change his life for the better if Jesus saved him.  It took a while, but eventually he used faith to climb out of his last abyss, and he went on to thank Jesus by deeds for saving his life.<br /><br />Both the Reb and Henry's story show the powerful impact faith can have on one's life.  But the story does not seem to offer anything unique. It is something that could be found on Oprah or the Lifetime channel.<br /><br />But I'm glad I read the book because it confirms for me that the power of faith is a wondrous thing.
B001PTG4BO|5.0|The Long Tail is well known as a book about marketing theory in an online, digital age.   The analyses of physical inventories versus online inventories is substantive food for thought for anyone (e.g. artists) with \\"stuff\\" to sell.   Anderson spends much time discussing music, CD sales, and the music business.  He does not however extend his discussions to actual songwriting (nor should he, as that is an entire discussion in and of itself in a highly specific field) when in fact they do apply quite well.    For an exploration of The Long Tail concepts in the actual creation and marketing of songs (as opposed to CDs) check out [[ASIN:097777080X Songcrafters' Coloring Book: The Essential Guide to Effective and Successful Songwriting]], one of the few (if not only) songwriting books which, like Anderson,  treats quality and appeal as separate parameters and presents them in the context of human nature.
B001OSIV62|5.0|I remember when this happened and how impossible it seemed.  It still seems impossible and watching this is all the more fascinating because I just could not believe what they did to pull it off. Absolutely brilliant.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|Don't be fooled by the costumes and scenery.  This film mutilates the greatness of the Beowulf story.  The monster is regarded as a victim, the Geat warriors a bunch of immoral thugs, and Hrothgar more evil than Grendel.  Adding insult to injury, the acting is second-rate, the scenes are joined like a broken window, and script is full of anachronism.    Disappointing, moldy cheese on an attractive platter.  Don't waste your money.
B001FB55I0|5.0|One of the best movies to come out of 2009, Terminator Salvation was exactly what the franchise needed to reinvigorate itself.  2003's Terminator 3 did for this franchise what the Maginot Line did for France in WWII: Nothing.  In fact, I'd hazard to guess the Maginot Line was at least a passive failure while Terminator 3 fell more along the lines of \\"Is there any possible way I can remove my rectum through my mouth?\\" type of epic failure.    Thankfully, Terminator Salvation rectifies this.  While not as action packed as its three predecessors, we are finally introduced to John Connor, whose very existence has been the crux of the Terminator dogma.  Exploring the initial structure of the human resistance, and its looming possibility of schism, truly gave one a sense of the scattered and desolate nature of humanity.  It also showcases a stage in the ever-changing evolution of Skynet and its slow, rumbling path towards human extinction.  Skynet isn't everywhere yet and the resistance, while holding out, still lacks the momentum, and personnel, to truly strike any critical blows against its AI antagonist.  This sets up a very well-written story and poses the question \\"What truly makes us human?\\"    The Blu-Ray transfer enhances the visual and audio experience and makes this installment a new and worthy torchbearer for the franchise.  I would highly recommend this title to anyone.
0399246665|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son, and I love the colors and the concept.  The books require the child or reader to identify shapes, numbers, colors, and first words that match one another.  Each book is a board book (there are four total), and when opened is split in half, top from bottom.   For example, there is the color blue with the word blue on the top part of the book, and you have to flip the bottom part of the book to find the picture that has a blue object.  It is easy to figure out and has directions.  The colors are vibrant with lovely looking brush strokes.   The set is definitely for beginning readers who are learning their colors and numbers.  Do not expect a story line with these books.  That is not their purpose.
B001F12J48|3.0|I was not so impressed with the 3D version of this movie.  It was not easy to watch on TV.  I was glad there was a non 3D  version enclosed.  My grandson who loves trains and went to see the Polar Express Train when it came to Midway, Utah, loves the movie and we have watched it many, many times.  He won't wear the glasses, so I have another reason for appreciating the non 3D disc.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Death Magnetic is a very solid album. Considering what Metallica had just come off of I don't think anyone was expecting a good album. It has some very cool riffing. The solos are mediocre and mostly just wah wah solos. The vocals are tolerable on all of the tracks except for \\"That Was Just Your Life\\". The instrumental Suicide And Redemption is the best on this album IMO. James had solos in this one and he really shined. In the middle of the song there's a clean breakdown that really sounds like it should've been dedicated to Burton in To Live Is To Die.    Now for the flaws. The first is the production. The clipping on this album is horrible because of how loud it was recorded. If you turn it up really loud on your stereo the guitars are so loud they completely drown out the vocals. Second is the vocals. They are easily the worst Hetfield vocals on a metallica album, time has really taken it's toll. the lyrics are laughable, very juvenile, even worse than St. Anger. \\"What don't kill ya make ya more strong\\" MASSIVE GRAMMAR AND CLICHE ALERT! Kirk's soloing is nothing special at all, pentatonics, wah pedal. Track by track:    That was just your life - 4/5 - Fast, great riffs, amazing harmony section at the end.  The End Of The Line - 5/5 - Amazing riffs! Kirk did great on this solo and the pre-solo is,again, a great harmony.  Broken Beat & Scarred - 3/5 - Some good riffing but terrible lyrics and vocals.  The Day That Never Come - 1/5 - Weakest on the album. This is a terrible attempt to recreate a song that was once successful (\\"One\\", of course).  All Nightmare Long - 5/5 - Nothing else to say it's fast and it's heavy!   Cyanide - 3/5 - Good solo, I don't really like the main riffs.   Unforgiven 3 - 5/5 - Great song! A good installment to the Unforgiven trilogy and awesome solo. Strange intro.  The Judas Kiss - 4/5 - Chorus is awesome, the main riff seems too much like some bubble gum crap though.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Inglourious Basterds is a movie for movie lovers. It is certainly a farce and a revenge fantasy, but it is brilliantly directed and acted. Some of the criticism I've seen about this movie is the same that is leveled against all WWII films that don't show Jewish suffering. \\"Downfall\\", for example. With all due respect to the people that find that offensive... WWII was about a lot more than the Holocaust, although I certainly understand the fixation. Some people want movies to be simple \\"white hats\\" vs. \\"black hats\\", where the bad guys are unambiguously evil, and the good guys are the paragons of all virtue. In other words, they want propaganda, which paradoxically is one of the central themes of this movie. Thankfully, Tarantino does not fall for this simplification. He gives us three dimensional, fully fleshed characters that you can love or hate regardless of the uniform they are wearing.    Hans Landa is the ultimate Nazi villain. Just underneath the veneer of good manners and pleasant conversation, just behind the winning smile, is a beast capable of murdering helpless women and children. His actions are more chilling because by his own confession, he really doesn't hate Jews. He persecutes them for the challenge of the \\"hunt\\" and for the intellectual satisfaction of outwitting them. The outrageously large pipe he pulls out during the interrogation of the French farmer is not a phallic symbol of sexual inadequacy, but Tarantino's tribute to Sherlock Holmes. The cinematography of the French farm scene is outstanding and the acting by Christoph Waltz should earn him an Oscar.    My favorite scene of the whole movie is the basement tavern gunfight. It was like watching an impending train wreck in slow motion. The banality of the conversation just adds to the sense of impending doom. Diane Kruger gives a surprisingly brilliant performance, as do all those involved. The slow, tortuous build up, which I'm sure many people find boring, is for me a master stroke.    As all Tarantino movies, Inglourious Basterds is also and elaborate tribute to movies. I'm not going to list all the references, but the highlight of his tribute to movies if the story between Frederick Zoeller and Shoshanna. Despite his charm and good manners, Shoshanna has an understandable dislike of the the young German war hero, who she can only see as a uniform despite Frederick insistence that he is \\"more than an uniform\\". For Shoshanna the real life Zoeller is not a human being, but one of the cogwheels of evil. It is only when she sees him in the big screen \\"acting\\", that she can recognize his humanity. She falls for the propaganda movie Frederick Zoeller instead of the real life one... with tragic consequences.    This is definitely an movie to buy and keep.

B00000IREA|5.0|When she was still young and gorgeous, Jane Fonda got the starring role in Barbarella. Barbarella is the main character in this film, who's on a space mission to locate Durand-Durand, a villain who's trying to take over the world. Barbarella wears outrageously sexy outfits, travels in a wildly decorated spaceship, and meets many strange creatures along the way, that she has to do battle with.     Barbarella's sex appeal is off-the-charts, and this film is oozing with a piping-hot erotic ambiance. Interestingly though, Barbarella has sex with other characters, in a most futuristic way. She takes a pill to 'tune-in' to her partner's psyche. And no bodily contact takes place during this sort of 'sex', except hand-clasping. Apparently, orgasm is achieved when the sex partners complete an ecstatic fusion, of their minds and souls. However, Barbarella does enjoy a sexual tryst via the 'old-fashioned way', with a man she meets during her travels.    Jane Fonda was brilliantly cast as the heroic, buxom Barbarella. Her on-screen charisma, is vibrant and compelling. Milo O'Shea as the evil Durand-Durand, does a decent job in his role. So does John Phillip Law, as the pure and gentle angel, Pygar. His perfect body and square-jawed, handsome face, made him a devilishly attractive 'angel'. Anita Pallenberg played the Great Tyrant, with femme fatale relish. The lesbian sexual undertones between her and Barbarella, were absolutely sizzling.    One of the best things about this movie, is the incredible special effects and gadgetry. Long before the flashy Star Wars series premiered, Barbarella contained some amazingly creative costumes, decorations, and scenery in general. The overall tone of this film, was deeply influenced by the uninhibited adventurous spirit, of the late 60s. Especially with regards to its bold, exciting sexual themes. For those who are Jane Fonda fans, and/or are devotees of 60s SciFi films, Barbarella is a fun-filled, juicy slice of 60s camp psychedelia.
0634060384|4.0|This book is a huge composition of hundreds of short jazz and swing songs from various decades put into simple note notation as well as simple chord suggestions listed above the treble clef for the left hand, as this book lacks a bass clef. Really, this book is the perfect tool for jazz instrumentalists and provides various chords and notes to add, improvise, and even change the key if you are eager enough, however, if you are looking for the full versions of these songs, look elsewhere, as this book contains maybe a few verses of most of the songs, with a few exceptions. This book contains really a lot of songs, many of which you probably heard or, as well as many which you probably never have heard in your life. Most of the songs are jazz composed by well-known artists like Herbie Hancock, John Coltrane, and Charlie Parker. This book is really cheap, and can be bought for around $15, making it a must buy for most jazz pianists and really leaves a lot open to the player, inspiring improvision as well as creativity. However, if you straight out want full songs and complete, accurate versions of these songs, this book is not for you, just look into Alfred's other books for those. Again though, it teaches you the basics for a lot of songs, and you can learn these all fast and as soon as you learn them you can figure out how you want to improvise and complete your version of the song. Overall, this book is big and you get so many songs that it looks like a bargain, but if you aren't really creative and want to learn how to play songs, rather than experiment with chords and styles, look into other books, this is considered a fake book and this book isn't really the nicest put together book, but for all the songs and creativity this book creates, it is worth looking at.

0385523904|5.0|As Barbara Demick says in her epilogue, North Korea is something of a mystery. How has it avoided the collapse that experts have been predicting for 15 or more years? How has it been so successful at keeping citizens ignorant of the outside world and the outside world ignorant of its machinations? And, because of these successes at insulation, is it even possible to understand what life is like in North Korea?    Fortunately, Nohing to Envy gives us a \\"yes\\" answer to this last question; here is a book where we hear the stories of six North Korean defectors. In interweaving chapters, Demick reconstructs these tales of struggle with the skill of a novelist (and anyone not told that this is a work of journalism may be forgiven for thinking it a dystopian novel a la [[ASIN:0451524934 1984 (Signet Classics)]] or [[ASIN:081297462X We (Modern Library Classics)]]).     Dr. Kim is a medical doctor, devoted to the Workers party; Mrs. Song is a wife forced to find any way she can to feed her family, including daughter Oak-Hee in increasingly dismal times; Kim Hyuck is a boy whose father gave him to a state orphanage rather than have a son he couldn't support; Jun-Sang and Mi-Ran are secretly boyfriend and girlfriend, each with private reservations about, and struggles with, North Korea that remain private for fear of governmental repurcussions. Through these tales, we are able to glimpse life in a nation gone horribly wrong, where selling anything privately or insulting the Workers Psrty can land you years of time in prison or a labor camp, where emaciated children sing songs extolling North Korea, and one's station in life is dictated by how loyal one's family has been to \\"the Party.\\" The stories are wonderfully told and, at times, I found myself putting the book down out of disbelief, outrage, and thankfulness for my own circumstances. I don't think anyone could read these stories and not feel very strongly.     Of course, Demick is also telling stories of defectors - by definition, stories about the strength of human spirit and tenacity. Nothing to Envy not only tells of economic collapse, but people's initiative in bringing about (illegal) markets to buy and sell goods. She not only tells of spirits being broken, but spirits persevering. And just as readers will certainly feel heartbreaks in these pages, so will they also feel joy in reading about some really brave people who broke the rules and thought for themeslves.     I cannot reccomend this book strongly enough! Readers of fiction (and biography) will get lost in the stories; readers of foreign affairs and political science will relish the descriptions of life under a most secret regime. Nothing to Envy is as captivating as a human story as it is informative as a political description.
031606792X|1.0|I'm almost finished with Breaking Dawn. But I have to write a review. What a mess!!! Ok here we go...    1). Wedding is done (see Bella that wasn't so hard, I mean no burning for 3 days straight or anything like that!!!), honeymoon is done (a little tactful description of at least one sex scene would not have killed Meyers), pregnancy and childbirth is done (a lot less description would've been appreciated here). Bella becomes a vampire, not only is she more beautiful and graceful, magically she has skipped the newborn vampire stage and can actually control her bloodlust even in the presence of humans. So I see Meyer still insists on insulting our intelligence.     But the thing that really got me here was Jacob imprinting on the mutant vampire/human abomination!!! What the F*$@!!! For the love of all that is holy, could he not have imprinted on someone else, anyone, preferably not connected to Bella!!!!! Even Leah would've been a more appropriate choice though by the fourth book, I'm sure even she was too good for him, since he was determined to abdicate any sense of pride and self-respect and follow Bella around like a love-sick puppy!!!     2). Am I the only one who found Leah to be the most realistic, sympathetic, well-written character in the book? I mean, here is this young beautiful girl who lost the love of her life to no other than her close cousin (almost a sister) because of some legendary destiny/fate werewolf thing called imprinting. Not only that, but she realizes that she also has the wolf gene and therefore has to spend most of her time in a testosterone-filled old wolves club where she phases back to human naked as the day she was born. Also being part of the pack means she can read all their thoughts. So not only does she have to accept the fact that she no longer has Sam but she has to be tormented day in and day out by Sam's fixation on Emily. She does all this AND performs her tasks dutifully, and the rest of them dare to wonder why she's so bitter!!! Plus this transformation has effectively finsihed off any hope she might've had of moving on with a normal life...no love, marriage, motherhood for poor Leah. I mean since Meyer was handing out happy endings left and right with complete and utter contempt for even her pathetic rules of story-telling, could she not have spared one for Leah? Something along the lines of- Leah permanently phasing back to human form, having someone or some wolf worthy of her imprint on her, promise to protect her and love her passionately and they live happily ever after. I mean Leah has had it much worse than Bella ever did.       3). Was I the only one rooting for the wolf pack to finish off the Cullens? I've been rooting for them since the second book actually. Let's review the facts, shall we? On one hand, we have a group of people who have the wolf gene that allows them to transmutate into wolves for the sole purpose of fighting vampires. A mission, a noble one at that, entrusted and handed down from generation to generation, to protect mankind. On the other hand, we have the Cullens, an aberration of nature at best, who purely out of a lifestyle choice, decide not to kill humans and drink their blood. Now people, I ask you, who do you think deserves our respect and support more???    4). What is up with this baby, Renesmee or more appropriately, Nessie? Why is everyone head over heels in love with her? I mean, she's just too creepy. She keeps growing in leaps and bounds, she drinks blood. I halfway expected her to fling herself from Bella's arms and bite Charlie in the neck. It would've made for a much more entertaining scene.  And to have Jacob pledge his heart, body and soul to her for all eternity, AND have the whole werewolf pack forget their centuries old well-placed hostility and revulsion to the vampires (their raison d'etre so to speak)because of her is just too much to wrap my head around!!!    5). At one point in the book, Bella says that she never thought she would love being married until she tried it, and that she never thought she would love being a mother until she was pregnant with the monster. So in the same logic, perhaps she doesn't know how much she'd love college until she actually tries it!!! At another point in the story, as she is contemplating her superiority and exceptional talents as a vampire she talks about how she has always been mediocre as a human and that she was born to be a vampire. Well perhaps if she had gone to college, she would've discovered hidden talents, acquired skills, enriched her mind, broadened her horizons and become a more exceptional human. I mean, after all, she and Edward could've worked on the whole human/vampire sex thing. They were doing pretty well in their honeymoon. As for the age thing, I mean yes, Edward is physically eternally 17 but technically and in actuality he is like a 108 years old!!! So why is she tripping???    I won't even dignify the whole Volturi scene with a commentary....    Stephanie, please finish writing Midnight Sun (Twilight from Edward's point of view) and publish it. I read the rough draft of the first 12 chapters, and let me tell u, it is better than New Moon, Eclipse and Breaking Dawn put together!!! Perhaps when you redeem yourself with Midnight Sun, your readers will forgive you for subjecting them to those three completely unnecessary books.     As for me, I hope that years from now, on a rainy day, when I have nothing better to do, I will once again pick up Twilight and read it, pretending that the entire saga ended with Bella and Edward dancing in their prom, locked in each other's arms, locked in their impasse forever....

B00004XOWM|5.0|One star reviews.. you're embarrassing. Limp Bizkit is(was)composed of an aswesome drummer, an awesome creative guitarist, a very good sampler/turn tablist and a childish yet catchy vocalist. Anyone who'd get up and actually say they have never enjoyed a Limp Bizkit song has their head too far up their own ass to know any better. The fact that you hate mainstream culture and genre mixing and pop culture does not make up for your lack of personality. This album was, is and will always be awesome. Perhaps, not in the vein of technical complexity ala Death or Cynic, but still, always a fun listen. Never a dull moment. Five stars all the way.
0451196716|5.0|Like all of the other Stephen King books that I have read I was deeply moved when I finished this. The plot is straight forward and simple enough. One hundred teenage boys are selected in an alternative history United States to begin walking at a marker in Maine (the typical King setting) and to continue walking until only one is left. If you drop below four MPH you get a warning. If you get more than three warnings in a three hour period you'll get your \\"ticket.\\" A strange premise indeed, but in the hands of King you'll begin to understand how even the most mundane things (like walking) can become seen as horrific and scary.     This book bears a close resemblance to another King book written as Richard Bachman, The Running Man.  The main themes of American voyeurism and our obsession with violence, games, and reality T.V. are explored. In fact this book feels like a spin off to that novel, which is definitely a good thing.     The less you know about this book the better. What I will say is that the characters are very well written and quite believable. The social dynamics that develop among the young walkers is both fascinating and disturbing and will keep your mind occupied even when your not reading.

1594202249|3.0|The thread of a 70s, druggie P.I. is good, but it goes nowhere very slowly. And as much as I appreciate Pynchon's fun of playing with multiple universes, it has no place in this novel (even if he masks it as a drug trip). Instead of this novel, stick to Robert... Crais' P.I., Elvis Cole, for P.I. reading.
B001GCUNW6|3.0|I watched the movie on standard dvd and loved it but the blu ray for some reason wouldn't work or at least the sound didn't function properly. The previews were all fine but once the feature started it was loud and noisy and distorted. I returned and received another in exchange with the same result. I tested it on another LG blu ray at the store I bought my LG blu ray player from and it did the same thing. I then brought it in as a rental from netflix and same thing. So LG owners beware. The movie itself is the best of the series imo.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|\\"Avatar\\"<br />Directed by James Cameron<br />(2009)<br />----------------------------------------<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and was very glad that I got to see it in the theater, rather than on DVD.  That's part of what's great about this movie, that it so powerfully and so clearly makes the case for film as a medium which, at its best, HAS TO be seen on the big screen.  I am not a huge fan of James Cameron's work (\\"Aliens\\" was fun; I loathed \\"Titanic\\") but I was really wowed by this one.  It's a true spectacle and, in its finest moments, will have you on the edge of your seat, rivited by what you see onscreen.<br /><br />Sure, as has been pointed out by many reviewers, the film is largely a pastiche of other films and themes -- \\"Pocohontas,\\" \\"Eragon,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"Dances With Wolves...\\" (even a bit of Disney's Pixie Hollow/Tinkerbell franchise...)  But it is brought together in supreme popcorn munching fashion -- this is a great Hollywood film with a powerful visual sense that is truly breathtaking. The political messages -- a critique of corporate greed, imperialism and ecological despoilation -- is admittedly simplistic, but frankly a breath of fresh air in a time when the post-9/11 patriotism is giving way to a confused disorientation and loss of direction for America.  In the packed theater I attended, some of it seemed to fall -- not on deaf ears, exactly -- but to a muted response, as if modern viewers have been given so few points of reference for this sort of eco-friendly messaging that they weren't quite sure how to respond.  But there was no way they could misinterpret it: Cameron clubs viewers over the head with the bluntest possible script, but we are so busy being overwhelmed by the sumptuous special effects and vibrant color palette that no one really minds.  Character development may suffer as a result, but the film as a whole is nothing short of dazzling.  I could have done with a little less of the shoot-em-up action at the end, but I was rooting for the good guys and moved by their victory. Who could ask for more?  I think I'm gonna go see it again.

159102594X|5.0|I find it rather insulting that a professional literary reviewer described this book as \\"muddled\\". Abercrombie does a wonderful job of describing the characters as he develops them, the context, and the world. Few fantasy books have made me laugh out loud thanks to the character dialog or the narration - this has happened multiple times w/\\"The Blade Itself\\". The action and battle scenes are gritty, gory, realistic. Think \\"John Ringo\\". The characters are vivid and interesting. Think \\"Tolkein\\" without the boring bits. The writing makes compelling reading. I can hardly wait to dig into \\"Before They Are Hanged\\" and \\"The Last Argument Of Kings\\". Frankly, I'm already beginning to wonder whether there will be a follow-on book or series from the trilogy!

B002RSDW80|3.0|If this had only been a doccudrama about Julia Child's enduring impact on history and culture (Iron Jawed Angels, Warm Springs...etc) we would have been okay.<br /><br />But the script recipe lacked coherent direction AND had a unneccessry character thrown in. It seemed like 'Julie' was merely inserted to make Julia's life seem 'current' and hip to the viewing audience.<br /><br />This inadvertently established and then reinforced an incorrect assumption that people are unable to gennuinely learn from each other, irrespective of our generations. I am among the people who felt she was an uneccessary ingredient in this film.<br /><br />Much like the Julia who becomes dimissive of her younger admirer, the screenwriters gloss over Julia's background in a McCarthy Era civil service--to the film's detriment.<br /><br />In today's 'security concious' era, having the background in that part of the story would have provided important and substantive ideas to chew on. How much protection is too much?<br /><br />The scenes where Child is sitting before the McCarthy 'anticommunist' committee are really chilling! Perhaps we're going back to that point in time without actually wanting to openly acknowllege it.<br /><br />And they never actually examine the MANY obstacles which she had to encounter in order to learn her 'traditional' craft and then peddle it to the 'happy homemaker'.<br /><br />Contrasting with the idylic image which this woman successfully projected through books and television, she was a serious business worker. She understood what it took for women to succeede in the business world because she was herself trying to break through against tremendous odds.<br /><br />Had this script been allowed to cook for a while longer before having hit the theaters--audiences would have had a very delicious dish to feast on.

And many refer to it as a Fairy Tale and yet for me, personally, I viewed it as something very real, and THAT is what made it magical.

B002E9HACG|4.0|Indeed, there is little doubt IMHO that this is the best, the most complete and sumptuous slab of wattage Europe have unleashed since they reconvened. Start From the Dark had it's moments but the rusty interplay was a bit obvious in that John Norums riffs and Joey Tempests vox seemed utterly disconnected on many numbers. Secret Society was a good album, no doubt about it. But this is a touch better. It hangs together much like Secret Society did but it has a certain X factor and I can understand why some people are giving this the full five star treatment.<br /><br />On this album Europe does a range of things right. The prelude sets the tone for the whole album, a nifty little intro number of the sort you may more normally expect from a power metal band. The title track itself is a sturdy hard rocker where all things gel nicely. Elsewhere we get some interesting keys/riff/vox interplay on tunes such as No Stone Unturned which at times seems like a song with some form of multiple personality disorder as the chorus swoops on a Tempest vocal hook while Norum warbles away in the background and Mic Micheali comes over all 70's prog tinged during the lulls. Other noteworthy numbers are the funky U Devil U which personally I find a bit twee though it's hard to argue with the amount of roll it gives you with your serving of rock.<br /><br />The production isn't as warm and traditional sounding as Secret Society but that's not to say it's not as good, just things seem more ..... shiny here. The booklet comes with full lyrics and I was lucky enough to score the version with a couple of bonus tracks. Don't get too carried away on this however as neither are new songs, rather live renditions of a) Yesterdays News and b) Wake Up Call.<br /><br />All up this is a fine, fine effort that has seen the band very much back in the spotlight - Classic Rock gave this 8/10 and even Metal Hammer(UK) were being nice to the band not to mention their headlining of the Bloodstock Festival to much internet consternation. If you were ever a fan of this band it's probably a good idea to grab this CD as it will become a trusted companion in the car, the office and around the home such is it's utility. Almost five stars.ion.

0439023483|5.0|Plot Summary:  The Hunger Games is about a bleak, post-apocalyptic world where the government ruthlessly controls the population through the glorified, televised deaths of children who are drafted from the twelve districts that make up Panem.  Katniss Everdeen comes from district 12, the poorest outpost where they mine the coal that keeps the Capitol bright with power.  Since the age of eleven she's been the head of the household, keeping her mother and sister fed through her cunning as a hunter, and now at the age of sixteen, she steps in when her younger sister's name is called during a reaping for the Hunger Games competition.    Wow.  This is the book that has convinced me that young adult novels are worth trying.  Seriously, this is too good to leave to the teens.  They can have Twilight as far as I'm concerned, but this story will appeal to anyone who loves adventure, romance, and awe-inspiring courage in the face of enormous evil.      The plot is not unique, but that does not diminish the power of The Hunger Games, and if anything Suzanne Collins has upped the ante by putting children in a to-the-death competition.  It's an appalling, but entirely plausible proposition within this totalitarian nation that's rebuilt on the ruins of North America.  The games are a means of keeping the populace in line, and reminding them that even their children are not safe.  When Katniss volunteers to take the spot her sister drew in the games, it is the first of many moments when she rebelled against the system, and took back an infinitesimal amount of control.    Katniss is a wonderful heroine, and at the age of sixteen she has the maturity of a much older woman.  Children grow up quickly in this dog-eat-dog world, and while she may know how to hunt, trade, and take care of her family, she knows nothing of love, which blinds her the feelings of someone close by.  I don't want to blow it for new readers, but there is a real love story that becomes a critical part of this book, and from what I can tell, the sequel as well.    If love is not your thing, then read this for the thrilling adventure that ensues every day that Katniss is battling for her life within the game.  I could not put this down, and I read it all in one go, because I had to know what happened next.  [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] is the next book in the series, and I absolutely cannot wait to find out what happens next.

B002DYKP88|4.0|How fortunate I am to have waited for a good copy of this movie.  I'd seen the final section on TV and knew I wanted to buy it, but so many people report having technical difficulty with the CDs they buy, that when I did find a copy it turned out to be perfect.  Luck, no?  But then, I was doubly fortunate because I found a good Chinese Video and book store with a large rental area, as well as a small but knowledgable staff who could guide me through the many titles I recognized and wanted, as well as the superabundance of those titles I did not recognize at all.  And in Phoenix, of all places.  Phoenix, which doesn't even have a Chinatown.  Or even one Chinese movie house.  (Gasp!)  And, coincidentally, I bought a copy of the Tan Dun orchestral suite from HERO a month or so before from Amazon.    A pity, but the film is too complex to review comprehensively.  I feel sure my Amazon readers don't want an monograph, certainly not on anything as esoteric as this ancient tale of China before it became what it is today.  One imagines the legends on which this story is based must go back several thousand years, and these characters' lives must, therefore, have taken on a patina of imortality if only because like most of the lives of the ancients, these heroes and their adventures have been written about at various times by many different people; they have become part folklore and part literature.  We cannot see the real people clearly through the mists of historic tradition, though we can be fairly certain of their existence.    There is no plot in HERO, and some will be disappointed and puzzled.  The film illuminates a tale or legend and is based on a time when the first (or if not the first then one of the first) Emperor(s) of China was busy conquering neighboring states, in order to incorporate them into his own.  We know it happened.  We know the effort was successful and that it took a very long time and cost many lives.  We know as well that the Emperor was opposed,and this story, HERO describes four individuals who attempted to assassinate him.  There was no over-arching, altruistic or political reason.  They wanted to kill him in order to avenge the states he conquered and subjugated; their own states.  The men are Silver Spear (played by a tall, skillful martial artist and specialist with the lance whose name I cannot recollect) Broken Sword, played by Tony Leung, and No-Name, played by Jet-Li.  There is a single female assassin called Flying Snow, played with astonishing skill by Maggi Chun, and there is a young female apprentice played by the dazzlingly beautiful dancer, swordswoman and actress, Zhang Ziyi.  These individuals will attempt to work out their murderous strategems in various ways and differeng places throughout the film.      However, the attempted assassination is not all the movie shows; it is not even all the movie is about; there is at least one passionate, heroic love within the assassin's group; the love of Flying Snow and Broken Sword.  This working out of the story is not told in a linear fashion.  It is as though the ambiguities of the legend of the attempted assassination demanded to be told and retold, in various ways, from differing angles.  There is no right or wrong way, and certainly no direct way.  So, that makes it challenging to watch.  The story is not complicated, really.  It's quite easy to understand.  It is essentially, a love story told against a background of intense political danger, but you must give in to it on its own terms, the way you do when you liswten to a Brukner Symphony.    For me, there are three creative elements to look for, particularly.  Or at least I focus on these three.  The first and easiest is the decor.  The designers have found a way to imbue all the surrounds, interior and exterior, with a feeling of what the ancient Chinese buildings, walls, pillars and architectural passageways must have looked like, by concentrating the design elements on the peculiar characteristics of antique ceremonial bronzes.  This makes for a look of intense but exquisite savagery.    The second element proceeds out of the first:  It is Calligraphy.  One sees rows of glyphs, or proto-characters all in little boxes, on many surfaces -- as well as stylized dragon or monster faces -- that remind you that Chinese, the longest continually used of all human languages, was carved or engraved on strips of bamboo which were sewn together into mats, and rolled up.  These crude scrolls became the first books before paper was invented, and several important scenes in this movie take place in large rooms, or libraries, actually, where stacks of thousands of these rolled-up scrolls form columns a dozen feet high.       This movie has as one of its crucial or plot elements, the ancient art of Calligraphy, itself, you see.  Chinese literacy is thousands of years old, I know as do you, yet truthfully, I have never in my life seen any film or play that dealt as  intently with the crucial skill of Calligraphy, or writing, or simply, Literacy itself.  Not anywhere.  Not depicting any era.  In fact, so important is writing to the story (and obviously to the Chinese) there is a battle scene about it.    At one point, we find that No-Name has joined the other assassins at a city that is under seige by the Emperor.  The approch of the armies is immenent.  The townspeople have fled, all of them but the assassins (one of whom is an eminent teacher in the Academy of Calligraphy) and his young apprentice, Jade.  But all the assassins are fugitives.    In one of a number of impressive displays of directorial talent, the Director uses his heavily armed and seemingly limitless army of thousands of extras with a kind of virtuosity in moving big, armed men, that reminds me of the first time I saw Mike Ditka whip the Bears heavyweights into moving formations behind the line of scrimmage, before making a play.  The speed, the precision: It's simply indescribable!  How do you rehearse a thousand men (and horses) and get them to move like one, on a signal?  Somehow it is done and we see how that ancient army used the compound bow -- and its far more impressive than at Agincourt -- and a hail of arrows falls on the Academy.  Arrows pierce the rooves, the walls; they wound and terrify students, until the oldest teacher enters and paying no attention to the rain of death, finds his place and fearlessly continues to draw his characters in his practice sandbox.  The studdents return to their desks, though the arrows continue to fall.  Abruptly, Flying Snow decides to take charge.  Distaining assistance she runs outside, leaps on the roof, and like a whirling wheel of red, with her sword combats and defects vast numbers of arrows.  No-Name too joins her on the roof and he deflects hundreds if not thousands of them too.  And here, something happens that I have never seen or imagined in my life:  Downstairs, Tony Leung, Broken Sword, standing over his calligraphic sand sketching box, begins to draw in the sand with his rod in a kind of frenzy of motion, matching Flying Snow and No-Name on the roof.  His garments, his hair, everything flies as though he were in a storm, and his movements are incredible.  Apparently, in his frenzy of writing, he is, by matching the efforts of his comrades on the roof, equaling (the effects of) theirs to such a degree that the attacking army is defeated or exhausted, and marches away.  It's inexplicable, but God! it is something to watch!  Tony Leung in a caligraphic frenzy is a unique sight.  It is no wonder he is an international star.    Sometimes I wonder what would have happened had Western or European sword-fighting, become blended into formal court dancing; which is to say into the intricate athleticism of Ballet?  It never happened, of course, but if it had, and if the intellectual understanding of warfare in all its forms had blended, at that level,  we might have inherited the kind of glorious, dancing exercise and skill in manoeuvering and battlefield strategy that the Chinese and Japanese know as Martial Arts in all its forms.  Sun Tzu, one of the great historical figures of Chinese military history wrote about THE ART OF WAR, and others throughout time and in differing countries have spoken and written about that art.  But here, HERO's director chooses to focus on the various aspects of war, themselves, of battle and fighting and to offer them to us artistically treated -- in other words, not the old Samurai-Ninja battles we've all seen so often and loved so much, but -- something very rare, very unusual.  And that's the third aspect of this film that catches my imagination; the successful effort to elevate swordplay to a high performing art.  And it involves the extreme beauty of the weaponry used by the characters, as well.  Sword collectors around the world must covet Jet-Li's engraved and slotted weapon.    There are a number of battles and engagements throughout the movie, weaponry drills, and manoeuvers of large numbers of armed troops with horses, and they're all worth watching.  Even the Emperor fences well.  And one could go on and on about the armaments themselves; the beauty of finish and finesse of design.  But, particularly, I want to recommend a combat that takes place between No-Name and Silver Spear, rather early in the film.  It happens on a rainy afternoon in a pavillion garden, while a blind old beggar-man strums a zither.  Ultmately, it's all about poise, spiritual poise; that is, symbolized by raindrops, the spaces between not only the movements of your body and your weapon, but the spaces between your visualizations of your struggle and its outcome.  The Master Swordsman, Jet-Li fights the way Picaso painted.  He never squints.  His eyes are always wide open.    The second great duel I want to mention, takes place between Broken Sword and No-Name, over a small pavillion in a lake, late one summer afternoon.  Now, Flying Snow lies dead on a couch,and Broken Sword watches over her.  (It is part of the story that they have been lovers and that No-Name came between them and contrives  both their deaths.)  The pastoral scenery is absolutely magnificent; still, peaceful, ideal.  No-Name appears and the duel begins.  It is an exhibition of probably the very best ariel-assisted duelinhg that can be done on film today, with no surrounding trees or bamboo to echo the fighters' movements.  Instead, the combatants, appear to fly back and forth through the air over the lake and the pavillion, their draperies flapping and their silouhettes changing as they vary their fighting poses, swooping and diving like birds.  And then, somehow, because they never at any time land on earth, or touch the water with their toes, the tips of their swords slash it's surface in the way some birds drink, on the wing.  It is not in any way real, or realistic, rather it is fabulous and metaphoric in the true sense.  Flying drops of water from one sword are cut in air and hurled back by another.  Turning from the duel, and abandoning his sword, Leung flies to the side of the dead woman in time to brush away the solitary drop of water on her cheek.  No-Name leaves.  It is over.    I saw it once, watched it twice, very, very carefully.  I had to see if I'd seen what I'd seen, and now, tonight, a week later, it came to me: what my intuition told me.  I had been watching a poem, and or a song.  I didn't know what the poem was, but it was probably ancient or at least venerable, and might have had to do with Swallows on a Lake, or Devotion.  And it came to me only an hour ago, from the past.  On the face of a Blue Willow Ware plate, when I was a child, I'd first noticed two kissing swallows in the sky, flying over a pavillion.  I didn't know; did it have a meaning?  And instantaneously I realized I'd seen that motif many, many times in blue Canton Ware. Yes!  It meant something and derived from keen observation of birds and deification of Nature.And here, the director was discovering it again and showing it in a completaly new way, combining the art of the sword and Cinema.    All these new films, and this one as well, they do not merely entertain; they open worlds.

B00004VVND|5.0|Even though the Terminator had better special effects, I still remember getting the [...] scared out of me from Yul Brynner's menacing walk as a small child. He just wouldn't stop! And, sure enough, that was no coincidence that the terminator mirrored Westworld. The same director did both movies, Michael Crichton. Well, son-of-a-gun! The stuff I don't know as a child sure creates a big impact. Even though I love to watch all the extras that are on movies nowadays, it's very fortunate I didn't have access to all this new technology back then. It would've spoiled the thrill when I was little; I'm only speaking about myself, of course. What a great movie!<br /><br />1-06-10 Update<br />I made an error stating Michael Crichton directed the Terminator. A reviewer mentioned that James Cameron directed The Terminator. I looked up IMDB and found out that Michael Crichton wrote the screenplay for Jurassic Park (1993). Now it makes sense. Both are future thrill parks, and something terribly wrong happens involving terror to the guests. Yul Brynner is still the original Terminator in my mind. Have fun watching the movies!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The Season 4 finale was outstanding.  I was getting tired of all the \\"domesticity\\" being foisted on Dexter and Rita was starting to really annoy me.  Am a long-time admirer of John Lithgow and he did an outstanding job.  What's up with Dexter's hair -- at times he looked like he was wearing a wig, and not a very good one.  Particularly enjoyed the episode with Zoey Kruger.  A more detailed story line revolving around a female serial killer would be a good plot idea for Season 5.  Quinn is no Doakes but he also could prove interesting for Season 5.  Debra's involvement with Antoinne was a low point for her character.  Could we have one season where Debra keeps her pants on?  I say less focus on the stupid kids (Astor, Cody and Harrison).  Dexter needs to concentrate on building his slide collection, which made Season 1 so diverse and entertaining, and totally hooked me on this unique and excellent series.  Your writers are terrific!
0789318121|5.0|My husband got this book for me for Christmas, as I am a huge fan of The Dark Knight and Batman Begins.  It was very interesting how the makers of the Dark Knight described the batsuit and how they came up with the underground batcave.  I have just begun reading it.  There are many great photos and some interesting artwork.  The script does account for a large part of the book, but I enjoyed it as well, as I love to write in my spare time.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the book.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|I went to the (awesome!) Boston concert in July 2008, so I have been anxiously awaiting this video's release.  The London show is nearly the same as the Boston show, with very slight additions and subtractions to some of the setlist.  The sound quality seems fine to me, as is the video quality.  I thought this was a great show!  This is a two-disc set: Disc One is the concert; Disc Two includes a very amusing documentary (which really highlights George's personality) and bonus tracks.  If you are a George fan as I have been for 25+ years, I do not think you will be disappointed.  He is an amazing entertainer, hands down!!
B001GWK2MC|3.0|I bought this for my two boys,ages 3 and 2. They love it.they want to play in it all the time since they got it on Dec 25th 09. Well today is Dec. 27th 09 and i just had to patch it for the first time. The bottom were they bounce on got a hole in it. My boys are not heavey,they jump in it with bare feet, and NO toys go inside it with them. So it lasted 3 days before i had to patch it. But the boys do love it. Lets see how long it lasts.

For the most part, it is just a compilation of portrait shots that have been taken countless times before        several pages are completely blank which doesn't help anything

1416550534|4.0|This was a very good book.  The author does a great job of moving back and forth between the present and the flashbacks - the story flows and keeps you hooked.  The details about life in that time period help you understand the motivations of the characters.  The book isn't predictable - you never really know what happened that night by the lake until the very end.  It also doesn't wrap everything up - which keeps it real.  I read Forgotten Garden which was good.  This was better.
1580084621|5.0|I got this recommend from Savuer and is it ever a home-run for Thai Cooking.  The ONLY book you will need on Thai.  For the novice I recommend a trip to your local Asian market, you have a 95% chance of finding all the ingredients and they will be fresher and cheaper.  The beautiful thing about our Asian market is that not only can you locate hard to find ingredients but we also discovered FRESHER vegetables and fish then in our local upscale market.<br /><br />This book is easy to follow and quite intuitive.  My 13 year old daughter has had no problems following the recipes, and neither will you.  Enjoy!

B0026P3G12|5.0|This is the most FABULOUS CD I have purchased in a long time!! Words can not describe how great this CD is!!  It is one in a million!!
B002SJIO4A|5.0|DISTRICT 9 is one of the most innovative sci-fi films of the decade.  Producer Peter Jackson and director Neill Blommkamp have fashioned a visceral examination of social mores and intolerance that resonates even when the movie morphs into the standard shootemup.  The effects are stunning and the shift from its documentary style beginning to its action packed finale, the movie packs an emotional wallop with an allegorical message and some touches of humor along the way.  Newcomer Sharlto Copley is brilliant as the bureaucrat forced to run for his life and join forces with the aliens.<br />DISTRICT 9 is a marvelous film and highly recommended.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|Day One:  John Lennon says 'I want to sound like I'm on a mountain top, chanting like a monk.  Go!'  Enter the creative genius of Geoff Emerick.      Obviously, many, many wonderful talents came together to create the powerhouse that was The Beatles, but often overlooked in the John/Paul sometimes George, etc. struggle is the young engineer at EMI, Geoff Emerick.    If you'd like to know what it felt like in those Beatles sessions-the lonely times in the tape room for overdubs (it was very hot with all that gear!), the last great session tracking the guitar solo's in Carry that Weight/The End, the lifelong friendship between Geoff & Paul; this is the book for you.    It felt as though I was drinking tea with The Beatles in an early session.  Who could ask for more?    Oh, and this book will make the value of both the old, unchanged recordings as well as the new remasters abundantly clear.  The hits, the misses, the re-takes, everything.  It renewed my interest yet again!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The beautiful God-given voice that He has given Susan Boyle shines through every song of this CD. Each song shares the heart and integrity of Susan and reaches to the very soul of the listener. I Dreamed A Dream is of the highest quality in all respects.
0451208706|4.0|Bravo.     Have you ever found yourself rooting for an assassin? Well, fasten your seatbelts.     Follett has created a wonderful character in Feliks.  He's a lover of Alexander Pushkin's literature, lover of culture, art and history - as well as a fabulous lover in bed - he bleeds passion for his love and for his cause. But Feliks is also a hardened criminal. Often misunderstood. Shipped to Siberia and tortured all because he fell in love with a girl of a higher social status.     Follett sets this tumultuous novel as Europe is on the brink of WWI - The summer of 1914. Germany had already been preparing for war, both to the east and to the west. Defeat or victory appears to lie within the hands of the Russians.  The Russians sends the Czar's nephew, Prince Orlov, to England to investigate and negotiate a treaty in secrecy.     But a group of anarchist, with spies in the Russian Secret Police, finds out about Prince Orlov's secret meeting. The anarchists feel the Czar is trying to drag innocent Russian peasants into fighting a war they neither care about, nor believe in.     So to prevent disaster, the anarchists send the infamous Feliks Kschessinsky to assassinate Prince Orlov. But when Feliks arrives to England, he finds secrets from his past that threaten to get in the way of his mission.     As the lies, deceit, betrayal, adultery, abound, you will be given a front-row seat to the decisions that unleashed WW1 and a look into the lives of the people who called the shots.     There were other characters there weren't as fleshed out, namely, Prince Orlov, the man who Feliks is trying to assassinate. If I knew more about Orlov, his fate would have mattered to me more - but since I know nothing about him, except that he's the Czar's nephew, I could care less about what happens to him. That was the only minor flaw I found with the book.     So while the novel was MASTERFULLY plotted and wonderfully paced, the writing did become a bit dense and dry at times. But that'sjust nitpicking.     Feliks Kschessinsky is a Great Romantic Russian Hero that you may remember long after reading The Man from St. Petersburg.
B002UEW31I|5.0|Loved the action and the movie kept moving the whole time.  Pitt was pretty convincing, he pronounced Maynardville, TN authentically, (its tough to do).
6305428425|5.0|The title really says it all. Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is about two ditzy girls from Tucson, AZ who moved to Los Angeles after high school. When it's time for their 10 year reunion they find themselves single, underemployed and generally unimpressive. They set out to make themselves, and the last 10 years, over to impress everyone at the reunion. Their plan pretty much fails and typical high school rivalries re-ignite in a hilarious chain of events that is quite possibly one of the best, mindless comedy movies of the 1990's.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Thank you Blokus!    We have a multi generational living situation in our home and had decided collectively to play more games as a family. I bought this as a gold box deal during the holiday season 2009.  The price was sixty percent off of Amazon's listed retail price.  The discount caught my eye but it was the 4 and 5 star reviews by over 400 people that sold me immediately.  We got around to playing it today and we all had a blast.      The first game was played by myself, my four year old son, and my mother whose left side (and right brain) has been paralyzed by a stroke.  The tiles take a delicate hand to place.  Perfect for fine motor skills for both my 4yo and my mom!  A lot of forethought and strategy involved.  My 4 year old won the first game with the help of both his mother and his grandmother.  My 10 year old beat me the rest of the night.      Everyone that did play really enjoyed the game.  I hope I can update this review when my 16yo and husband play.  I have no doubt they will both enjoy it.  If it goes back down to the price I paid during the gold box deal I will stock up and give this game as gifts to my siblings, in laws, and their families.  Perfect as a hostess gift or a housewarming gift too!     For two players the instructions state to use all four sets of tiles.  One player could easily play with the goal of placing all the tiles.  As a matter of fact I should go do that now.  I have to beat my 10yo.

B001UHOWXI|2.0|At the time I write this review, there are 555 reviews posted for the this Blu-ray version and 555 reviews for the 60th Anniversery DVD version. How is it possible for Amazon to have the same amount of reviews for a Blu-ray that is barely a month old and a DVD that is 3 years old. There is only one way, Amazon takes the DVD reviews and puts them under the Blu-ray product. I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but this practice borderlines false advertising. It's wrong, especially classic movies like this where the movie sells its self.<br /><br />Amazon has to stop doing this practice. Please start listening to us customers, and please review the exact product we are researching for purchase. We especially want to know the quality of the Blu-ray against the DVD version. There are many Blu-ray versions out there that are not worth the purchase. In fact, the DVD played in a Blu-ray player actually looks and sounds better than the Blu-ray version. We will respect and trust Amazon reviews far more and you will have more loyal customers for it. I want to buy this product. Do I buy the Blu-ray or the 2006 DVD? After 555 reviews - I have no idea!!!
B001GCUO4S|2.0|Visually, it's a nice movie. The special effects have increased since the last ones. I don't like that they used more CGI blood/gore for the shots instead of using practical elements.<br />Acting, bad. The younger actors have no talent! They don't seem to have the same appeal as the actors from the other movies. Barely any character within the characters, and when they do, it's the same as the other movies(jock, slutty girls, good girl, weird person, etc.), predictable.<br />The deaths, original, yet boring. Unlike the other movies, the deaths are pretty boring, and unrealistic, though yes the other movies were pretty unrealistic (besides #1), they were believeable enough not to point them out.<br />It seems like there was no character interactions. They would go after each person and then they would die. The characters were just pawns to have more bloody deaths.<br />Overall, I give it a 2/5. Good visuals, original deaths, yet boring and perdictable characters, and bad acting.<br />The only reason I would buy this film is to finish my collection, though I think it should have stopped at #3, with what it had.
B002T921AC|5.0|You guys gotta calm don on the reviews here. Why would you write here if you hate him? Don't click on here if you don't like here. He does have some inappropriate lines in \\"Love Me\\" and it's actually not that bad. So yeah haters don't watch his videos and make stupid comments if you hate him.I recommend you do buy this. <3
B00260HH3K|1.0|You know, just why would they make this movie into a live action film? The movie and Anime are not identical in any way, I mean 'any way'. I would steer clear from buying or renting this film. I would rather recommend seeing the movie for free over the net.     My kids are big fans of the Anime series and they hated this movie with the passion.    During the movie, My kids asked me, \\"We want to go home mommy, this is not Dragonball\\". I told them ok, and told them I totaly agreed with them, it wasn't Dragonball. I talked to the manager before we left the theater demanding a full refund. He gladly give me my money back with out any problem. I Was happy he did because this movies was no where near worth the $50.00, I dished out to see this movie. I used that money to take the kids out to eat instead. I should of done this in the first place then taking my kids to see this crap of a movie.     If they are going to transfer these type of Anime movies over to the big screen. They really need to do their home work first before they start making anything. I couldn't believe how badly this movie turned out with all the material they have on Dragonball.    It wasn't made for the fans or the hardcore fanatics.    Dragonball is one of those movies that was made just to for the money, nothing else. Getting kids to think they are seeing what they want but turns out it isn't. But the directors still make a profit even it it's a bad movie.     It's sad to see where they are taking movies now a days. I do recommended reading reviews first before dishing out money. -=Kaity=-

0156027321|3.0|When I picked up this book, it was like giving in to peer pressure.  ALL, and I do mean all, of my friends that enjoy literature have read this book.  I am constantly trying to be one step ahead in my reading, so I didn't want to follow in everyone else's footsteps and read a book simply because they did.  I waited a considerable amount of time for the buzz to die down, then I picked it up for half price at a used bookstore.  It certainly had to be worth $3.50, right?    I am very thankful that I paid $3.50 for it, no more, no less.  I got about $3.50 of enjoyment out of it.  The thoughts on religion were very profound, but the sequences on the life raft seemed to go on and on.  Pi is a participant in three major religions, making him a walking controversy.  He does not see why he can not participate in all three of these, and by the end of the novel, it is clear that Pi has chosen the best aspects of all of the religions, and there is a lesson in that for all of us.    Sadly, all the sequences on the life raft are incredibly lengthy.  The book could have cut about 50 pages, and certainly not lost any of its charm and lesson.  I really don't need to know how to carve open a sea turtle or exactly what is in the contents of a life boat hatch.      Overall, I would recommend this book to others, just not to purchase.  Borrow it from somebody else.  I guarantee that someone, if not several people, who you know owns it.  The book is great in the beginning and the ending, but the middle section is just too lengthy.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|This is a great toy!  We purchased it on Amazon for our 2 yr old son, who is really into vehicles right now.  We gave it to him for Christmas, and he has played with it non stop for the last 3 days, it is the first thing he asks about when he wakes up.  The toy says it is for ages 3 and up, and there are parts of it that he doesn't quite have the motor skills to manuver yet (like the elevator crank, and replacing the ramps when they come off) but he is certainly enjoying it now and will grow into it in the next year or so.  We are planning on getting more parts of this city series!!    After reading other reviews, I think we are going to glue down the ramps, the only thing that frustrates our son is when the ramps come off and he can't put them back.      Check out the product dimensions, our son doesn't put things in his mouth any more, but if you had a 2 yr old that still chews on toys the wheels on the cars might be a choking hazzard.

044024238X|4.0|I always read at least several of the reviews that my colleagues have posted before me, trying to get a feel for what has been said before and what is yet to be said.  I try to read several reviews of people who loved it, and people who hated it.  Often I am impressed with what my fellow reviewers have to say, and even build upon some of their ideas to complete my review.      Unfortunately, as I flip through these reviews, I find little guidance for my own.  The people that loved it loved it for predictable reasons - the main character's gumption, the hunky leading man - and the people who hated it raised their feminist flags and stomped around.  What sort of woman would quit her high powered job to become a maid?  What type of woman would have never ironed a shirt or cooked a meal?  This is completely unrealistic!!!    It's not that far of a stretch.  There are many woman that feel pressured to follow in the footsteps of their parents, even if that means following them into a career that they don't enjoy at all.  If Samantha's mother was as high-powered as she is presenting, do you really think that she would take the time to teach Samantha how to iron or cook?  Do you think that she really even does those things for herself?  I didn't think so.    And burnout is absolutely a great reason to quit a job, and an incredibly strong motivator in our world.  I know a ton of people who have thought about and actually quit their jobs for that reason.    Overall, this is a book that is a ton of fun.  Are you going to have important life discoveries and be profoundly moved?  Probably not.  Not every book has to be a classic!  Just enjoy it for what it is, not what it's not.
B001UV4XWO|4.0|My friend and I spent some considerable discussion time trying to find reasons for so many poor reviews for this film. There is one thing we both agree on: The Box is an auditory focused film. In fact, with only minor adjustments to the script, it would make a great radio play. So, unless you are committed to paying a great deal of attention to every word spoken, you are bound to get lost and confused by the complex plot. In these times of short attention spans, this is an obstacle the film makers may not have taken into consideration... Pity, as the film is actually quite original and the story intriguing.<br /><br />The Box is based on a 1970 short story \\"Button, Button\\" by Richard Matheson (also the author of the celebrated \\"I Am Legend\\"). A financially overextended middle class couple receives a package containing a box with a button. A strange and grossly disfigured man later visits their house and explains should they choose to press the button, they will receive $1mil, tax free. The drawback? Someone they do not know will die. The couple's actions following the man's visit, as well as the consequences of their actions, constitute the meat of the story. The why's and the who's are mostly explained, though some questions are purposefully left for each viewer's imagination to tackle. The performance is satisfactory from all leads, except Cameron Diaz. She overacts in every scene, to the point of becoming a distraction. Her casting played a major part in my downgrading the rating to 3.5 stars.<br /><br />If you feel you can ignore Diaz and focus on every word of dialogue, you will be rewarded with some original thinking and a somewhat creepy film. I was entertained.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I can't tell you [literally because I don't know you] how many movies I have purchased that supposedly had \\"extras\\" or \\"special features\\" that left me feeling...empty. So often they are just thrown together scraps or something that just didn't feel like anyone cared. Star Trek has sweeping graphics and extras that are a total scope of the film from costumes to props to planets to star craft. J.J. is interviewed in a lot of the pieces as well as many of the principal actors. The interactive Enterprise is fun and ... well you didn't really need me to review the movie did you? I mean you already saw it - if you're like me you half buy the DVD to watch the making of and listen to the set designers and costume creators. This bonus disc delivers....
0385504225|3.0|It is a huge effort to write a novel, and I respect the process and effort, so rate it 3 stars.    I really did enjoy the tidbits about Washington D.C., especially the Capitol and the Washington Monument, and descriptions of the art works.   I wish there had been more engagement with details of place, as in the earlier novels.    I loved the settings of Smithsonian pods 3 and 5 - that was great.   Wish there has been imaginative constructions about what research Katherine was doing and what her findings were.      Actually, I was left with the feeling that ideas/material on Katherine's Noetic Science are being saved for a sequel, instead of being included in this novel.  I think more detail about what went on in pod 5 would have made this book much more compelling.    Basically it seems that Brown is following the \\"Michael Crighton path\\"  - writing something that is more screenplay than novel.    I was so disappointed.        I read this in 1 day over the holiday, which helps get a clear sense of pacing.    --My first reaction was that the pacing was forced (and made me think \\"screenplay\\").   Framing the action with a very short time period was enjoyable, but many action sequences were rat-tat-tat and choppy.  --My second reaction was that Brown was following advice to \\"dumb down\\" the writing, including changing the way Langdon speaks and inserting improbable sequences to push the narrative forward (e.g., dialogue between Katherine and character posing as psychiatrist -- completely unbelievable that she would fall for that....)     Seems to me Brown's writing has changed since the early novels.  --My third reaction was that the book was rushed out the door too quickly, with no help (or with bad advice) from the editor.       The concluding \\"big insight\\" was underwhelming, but the overarching metaphor remains powerful and interesting.  It touches on a subject currently getting talk show attention again  -- mind vs. brain (is the mind \\"caused\\" by brain processes or isit embedded in cross-dimensional and/or multi-organism collective consciousness, etc.).
0141040378|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in  Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama  (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

B001FB562U|4.0|The Road is based on a Pulitzer winning novel by an American writer Cormac McCarthy (2006). The story is simple:<br /><br />Almost all vegetation as well as animal and human life on Earth have been extinguished by a mysterious cataclysm. It has been years since governments and society collapsed. With no renewable food sources, the few survivours have turned to cannibalism, and violence has become a way of life. Amidst this desperation, a bedraggled man and his young son are traveling south. The father is trying to find a future for the boy. Their journey is the subject of the film.<br /><br />I am happy to report that The Road is NOT another Hollywood version of an action packed apocalypse. No zombies need make an appearance, for most human survivours are far scarier... It is a film frightening in its realism, well written and superbly acted. It is also highly depressing and as hauntingly disturbing as a film can get. If you choose to see it (and I highly recommend you do), make sure you prepare yourself mentally beforehand. To illustrate: after the screening, my viewing companion and I proceeded to dinner which, uncharacteristically, we consumed in almost a complete silence, our emotions still firmly tethered to the story we had just seen.<br /><br />To those who have read and admire the novel: I believe you will be pleasantly surprised by the respectful treatment the original text has received. The four star rating I have given the film is strictly due to its ending. It felt somewhat rushed and stuck on. In the novel, it is clear that the ending should not be taken at face value. In the film, the possible duality of the ending is not as clearly suggested.<br /><br />Still, great stuff! (watch out for cameos from Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce)

0141439793|4.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.<br /><br />And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").<br /><br />The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.<br /><br />Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.<br /><br />Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|I consider myself a Sherlock Holmes fan. I won't pretend I've read all the stories Arthur Conan Doyle wrote or seen every episode of Granada's terrific Sherlock Holmes TV show starring Jeremy Brett. I CAN however say that Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is no retelling but an interesting re-imagining (or reboot) of the character. This is apparant in the slam-bang action-packed opening (easily the best sequence in the film) where we see the Sherlock Holmes and the police rushing to save an innocent woman from being sacrificed by a mallicious cult. Holmes uses both his brains and his brawn to foil the cult's plans letting you know this is a more action-oriented Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is terrific as this new Holmes, a character that's always alert and always ten steps ahead of everyone else whether it be crime scene deduction or hand-to-hand combat but falls short when it comes to understanding people (or ANYTHING outside his own brilliant mind). Mark Strong is equally good as the villain Lord Blackwood, the powerful cult leader using \\"black magic\\" to gain influence over his followers. Jude Law is well cast as Dr Watson, Holmes' life-long companion as is Eddie Marsan as Inspector Lestrade (the Commissioner Gordan to Holmes' Bruce Wayne). Rachael McAdams is miscast as Irene Adler. McAdams is a good actress but she seems so out-of-place with the rest of veteran actors of the film that I just didn't buy her as Holmes' intellectually flamboyant equal.<br /><br />While the characters in this movie are great, I unfortunatly can't say the same for the screenplay. The story's interesting enough, but the dialogue these characters spout is so flat (and at times inconsistant with the time period) that it's hard to feel engaged by their relationships to one another. You just don't care enough about them. Guy Ritchie has been reknowned for his sharp dialogue in his terrific crime films so I'm not sure what happened here. Can he not convey anyone unless they're a foul-mouthed gangster?<br /><br />Another thing that falls flat in this film are it's action scenes. The close-quarters hand-to-hand action is great (if redundant) but when the film switches to more open/grandious locations for it's action the movie gets lame. I don't think I've ever been so bored watching a character almost sawed in two, or watching a destructive fight in a harbor while the heroes almost get crushed by a boat. Again, this might've been different if I cared a bit more about Holmes and Watson and Adler, or maybe if Guy Ritchie had a bit more experience directing high-end action sequences but as it is I couldn't get into it.<br /><br />A couple things this film did succeed in was it's set designs and music. Old-London looks and sounds so gritty you'll be almost sucked into it's grime (I also love the look of Holmes's office room). The music is also exceptionally well chosen to the point I sat through the entire credits just so I could hear the entire soundtrack.<br /><br />While Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is lacking for the most part it does have some interesting ideas going for it. This is supposed to be the first in a trilogy, I just hope they spruce up the dialog (and control the action a bit) for the sequel.gangster?

B001UJE97K|1.0|Vampires vs. werewolves seems to be the popular supernatural conflict in movies right now, but I'll give credit where credit is due -- \\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" actually provides some backstory for that war. This prequel to the other two \\"Underworld\\" movies is a grimy, gloomy affair that has some good acting, but is drained dry by choppy direction, a flimsy plot and a love story that never quite convinces.<br /><br />Lucian (Michael Sheen) was the first of the Lycans -- rational lycanthropes capable of taking human form. Born from a savage werewolf, he was made into the personal slave/protege of the vampire lord Viktor (Bill Nighy). But things began to go wrong when two things happened: Viktor began breeding a new race of Lycans by infecting humans with Lucian's curse, and Lucian fell in love with Viktor's lovely daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The Lycans are treated like beasts of burden by the vampires, and rebellion is starting to stir among them -- and especially in Lucian, who sees them as his people now.<br /><br />But when Lucian is savagely punished for removing his slave collar (so he could save Sonja from werewolves), he decides enough is enough -- he and a small band of Lycans break out of the fortress and escape into neighboring lands. But he's determined to return for Sonja, whose affair with Lucian has been discovered by a horrified, grief-stricken Viktor -- and as the armed, organized Lycans clash with their former masters, someone will lose everything.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is sort of a werewolf \\"Ten Commandments\\" crossed with a bit of goth \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" -- basically it's about a rather straightforward slave uprising, and a forbidden love that obviously isn't gonna end well. The entire movie is bathed in gloomy shadows, rain and lots of pale anemic light; everybody wears weird pseudomedieval armor and lives in grimy stone fortresses that would drive most people to suicide.<br /><br />The plot also isn't terribly complex -- there are no twists or unexpected moments in either the slave uprising or the forbidden love affair. Both subplots go from A to Z with brain-melting predictability. What's more, the romantic angle is painfully unconvincing-- Lucian and Sonja start boinking out of the blue about five minutes after meeting each other, and they do it in a sewer. Apparently this is supposed to convey eternal true love... but it just left me thinking how gross it was.<br /><br />It also helps to ignore the choppy direction, frequently pompous dialogue (\\"Do you not realize that what I am giving you is a gift?\\" \\"It's a curse!\\") and dense melodrama (\\"We can be slaves, or we can be LYYYYCAAAAAAANS!\\"). Fortunately it isn't half bad at action scenes -- we've got big brutal werewolves, anemic noble vampires, lots of leather and metal armor, and plenty of necks being torn out with big bloody teeth.<br /><br />Sheen and Mitra both do good jobs as Sonja and Lucian, although Sheen yells a lot and Mitra looks terminally ill (would it have killed them to give the poor woman some lipstick?). While they do solid jobs throughout the movie, they are genuinely moving during their last scene together. Bill Nighy manages to bring some extra dimensions to a flat villain, by conveying his grief over his daughter's betrayal of her vampire kind, and Kevin Grevioux brings a lot of life to the smallish role of Lucius' second-in-command.<br /><br />\\"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans\\" is a simplistic movie riddled with gothic gloom, goofy melodrama and a very flat love story.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|Avatar is the fastest three hours I have ever spent in a theater. That's the strongest testimony I have to offer that it is, if nothing else, a well assembled, captivating entertainment. This is all I expected of the film, and it did deliver. I have no major complaints. (Yes, it does take elements and concepts other Sci-Fi writers introduced, but it whips basic ingredients provided by Clifford Simak, Ben Bova, Robert Heinlein and probably others into something enough unlike the originals to serve a popular film. Cameron never claimed to be a major Sci-Fi writer, at least the last that I heard.)<br /><br />Those looking clear around the story, the characters, the neat SFX solely to the so-called message  -- as virtually no one else but the Right fringe of the audience is -- are the ones making a problem for the film. You can view Avatar as a Sci-Fi action/adventure with a social message, but make no mistake: It is first and foremost a Sci-Fi action/adventure film. It is obvious that the film's huge audience is eating it up in spite of, not because of any interpretable message.<br /><br />In political terms -- let's be totally real here -- there is nothing to argue with in the gospel according to Avatar. The position is as simple as the tale being told: Good things should happen to nice people; mean people suck; if you are good to your land and planet, it will be good to you in return; when your only tool is a hammer, every problem begins to look like a nail. That all this sounds like a bumperstickerization of a complex topic may be the clearest indicator the nitpickers and would-be polemicists have that their decision to argue with this film was misguided at it's inception.<br /><br />Ultimately, Avatar succeeds or fails, not as a political statement, but as an action/adventure film, and very adroit thrill ride. It's this aspect of the film that will draw millions and perhaps ultimately billions to see the film. As a thrill ride, it cannot be denied that Avatar is well put together, cracklingly paced, full of dazzling set pieces that out-Spielberg Spielberg and out-Lucas Lucas. If you're a fan of action/adventure movies, that's a good thing.<br /><br />It may gall those who have picked this film as a culture war battleground that more people wish to be amused in these troubled times -- and identify emotionally and personally with the down-trodden and victimized -- than will ever be evangelized to their political doctrine. But how, exactly, is that supposed to be Avatar's, Cameron's or the audience's problem?lingly paced, full of dazzling set pieces that out-Spielberg Spielberg and out-Lucas Lucas.

B00081U6EG|4.0|Well, mostly I really enjoyed this concert.  Perhaps just seeing some of these people again was enough to put the cherry on top.  I certainly could have done away with some of the players to be replaced by at the very least - Eric Clapton, Richie Blackmore, Yngvie Malmsteen, Jeff Beck, Mark Knopfler.  However, this made a lovely Christmas Holiday treat for my husband and me today (12/27/09).  I don't think we'll buy the DVD however.  We have the DISH Satellite so we get to enjoy the Palladia channel which shows many, many of these great concerts!
B002LFPAUC|5.0|What can I say? This is one of the greatest and most thought-out shows of all time. Cleese seems to be clearly influenced by comic greats such as Ernie Kovacs and this is a good thing. Not to take anything away from Cleese, of course. Sadly, this show could not be made today, as it would be considered Politically Incorrect. So, folks, get it while you can, as its likely to be banned by the USA government soon. To quantify out of a 0-10 rating, I would give this brilliant series a \\"10.\\" I just wished they'd have made more episodes. Purchase this set and you won't ever regret it. It is truly genius.
0316069906|5.0|There are no words to describe how grateful I am to Mr. Foer for writing this book.  I read an op ed piece by Mr. Foer about his book on cnn.com and I immediately purchased the book. The book is masterfully well written and it is not preachy or elitist. It is simply written from the point of view of a father, who now in the position of making food choices for his child, wants to make the best choices possible. Eating Animals is extremely well researched and grounded in real, verifiable data. On top of all that it is a great read, with touches of humor and a really engaging personal story through out. I read it in 1 sitting in the course of an afternoon and from that moment on, I become a vegetarian. My husband read the book when I was done with it and now he is a vegetarian too. Mr. Foer writes about the act of purposeful forgetting and thanks to his important contribution, I will never allow myself to forget where food comes from. I frequently recommend this book to everyone who asks me why I decided to become a vegetarian and I highly recommend it in general.
B001OQCV60|4.0|I don't like the ego Robert Downey Jr. seems to have in most TV interviews, but I can't deny that the man can act his behind off. His Sherlock Holmes is funny, smart, tough and all while keeping a very good British accent. There is just some magic behind his eyes in every scene. His chemistry with Jude Laws's Watson is the closest thing on screen between two dudes since Brokeback Mountain. Okay, they don't get it on, but you can tell they have a love (not in that way) for each other that neither can really express. Jude Law more than holds his own and even manages to steal a few moments along the way. Most of the film's humor stems from the back and forth between Holmes and Watson. Rachel McAdams is okay, but she really isn't given that much to do. Mark Strong made for a decent, yet predictable villain.<br /><br />My main gripes are with the story. There's nothing really new here and it is dragged on for about 15 minutes too long. I also had trouble keeping up with some of the dialogue that seemed to be either mumbled or covered up in a thick accent. I'll have to check this one out again with subtitles when it hits Blu-ray. I'm sure I missed a lot of jokes the first time around. Guy Ritchie's directing style has been poorly received by critics in regards to Sherlock Holmes, but I didn't find it too distracting. In fact, I normally can't stand his movies, but I really ended up enjoying this one. He adds just the right amount of darkness to the material and keeps his crazy editing cuts to a minumum.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes combines a little humor, lots of action and some better acting than one would expect in a movie like this. The ending is sequel friendly and I think this new version of this iconic detective will leave people wanting more.
0316017922|3.0|I dunno about Malcolm Gladwell. It all goes down so easily that sometimes you can't be sure exactly what you're swallowing.     Here's why I say some of it is too easy to verify. The basic claim is that successful people aren't just \\"self-made men/women\\" - they've had advantages. Now, that's pretty easy to verify. For example, if you were born in the US, you've got a better chance of achieving wealth, a good education, a nice home, security and peace than if you were born in, say, Afghanistan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. You'd also have a better chance if you were tall, if your parents were rich, if you were white (particularly at certain points in history), if you spoke English, if you went to a good school, if your parents have lots of books in their house, if you have a genetic disposition to certain traits, if you don't have a mental disorder, if you're not hit by a bus, if, if, if... All Gladwell has done is chosen a few of the more surprising ones.    Okay, so now the \\"too hard to verify\\" basket. Well, is it actually true that the Chinese rice grower's proverb about getting up early in the morning 365 days a year is responsible for their children being successful? Well, who's to say? Maybe it's the way they teach their children other things. Are there examples of kids who don't succeed? That's the problem with the social sciences; it's all so hard to pin down. It's hard enough verifying things when the science is tight and single-minded, but when it comes to something as broad and difficult to control as a cultural mindset... which is just one of an infinite number of factors influencing someone's upbringing, well, it's just all a big nice fanciful story that may or may not be true.    It's very digestible, but I'd suggest reading with a big grain of salt.

B002VECMAY|4.0|Up in the Air is that rare film where you don't know what's going to happen at the end.  I was all set to believe, for example, that George Clooney, after firing 17,000 workers, would wind up fired himself: that would be the way Richard Yates would have played it.  Finally I realized how director Jason Reitman was harvesting all this narratological surprise.  Basically the film is two different movies, each with its own story, and the stories are chopped up and intersected with each other to provide a jolt of surprise from time to time.  The first story is the high concept story, Clooney as Ryan Bingham who makes it his business to fire innocent people, hired almost as a mercenary by companies whose executives lack the balls to make the cuts themselves.  I don't know what you all made of this storyline, but I found all of the characters involved morally repellent, soulless.  They were funny (Jason Bateman), charming (Clooney), lovably young and insecure (Anna Kendrick, as the Cornell graduate with a new vision for firing people more cheaply), but all of them disgusted me.  I guess that's ok in a movie, who wants a film with a bunch of goody two shoes, but are any of them redeemed at the end?  To do that you'd have to redeem the whole capitalist system of profit trumping everything.<br /><br />At the same time as we register discomfort with what Bingham does, we are encouraged to envy him his ten million miles and his Concierge card from American made out of graphite.  It's so rare people doubt it exists!  But we see it in action.  When he comes towards them, people in slavery to American must bow down to him and greet him warmly.  Fake warmth that Bingham recognizes, and yet he seems to enjoy--well, who wouldn't.  Yes, the perks of his position are what it's all about.<br /><br />The second story is that of George Clooney (Ryan Bingham) as a man who has not let himself be vulnerable enough to love.  That's the more appealing story, and perhaps the more familiar.  We see him let his guard down with the elegant, beautiful Vera Farmiga, a woman as expert with airline schedules as he.  I liked all of this story, but it's as old as Hollywood itself.  We saw it with Clark Gable and Greer Garson 60 years ago, it's as old as time.<br /><br />The movie shows you don't need fifty million dollars worth of CGI to tell an entertaining tale, but after leaving the theater I felt a huge number of qualms about the admittedly risky nature of the story I had just seen and I wasn't sure how I felt--that's a good thing, right?  The use of real people playing the people fired by Bingham--clever, but ultimately exploitative?

B002MW50KO|1.0|I have been a Bob Dylan fan since about 1964. I own every album he ever made. I cherish nearly all of them, and there are many from each decade of his career that I think are great and STILL listen to with some regularity. I consider him to be one of the greatest songwriters and rock artists of the 20th century. I believe he long ago should have won a Pulitzer and/or Nobel Prize.      And, I should add, I generally enjoy Christmas music - the old chestnuts, the rock-pop Christmas tunes, and so on.    That being said, this album is atrocious. It should never have been conceived. Having been conceived, it should have never been recorded. Having been recorded, it should never have been issued. Having been issued, it should never have been bought.     Many of the twists and turns in Dylan's career have been misunderstood or misconstrued by his fans and the general public. In this case, the misunderstanding and misconstruing is on Dylan's part -- and attempts by critics and listeners to \\"get it\\" are misguided.

Granted the line 6 device is significantly costlier, but the tone out of it is much more interesting. But I can't toss the line 6 unit into my guitar case.

All I can say is that it is the best movie I've seen this year and quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. To clarify that statement and avoid being flamed by someone who did not enjoy it as much as me, I offer this statement. When I say 'best', I mean more that it could be my personal favorite, not necessarily 'best' in a quantifiable and measurable manner. Anyways, I will surely be buying this movie on blu-ray when it releases. And I almost never buy movies, so that's saying something.
B000EDWKXI|3.0|At the dawn of an enlightened age the legend of Casanova<br />is somewhat twisted by this happy ending romantic comedy.<br />The period costumes are very good and the acting is well done,<br />but like all such romantic rewrites much of the plot seems<br />pretty hard to believe? For example, Casanova is rescued from the church<br />who is about to hang him by his mother the actress and her<br />friend the actor. The leading lady is a fem-lib writer<br />well before such texts saw the light of day, because<br />the church backed the family as headed by men<br />and women had nearly zero rights in an court.<br />The antics of Casanova with his womanizing madee him somewhat of a hero in his<br />time to many of male population.<br />I think that rewriting history for a romantic happy ending<br />is probably good for Hollywood and bad for history?
B001OQCV60|4.0|Given the idiocy of most action pictures, the wit and verve on display here is refreshing.  Ritchie also finds new ways to stage hackneyed action tropes, as per the Big Explosion that climaxes the second act of the film.  He cuts the sound, and for once we actually feel the toll the explosion takes on the main characters instead of just watching them leap toward the camera as flames rise behind them.  It's wonderfully orchestrated -- and I hate explosions.  But Ritchie's real distinction is his attention to character and subtext.  Though it's disconcerted straight male critics (who get disoriented when movies don't support their heterocentric worldview) and studio executives fearful of a homophobic public (with cause, possums), this is distinctly a love story (crossed with a screwball comedy) between Holmes and Watson, all the more winning because it's implied and not shown.  Downey, Jr. and Law have great screen chemistry.  If this episode doesn't quite levitate all the way as a pop entertainment (blame a too complex plot) I'll still bet on the successful future of franchise.

Disc 1, labeled as \\"The Final Cut\\" was in fact, the Workprint disc - the Final Cut disc was entirely omitted from the set! Due to numerous reports on Amazon and in other forums, it makes me think that this error must affect thousands of units but only a few of the purchases are returned either due to consumer ignorance or laziness.  This same manufacturing error has been reported since the release of the collector's edition and it is still not corrected - I suppose it is cheaper to replace a few discs for those who take the time to complain than to recall the faulty lot of sets with possible errors.

The book expressed the kind of love one would want but the kind of ending one would only want to read. It was a beautiful story.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|This series was the finest show ever created for television. It does the best job of recreating pre-christian Rome that could have possibly been done within the constraints of television or film. In fact, I am not the first to say that if you really want to see the impact that Christianity made on the world then watch Rome to find out what the world was like before it.  And I am saying this as someone who has read very extensively about Rome and this time period- and had five and a half years of Latin in school, which included having to translate Ceasar's Gallic Wars. So one of the things that I really liked about this series was the attempt to really show us what Roman life and politics was about.     On the other hand, because of budget constraints, the series was cut short- it properly should have lasted at least three years and instead ended after a shortened second season. The final episodes attempt to summarize what happened on the way to Octavain becoming the sole Emperor of Rome. That is why you will probably find the first season more satisfying dramatically than the second.    While the broad outlines of history are honored that this series is not totally accurate.  As an example: One of the main female characters in this series is Atia- the mother of Octavian. She is pictured as living though all of the events up until Octavian becomes Emperor of Rome. The real Atia died before Octavian reached his twentieth birthday. But this is a quibble- what Atia's character shows us is the influence of women in this period of history- Roman women were utterly powerless yet also extremely influential.  So the history is not totally accurate, but the characters go a long way towaqrds showing us the realities of the time.  That is why I think of this series as not a history but a portrait.  The great drama of the time plays out in a way that lets us see the character of the people rather than just a depiction of events.

B00007FOMP|5.0|It's generally regarded that the Beatles were the first group to make people think of an Album as one cohesive, artistic statement. A Beatles album was meant to be listened to in one sitting. All the songs were meant to create a larger body of work. This was an important deviation from the traditional method of creating an album, which was more or less a collection of singles with no particular relation to one another. This was an important concept in the sixties that influenced every other musician in every other genre with one exception. Soul music. Somehow, this important idea didn't extend to Motown or Stax. Soul musicians didn't write albums, they wrote songs, and of course when they had a dozen or so recorded, they released them as an album, but it wasn't the same thing. The albums didn't have running themes. They didn't have songs that flowed together, that were meant to be listened to in succession. For some reason that I still have yet to discover, Marvin Gaye was the only soul musician to experiment with the developing artistic ideas the sixties are known for, and he only did it a single time. That was on this album. \\"What's Going On\\".<br /><br />You can't separate any song from this album and still achieve the same effect. The first reason for this is obvious. The two sides have suite arrangements. Every song runs directly into the next. Except for the slight pause at the end of What's Going On (probably added because the song was released as a single), there's no breaks between the tracks. From \\"What's Happening Brother\\" to \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" there are no stops. It basically is one long song. The same technique is used on side two, where multiple songs run together to form an inseparable string of music. This is the only soul album that borrows this favorite technique of Paul McCartney. Second, there's also a running theme in the music. The songs deal with the self destruction of mankind from War and pollution, and are responded to with cries to save the world for God and for our future generations. The album carries a message, it deals with real problems man constantly faces. It deals with universal truths, the self eradicating nature of the human species. This is not a collection of soul songs. This is a Soul Album. The first, the last.<br /><br />I still haven't been able to figure out why this is. Every other genre of music was experimenting with these concepts throughout the sixties. Why did it take Soul music until 1971 to catch up? And why was the experiment abandoned? The album was a huge success. Why were there no followers? Even Marvin Gaye himself never made such an incredible artistic statement again. It's unfortunate the experiment didn't last, but at least we did get one great soul album.r God and for our future generations.

B000UVDPH4|5.0|I had to sneak in to see this movie screened at the theatre when it was initially released in 1979. For years, I had a bootleg VHS copy that had been censored for drugs, violence and full frontal male nudity.  The combination of the Who's music, a great story line about an era I knew nothing about and the great English locations simply blew me away.<br /><br />The story is set during a five-day period in the early 60s and revolves around Jimmy, a young Englishman who is pretty disaffected but who has a job, a crush on a pretty girl and still lives at home.  He is a \\"Mod\\"-drives a scooter, takes drugs and dresses in suits.  He is totally committed to their creedo, not the least of which is a hatred for \\"Rockers\\"-guys just like him who wear Levis and leather jackets and ride motorcycles!<br /><br />We watch Jimmy's world collapse around him during an ill-fated bank holiday in which gangs of Mods and Rockers go to Brighton, a quaint seashore town and fueled by drugs/alcohol/testosterone proceed to tear the place apart.<br /><br />Director Franc Rodham did a brilliant job with the subtle insights into working class British life-the baths, the food, the clothing, the class differences-and they are backed by an amazing sound track of original Who songs + the great rock and roll songs of the era.  Rock star Sting has a small but pivotal part as The Ace Face, an angry sharp-dressed Mod everyone look up to and as the story unfolds you begin to understand the forces that fuel his rage and Jimmy's drug fueled depression.<br /><br />I really thought by now that opera companies and symphony orchestras would be performing Quadrophenia because Pete Townsend is a musical genius who just chose to wrote and perform rock instead of classical.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Sarah McLachlan gave us a splendid holiday album with this release; and even though Christmas is officially over I'm still enjoying holiday music including this album! Holiday music is some of the best music you could ever ask for; and Sarah McLachlan certainly doesn't disappoint us with her performance on this CD. Another thing I like about this is that Sarah performs some melancholy ballads on this album; this really gets into a bittersweet side of holiday time that is sometimes overlooked. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done.<br /><br />Sarah McLachlan joins The Sarah McLachlan Music Outreach Children's Choir and Youth Choir for a beautiful, sensitive rendition of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over).\\" The music fits in perfectly with their singing; and I like the percussion very much. Sarah's excellent diction makes her singing very special, too. \\"What Child Is This? (Greensleeves)\\" is also very good; Sarah never misses a beat on this timeless ballad as she sings this to perfection--and beyond! \\"River\\" explores some sadder moods that can occur at Christmastime; and the title track (\\"Wintersong\\" written by Joni Mitchell) is another poignant ballad that features Sarah squarely front and center--which is right where she belongs!<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" charms me with its beauty; this music leaves nothing to be desired--it's all THAT good. Sarah's interpretation of \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" is very easy on the ear and it moves me every time I hear it. \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" has a terrific arrangement that highlights Sarah's beautiful vocals; and \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\" gets a fine treatment from Sarah McLachlan who delivers this faultlessly. \\"Silent Night\\" is a major highlight of this album; Sarah delivers this like the pro she is and always will be! I like Sarah's interpretation of \\"Silent Night\\" very much and I think you'll like it, too.<br /><br />\\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" has a lovely guitar arrangement; I love Sarah's cover of this Gordon Lightfoot ballad! \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\\" originally performed by Judy Garland in the MGM musical \\"Meet Me In St. Louis,\\" uses the strings and more to great advantage; Sarah makes this amazing with her spectacular delivery. Sarah truly sings this from the heart and just one listen proves it! \\"In A Bleak Mid Winter\\" is also quite well done; Sarah performs this with panache. \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" from the soundtrack to \\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\\" has Diana Krall on the piano with Sarah singing; Sarah and her peers give this tune a somewhat sad flavor although it is pensive as well. However, \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" is still a solid tune with which to end the album--and it even leaves me wanting more!<br /><br />This is a fine album for Sarah's fans; and of course anyone who wants high quality control Christmas music would do well to add this to their CD collection.

My daughter had only been exposed to ST:TNG, which she found \\"boring\\", \\"dull\\", and other worthwhile adjectives, and she adamantly did not want to see Star Trek.  She loved it, as did my wife, another fan of the original series.    This was a great Christmas gift, and I thoroughly appreciated it when watching it a second time at home.  Good effects, great story.  None of the characters were either over-the-top mimicry or all new \\"improved\\" versions of the old versions, just younger ones gaining the experience that underlies the classic characters.  Lots of stuff for new and old fans alike, with lots of nods to the original series, but you don't have to like, or even ever have watched, it in order to appreciate this movie.    I don't often say this, but you won't be disappointed one bit, and I, for one, look forward to \\"Star Trek II\\", whenever it comes out.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I just read a review that was pretty negative about this album and it encouraged me to write this review.  I have to admit, the first time I listened to this CD...I was slightly disappointed....but honestly, I was skipping through the songs so nothing caught my attention like his last two albums did.  HOWEVER, I put the album down and didn't think about it for a couple of weeks then me and my kids went on 4hr road trip and my son wanted me to bring it, so I did...  As I drove and listened with no distractions...I found that I simply LOVE this CD.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Cry Me A River\\" has a pretty dramatic arrangement, but it grew on me. :)  I love his remake of the old Dean Martin tunes... No one does it like Dino....I know, but Buble does them VERY well.  David Foster's arrangements are brillant in my opinion.  The new songs will become as dear to me as \\"Home\\" or \\"Everything\\", I am sure.  The title song \\"Crazy Love\\" is one of my favorites.<br /><br />I give this CD a solid 5 stars, a very enjoyable addition to my Buble' Collection :)<br /><br />Addendum: 3/4/10<br /><br />Okay....I drive several hours a day for my jobs so... realistically, I have been listening to this CD almost daily for the past 2 months. I enjoy it more and more each and every day.  The songs are sweet and soothing....working to not only make me smile, but smoothing the edges of my frayed nerves at times, when stress threatens to get the best of me.  GREAT CD!
0316044695|5.0|Very, very powerful book. I started reading it last night and couldn't put it down until I'd finished it. I bawled my eyes out. Marcus Luttrell does a fantastic job of introducing the reader to his teammates and of recounting the horrendous events that transpired on that Afghani mountainside. I felt like I was right there with them, like I knew them all, like I lost friends. These men are without a doubt true American heroes. My prayers are with each and every one of them. To all our servicemen and women: come home safe and thank you for all you do!!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This was one of the more original horror films I've seen to date and I had to actually sleep with a light on.  Well, not really, but I did get up to use the bathroom the night I saw it and found myself staring at shadows. This movie is for people who have an imagination. If all you want in a horror film is blood, gore and gratuitous violence, stay home and rent SAW. But if you want to be genuinely creeped out without a lot of fancy FX, this is a pretty good scare ride. You never \\"see\\" the monster, you just feel your skin crawl.
0385504225|1.0|I loved Angels & Demons, Da Vinci Code, and Deception Point. This book however, was a different story.<br /><br />Most of the detailed reviews (esp the one by Garvinstomp) have covered it:<br />- The ultimate reveal is pathetic. In fact, it's not really a reveal at all. Throughout the entire book, Langdon tries decipher a pyramid object that promises to reveal an \\"ancient mystery\\", the source of a great wonderful knowledge, one that the Masonic society has closely guarded for generations. When you finally realize what this wonderful knowledge is, you can't help but wonder: really? Hardly worth guarding with your life. And unlike the other Brown novels, there isn't any big \\"twist\\" at the end either to give you a sense of satisfaction at having finished the book.<br /><br />- Why is noetic science even in this plot? It barely has anything do with the main plot. Take it out and get rid of half of the useless words.<br /><br />- Seriously, do yourself a favor and read the plot summary on wikipedia. That is all the \\"meat\\" in the book (the rest is mostly frivolous details like how many bulbs were in a chandelier, or the color of the doorknob). Then decide if you want to read 500 pages to find THAT out. You'll thank me.<br /><br />- Overall, the plot is SLOW, the characters spend too much time in very few locations (unlike the other two Langdon books where he kept running around, here they simply talk, and the author fills the gaps with descriptions of the surroundings I couldn't care less about), and the ending isn't much of an ending at all.<br /><br />It really feels as if Dan Brown has run out of mysterious symbols and ancient legends to make stories out of. Unfortunately, he really doesn't need any of that to make a good story (think Deception Point). Instead he attempted to cash out on the Da Vinci code fame by continuing the here-are-some-more-startling-ancient-myths-that-are-true-and-have-shocking-consequences theme. Unfortunately, the glaring lack of material and substance showed.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|Social worker (Mikkelsen) runs an orphanage in India but must return to his home in Denmark to meet a wealthy industrialist who is interested in funding one of his projects. He arrives in Copenhagen just as the rich man's daughter is about to be married. At the man's insistence Mikkelsen attends the ceremony and during the wedding he makes a shocking discovery. This is one of the most interesting and intelligent dramas I've ever seen. An extremely well acted film that makes you realize the impact your decisions can have in other people's lives.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|I bought this prime time soap opera (not really a sitcom) for someone I know this Chanukah and she acted like I'd given her the Holy Grail.

B002HWRYJE|3.0|When you go to see a Star Trek movie, you expect certain things.  I am a treker but not one of those people that owns a uniform or has to 'live' Star Trek daily.  However, I do know enough that this movie is definitely not a Star Trek movie.  J. J. Abrams has admitted to not understanding the concept of Star Trek and it definitely shows in his latest effort at entertainment.  The movie loses some of its Star Trek feel right out of the gate when you see the Starship Enterprise being built on the surface of the Earth.  As anyone should know, the ship was too large to be built anywhere but in orbit.  Nowhere would there be enough room on Earth.  And the movie continues to veer from the already established history of Star Trek.  Despite the poor showing for any relationship to Start Trek Cannon, this movie is a very good Sci-Fi flick.  There is non stop action, good characters and a decent story line.  Definitely watch it for this reason, not for Star Trek.  J. J. Abrams at least made a good Sci-Fi film that I enjoyed watching.
B002LCOQQY|3.0|It is true: the remastering has done miracles espec ially for this one which sounded really thin on CD. However it is in my opinion not the work that has g ained the most from the new batch of remasterings since it does not have the same amplitude in sounds as the others. However it is a splendid piece as vinyl.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|Spoilers!    I was having a pretty good time with this movie.  The special effects were solid, the storyline fairly cohesive and Sam Worthington's performance was strong.  I fully expected Marcus to not survive the movie, but when they arrived back at the rebel camp I had was pleasantly surprised he survived the fight at Skynet.  Then the massive, huge let down with him volunteering his heart to save John Connor.  The really irritating part is John nodding to him like \\"Good show old chap, I'll make good use of it\\".  Marcus had every bit as much right to \\"life\\" as it were and was the most compelling character in the film (much more so than Connor/Bale).  He would have made an excellent torch bearer to carry on the fight and could have breathed new life into the series.  As it is we get a stupid ending with Bale set for another sequel.    For those saying it would ruin any congruity between Salvation and previous films, Connor already stated his mother's recordings make no mention of such a \\"terminator\\" - it could be explained as the time line unexpectedly shifting (just as it would have if Kyle had been killed).    John Connor should have died, Marcus should have lived.  The last minute re-write (from what I heard) spoiled this film for me.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|If you've had a GI Joe, this is not really the kind of movie you would expect. GI Joe was more a traditional soldier from the Vietnam era. OK, nowadays things are different and Hollywood decided to jazz things up a bit. Why not! Overall it is pretty OK. The effects are stunning . There almost needs to be no plot since the movie never really does stop. In that sense it is very often overwhelming but still good fun. Especially since the technology is not hyper-realistic for today. A fun movie.
B002BFIN6K|5.0|My audiophile husband greatly enjoyed this CD for his birthday.  I liked it as well.
B002OOG6RQ|2.0|Do not get me wrong, Rammstein have produced a few innovative things: Mutter was nice. This however sound like stuff Minsitry did like what 20 years ago. Basically Minsitry and a few others have defined this industrial metal or whatever you want to call it a long time ago. I am not sure that this is that interesting. Die Krupps have a more interesting techno edge and are lighter. Here the whole image is too heavy and difficult to swallow. Laibach tired me also 20 years ago. Still if you like this kind of music, it is not bad. peace Love and Pitbulls was nice.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Great choice of songs and music.  She's gifted with a beautiful voice and her soul shines through!  Thank you Amazon.com.
0882709194|3.0|I got the book because some Fundamentalists were giving them away for free at my university.  Some people in my lab received copies too.  It was really funny (although sad) to read the introduction.  We cracked up a lot.
B000FWI8Q6|5.0|A definite must have for Christmas time.  This is one of his earliest and features the Andrew sisters singing with Bing.  It's an awesome CD!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Its a great deal, it comes with BD, DVD and digital copy, a must buy for me.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|One of the only things I prefer about the XBox 360 is that the trigger buttons on the controllers seem  lot more usable. The trigger buttons on the Dualshock controllers, being convex, always seem to encourage my fingers to slide off them instead of stay centered and in control. These simple and inexpensive trigger addons deal with the issue perfectly. They snap on easily and stay put during tough use, plus they feel and look like part of the original controller! I would highly recommend these to anyone who desires a more prominent or concave trigger on the PS3.
B001992NUQ|5.0|An amazing movie in amazing Blu-ray quality...couldn't have asked for anything better. All my friends (and, I'll admit, myself) were blown away by the picture quality, not to mention the fact that this is a movie everyone should own.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Don't believe the nay-sayers. I almost passed on this due to the reviews I read here. That would have been a big mistake. I really enjoyed this movie, as did my wife. Yes, the first 20 minutes or so had us wondering, due to the documentary style of shooting, but it did a good job of setting up the rest of the movie.   Rent it if you're not so sure, but you'll likely enjoy it if you watch it.
B0013GQPUO|1.0|This classic was in such bad condition that I had to put it into the recycle bin and reorder from Borders.
0307593525|5.0|There are books which will keep you up all night reading but this is a different kettle of fish entirely. This is a book which will keep you in your kitchen experimenting with French cuisine.<br />I must admit I have been a little too busy trying out various recipes to write a long review of the book. So many goodies you can try to prepare on your own. So many fancy names you read about in books and heard in the movies and now you can cook them in a few minutes.<br />You can find here an appropriate dish for any occasion - tete a tete with your better half and official dinner for inlaws included. And your sex is immaterial - even the most untalented gentlemen will find a dish to impress the family and friends if they only find an hour or two to go through these two bulky volumes to choose something within their range. Onion soup, maybe? Well, and if they feel like a small experiment before the big night...<br />A fair bit of warning - these recipes are not always very easy and some dishes take time to prepare but great cuisine must require a bit of effort and best ingredients.<br />What are you waiting for? Get a copy and start cooking!
0684833395|5.0|This is quite simply a fantastic book and a must read for anyone who appreciates modern classic fiction. Funny, insightful and tragic. The book begins in quite a funny manner as you begin to meet the characters, although one by one, tragedy befalls them and you can only smile at the sour irony of their situations. I personally likened it to the MASH TV series in many respects finding parallels between Yossarian, the main character of Catch 22 and Hawkeye from MASH. This is of course my own personal feeling and Im sure that people would be happy to point out many differences between the two characters.
B002N7FIPK|4.0|Simplemente excelente....Espectacular vocalizacion.  Otra vision de su musica.  El Sonido podria ser de mejor calidad
1905654294|1.0|in my opinion, ruined the series.  Like so many others have said, in comparison to their counterparts in her other books, the characters in this fourth book are cardboard cutouts.  About the only thing they really have in common, are the names.  But they're not the same people.      I had never been a great fan of the series, but I'd hoped that the fourth book would redeem Meyer, and be better than what she'd written before.  Sadly, it didn't do that.      And not only was the writing done poorly, there were things that, if I'd liked the series to begin with, still would have completely sickened me.  Edward asking Jacob to have sex with Bella for one, something a loving husband would never do in real life under any circumstances, and Jacob imprinting on an infant.  Nothing can make that okay to any reasonable person.    It's a shame.  Meyer had such potential.
1400067936|5.0|Clearly the book wasn't meant to be comprehensive but in my opinion it's still a great read after reading Black Swan.     Many of the arguements are very similar: they are presented in slightly different manner, and some of anecdotes are pretty funny and engaging most of the time. Not surprisingly the idea of the book Black Swan could also be found in this book.       Finally, knowing the idea of chapter 6 on skewness and asymmetry is already worth the price you paid for the book.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We totally enjoyed the album.  She sounds different in each song but all are well worth listening to.  If you enjoyed her on the show you will love her in this album.
B000ZELISO|4.0|I know this movie has been a little controversial for Harry Potter-lovers, which I am, but I actually loved it. I think it boded well for me that I hadn't read the 6th book for a while when I went to see this movie because then I couldn't exactly remember all the details that were left out. :)  I think this movie is a lot more entertaining/funnier than the others. On entertainment, I give it an A+. ...as far as details and action scenes go...it's more like C+ BUT I side with entertainment!
B002NUULNG|4.0|The Blu-ray is excellent, the movie an anime classic, and overall an all time favorite. The 2.0 brought a lot of minor changes and like the revised \\"Special Edition\\" releases of Star Wars many of the changes were completely unnecessary.<br /><br />The CGI Makoto looks odd and out of place. She looks stiff and rubbery and a generally poor attempt on Production I.G.'s part not really up to their usual standard as they have shown themselves to be capable of. She clashes horribly with much of the hand drawn animation of the rest of the film.<br /><br />Makoto aside some of the other changes aren't to bad from the computer displays to some of the vehicles they are small frivulous and though they don't add much to the film at least they don't detract from the immersion as the scenes with CGI Makoto do. Unneccisary, but not bad changes to say the least.<br /><br />Thankfully the Blu-ray's special features included the full theatrical video in HD though with the 2.0's (improved) audio track... Granted the \\"theatrical\\" version is a rip of the Laserdisk release and isn't a real film transfer but it is a great addition for the hardcore that prefer the \\"original\\" film.<br /><br />Really the special feature alone made this Blu-ray worth the purchase weather I you the changes or not (LD upscale issue aside).
0345494997|4.0|Nancy Horan's historical novel about the scandalous affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick is an interesting debut she should be proud of.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- The historical events and personal drama are appropriately balanced; after reading the novel you feel as if you have learned about Frank Lloyd Wright's history as an architect, but have also obtained an interesting perspective on his and Mamah's personalities.<br />- Another note on history, Nancy Horan must be given credit for the amount of research put into the text, both in regards to her characters and the actual events described.<br />- The novel is full of struggle, with multiple viewpoints represented. Mamah and Frank deal with the backlash of abandoning their families, Frank's money troubles are clearly depicted, and the role of women during the beginning of the 19th century is discussed in great deal, with Ellen Key's philosophy used as a vehicle.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Nothing about the novel stands out as far as the actual prose. Given the characters and context, I think Horan could have been a bit more creative with her narrative decisions. In the beginning it seems as if she might veer away from the standard linear, but ultimately decides not to.<br />- The diary angle is unnecessary and only partially executed.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />- The cover. I'm sorry, but it doesn't match what's inside.<br /><br />As a whole, the positive exceeds the negative, as the story itself kept me reading. I must defend the text against those that argue with the characters' decisions- keep in mind this is based on a true story, therefore Horan didn't feel at liberty to rewrite Frank and Mamah's past.
B0028T6XXY|1.0|While I am a huge Michael Buble fan I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the DVD.  I purchased this for my 17 year old nephew who really loves him as well but was shocked to find that the language he uses is less than stellar.  This is definitely not a family friendly concert to watch in my opinion. I was also disappointed that you only actually get to see about 4 songs performed.  If I could return this item, I would. It is not worth the money!
0802130208|5.0|CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a modern classic with hilarious dialogue and situations. The characters are original and fully realized, especially the protaganist Ignatius J. Reily. The essence of New Orleans is well captured and the author certainly knows the city well. Ignatius' strange insights into the world make for delightful reading, and many of them will make you burst out laughing. The dynamics between the characters are perfectly done as well. This a brilliantly funny book despite the tragic story behind its publishing- I wish Mr. Toole was still here so he could produce more work! Highly recomended!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I really liked the movie.      Read everyone else's descriptions, or not, and just get it and enjoy.  I had no knowledge going in except about Julia Child being a PBS cooking show host many years ago.

B001FB55HQ|1.0|They should have stopped at T2, but the cash cow can always be milked to death. I loved the first 2, but they went downhill from there. From T1 Kyle Reese said the first terminators had rubber skin, and were easy to spot. In this one they have never even seen a terminator with skin on it, rubber or real.There were many plot holes and really bad cheesiness like\\" Oh his heart cant take it.\\" \\"Then please take mine.\\" So if you like your action dark and hard to see with some big explosions added in. Mix in no plot or characters that you give a rats ass about. Then this is the movie for you.
B0026J8LHM|2.0|Ok, I've only given this album one listen so far, but I really don't know if I can make it through this over-blown production a second time.  I've been a DT fan since the beginning and have all their major releases, and have always enjoyed their work.  But, the lyrics on this effort are so inane, childish, and bereft of thought that it really mars the integrity of the entire piece.  A Nightmare to Remember - the retelling of a childhood tragedy in which the protagonist's parents are seriously injured - really uplifting stuff here.  The whole plot could have been told in about 1/3 the time but instead gets stretched out for 16 minutes and just seems repetitive and overdone.  Then toward the end comes Portnoy growling a stanza of lyrics, which, by the way is just horrendous, especially when you have a top notch vocalist like LaBrie.  Portnoy wants to be Phil Anselmo, but needs to stay behind the drums.  The theme of the song just seems too thin.  Yes, everyone has tragedy that befalls them and changes them -  so what.  How we bounce back is what matters.  This song just leaves the listener hanging and very unfulfilled.<br />It's somewhat ironic that the only song on here with decent lyrics is Best Of Times which was penned by the aforementioned growler, Portnoy.  This song is very heartfelt and the lyrics touch on a subject very poignant to us all, the loss of a parent and coming to terms with this emotional void while also cherishing the wisdom and advice imparted by the deceased.  This is the lone bright spot on the disc.  The other songs in between are not even worth commenting on.  But then there's the ridiculously inept Count of Tuscany which is just so obtuse it has to be mentioned.  The concept of this albatros is the story of a young man who is conveyed by the Count to a mansion in the countryside where supposed horrible fates befell soldiers during a war.  Apparently they were somehow lured there as if by a siren, drugged with alcohol, and buried in wine casks.  While the young man learns of this tale of terror he worries that the same fate may soon befall him.  But alas, the Count ensures him that he is free to leave and should tell everyone that he meets that the horror stories are untrue and he should make everyone he meets aware of the truth.  So basically, it takes 20 minutes to tell a pointless story in which nothing ever really happened and now this person should go around the country side telling everyone this meaningless tale of nonsense.  Seriously, my four year old daughter could tell me a better story.  The only thing that I can conceive that Petrucci is trying to say here is, 'don't judge a book by its cover'.  But it didn't need to take 20 minutes to say it, and it sure as hell didn't have to be hidden within such a shoddy story line.<br />Anyway, I can't believe that at this point in time this is the best that DT has to offer.  Pitiful.  I award two stars based upon musicianship and skill level but can go no higher due to the terrible lyrical content of the songs.  It just makes the whole effort seem preposterous.  I should have burned the lyric sheet!
B0000700KL|1.0|This movie lulls you into a sense of security--security that you won't be met with disturbing images.  You're presented with lovely images of nature and sacred places and the next thing you know you're shown a million baby chicks flying through chutes and being culled into a chick destroying machine.  I don't enjoy seeing images like that.  I purposely don't watch movies about people or animals being tortured. I didn't appreciate being tricked into seeing an image that is now burned in my brain.  Yes, I know it's what really happens. I just don't want to see it.
0316236535|1.0|Love the book. My son's speech therapist used it, and my boy loved it. Ordered it for Christmas, but was sadly disappointed when the \\"red\\" mouth is VERY ORANGE! I would suggest people buying it from an actual store where they can see the pages before purchasing.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I am 25 and married. I grew up right as Toy Story was being put out. As a kid I thought it was terrible and as I got older I didn't like nor disliked it. As for nearly everything else pixar has done. Its dreck. Mindless characters and shallow atempts at humor. Cars is a movie that sufferd from many of these plot holes, but stile thanks to its wild idea was entertaining. Though for an adult it dosn't really make sense. Finialy Up. It takes what is like with Cars and takes out most of the cheap uncreative plots and situations. The movie much more realistic and down to earth.(in a character sense) I am a hard critic and have a movie collection well over 600, and have a wide range of likes. This I liked. I really think its the best disney movie since the Lion King. The animation makes cars look old, and the story brings fiften years of sub-par stories to shame. I would a recomend this movie for all ages. My wife loved it, and I liked it; that dosn't happen to often.    So be surprised with this odd gem. Simply Pixars best movie. Period.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I simply want to add to the accolades this series has received by emphasizing.     1) the veracity of the period sets, mannerisms, viewpoints, prejudices, and expectations is unmatched by any comparable film I've seen. It's clear that this was the overriding intent of the producers. The scenes of John and Abigail attempting to live in the desolate and half completed executive mansion were terrific.     2) the acting is superb. Giamatti is one of the best, if not the best, character actors in the business. His ability to move from the understated to the explosive and back again is extraordinary. Stephen Dillane was excellent in capturing Jefferson's ethereal personality (his contemporaries, pro and con, all agreed on this characteristic of his). Tom Wilkenson as Franklin reveling in French hedonism was a delight.     A couple of corrections I would make.     a) Hamilton was not given enough attention, given his crucial role in the early republic and his efforts towards the adoption of the Constitution (i.e. through The Federalist Papers, which were Hamilton's idea). Jefferson is accurately portrayed as brilliant, but Hamilton was a certifiable genius. Here instead he's portrayed as a meglomaniac.  b) The short portrayal of Louis XVI was innaccurate. He's shown more as a spoiled pampered child than in fact a middle aged man at the time with a warm personality and insightful mind. The irony of history is that the French Revolutionists chopped off the head of a man who was, by the standards of the time, a good monarch.  They should have chopped off the head of his grandfather, Louis XV 30 years earlier.    But, as I said, these are small issues given the excllence of the overall series.

038534273X|3.0|The first few chapters provide a high-level description of the early days of Google.  This reader was left wanting more detail.  Subsequent chapters are disjointed descriptions of the origins of other Google services like Google News and Google Shopping.  For the Internet-savvy reader in 2009, I'm afraid this book is obsolete because most of us understand the importance of Internet search, blogging and other Google services.  When this book was written, those services were new and not yet widely understood.  The hand-holding that the book provides to describe simple concepts like Google Shopping is not necessary and comes across as borderline insulting.<br /><br />This book provides precious little detail about Google.

0547260695|5.0|I was initially a bit skeptical when I heard that my favorite book would be published in a pop-up edition.  I've always felt that many pop-up books are more novelty than a genuine expression or variation of one of the oldest art forms.  Being that The Little Prince is my favorite book, however, I purchased it anyway.<br /><br />I must admit that part of my skepticism came from my doubts about how well the simple and elegant illustrations from this classic would translate into pop-up art.  Were they detailed enough?  Interesting or intricate enough to make it worth it?  I had thought, in my sadly limited imagination, that the illustrations would not make awe-inspiring pop-ups.  As you've already surmised, I was sorely mistaken.<br /><br />The book, presented unabridged (thank God!) adds another dimension to an already deep and beautiful story.  To see the book and its unforgettable characters come to life is a delight.  Even some of the more simple illustrations get lifted to another level by the clever designer(s) who had a hand in this book.  My favorite passage is Chapter VI when the Little Prince reveals to our narrator how he loves sunsets and once saw forty-four in one day.  The chapter is brief and sad, and the illustration that accompanies it equally so.  To be able to make the sun set myself (and then to watch it rise again on the other side of his planet) was an exercise in simple joy.<br /><br />If you love this story or know someone who does, I highly recommend this book.  The pop-up pages aren't a novelty; they're an extension of an already treasured and lovely story for both children AND grown-ups.

B000OVLBIU|4.0|If you follow the Ghost Rider comic book series, you will probably like this movie; if you've never been exposed to GR before, it might be a better idea to rent this one first.     Nick Cage does a good job of portraying the title characters complete detatchment from, and disreguard for, his own life, trying to come to grips with what he's been suckered into. The special effects are very well done, and overall this is a very good 'port' of a comic book story to the big screen.

B001QOGYFY|1.0|I've always wondered, \\"Is it ever possible for a movie about a serial killer in the Arctic to be so slow and boring?\\" And that is what I beg of you to ask yourself before even touching this movie in any shape or form- I mean, I have seen tons of slow movies about serial killers in the past that I have enjoyed immensely. The Silence of the Lambs, Zodiac, and Se7en moved at unbearably slow paces yet I enjoyed them and found them interesting. I am also not afraid to admit I enjoyed the first three Saw movies immenesely- Hell, the second movie works its best as a cracking little crime drama. The best part of the movie, without a doubt, is the conversation between John and Eric- the chemistry is beautiful! It's like they admire each other, yet simultaneously hate each other too.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am afraid that be not the case with \\"Whiteout\\".<br /><br />Whiteout was based on a graphic novel of the same name. I have not read it, but I am certainly not doubting that it is better. There have been quite a few graphic novel adaptations this year- Watchmen seen through the eyes of Zack Snyder, the recent Surrogates, etc. And I LOVE graphic novels. I read Watchmen three times- it really is that great. Just this past Christmas I got \\"V For Vendetta\\", which inspired the movie of the same name. I must say that Watchmen is probably the best film adaptation of a comic book ever- It follows the book VERY closely and doesn't change anything majorly. I've heard from fanboys of the Whiteout graphic novel that this strays too far from it, and I'm not surprised<br /><br />Basically this movie is about a young woman named Carrie Stetko, who is stationed in Antarctica. It is her last three days in Antarctica, and she is just bringing things to a closure. However, things get complicated when a corpse entombed in ice shows up, and basically the same thing keeps happening, almost like a groundhog day loop. Furthermore, there is a huge ice storm coming, and if she doesn't solve this mystery, she'll be like all the others in the ice desert of nowhere.<br /><br />For the first time in my reviewing career, I am baffled. I'm sitting here with basically nothing to summarize. You notice how short the summary I put was? That's basically only what I could remember. This review is taking me an hour, basically since NOTHING happens. Better than 50% of the movie is shots of the backs of people's heads, which got really distracting after 20 minutes. The other 50% is made up of 25% of Kate Beckinsale running around in a parka, 20% shots of Antarctica and 5% of any real action whatsoever. When something happens, you're so bored you can't even tell that something's happening.<br /><br />I'm not saying I hate slowly paced movies. If anything, some of the movies I absolutely love move are painfully slow. But compared to those ones, Whiteout is like a two hour joke without a punchline, with so little to do but so much to say. I'm pretty sure the author of the GN is going all Alan Moore on everybody right now involved with the project. I be not surpised if he was.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br /><br />Entertainment: 2/10- I stayed through the whole movie. Ph33r my l33r st4y1ng pow3rzzzz :P<br />Sex: 1/10<br />Violence: 2/10. I'm actually kinda shocked I'm grading this movie on anything like that because hardly anything happens... ever.<br />Runtime: I want those two hours back!!!!<br />Shots of the backs of people's heads: There's tons of them.

B000063Y8F|4.0|I bought this garlic press some time ago, and have gotten consistently good use out of it.     I've heard it said that there's a better one out there by Kuhn Rikon, but from what I've seen of the design, I'm better off with this one, since every other garlic press I've tried with that design managed to pinch my fingers.     The design of this one by Rösle makes it almost impossible to pinch your fingers when pressing the garlic through, and it really does a nice job, so I'm content.
B000002GYI|5.0|OK - this album is brilliant. I bought the original LP when it came out, and have enjoyed it for many years, recently received the CD as a gift. It is better today than in 1981! Why? It's like going back and appreciating the alphabet after people have been writing \\"books\\" - using it for decades. So much of today's music just uses the work of others. Reused \\"tracks\\" have replaced \\"notes\\". Well, Kraftwerk used notes to make original tracks, and the collection on Computer World is one of the best. (See \\"The Man Machine\\" for another great collection)    But the brilliance goes beyond originality. After listening to Lady Gaga's \\"Poker Face\\" on the same equipment, I'm now playing Computer World. \\"Poker Face\\" is a great, modern pop song with heavy electronic influence, a lot of musical richness, vocal overlays, etc. - fill the room when playing it - a big sound. Hearing Kraftwerk's Computer World right after that transports you - back to when you were learning the alphabet - but there's more than that. It's clean, punchy, seminal, but it's also filled with music - simple clean overlays all over the place. If your brain can process it all, it is literally a feast for neurons. You will hear all of this greatness build as the tracks go by, with what seems to be a theme, and already by track 3, you'll be assaulted. Be prepared.    Track 1 (Computer World) is a kind intro. Easy to listen to, gives a good sampling of vocoder, nice easy electronic beat, smooth simple electronic keyboard line as a brakground, with a simple melody. Uplifting, energetic, clean, innocent. Wonderful.    Track 2 (Pocket Calculator) kicks up the energy from the start. A simple, punchy line to start (first four measures), with this wild staccato \\"backbeat\\" - how do you even describe that \\"backbeat\\" line? It's like it comes from your gut. Then comes the layering. If your brain can follow it all, you are in for a real treat.       The track continues to change - while remaining the same. Some lines are simply repeated, others are changing, some of the past lines are brought back in. Amazing song.       (Aside: I saw these guys in concert in the early 80's in the Savoy theater in NYC (standing, right near the stage), and when the lyric \\"by pressing down a special key, it plays a little melody\\" came, one of the players (it think it was Schneider) handed a small keyboard out to the audience to play, and I was able to reach it - was a blast.)    Track 3: (Numbers) - by the time you get to this track, you are somewhat prepared. You have opened the \\"in\\" door to the \\"Numbers\\" room, and it's freaky. It sounds so simple at first, starting with counting in German, the numbers from 1 - 8. But then comes - THE BEAT line. Wow. Crank that when it comes! Let's get funky! Today, people may think this beat and musical line fairly \\"normal\\", I suspect. But In 1981, it was \\"warpy\\" and \\"freaky\\". I don't think many people could \\"handle\\" it then. The song continues with the \\"Tour de France\\" style sharp \\"ticks\\". The ticks are like some freaky clock, pushing the beat forward but not with a regular \\"tick\\" or pulsation (for a more regular \\"tick\\", see the older songs \\"The Robots\\", `Spacelab\\" - or actually, most others songs - from `The Man Machine\\" (1978)).       In 1981, this was like John Cage meets pop music - unbelievable, and \\"too much\\" for some people.       When I hear this beat, I can think of so many edgy modern songs that follow from it.    Track 4: (Computer World, Pt. 2) - is like opening the \\"out\\" door to the \\"Numbers\\" room, and leaving it - whoa - and just in time. It's brilliant - this track is taking you down, slowly, easily, as if you are hearing the \\"Numbers\\" room fading into the background, all with the \\"Computer World\\" theme carrying you through. At the end, you are in the middle of what sounds like a bunch of cell phone conversations - Kraftwerk's way of telling us what's to come.    Track 5: (Computer Love) You are now out of the \\"Numbers\\" room, in a much more comfortableplace, with a simple melody, simple backbeat - NOTHING like the first four tracks. Consider it a respite for what's to come. The song does build a bit into the end, but remains calm and serene.    Track 6: (Home Computer) You are not getting out so easy. Track 6 now starts to get dark, but just slightly so. Just a bit like the later musical line in \\"Poker Face\\", but more staccato here. But now the musical lines keep changing - from that straight and semi-dark line, to what might be described, as if seen in a movie, as \\"bubbles\\" rising - with heavy reverb. Where in the world did these guys come up with that musical line? Then, at about 4:20 into the song, the \\"bubbles\\" overlay with a whole bunch of wild sounds - similar to \\"tinkling glass, steam, punchy high frequency bursts\\". Go listen to it, words don't do it justice.    Track 7 (It's More Fun to Compute) Now, we're getting sinister. We're now firmly in the World of the Computer, and there's no going back. You've heard too much to go back. As I recall, the live version of this was smoother, more \\"song-like\\", but I like the studio version better.    If you've read this far, this won't pertain to you, but many people are just simply not going to appreciate this music. Feel lucky if you do. One reason is that it's tough to penetrate the originality. It is just not the usual \\"same as usual\\" western music. Also, to some, it sounds like \\"confusion\\", while other can seemingly process each of the lines in parallel, and it sounds quite clear. If your brain can process it, you'll certainly have a great time with this album.
0071636080|4.0|How many iPods do you own?<br /><br />I ordered the first Windows-compatible model on launch day. I had to wait until then because I didn't have a working Mac at the time; now I have two of them.  Since then, I've accumulated new iPods at the rate of roughly one a year.  Some day soon I'll be able to open a small museum featuring all of them and the three inch thick PowerBook that I used in grad school (it came with a whopping 32 Mb hard drive).<br /><br />Am I a prodigal gadget geek?  A spendthrift music maven.  Nah.  I blame the presentation skills of Steve Jobs.<br /><br />You can't get very far studying current ideas about presentations and public speaking without the example of Steve Jobs popping up over and over again.  And for good reason-- he excels at selling us stuff.  Jobs is one of the few CEOs of a large corporation who is a household name and whose presentation skills clearly add value to his company.  His showmanship at Apple's product launches generate buzz and demand-- if not lust-- for Apple's products.  Clearly my expanding collection of superseded iPods proves that I'm not immune. And when Jobs was ill there was a great deal of concern about whether Apple would be able to generate anything close to that excitement without him and whether the company would be mortally wounded by his absence at these events.  His value to Apple is so great that the SEC opened an investigation into whether shareholders had been harmed because Jobs' illness had been downplayed.  If he wasn't around to convince us we had to have stuff that we never knew we needed, who would?<br /><br />So it isn't surprising that many of the leading presentation experts focus on Jobs as a clear example of how strong presentations can make a real impact.  What has amazed me is how many of these writer (Gar Reynolds, Presentation Zen; Guy Kawasaki, all kinds of great books) have actually worked with Apple or on Steve Jobs' presentations. It seems that Apple isn't just a place where they create great presentations but also a crucible of thought on what it takes to make a presentation great.<br /><br />Now Carmine Gallo has written The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs with the idea of pulling back the curtain on Jobs' big presentations to show us how they are put together and some techniques that we can borrow to improve our own talks.  Probably the most important thing that Gallo reveals is how much work actually goes into crafting one of Jobs' presentations.  Despite the fact that the final results are persuasive, polished, and entertaining, Steve Jobs is not a natural presenter who just gets up in front of an audience and speaks off the top of his head.  Instead, he relies on a whole team of professionals who spend weeks helping him write, design and rehearse every one of his talks.  Suddenly it makes sense that so many of those experts have personal experience with Jobs.<br /><br />While this might initially seem discouraging to those of us who don't have the resources of an entire corporation at our disposal, it's actually very liberating to know because it means you don't have to be a \\"natural\\" either.  With enough thought, planning and practice anyone can improve their public speaking skills.  Sure, it's going to take some effort to put together and deliver a really great talk, but making the effort can help you rise above the sea of bad presentations out there.  Work hard on your presentation and deliver it in a way that makes it look effortless and you can be a star!<br /><br />Some of the other major strategies that Gallo focuses on include:<br /><br />Making time for rehearsal:  Jobs rehearses his presentations over and over and over again until he's confident that he knows his material and that he's got all of the various elements (script, slides, props, demos) just right.  Rehearsing will help you iron out the kinks in your own talk and calm your nerves when you're confident that you know what you're going to say.<br /><br />Taking the needs of your audience into consideration:  It isn't enough to just get up in front of an audience and share information or try to sell something.  Steve Jobs knows that he needs to meet the expectations of his audience if he wants to hold their attention.  They need to see Steve Jobs up on stage in his familiar black turtleneck with cool new gadgets, jokes, slick slides and product demos (preferably short ones).  You need to be just as aware of the needs of your audience and focus on how you're going to engage them.<br /><br />Displaying your passion for your topic:  If you don't feel strongly about what you're talking about, how do you expect your audience to care?  Gallo repeatedly quotes Jobs discussing his belief that his success is due to the fact that he feels passionately about his work. There's a great scene where Jobs tears up during the editing of Apple's \\"Think Different\\" commercials because he is so moved by the message that he's helping craft. He sees Apple as having changed the world in a positive way and encourages others to do work that they really believe in.  Anyone who has ever worked to sell a product or an idea knows that it's a lot easier when you're selling something that you can believe in yourself.<br /><br />Creating an antagonist:  One of the best ways to build strong emotions for a product-- create a villain.  Jobs often contrasts the ideas he's presenting against examples of other companies (Microsoft), products (the PC) or technical limitations (slow internet access on conventional cellphones).  Presenting a problem and offering a solution is a great way to win over an audience while building excitement and loyalty.<br /><br />There is much more to recommend in The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, though the book does have a few drawbacks.  Using the example of one public figure throughout is an interesting way to focus attention, though some readers may want to hear about the strategies of other speakers.  And it does get repetitive hearing the same Apple launch presentations recounted over and over again.  The design of the book itself is also a bit awkward-- side topics are often jammed into the main text in a way that makes it hard to follow.<br /><br />But this is a book that has a lot of valuable concepts for students of public speaking, especially those who don't come to it as \\"naturals\\" and need tips on how to prepare in order to overcome that challenge.t get up in front of an audience and share information or try to sell something.

B0015DYIH2|2.0|Nothing in this story was what I was expecting. After reading the first 3 series, the excitement in the whole storyline between Bella and Edward died out. I didn't know how Stephanie Meyer was going to end it, but I guess she wanted to have a happy conclusion for all of her characters but I am not sure if it made her audiences satisfied. I was hoping for more, esp since Bella and Edward was finally consummating their love for one another through marriage. I also noticed a big change in Jake's character from New Moon to Eclipse & it just kept on getting worse in Breaking Dawn. Edward also seemed like a changed character, he becomes more of a stalker and depressing with all his negativity around Bella. As for Bella, she seemed more childish than before. I am glad the way the story ended the way it did bc I no longer crave for Twilight though I will be surprised to see how the movie spans out & how many changes should be made to make it watchable.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|Wolfmother has brought us a whole new sound scape on this album. From the first track \\"California Queen\\" to the last \\"Violence In The Sun\\" they pound their music into your brain with a thunderous effect. I have loved them since the first album and continue to love them throughout this monumental album. \\"10,000 Feet\\" is a great song [my fav on the album] to blast out your speakers. If you want true rock n roll then this is the album to buy. They stand toe to toe in my opinion to greats such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. They just don't have a lot of albums under their belt yet.

B000J0OANO|5.0|We used to play this game often at small family get-togethers.  The first right answer is the one that wins the point, so the player with the faster mind or the faster paddle wins.

As one other reviewer said, some questions are rather dated and no longer hold true.
0385504225|3.0|Writing a review for this book is difficult, because by the end you will be fixated on the last twist and whether or not you found it believable or cliched.<br /><br />However, before that one final twist, The Lost Symbol is an enjoyable ride. As always Brown's play on words keeps you entertained as he \\"reveals\\" facets of history lost to the average person. His new look at American history and the role Masons play is engaging and will drive Mason critics and conspiracy theorists wild.<br /><br />This time Langdon has to help out a friend who belongs to the powerful Solomon family. As expected he has a gorgeous mature sister who will join the wild ride as the two are fighting against a mad man who is convinced he has unveiled a powerful Mason secret that only the older Solomon has access too.<br /><br />Get ready for wild riddles, pyramids, and entertaining play on words, facts, and history. Brown is able to intersect several stories into one novel taking you back and forth from villain to Langdon's perspective in no time.<br /><br />Some of the novel's weaknesses include the overuse of the phrase, \\"My GOD!\\" and side characters whose roles seem not to be clearly defined are they villains or simply hindrances? And most of all the final twist revealing how everyone is connected in this huge puzzle, left me disappointed. I can only assume it is a type of revelation that readers will either love or hate. I certainly was no fan of it.<br /><br />The ending seemed frazzled. Why isn't Peter going to the hospital and taking his time to reveal this last ridiculous Mason secret. Uh...you're missing your hand, sir. I think secrets can wait or be shown after you're seen by medics. The Mason secret seemed too sugary of an ending. I think Brown wanted to go for a moment of patriotic appreciation, but it seemed force.<br /><br />This definitely is no Da Vinci Code, but it's an easy beach read. Expect nothing more than that and you'll be satisfied.
B002ONC9MS|5.0|\\"An Education\\" is a coming of age film set in London in 1961.  It centres on the life of Jenny (Carey Mulligan), an almost precociously bright middle class high school girl, whose father has expectations of her attending Oxford to read English.  However, even the sometimes best made plans can come unstuck.<br /><br />Jenny falls into the orbit of David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard) who is probably twice her age but extremely beguiling.  His world is one of money and good times although the means of raising this money is, at best, marginal and, at worst, criminal.  Jenny chooses to ignore these facts as she falls for the trappings of the lifestyle.  Slowly, her studies fall by the way side until she eventually walks out from school as David's fianc&eacute;e.  She soon learns, however, that David has a secret he hasn't shared with her.  It is this secret that conflicts the relationship.  Jenny is left without an education and a very bleak future.  But she is made of sterner stuff.<br /><br />This is an excellent film.  Carey Mulligan deserves an Oscar nomination.  She is wonderfully supported by Alfred Molina as her naïve father, Emma Thompson as the overly stern school principal and Olivia Williams as the genuinely concerned teacher.  Each plays a marvellous supporting role.<br /><br />I recommend \\"An Education\\" unreservedly.  It was a couple of hours very well spent.

But if you are a true MJ fan, you will understand between the lines and feel the emotion he evokes to you.  Enjoy and then keep his vision going by sharing this book with others.  Good people should be edified.  It is up to us to keep his message of love, peace and healing in all we do.  God bless his work, family and fans always.  LJ.
0312944098|4.0|The UK paperback edition's backcover hosts an exerpt from the Sunday Time's review of this book according to which Mr. Archer is \\"well placed to be the British John Grisham\\". This might be partly true in the sense that the legal technicalities of the trials Danny - the main character - is subjected to are finely explained and presented in a way which is never boring. However, this statement is also inaccurate as whereas Mr. Grisham's books often denounce the moral and systemic corruption of the US Legal system, in this book judges, lawyers and even prison institutions are mostly depicted as highly moral pillars of society...obviously with the exception of Mr. Spenser Craig, QC whom the reader will soon discover to be a veritable black sheep of his profession. The character of Mr. Frasier Munro, a Scottish lawyer who assists Danny in connection with his succession troubles brings the reader back to a concept of the legal profession which unfortunately I believe has long disappeared when lawyers still had a truly intense personal relationship with their clients and sincerely cared for them. The book has some slow passages, not many though. The last 50 pages are truly engaging, to be swallawed in half an hour intense page turning. Overall a very good read.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|well if anyone of you have seen both iron man and the hulk (new version) you would know that in the hulk at the end of the movie \\"tony stark\\" walks into the bar rhe general is in and says we should join our teams... now that sounds like an iron man hulk team up movie. as for iron mn truely a fantastic movie in every way
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol, while interesting and informative (well, to the greatest extent a fiction book can be), lacked the pizazz that Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code had.

B00000K2VZ|5.0|THis woman was talented in a way that most modern singers can't even come close to.<br />And this was a great disc from her and more would have followed if she hadn't blown it all to the grave with drugs. Hard  Drugs suck and I don't buy the argument that hard drugs made rock great , most of the best artists did their best work when they were not on heroin staring at a wall.  Janis never made a bad album of any style and this is a seventies rock/pop disc that is still great.  One can only wonder what great hits and songs would have flowed from her if she were still around. She'd be a grand dame of rock no doubt.
B0025KVLTM|2.0|The only thing I cared about when I picked up the new remastered version of Sgt.

They didn't.<br />The reprise of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is supposed to be the great rock and roll lead-in to our huge finale, and it is absolutely essential to have - in fact, the whole effect hinges upon - Paul McCartney yelling his head off at the end. With that missing, the song is ruined and it remains so.<br />I haven't found out yet on these \\"remasters\\" if they've restored the missing harmonica on \\"Thank You Girl\\" or thrown out that horrid dry guitar on \\"I Feel Fine\\" and \\"She's a Woman\\"....if not, we'll have to rely on those otherwise unnecessary Capitol version CD releases, but as for Sgt. Pepper...no salvation.

0812550706|3.0|After having read so many good reviews about this book, then reading it myself and not liking it, I sometimes get the strange feeling that I haven't read it properly. Has that ever happened to you?     Enders game, for me, was a rather ordinary read. I didn't find the message profound, I didn't find the characters extraordinary, and I was not impressed with the extended scenes of virtual combat. In fact, I became very tired of the perpetual training that Ender had to go through.     I am unsure as to why there is so much hype about this book even to the point that it has become required reading in some schools.     Maybe I missed something, I don't know, but whatever it was must have been important. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book, however, it isn't in and of its self. It totally depends on whether Card's style suits you.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|The Jeeves and Wooster series was great when it first came out in the 90's, and we're enjoying it all over again with our teenage children -- who, by the way, though skeptical, have found it funny enough to want to watch! The humor is sometimes cerebral, and sometimes just plain fun.  Highly recommend these DVDs.
0452295548|2.0|Plain and simple, the book is a disappointing mess and devoid of any deeper meaning.  While the book is relatively short, it could have been easily compressed to half its length just by cutting just some of the repetitious elements.  The author's quasi-spiritual musings about 'nirvana' and its relationship with the specialized functions of the brain's right hemisphere are vague and don't really shed much light on either the scientific or purely personal sides of traumatic brain injury. I just expected so much more...    There are much better books about traumatic brain injury out there, don't waste your time with this one.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I would say this movie is targeted more toward older audience with a lot of its underlying theme but still enjoyable by younger kids. Special feature disk was quite good as well as it discuss some decision they have made in coming up with character and setting as well why certain scenes took place. I would definitely recommend blu-ray package or DVD stand alone since you get so much more as well digital copy.
B00009MGGI|5.0|\\"But they all, all of them, betray us eventually.  They love us, but not quite enough.  They trust us, but not quite enough.  And we trust them to be entirely human... meaning less than trustworthy.  Which means that we can never entirely sleep.  As the cat's eyelids flicker, some part of us must stay awake, always, ready as the coiled spring is ready.\\"      I'm in the process of watching this lengthy trilogy of British political drama for possibly the 4th or 5th time.  This is the sort of thing one can watch over and over.  I've found that the language sticks in my consciousness, it buries itself there for future reference... and reflection.  It really is quite excellent.  So much intrigue, nihilism, and corruption... House of Cards shows the dark side of humanity in a very matter of fact, believable way.      Read the description and other reviews on amazon, and if it sounds like something you'd be interested in, then buy it.  Nuff said, end of story.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|When Norah Jones first burst onto the scene, I responded enthusiastically. For some reason, my appreciation for her quickly dimmed and I stopped listening. Then, I received \\"The Fall\\" in my Christmas stocking and fell immediately in love with her sweet melodies.  I especially like the song, \\"You've Ruined Me,\\" both for the music and Jones' fine singing in the upper register.    This is Jones' best album for overall consistency and content. There isn't a bad song in the lot. But be aware, the songs are melodious. If you are after driving rhythms and loud guitars, this album isn't for you.
B002YVAT72|5.0|Rec'd this turntable for christmas and haven't stopped using it.  It does exactly what it was made to do, convert vinyl to mp3s or cds.  I don't understand why someone would buy this item to be used as a turntable to listen to their records.  The product is a USB turntable to Convert.  Oh well, the only part I wasn't thrilled with was having to download itunes software.  The \\"ez vinyl\\" that comes with this transfers the recorded media to itunes.  Not a problem, I just dragged and dropped to windows media player and either burned cds or sync to my mp3 player (it is not an ipod). The additional software in the box, \\"audacity\\" took out the clicks and cracks without much work on my part. You can also convert 78's with the audacity software.  This item looks great (with it's smooth black piano finish) and so far has done a wonderful job.  I can finally get some real oldies transfered to my mp3 player.  I can honestly say this is the best gift I rec'd this year and recommend it highly.
B0021L8UQ2|2.0|Poor Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman at 12 years). All she wanted was a little love. Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles to remove first. This takes planning, finesses, and a little collusion.<br /><br />This defiantly is not &#34;Dementia 13&#34; but it is a want-a-be. The film is highly predictable as most of the blood is in the first scene. That is because it was supposed to be a psychological thriller yet turned out to be a cheap slasher. The movie may be in a hurry to end but you do not have time to ward the unaware schnooks that they are about to be dispatched by a household utensil or the odd tool. The only spooky or over the top violence was when a poor defenseless pigeon was dispatched with force.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-ray but nothing really looked fake on the big screen TV.
1416594787|5.0|Other reviews have more than properly given this book credit and honest commentary. I can only add that I believe this might be his most important work. Yes, some of the material has been said and done in his other works, and that is why it is important to continue on course.    There are still people hiding in fear, believing in superstition and ignoring proven scientific facts and well developed theory (unproven) but based on solid information. I do not care if you are religious or not. What is most frightening are the people that are religious trying to force their confused, disorganized and unprovable beliefs onto everyone else. Schools should teach facts as Dawkins says. Outside of school, you are free to pursue religious beliefs. Now, we have 'nut jobs' on TV preaching hate but hiding behind religion. That is dangerous, it is wrong and people get killed because of that behavior. I cannot think of anything that goes more against the teachings of Christ than preaching hate and violence!    This is the ground that Dawkins covers in this book. Going over the proof of evolution and the myths and unproven beliefs of religion. This is new for Dawkins. Going over the evidence and providing the proof and not assuming it to be truth or the reader to assume the truth.    Believe what you will after reviewing the evidence. I know I believe in scientific fact but have no desire to strip anyone of their religion and neither does Dawkins.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This British Comedy Series has to be on everyone's list of \\"favorites\\" and/or \\"best\\"  program lists.  I know it's on mine.<br /><br />The only bad things are that there are only 20 episodes and that John Cleese is now suffering from the results of the physical pratfalls he performed in the series.  Watching him perform was (and still is) magic.  Even his \\"fist waving\\" could bring hoots and hollars to the most sedate viewer. I always slipped into Pampers before watching the show, if you get my meaning.<br /><br />It's comedy was way ahead of it's time.  Modernized to todays surroundings, it would rival anything on television for writing and character development.  The one problem would be in casting.  The original cast made the perfect ensemble.  I can't imagine who could fill the shoes of the original cast members.<br /><br />I enjoyed every minute...
B000I5XOVE|3.0|This is one movie that badly needs a remaster.  The Blu-Ray was made from an old 1080i master that has been upscaled to 1080p so the image is full of jaggies and visible pixels. Still a fun movie after all these years but when I buy Blu-Ray I expect reference level quality - this one just doesn't deliver.  Prepare for the old Hollywood Double Dip.

0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown has become formulistic (ok - not a real word, but hopefully you get the point).

I won't be reading another Dan Brown book!
B001FB55I0|4.0|I was hoping for more from this but it was busy paying homage to the prior Terminator catch phrases and not focused enough on plowing its own ground.  On Blu it was amazing to watch at home.  There is a scene at the gas station where a ginormous Terminator thing flattens everything in its path.  At the theater that scene was one of the best of all of the summer blockbusters.  At home it's not as impressive but the sound and picture quality on this disc is stunning.  I watched on a Panasonic plasma, 50\\", 1080p via HDMI from a Playstation3.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Tony Scott's D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu (2006) is a film based on a totally unrealistic premise, but is fascinating none the less.  Intricate, very well-written and acted, this film, which is totally wrapped up with the subject of travelling through time, has to be seen more than once to be fully appreciated.<br /><br />Denzel Washington (Training Day) is ATF agent Doug Carlin, called to investigate an explosion aboard a ferry in New Orleans, that has killed over five hundred.  A dead woman, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton) washes up on shore, and becomes the focus of his investigation, when it appears that her SUV, loaded with explosives, was the source of the explosion.  Working with an FBI investigative team that includes, Agents Paul Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood), and Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg), Carlin discovers that a technology exists that enables the past to be viewed on a computer screen.  Known as Snow White, the team has the ability to look back in time exactly four days and six hours.  Not only can they see the past, but they can see through walls, and at any angle.  The technology is complete and utter fiction, explained with a multitude of scientific babble.  Accept it or not, the presentation is straightforward, drawing you deep into a world of all seeing voyeurism.<br /><br />The tone is unwaveringly serious, and the atmosphere tinged with darkness.  Things become only more absurd, as the laws of physics are bent further, when a message from the present is sent back to the past, resulting in the death of Carlin's partner.  The team is able to identify and apprehend Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), the terrorist responsible for the bomb blast.  The Government is satisfied, but Carlin wants more, he wants to change the past.  With Denny's help, Carlin returns to the past to try and save Claire.  In a quite remarkable way, Carlin, Claire, and Oerstadt relive the past.  It is decidedly different, and almost all the loose ends are tied up.  Reality is given a radical twist, in this most provocative thriller.<br /><br />Although the story is completely out there, as you might expect in a Tony Scott film, and a Jerry Bruckheimer production, the action sequences are slickly executed and well done.  Denzel Washington is very convincing as a man interested in solving a crime, and obsessed with saving a woman he thinks he knows.  Paula Patton performance is also very good, although her character's transition from victim to action hero is a bit much.  D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu thoroughly plays with your mind from start to finish, and yet at the end, you probably won't mind at all, although it is almost impossible to get the full impact of the film in a single viewing.  The wacky idea of being able to view the past is one matter, but what is perhaps the hardest thing to believe, is that the technology  would be used for law enforcement, rather than to kill, or destroy, or for profit, or to gain power, or further some other dark evil purpose.  The nature of man being what it is, the possibilities are limitless.eality is given a radical twist, in this most provocative thriller.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|Much like the other first wave bay area thrash bands (Megadeth, Slayer,- yes, even Metallica, Exodus) Slayer albums continue the same formula that seems to work for them. Fast song, slow mid tempo song. Problem is as good as a record as this sometimes can be- it sorta feels recycled in places. \\"War Painted Blood\\" has that same sorta riff as in \\"Angel Of Death\\" from Reign (still possibly one of the finest examples of a Thrash album PERIOD!)Another example would be \\"Pyschopathy Red\\"- which feels like an example of self plaguarism.   I say this with nothing but love for this band- I feel no band can really touch these guys. Lombardo (yes, he's back for another round after the slightly flat Christ Illusion) Araya, King and Hanneman turn up some very familiar sounding thrash metal as only they can do. For some reason the song that seems to stick out lyrically is \\"americon\\"- which is as closed to political as I remember this band getting. I can see some right-wing douche bags giving them somewhat of a hard time on writing something that doesn't seem very pro-America. But what about the music? Well, as I've said before- fans of Slayer should know what to expect. So really going to deep to elaborate is sorta redundant. It takes mostly whats good about their past and puts them in a blender, if you want more 'sung' vocals & melody ala Seasons and/or South of Heaven?  you got it- if you want straight up speed you got it (\\"Unit 731\\", \\"Public Display of Dismemberment\\" which is very where Dave Lombardo is close to doing blast beats) you want dissonant yet frenzied guitar shredding? You definetly got it! Enjoyable disc.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|I wont say i'm a FAN of Alicia Keys but I must say, Every album she's released has come in contact with me one way or another, Through friends, Family members, Radio, TV etc. It does not ever seem to fail, She's always (So Far) had something on each album that I really like. While not ever liking her album's as a whole the songs that I do like are QUALITY. Meaning the songs that I like by her so much you may think i'm a FAN. Nothing's wrong with Alicia Keys, I just don't find the great combination of vocals, music & lyrics in every song.<br /><br />Now, On this album. I've noticed some changes in sound. The beats are more Pop flavored (In My Opinion), This album is not as Soulful as her albums prior. The music here is a little softer or lighter than her previous efforts. The melodies on some of the songs are pretty. My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" (Of course), \\"Wait Til' You See My Smile\\", \\"This Bed\\" & \\"Empire State Of Mind\\". Those (4) songs are fantastic.<br /><br />\\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" has fabulous drum arrangment and bass, The sound of construction workers banging on metal in the far distance (That's the best I could do at the moment). \\"Wait Til' You See My Smile\\" starts off like a vanessa carlton song which caught my attention immediatley. \\"This Bed\\" is very 80's inspired, Reminds me of something Prince, Morris Day & The Time, Ready For The World etc. would've done sometime in the mid-80's (1985) (That was really excited for me). Last but not least \\"Empire State Of Mind\\" is very rich, Sounds like something you'd here in a movie, The chorus is large and the lyrics are rich and the background vocals are heavenly.<br /><br />When purchasing this album I honestly did not expect to LOVE every song (I already knew that wouldn't be the case) So I'm giving this album the benefit of the doubt by rating it (3) stars. The rest of the songs other than my favorites I named aren't bad at all they simply just aren't my taste, There's a difference in music actually being BAD versus something that's pleasing to me (My taste).<br /><br />The only real issue I have with the album is the BEYONCE' track \\"Put It In A Love Song\\", It's not well written at all and is completely out of place on the album. Alicia Keys and Beyonce' doesn't even sound right together. They should stick to doing seperate work, it's like Mariah Carey Featuring Whitney Houston or Whitney Houston Featuring Mariah Carey on one of Whitney or Mariah's album tracks, it's just not supposed to happen. Unless it's titled as A Duet on a soundtrack for a movie or something other than a studio album. Also the word \\"Featuring\\" is a bit tacky between two big names.<br /><br />Other than that the album is listenable and likeable.<br /><br />******************UPDATE Dec.20.2009******************<br /><br />\\"That's How Strong My love Is\\" Is a NEW favorite of mind from the album, It's an acoustic. Alicia Plays the piano so rich & beautifully in this song. Something about this song reminds me of Force MD's \\"Tender Love\\" from 1988, I believe it's the melody, the harmonies and the arrangments...Well, That's pretty much the song. No surprise, Alicia already covered the song and did an amazing job, Apparently she love the song so much she created a song very similar. The album's rating goes up to(3.5)... With this song added I know like (5) songs out of the (14) available. Again, The songs I like are QUALITY, Therefore... (You know the rest)<br /><br />Also, I would recommend purchasing the iTunes Deluxe Edition of the album instead of the standard copy. You'll get (4) extra songs, (2) of which should have been original tracks on the album, had they been- This would definitely be pushing a (5) star rating right now.<br /><br />\\"Stolen Moments\\" which was orinally a track from her unplugged release in 2005, Not a favorite of mine.<br /><br />\\"Heaven's Door\\" I truly love this song, This shouldv'e been an \\"Empire Original\\", Goes with the themeof the album I don't see what the problem is.<br /><br />\\"Through It All\\" This one is also a favorite of mine and should've (again) been an \\"Empire Original\\" (Who chooses what goes on the album?) ::Disgusted::<br /><br />\\"Pray for Forgiveness\\" I don't like this one, It starts off pretty but as the song goes on I get bored.<br /><br />Last but not least, There is also an \\"Empire Edition EP\\" with some old, New and live Material. (2) songs<br /><br />\\"Almost There\\" Originally performed by Michael Jackson, She did a fabulous take on this song. It has more of the sound of \\"The Diary...\\" rather than this NEW album.<br /><br />\\"Lover Man\\" Another favorite of mine.<br /><br />I know I said I wasn't a FAN and I also mentioned how someone could get the idea that I am due to those quality songs that I constantly play on repeat. I heard the extra tracks through a friend of mine and couldn't resist them as my own. I must say I am impressed with the \\"Empire Sessions\\", Not the album, rather the sessions as  'Know the difference\\". Again ahd the standard copy included these extra songs instead some of the others I (personally) believe it wouldv'e created a better album as a whole.s also a favorite of mine and should've (again) been an \\"Empire Original\\" (Who chooses what goes on the album?) ::Disgusted::     \\"Pray for Forgiveness\\" I don't like this one, It starts off pretty but as the song goes on I get bored.    Last but not least, There is also an \\"Empire Edition EP\\" with some old, New and live Material. (2) songs     \\"Almost There\\" Originally performed by Michael Jackson, She did a fabulous take on this song.

B000E1JOSE|5.0|This dvd and cd (I have both) are definitely collectibles.  Roy is singing with and for his peers, other singers and entertainers.  James Burton on lead guitar, with Jennifer Warnes, k. d. lang and the one and only Bonnie Raitt singing backup, along with Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, J. D. Souther, T.

For Roy's fans, it is one of the few live concerts still available commercially.  What an evening!
B001UV4XUQ|2.0|This movie had all the makings for greatness and a fun movie experience, except that in the end, it became academic, a self-help guide to getting over a relationship with a commitment-phobe who took advantage of the generous heart of an individual who proclaimed with his whole being that he was in love. It seems criminal to indulge in a relationship and lovemaking when in your heart you know that you can't see your life going forward with the person. To glamorize and romanticize this in a film was just sad and disappointing. Too bad. There were so many moments in this film that I just loved. It is filled with wonderful detail and sweetness. I particularly loved the Hall & Oates dance sequence. But for all of it's goodness, it is overwhelmed and washed away when this film ends with a train wreck and the story's shabby attempt to substitute the mess with a patchwork rainbow.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.    Skylar-Spock definitely stole the show as he was/is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime - having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.    The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New-Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New-Checkov was over-done with the geekery TNG-style, New-McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New-Sulu was not quite right. New-Uhura and New-Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high-ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.    The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary-looking space-ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?     On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini-homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline/reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean-cut also opens up the possibility of more \\"visitors\\" from the original Trek timeline/reality in future movies without \\"ruining\\" TOS :)
B002RKSWH4|2.0|There are a few places where the character Hastings provides a \\"facsimile\\" of letters, scribbled notes, etc.  These things are missing from the text.  While they are not absolutely vital and can be discerned from context clues (if not at the spot of the omission, then later), having them present would obviously be preferable.  The missing parts can be found by looking up the book at Google Books, if you have a computer nearby and want to go to the trouble.
0810983915|5.0|bought these for 9 yr old Granddaughter and she loves all of these books.Would highly recommend them.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|While I realize that this book is supposed to be for a YA audience, it is a book for adults as well. It is quick and easy read but don't start it unless you have enough time to read it all at once. I couldn't put it down stayed up way to late to finish it. It is a story about a teenage girl in a coma who has to choose whether to die and be with her family who perished in a car accident, or to live and face an unknown future as an orphan. We don't learn of her choice until the last page of the book and the author does a great job of keeping the reader in the dark. It is just beautifully done. I ended up crying as the book came to a close so keep tissues handy. You will need them.<br />(I read this on the Kindle for PC and it flowed well on my small netbook screen.)
B002T9H2LK|5.0|WARNING SPOILERS. 4.5 STARS. This movie is highly entertaining, the proof: I saw it with my mother, she does not know who is Quentin Tarantino, she does not know what Pulp Fiction means, she just saw the 150 minute film without stop (I thought it was much less time), she laughed through it all and when it ended she exactly said: \\"since a lot time ago I haven't seen such a good film!\\". Whoever does not feel and catch the tension in the first \\"chapter\\" and the scene in the bar, has no sensibility for good films and dialogues at all, I can say that without regret, guaranteed! How the tension rises in those scenes is something to be seen and heard, it is totally masterful.    Yes, there is goof, there is camp, there is absurdity, there is a very straight unseriousness and even unrespectfulness for one the most terrible and dramatic  periods of human history; nevertheless perhaps that is Tarantino's specialty: show the absurd, to laugh at the most horrible without shame, to laugh at the human misery and absurdity of violence and war. Kubrick did it on a smaller and subtler (humorist) scale on Full Metal Jacket; Tarantino plays it big with no shame at all. The capacity to laugh at ourselves is one of the things that makes us humans.    And yes: a total \\"Yeah! Get some!\\" to see in any movie Hitler being shot in the face with no mercy, only Tarantino could deliver us that.     Being honest I would give the movie 4 stars, the extra half star is because it is so unique in the WWII film catalogue and to do some justice in the average Amazon rating. I substract half star because the narration is not relevant and because is not Tarantino's best, that place still belongs to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, whatever your choice is.    Not every war film has to be politically correct and a history lesson, so reviewers that complain about this are missing the point of the film, a little of spice in our lives can do no harm. Final note: the music soundtrack, is very very good.
B002GPNQXU|5.0|It is uncommon for Disney to actually produce a singer with beautiful voice, which Demi is. This is her second album and my favorites are Catch me and Falling over me. These 2 songs show her beautiful voice and how well she does control it, without too much heavy metal type which Demi personally likes. After this album, she is now one of the top singers I will be looking for their works in the future. Also, one big plus point of this and her albums is that she also involves in song writings; a lot of talent in this person, this is a great work.

1401323820|5.0|I bought this book for myself for Christmas and read it twice now. I enjoyed the book it is a fun & easy read and looking forward to the next one ABC is releasing. I love the Castle TV series and think this is a great idea to have the book featured through the plot lines and go hand in hand with the series. Makes it fun if you love to read and you love the show.  I like the cross references and some of the lines are used in the show so for me it's a win win situation. If you like a good mystery and a fun TV series then Heat Wave will be worth your time to buy and read. I haven't invested myself in a TV series in many, many years but Castle hooked me and once I found out about the Heat Wave book being real and released through ABC it became it's own prop for the series, I was happy to see the book didn't fall short and disappoint me. I love a book that entertains me all the way through.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've owned the Polar 625x and this blows the doors off of it!  Polar blew it by not being compatible with Macintosh operating system - they should have teamed up with Garmin years ago.  Now Garmin has easily surpassed them.    Positives...  1) GPS is very accurate  2) Heart rate Monitor very accurate...not as finicky as Polars's  3) rechargeable battery...don't have to send to Polar every time I need a new battery  4) Garmin connect is way cool...gives you all the info you want/need and more (maps, heart rate, pace, mileage, cadence, elevation, etc)   5) through the Garmin Training Center software...much easier than Polar to set up all different kinds of workouts (tempo runs, fartleks, ladders, intervals, etc) and then easily uploads to your watch for easy access.  you can even schedule your type of run days in advance and your watch will remind you  6) Garmin website provides training videos    Negatives...  1) touch bezel a little too sensitive  2) Garmin Training Center software a little basic...but is more than made up for with Gamin Connect
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|One of the last of the apocalyptic films of the 1970's.  A year later cinematic science fiction would be forever changed by STAR WARS -- kinda funny as Lucas had one of the 1970's string of such doom and gloom films with THX-1138.  Based on the novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, it is of a world where over population is dealt with by not letting people live beyond thirty (in the book it was twenty, but the age of the stars made the change necessary).  Still, a pretty entertaining film.  Good performances by Michael York, Jenny Agutter, Richard Jordan and Peter Ustinov.  In her first screen role at a surgery parlor is Farrah Fawcett.  Directed by Michael Anderson ( AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, DOC SAVAGE, THE SWORD OF GIDEON) and with a really terrific score by Jerry Goldsmith.  Commentary by York and Anderson, a making of featurette.
0767827902|4.0|This film reflects Larry McMurtry's genius in every frame.  The actors : Ben Johnson,Timothy Bottoms,Cloris Leachman are excellent. The film resonates with a powerful authenticity of time and place. It's well worth seeing and emblematic of the \\"New Hollywood\\" films of the late 60's and early 70's like \\"Midnight Cowboy\\",\\"They Shoot Horses Don't They\\"  and many others. Still , it is too downbeat in foucs and tone to be one of my favorite movies. In addition, any great movie, in my estimation, must have characters that you care about.  Other than the mute boy with a disability who achieved this,none of the other characters fulfilled this goal.
1906694176|5.0|It might look redundant to read all reviews and praise for Stieg Larsson final chapter of his Millennium trilogy, but for you to really know what all the fuzz is about, you have to have been immersed in the complex and exhilarating world of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />The girl who kicked the hornets' nest start at the very exact point its predecessor (The girl who played with fire) ends, and I have to say that along with all the thousands (if not millions) of followers of Salander's saga, not only my expectations were high, but I guess as it happens with any series that came to a conclusion, you say to yourself \\" This has to be VERY GOOD in order to not spoil the momentum that the previous chapters might built in you\\", well, I join my fellow reviewers in saying that this book delivers and then some.<br /><br />All the main characters are still here, and even some new are introduced to the story, and it is true that at some point, you might sense that you lose track of what is happening with whom, yet Larsson magnificent writing help the reader to get back on track and into the amazing conclusion of a well written story.<br /><br />To properly understand and enjoy at its fullest the exhilarating conclusion of this trilogy, you have to have read the 2 previous chapters of this novel. At 600 pages, I have to say that at the 200 mark, I have the curiously sentiment that the ending for this novel will be a powerful one, and I have to say I was not mistaken.<br /><br />What we have learn from Salander and her personal history before joining Milton Security or even knowing thru(and even developing some type of a relationship)journalist Mikael Bloomkist, will be beautifully described,complemented and perfectly accommodate to the story that will conclude with a trial that will give you goose bumps and a face to face showdown with someone of Salander's past.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind, this is by far one of the best thriller novel that you will ever find, so for rejoice or just to say goodbye to a wonderful novel history, pick this one as soon as is available, your eyes would not stop reading, your heart will not stop pounding, and you will be joining the legions of admirers and supporters of one very interesting anti-hero named Lisbeth Salander.onderful novel history, pick this one as soon as is available, your eyes would not stop reading, your heart will not stop pounding, and you will be joining the legions of admirers and supporters of one very interesting anti-hero named Lisbeth Salander.
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|The start of the \\"Bob Lee Swagger\\" legacy was \\"Point Of Impact\\"!  One of my 3 favorite books of all time, (Lonesome Dove & Silence of the Lambs).  First mistake? casting: Mark Wahlberg is a 2nd rate \\"B\\" list actor at best.  The ideal for this guy is someone like a little bit younger Clint Eastwood.  Make this great story a \\"MAJOR' motion picture, not some watered down version.  Could NOT be more disapointed.

B002QH2NUA|5.0|Full disclosure, I'm a huge Macca fan.  He could floss and brush his teeth for 2hrs on dvd and I would savor every moment.  That said, I think anyone would enjoy this live show.  Paul has so much fun and loves performing his music.  His voice sounds strong and great here.  He is truly at home on the stage.  The comraderie with his current band (I think about 10yrs with Brian, Rusty and Abe and decades now with Wix) is beautiful to witness.  These guys play tight and strong, they must love these tunes like Paul himself as they do them very well.  The picture and sound quality are excellent, or maybe as excellent as your tv/sound set-up and mine is pretty good.  I don't know how it happens, but Paul seems to become younger with each song he plays...I swear he lost 20yrs playing this show. The set list is a great mix, mostly hits but they span Beatles, Wings and Paul solo.      Fave moments:   His emotion on Here Today  Sweet words on Linda before My Love  Breaking out some Jimmie Hendrix!   Highway  Mrs Vanderbilt  I'm Down w/old footage interspersed  Helter Skelter
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay! so im usually not a video girl and I like working out at the gym but since i'm running low on cash now i decided to start working out with this video followed by my very strict diet administered by my doctor....all i have to say is.....WOWOWOW!!!!! guys, ive been spinning for years, I was a swimmer and a water polo player for four years and i have pretty good endurance but this video reallly kicks your butt. Start with level 1, people! You may think you're too experienced for level 1 but i thought that too! This video is instructional and very challenging. Jillian is very motivational and the 20-minute high-intensity workout is probably the same as an hour of moderate exercise at the gym. All you need are dumbbells that you're comfortable with and a towel or mat. Do it for 30 days and then continue it 3-4 days a week. it's only 20 minutes of your life and you will not be disappointed.

B002436WJE|5.0|This movie seems to be a big DVD hit, and for good reason.  Taken is a return to some 1980s-type revenge movie antics, with Liam Neeson fitting into the hero role where we often expect a more musclebound star.<br /><br />If you've seen the trailer...you know where it's going.  Neeson is some kind of ex-CIA operative, a \\"preventer\\", whose daughter is kidnapped about 10 seconds after landing in Paris.  Using some spare info she gave him on a long distance mobile phone call, he travels to Paris, and within minutes is cracking heads.  The villains are a band of Albanian kidnappers who grab travelling girls and sell them into prostitution.  Neeson single-handedly takes down a good portion of the crew in the course of this film, wiping folks out with chops to the throat, bullets, and even a makeshift electric chair.<br /><br />The movie is pure audience manipulation, and you'll be rooting for Neeson to bash heads with glee.  The daughter and her airhead friend are helpfully stupid, immediately talking to strangers who work for the kidnappers, Neeson's ex-wife is appropriately awful, and the ex-CIA-guy-as-Superman cliche is amply employed.  The movie is very brisk, has several action set pieces (including at least two car chases filmed like car commercials, of course), and knows that you know it's getting ridiculous but not letting up.  Neeson is very convincing as a calm, collected, demolition man who knows all sorts of random, McGuyver-esque tricks and barely breaks a sweat as he chases cars on foot, takes out a dozen guys in a minute, and breaks all manners of bones and heads, while wrecking parts of Paris, to track down his daughter.<br /><br />The American version was surprisingly rated PG-13, even with Neeson taking out about 30 guys, and with the plot of international prostitute smuggling cheerily explored.  The Extended, Unrated version adds some more gunshots and chops in, and indeed is less jerky since you could tell things were cut to get the softer rating.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.  They'd be crazy not to explore Neeson whooping some other gang-du-jour in a prequel or new episode where his puppy is kidnapped.fans of fast-paced, man-on-a-mission revenge flicks, this is great for repeat viewings, and very ripe for sequel or even franchise potential.

B000AYQLX6|4.0|In light of the fact that fans and critics never seemed to accept John Lennon's solo work as anywhere on the level of his work in the Beatles, it's no wonder Lennon just dropped out of sight after this album. After all, Walls and Bridges is a delightful pop album for its time, with a production that salutes the glam rock era of the 1970s and two undeniably perfect pop songs in \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" and \\"#9 Dream\\", the latter easily as good as a Beatles song. The rest of Walls and Bridges is a mix of happy jams or artier introspective moments, including \\"Nobody Loves You\\", the ultimate anti-anthem for depressives. It all goes down easy, and there's many a pop artist who would be acclaimed for making an album at least as good as this. No one could have ever borne up under the weight of the Beatles' undeniably enormous artistic legacy, and all the expectations that came with it, so who can blame Lennon for simply giving up trying for a while? Judged on its own merits, Walls and Bridges is a fine pop album, perhaps even more likely to be enjoyed by those not intent on deifying the Beatles.
1439138311|2.0|I had been excited to read this book, based on the glowing reviews it received in the NY Times & elsewhere.  After finishing it, I was really disappointed.  While the writing is excellent, I was dismayed by the extraordinarily limited perspectives of the main character.  I understand her lack of sophistication, based on her upbringing in a tiny rural village, but I can't fathom her lack of curiosity or empathy for anyone in her new world.  Though the author is much celebrated, it was curious that he appeared to give his main character neither an inner life nor much in the way of a value system.
B0029O08WA|2.0|There are some good songs on this album, but there are also some really terrible songs.  I loved the Twilight soundtrack so this was really disappointing.  There are too many songs that sound the same and I just kind of tune out after a while.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|Once we bought our Wii system, I found out that GameCube games worked on it also.  I had never played GameCube so it opened up a whole new set of games for me.  The only problem was finding a controller since the Wii remotes don't work with Gamecube games.    I tried 2 other controllers prior to buying this one.  One - a cordless variety - I purchased at Walmart.  The controls were much too loose.  It was hard to focus on any small object during game play.  I also tried another variety that I purchased off Amazon - a cheap corded version.  It was completely useless.  I got so frustrated with trying to play that I gave up.  Finally I spent the extra money and ordered the official Nentendo controller.  It was well worth the extra money and I would have actually saved if I had bought it to begin with.  It is lightweight.  The cord is extra long which gives plenty of room to sit back from the television to play.  The controls are very quick and very precise.   This is definitely the controller that you want to purchase for your GameCube games on Wii.

1400032717|5.0|Christopher is autistic.  Usually, when someone hears the word autistic, they think that someone is unstable. They assume that the person is toxic, that they should just back away, turn, and run.  This book is not about autism. It is not a problem book. Christopher is Christopher, and he just happens to be autistic.  This book is about the murder of a dog, and how it turns into so much more, sets off a series of reactions. Christopher grows up, realizes what family really means, and, in the end, does finally learn who killed Wellington.  When Christopher finds Wellington in Mrs. Shears' garden, dead, he promises himself that he is going to find out who killed Wellington. He is going to solve the mystery, and he will do this no matter what it takes.  Even after his father forbids him from investigating any further, Christopher still proceeds. And he writes about it, as Siobhan tells him too. Siobhan is his teacher of sorts at school. She was one of my favorite characters in this novel.  Mrs. Alexander was another of my favorite characters. Mrs. Alexander is an old woman, Mrs. Shears' neighbor. She is friendly to Christopher, automatically invites him into her home, welcomes him with open arms. Except Christopher doesn't like strangers, and he hates to be touched.  Christopher keeps investigating, looking further and furhter into Wellington, and his murder. He questions many things, many people. Who hates Mrs. Shears enough to kill her dog, her only companion now that her husband is gone?  Christopher's father takes his novel, the book he's been writing, and hides it. Christopher's father is a good man, even if I didn't always respect or understand the things he did. He just wanted to protect Christopher, but not because Christopher is autistic. Because he loves Christopher.  The autism, Christopher's 'condition,' isn't really acknowledged in the book. He acts differently, sure. But people don't just come right out and ask, it's not spoken out loud. Christopher knowsthat he's different. And different is different, normal in it's abnormality.  It's when Christopher's looking for his book that he finds the letters. Letters from his mother...except his mother's dead. She died from a heart attack. It's just been Christopher and his father for a few years now. But if she's dead then where did these letters come from?  What if she's not dead? What if she's alive somewhere, somewhere without Christopher? Does she miss him? Why did Christopher's father keep these letters for him? Are there things he shouldn't know?  And who killed Wellington?  This novel, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, is the answer to all of those questions, and then some.    My favorite part about this book was how thoughtful Christopher is, the things he thinks about.  He really is a brilliant boy. He explains astronomy and math and I think I learned more from this book than I've learned in the past ten years of my life.  He's so thoughtful, so smart, and this book really made me think. I'd put it down, go to school, go out with my friends, and I'd still be thinking about this book. I'd be thinking about what happened, what I thought was going to happen next, and I'd be thinking about the things that Christopher had written.  About how we are so small, and how there are billions of people in the world we live on. And me, and my family, and my friends, and my friend's friends, and their friends. We are just part of things. We are just one town, in one state, in one country, on one continent.  And stars burn out, yet we still see their light years after they have burned out because it has taken this long for their light to get to us.   Those stars are already gone, yet we still see them.  And I'm still thinking about this book, even after I've already moved on to another book, even after I've put it back on my bookshelf and taken the next book.    Read this book. Read it read it read it.  I loved it. You will love it.  I love school times like these.    (cross posted from my blog, [...])

Angie Dickenson looks great and gave a decent performance given her age at the time. Supporting cast well chosen and gave excellent performances.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I do not feel bad or weird at all for saying this: I am so offended by television now, I can only turn it on for seconds at a time to search through the guide for either The Bells of Saint Mary's, Miracle on 34th Street, A Christmas Story, or It's a Wonderful Life.  I only turn it on occasionally for Christmas movies in other words.  Okay, so occasionally I might sneak in an old Andy Griffith Show as well, I wont deny that.  We as a nation and also as the global citizens of today need to seriously ask ourselves a question: What has become of us?  No really, what are we all becoming, and are we sure that we ever gave our consent to becoming it?  As we get older we tend to be more concerned for things like safety and morals, our children's safety and morals, living a good, simple life, and things of this sort.  This might even happen to you some day, but with all of the helevision programming being consumed into the youth's minds today, I literally shudder at what the future might look like.<br /><br />People from my generation and from those before it remember hearing Christmas songs when we'd go into stores.  And I mean actual Christmas songs, none of this 'Jingle Bell Rock' garbage no, no it was 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful' and real Christmas songs like that.  It created an enduring sense of sacred reverence and awe that is indescribable to people that have never experienced it.  But now I see that Christmas (and Christianity) is no longer \\"politically correct.\\" Shame on everyone who has taken part in allowing this to happen.  It might seem like a victory for you now, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and I guarantee you, a dechristianized world is a world that even you do not want to live in.<br /><br />That said, do give this movie an honest and objective try.  There is nothing quite like it that has ever been done in the cinematic form.  Maybe if we humble ourselves, educate our minds and work extra hard, God willing, we might get the nation back to a fit and moral state again.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|I officially give up on Tarantino. This movie was remarkably bad, it was hard to follow, and showed little creativity. If one knows nothing about history or the epic struggle that was World War 2, you might be entertained. Pitt is a good actor but his role in this seemed forced and contrived. This film was not worth making or watching. Don't waste your time.
B000MX7V5M|4.0|To Catch A Thief    Alfred Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief is a light hearted romp on the French Rivera. The French Rivera was one of Hitchcock's favorite locales and setting this movie there was like coming home.    Of course, you have the suave Cary Grant, aging but still on top of his game, and the beautiful Grace Kelly.  The world lost a great actress when she found her Prince Charming and left the film world forever.    With car chases along cliffs and a mysterious thief depriving the rich women of their precious jewels, you have a great film filled with humor and suspense.  The ending is a bit of Hitchcock's mischief.    Edith Head's costumes are in the grand European tradition.  She was nominated for an Oscar. Roger Burks's beautiful cinematography won the only Oscar.    The DVD quality is excellent as a number of reviewers have stated.  This is a great film in the old tradition of comedy and suspense with a tidy mystery tossed in for good measure.

B001UV4XUG|2.0|This is a skeleton of a movie. It's plot can be described in a series of statements: a boy likes a girl, she likes him back briefly, then he is very sad. I believe that the merit of this film is that it is so very thin and cliched, you can project your own lovelorn experiences onto the characters. There are cutesy indie references to listening to the Smiths in the elevator and reading \\"Dorian Gray\\" in a deli, but nothing unique is actually said or done. Zooey Deschanel and Joesph Gordon-Levitt have starred in a film together before- \\"Manic\\" and it's completely different, but if you're interested in this movie for the actors and wouldn't mind a film of much greater intensity, I would strongly it over \\"500 Days of Summer.\\"   Also, I'm not down on this movie because I don't like somewhat fluffy stories about love that isn't working out, I do like those. Just not as idiotically fluffy as this. If you just broke up from a relationship and want to watch something to project your feelings on, I would recommend \\"Love Me If You Dare.\\"

B000MAH8HQ|2.0|First, let me say I'm a great fan of Shakespeare, and there's no reason to offer a review of The Tempest here.  If you want to know what The Tempest is about, there's plenty of places to find that out.  This is a review of the Kindle edition of this edition of The Tempest.<br /><br />I bought this edition, paying $4.95 for the Kindle version, because I thought that it would be the Folger Shakespeare Library version of The Tempest.  It's not.  The Folger editions of Shakespeare's plays are handy study aids.  Each right hand page of text is accompanied with a left hand page of annotations, including illustrations contemporary with Shakespeare.  The spelling has been updated but the language has not been changed.<br /><br />This Kindle edition includes the memorial verses to Shakespeare found in the First Folio.  These can be found in many places.  It does not include the Folger's introductions to Shakespeare, or to this play in particular, nor does it include the essays that accompany the Folger editions of the plays.<br /><br />I have already loaded my Kindle with the Complete Works, for which I  paid, I believe, $0.99--a remarkable price for the greatest literature in the English language.  There was no reason at all for me to pay $4.95 for something I already have available on my Kindle.<br /><br />Buyer beware!  The Product Description for this edition of The Tempest DOES NOT apply to the Kindle edition.  Too bad.

0307454541|2.0|I requested this book from the library because I'd read amazing things about it.  Rarely have I been so utterly disappointed in a book. It was a ponderous read. Well over 400 pages, it literally takes half the book  until something happens that drives the resolution of the main mystery, and the moment comes about through coincidence rather than deductions on the part of the main characters. (I hate this deus ex machina approach to crime fiction.). On our way to this golden moment we get an endless back story about a cold case and the history of all the family members of a very large, very rich family. They hate each other, of course, so the reader has to keep track of not only relationships (assisted by a family tree that really should have been on the endpapers instead of buried in the first chapters), but also enmities.<br /><br />The main characters, discredited journalist Mikael and misfit Lisbeth, work together to solve the mystery of a girl's disappearance, and I would have liked the book far more if it had ended once this mystery was resolved. Instead we have to wade through revenge plots and corporate espionage and descriptions of high tech tools and hacking methodology. Enough, already.  Ironically the one mystery I wanted solved was ignored by the author. What is the full story of Lisbeth? What is wrong with her mother? Does her mother's problem relate to her issues?  These questions were at least as compelling to me as the main mystery.<br /><br />Finally, no one should read this book without being aware that it contains graphic depictions of animal torture and death and extreme violence to women (rape is the least of it).  Sensitive readers, especially cat lovers, should think twice before reading this book.
0385341008|5.0|This is one of the most satisfying books I've read in a long time. Written as a series of letters, the story unfolds and you get to know the characters as they write to each other. The author strikes a perfect balance of humor and serious elements. (I don't like a book that's all fluff, but I don't want to be overwhelmed with suffering either. I want to be entertained and surprised. I love a good story. A little history is good too.) This book was just right. It makes you think and makes you smile. I highly recommend this book.

His antagonists are so evil that you fear for the good guys with every twist.<br />Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant social misfit and Michael Blomkvist, a celebrity journalist/publisher  are  separately on a quest to find the leader of a sex trafficking and drug ring that have eluded and engaged many top politicians and public figures in Sweden; Salander (partly) because she is being framed for three murders, and Blomkvist, because he believes Salander to be innocent and two of the victims were his friends.<br />This is one of the best page turners I've ever read.

From the very beginning it felt like one of those campy old detective novels where the descriptions set the stage for bad writing instead of drawing a picture of the scenes in my mind. Granted, this could be because I listened to the unabridged audio book instead of reading the novel.   I suppose I wanted the tone of the conversation to be reminiscent of the character \\"Castle\\" in the show but the book had none of his flair or the electric chemistry between its characters. The truth is I ended up using the audio book as a cure for insomnia, I put it on at night and I drifted off to sleep before I knew it. I guess after that last comment, which I meant literally, I should add that although it took a bit of effort I did eventually make it through the whole thing and I'll admit that the plot was good I just didn't enjoy the writing style getting me through it.
B002Q9MZF6|2.0|The director, Robert Dornhelm (whose immediately previous contribution to classical-music filmmaking was a fine Karajan documentary released for the maestro's centenary), comes armed with many ideas about how to \\"open out\\" BOHÈME for cinematic purposes, and to put his stamp on it. During the opening Rodolfo/Marcello exchanges, we glimpse Mimì in her room, eavesdropping. Dornhelm returns to her a little later as she considers her course of action. Later she lingers in the hallway, waiting for the other Bohemians to clear out. By the time she actually confronts Rodolfo, we understand she has had her cap set for him for some time. This idea would be unwieldy in a stage production, of course; but having seen it perpetrated here, I see no gain whatsoever, and am grateful it has not occurred to any director in my prior experience. Does Dornhelm imagine that Mimì becomes more interesting and \\"modern\\" if she's made calculating and shrewd? Hasn't the first meeting in the dark between these two simple people always been touching in part *because* of the element of chance, and the heroine's sweet artlessness? Whatever the case, in Dornhelm's film, the two young lovers do make it to bed following their first famous duet. How long Rodolfo's friends are kept waiting at Café Momus, and what the amount of time might say about our poet's prowess, at least are left to the imagination.     The inspirations keep coming. As Schaunard tells the story of his day, we see it in flashback (black and white except for the bright colors of the Englishman's ill-fated parrot). At the start of Act IV, the beginning of Marcello and Rodolfo's scene is moved to the street; they continue their conversation as they walk to their flat. There are more remembrances, adjustments, overlays, composites, even modest visual effects (ersatz clouds whizzing by, glimpsed through the loft's windows). The film is all \\"touches\\" and \\"notions\\" -- a surfeit of them -- and the finished product is clunky, labored, and ultimately unmoving, because more important work has been left undone. If Dornhelm has any gift at all for directing actors, it is well hidden here: with one exception, the cast's performances range from anonymous to embarrassing.     The exception is Anna Netrebko, whose physical performance as Mimì is subtle, conscientious, and perfectly scaled to the camera. That beguiling dark lyric voice is in fine shape, and the part suits her well -- better than the florid music of the bel canto heroines she often essays. Her partner, Rolando Villazón as Rodolfo, pops his eyes, gestures broadly, and puts on a show of frightful overacting. He can be guilty of the same things on stage, and probably even in his daily life. But live theater is a different medium with its own rules and reasonable allowances, and Villazón has demonstrated for directors such as Vincent Paterson (MANON) that he can rein himself in when the material and the production call for it. Here, he's at his big-projecting stagiest against a would-be naturalistic milieu, with a female lead who is more camera-savvy, and it all makes for a terribly uncomfortable fit. I am not sure where the recording of the soundtrack fell within the chronology of Villazón's 2007 vocal crisis, his attempted comeback, and his 2009 vocal crisis, but knowledge of his struggles makes his tentative or hard-pressed moments stand out in sharper relief. His future remains uncertain at this writing, and it will be a great shame if this tenor, who began so promisingly, lives down to the gloomiest predictions circulating. There are long stretches of attractive and persuasive singing here, but he cannot be said to sound at his best, and he and Netrebko do not demonstrate their vaunted chemistry as much as one anticipates. Their passionate display near the end of Act I is a sterile and choreographed affair, not helped by the director's silly camera angles, which suggest a parody of a perfume ad.     Among the rest of the cast, Vitalij Kowaljow (a surly Colline) and Nicole Cabell (Musetta, more comic minx than alluring siren) do well with the Coat Song and the inescapable Waltz, respectively. George von Bergen acts the Marcello sung by Boaz Daniel; Adrian Erod stands in for Stéphane Degout's Schaunard -- none makes a striking impression. The talented conductor Bertrand de Billy, leading the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, is only workmanlike here; it is not a reading long on poetry, affection, or individuality, nor one evincing the greatest sensitivity to the singers.     Technical shortcomings are as numerous as directorial gimmicks: post-synchronization is little better than that seen in Ponelle's opera films of almost 40 years ago. The blocking is rudimentary and the editing jagged, most of all in Act I. On the basis of this DVD, I would have guessed the film to be two decades older than it is; the quality is muted and dingy, and I hope it looked better in theaters. (If it did, the transfer has been botched by the DVD label, Kultur...which would be no surprise. I dread to see their name attached to anything I plan to buy, and have previously suggested their slogan be \\"When You're Glad To Get It At All\\" or \\"Kultur DVD: Striving For Adequacy Since 1997.\\") The translation provided in the optional English subtitles is so heavily condensed as to be barely adequate. In protecting viewers from having to read more than a few words at a time, and neglecting to translate lines deemed \\"nonessential,\\" the responsible parties have deprived us English speakers of much humor, detail, and verbal nuance.     In fairness, there are things here that do work: I believe Act III comes off the best, because Dornhelm is at his least fussy there, Villazón is relatively restrained, Netrebko as touching as ever; and amidst this confluence, we hit one of several patches of Puccini that are close to bulletproof. Still, one can do better. For Netrebko and Villazón together, stick with the Virgin L'ELISIR D'AMORE or theDG MANON. For a film of BOHÈME, the 1967 Karajan/Zeffirelli (on DG) is more interestingly conducted and overall better sung (it even has the better Mimì -- Netrebko is an exotic and intriguing visitor to this musical world, but the young Mirella Freni actually lived there). The 1967 too has shortcomings, but Dornhelm's film duplicates them all, with fewer compensations. For a DVD of BOHÈME in general, go with one of the Met performances available on DG, with the slightly later Stratas/Carreras having an edge on the Scotto/Pavarotti. An honorable mention goes to the 1989 San Francisco performance (Kultur again, alas), a late-career reteaming of Freni and Pavarotti in a beautiful and perceptive Francesca Zambello production. Dornhelm's film should have been able to stand alongside any of these, but it is a major disappointment: as artificial as Mimì's embroidered flowers, and little more fragrant.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Star Trek (the reboot) succeeds in that it establishes a group of likable characters set for their next adventure--I will absolutely be there for the sequel--but as a film it disappoints a bit; with its paradox-filled plot, padded running length, generic villains, and lack of any real subtext it's only noteworthy in what it sets up, not what it puts on screen.    2.5/4
B00122GHKC|5.0|This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it.  It is beautifully written, entertaining, at times amusing, poignant, and above all revealing.  The author is very open about his weaknesses, his mistakes as a young man, his confusion about his place in society.  While his ancestry is remarkable, he's traveled extensively, attended outstanding schools, lived in so many places, has such a large multi-cultural family, that it was interesting to read about those things that may be common to many of us. Lessons he learned from his parents and grandparents focused on the importance of education, honesty, fairness, straight talk and independent judgment.  His experiences may have been difficult at times, but through them he gained a deep understanding of the human condition of many cultures.  Reading this book has given me such insight into our first Bi-Racial President.  This book would make a perfect Christmas present.
B001FB55I0|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.    2/4
B0012K1ILW|3.0|First off, I hope everyone realizes that Erykah Badu is probably not going to be able to make another [[ASIN:B000005AYM Baduizm]]. I've always been a fan of hers, but I couldn't really get into [[ASIN:B00006ZCFH Worldwide Underground]]. But after all the buzz I heard about New Amerykah Part One (4th World War), I finally decided to check it out.<br /><br />I have to say that this album is a little overrated. For starters, many of the six and seven-minute songs are that long only because after the actual songs are over, they're followed by some out-of-place political speeches by some unknown male. Also, there are a number of times where Erykah provides bizarre lyrics and thus makes you wonder exactly what she's talking about (see \\"The Cell\\" or \\"Amerykahn Promise\\"). \\"My People\\" sounds like a loop, and to call the production on \\"Twinkle\\" disorganized would be an understatement.<br /><br />It's a relief when Erykah's more standard fare shows up, like on \\"Honey\\", \\"Master Teacher\\" (featuring vocals from a Stones Throw artist named Georgia Anne Muldrow), \\"Me\\" and possibly \\"That Hump\\". New Amerykah Part One isn't a bad album but it isn't a classic like everyone says it is -- in fact, it's her least accessible album, so B.I.F.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B001P5HI4A|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A movie in which a 40-year old woman plays an 18-year old boy and a musical in which all the songs sound the same, Yentl succeeds in depicting the world of fin-de-siecle Poland and features a winning performance by Mandy Patinkin, but is less accomplished in its love story; if you really like all things Jewish the movie might appeal to you, but otherwise pass on Yentl.    2.5/4
B001GQACGO|3.0|No one disputes Beyonc&eacute;'s vocal ability; however, in the past she had yet to impress me with a truly stellar album, no matter how much they bumped in the clubs. But it looks like she's finally on the right track with I Am...Sasha Fierce.<br /><br />This is yet another of those albums that was rereleased about three different times, so the version I have has more songs on it than the original. This is also another one of those situations where the artist performs half of the album as herself and the other half as her alter ego (in this case, Sasha Fierce) but the two personalities don't sound any different from each other. At any rate, the first few singles \\"If I Were a Boy\\", \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and \\"Halo\\" rank among the album's best moments (but with \\"If I Were a Boy\\", since when do men actually stick up for each other, B?).<br /><br />But unlike the case with [[ASIN:B000H0MKGA B'Day]], there are other notables as well, including \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Satellites\\". And this version of the album has five extra tracks, which are all pretty decent (\\"Ego\\", although looking extremely corny on paper, is my favorite); the thing is, though, B could have used these tracks in the first place and left some of the other ones off, namely the four-in-a-row of \\"Radio\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"Diva\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" (yeah, I like the video but not the song).<br /><br />It's a little surprising not to find husband Jay-Z on this album at all. Anyway, even with the uptempo tracks, I Am...Sasha Fierce is Beyonc&eacute;'s most mature album, so pick it up if you haven't already.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B002VECMBI|4.0|Up in the Air is an excellent film. It's never dull, well-acted and satisfying in that certain way. You know the one. It goes something like this:<br /><br />\\"Gawd, I'm just so glad to finally see a film that's actually intelligent and doesn't make me cringe. \\"<br /><br />It's kind of sad we have to set the bar for a good film so pathetically low. Intelligence shouldn't be rare like diamonds in the movie theater. But it is.<br /><br />If there's anything wrong with the film, it's just too pat. Too safe. The plot twists are predictable, the ending one of many potentialities the reasonably smart movie-goer will at least fleetingly consider long before the credits roll. And because of that I can't call this movie great with a capital G. It's merely very good.<br /><br />And given how rare \\"merely very good\\" happens to be these days, I'll take it whenever I can get it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's CD, \\"I Dreamed A Dream,\\" is without doubt the best vocal production I have heard in quite some time. Susan gifts the listener with twelve of her favorite and well-chosen songs - all performed with talent, heart and soul. What makes Susan's voice so enchanting? The answer is simple - beauty of sound, beauty of words, and beauty of interpretation. Susan's ability to phrase is absolutely stunning.  The range of her voice is always clear as a bell as she moves easily from soprano to contralto - and never, not even in the twinkling of an eye, is she ever off key.  The voice is absolutely one of the most magnificent I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.  It is apparent to the listener that Susan's music is an expression of her life - her love - her losses - and her dreams.  Of \\"Amazing Grace\\" she writes in the program notes, \\"About revelations. About finding your way. Everything was new to me.  I was scared. Hope it's better. I know it can be with your continued support which I find both touching and humbling.\\" Your audience hopes so too for we are all cheering for you. Not only is Susan's vocal production of the finest quality but also the accompaniment.  The pianist is magnificent.  We can only hope that Susan's first CD is  not her last. How fortunate we are that she finally decided to share her voice with the world and to remind us all that it is never too late to pursue your dreams.
B002L6NYBS|3.0|This was recommended to me by an acquaitance from England, where apparently this is quite big, so I gave it a try.<br /><br />This is about the adventures of a group of girls at a VERY unconventional school as seen through the eyes of a newcomer as they struggle to fight off not only foreclosure by the local bank.  But instead of holding bake sales and other normal fund-raising activities, they decide to steal the famous painting \\"Girl With Pearl Earring\\" from the National Gallery and then sell it on the black market--like I said, this is a VERY unconventional school.<br /><br />This film certainly shows off a different side of England than what people expect and for the most part it's good fun; my only real problem with it is that the girls suffer no real setbacks in their efforts, no \\"raising of the stakes\\", as it were.  But like I said, it's all good fun.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Who wasn't captured by Susan Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent this year?  If you weren't - of course you won't like this CD - otherwise this is a keeper.  Included is the obligatory \\"Silent Night\\" to capture Christmas sales; but overall, it's an album beautifully produced and you come away with a belief that the chosen cuts capture her love of church music and the Broadway tunes she does so well.  I wish there were more demanding songs here but it leaves you wanting more, which is what it's all about.  Absolutely captivating renditions of Madonna's hit (sorry can't remember the title right now - surviving on her own), Wild Horses, and Cry Me A River.  Her success is well deserved.
B000RF7XYO|4.0|Elizabeth, the bastard daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, is a Protestant, and considered an enemy of the Catholic Queen Mary. As more Protestants start an uprising against the Catholic throne, Mary brings Elizabeth before her to be tried and sentenced for treason as a heretic. Instead, Mary is unable to condemn her half sister to death, and tells her that she is dying of a tumor and when she dies Elizabeth will become queen. At the age of 25 Elizabeth becomes queen of England and must deal with affairs, death threats, attempted murder, and plots from within her own administration to become the Virgin Queen who brought England back to prosperity and prominence.    In 1998, Cate Blanchett was an unknown having only appeared in bit parts here and there, but was more well known on the stage. After considering Nicole Kidman, and turning down Meryl Streep (one of only three roles she has ever been turned down for), Shekhar Kapur, an acclaimed Indian filmmaker making his English language debut, saw a trailer with Cate Blanchett and knew that he found the perfect Queen Elizabeth. And this was a daunting task. Queen Elizabeth is a well revered monarch, and not much is known about the early years of her reign. Piecing together what we know of Elizabeth's life and her reign, Michael Hirst crafted a screenplay that shows how Elizabeth became the queen, and woman, she would become. The question is, how well does it work.    Elizabeth is possibly the most beautiful period piece I have ever seen. The cinematography is amazing, the sets and costumes are absolutely breathtaking, and Shekhar Kapur has an eye for bringing out the most in all of it. Shekhar Kapur also brings a more worldly view of the world as well, not just looking at this as the tale of British nobility, but looking at it as a story for the world of coming of age, politics, and religion mixing with politics and the dangers there in. Hirst's characters are well crafted and lived in, which typically is a problemfor most period pieces dealing with real subjects. All too often characterizations suffer in these cases because there are so many people who helped make old mold your central character, but Hirst handles these issues deftly to craft great characters and you either empathize with or despise.    The acting pedigree in this movie is stellar, and the ensemble cast of course makes the best of a great script. The real standout for me was Joseph Fiennes, currently the main character in Flashforward but also known for being in the other great period piece of 1998 Shakespeare in Love. Joseph Fiennes plays his character, Robert Dudley, with love, anger, malice, and sadness. He imbues him with such likability that, even at his worst, you feel every tick of emotion within the character, and Joseph Fiennes wrings ever bit of emotion from the character to the last drop without ever feeling as though he's going over the top. Naturally, though, when you're dealing with a cast that includes Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean), Christopher Eccleston (Dr. Who), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator), Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), Sir Richard Attenborough (Jurassic Park, and a phenomenal director in his own right see Ghandi), and so on saying one actor is a standout is like picking the best lawyer out of a group of Ivy League grads who all graduated at the top of their class.    The one problem that I have to say that I have with this film is that the side plot dealing with Eccleston's Duke of Norfolk and the Vatican seemed slightly undercooked. It just didn't seem as though it was given the attention it needed, and in turn the Duke of Norfolk wasn't given enough to due. He's still fleshed out, but it feels as though your made to believe that he's the sole leader in a plot but I never really completely got the feeling that he was as in control as you were made to believe. Of course, when the real focus of the film is the coming of age of Queen Elizabeth I, this is almost an afterthought, and the plot still shows you how this led to Queen Elizabeth becoming the monarch she became.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes period pieces, history, and fans of the actors and actresses mentioned above. Personally, I think this is the best work from most of those mentioned above, including Cate Blanchett, which is saying a lot.    4.5/5
031606792X|1.0|I read each Twilight book in one day. I just stayed up all night reading breaking dawn. I have never been so angry at myself for wasting my time. What a crock. This is one of the worst things I have ever read. I feel like Meyer lost her way. I loved the first two. Third was ok, but this was terrible. Meyer didn't even know her own characters in the end it seems. The only character of any value in this book is, as others have said, Leah Clearwater. I think it is because she is a newly developed character. It seems Meyer cannot stretch her characters out over 4 books without losing sight of them. This book disgusted me for many reasons. For one, she made it quite gory and really, really creepy. Besides that, everything just works for everyone of course... It should have been a little harder, except for Jacob - it should have been so much better for him.    Eww.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I will not go into any details about the movie because there are already so many done by people that obviously have a writing talent far superior to my own poor scribblings... My reason for writing this review is to ask those who have not watched this GEM of a movie to disregard any negative opinions expressed here and just form their own after seen the movie in its entirety. My wife and I have stopped going to movies because we are tired of being disturbed by Cel phones going off despite the many warnings to turn them off and of people been noisy and walking in and out of the theater in the midle of the show (we live in FLorida and these problems are particularly seen here). We just wait and we enjoy movies at our home theater. Still every once in a while we \\"sacrifice\\" ourselves and try an ealry showing of a particularly interesting (to us) movie at our local theater.     Somehow we missed this one at the theaters and we found out about it when we saw the ads in Walmart (of all places) that it was \\"soon\\" coming to DVD and Blue ray. For some reason we both got intigued by the ad, sensing that this was an exceptional movie. We finally got it today and we were both astounded by all aspects of it. Cinematography, acting, effects and most of all STORY are first rate. The violence that so many \\"nay sayers\\" have a problem with was absolutely necessary for the story line. If you have problem with it then respect the \\"R\\" rating and avoid watching it. Please do NOT watch this movie with your own preconcieved ideas about what a \\"good\\" sci-fi movie should be because it is like going into a gourmet restaurant and rating it low because it did not have McDonalds Burgers... I read various negative reviews here in Amazon and in all honesty NOT ONE of them really gave me a valid reason for the low rating. Most of them came from people that walk into a movie and already know what they want to see (more or less like \\"Snakes on Plane\\") or from people that just HAVE to say something negative about a movie that a lot of them did not even watch in whole. Or others that did not even \\"get\\" the movie at all and gave it poor ratings when they gave 5 stars to movies like GI Joe or Transformers. By the way, I DID like BOTH Transformer movies but I got exactly what I expected: Great Effects and a POP Corn movie. Nothing wrong with this but every now and then (actually MOST often than not) I prefer watching movies that surprise me with their story, cinematographic approach and message. This movie has all of these elements in spades. The movie \\"had\\" in the first coupe of minutes it started. I immediately \\"knew\\" that this was a special movie and a real treat and I was not dissapointed.    My wife is NOT a fun of as she calls them \\"war\\" and overly violent movies but she was captivated by this one. She rates it as one of the best movies she ever saw...and so do I. Up there with Alien, The Fly and Blade Runner for me!     Again, if you are a movie fan, please do yourself a favor and watch this one.

0671449028|5.0|My little guy loves this book at bedtime.  He is twelve months now and it remains one of his favorites along with moo ba la la la and Not the hippopotamus.   It gets him perfectly wound down for bed after his bath and it has that certain clever humor Ms Boynton always creates for our little ones.  We just bought it for a little friend's one year old birthday and they are falling in love with it also.  It is perfect for any baby book collections. Highly recommended.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I stumbled across this book when I first got my Kindle.  I immediately downloaded and read it.  In fact, it was so good that I stalked the sequel, checking nearly every day until they made it available as an ebook.    THE GOOD:  -Katniss is a strong likeable character.  She is unique and fierce with a depth of character I have rarely seen.  -All of the other character are just as good and distinct.   -The plot and relationships are completely unpredictable, and kept me turning pages--the most into a book I have been since the Inheritance Trilogy (Eragon).  -The next book in the series was not anticlimactic like so many are--built on and deepened the plot.    THE BAD:  -The Capitol is a bit one-dimensional.  Why do they oppress the people?  Just because they like the power, or are corrupt, or honestly think they are doing the right thing?  This is never explained, and we just see the Capitol as the indistinct \\"bad guy\\".  Of course, more detail could show up in the third book.    CONCLUSION:  The book is an amazing read, one I have read three times in the last eight months, and that I intend to read again right before the third book comes out.  I would recommend it to anyone, no matter the age group or genre preference.    *CONTENT*  Sexual:  There is some romance, but no real sexual content--nothing past kissing.  In this area, it is appropriate to any age group that can read.  Violence:  By its very nature there is violence and killing.  It is not overly descriptive--any more than necessary, and it acknowledges the wrongness of killing.  I tend to have trouble with gory or scary books, but this one did not bother me.  I would recommend it to teens and up.  Language:  There is no profanity that I can think of.

B002VECM6I|5.0|\\"The Blind Side\\" is the inspirational true story of Michael Oher, a black Memphis street kid without a family who is taken in and adopted by a wealthy Caucasian suburban family headed by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw. The boy becomes a high school football powerhouse and goes on to become heavily recruited college football prospect.<br /><br />That's the simply-put plot of the film. But what that doesn't say is how much this film displays love, compassion, caring, tenderness, survival, and toughness. Not only from the family's dominating matriarch, Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock in her best ever performance, but from Quinton Aaron playing Michael, who may seem to be a naive innocent, but who also develops into someone who is resilient enough to flower and thrive under the love and care of the Tuohy family.<br /><br />Great cameos by the actual coaches who recruited Oher enhance the film, as does good natured humor and a fairly balanced approach of perspective from both the family and Michael. But more than anything, this film says a lot about love and how that bridges every difference that human beings can have.

B001OQCV60|5.0|\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is an obvious attempt at a franchise for literature's most popular detective, who was earlier portrayed in films by Basil Rathbone and on television by Jeremy Brett. Both of these previous portrayals were more or less faithful to the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's original, albeit it someone adapted in Rathbone's case since his Holmes fought Nazis.<br /><br />The 2009 version, directed by popular British comic crime caper director Guy Ritchie, is definitely an updated version. Robery Downey Jr's Holmes is like the classic character in that he is a disturbed, tortured genius who is a loner except for his constant companion Dr. John Watson. He differs from the archtype by being more of a bon vivant loner. His Holmes is someone who fits easier into society when he wants to fit in, where the old Holmes will standout regardless of what he tries to do. Moreover, traditionally, Dr. Watson is a doddering, deferential sidekick whose chief attributes are his knowledge of medicine, his trusty revolver, and by being the chronicler of Holmes' cases. But Jude Law's Watson is strong and intelligent in his own right, does not suffer Holmes' eccentricities lightly, and is more than able to handle himself in a fight.<br /><br />The plot, which includes a plot by a noble to take over the world, involves Holmes' female foil Irene Adler (played by Rachel McAdams) and a Freemasons-like secret society is entertaining, but the biggest mystery is whether Ritchie et al pull this adaptation off, and they do with a charm and panache that begs for more adventures. I look forward to seeing what other adventures this new Holmes/Watson have under their Victorian sleeves.

B001OQCV60|4.0|The Hollywood film critics gave this movie a C ,calling it top heavy and spastic. But these are the same individuals who lied and said ,Burn after reading was a stellar film. So now,if the critic say it's sucks, I usually enjoy it.  .  Robert Downey  jr. hams it up - He totally nails Sherlock Holmes.His version of Sherlock is also a boxer. I love when he gave boxing analogies. They were very interesting.    I wouldn't take kids under 8 to see this.I don't think they would enjoy themselves.Sherlock goes go to a slaughter house and there is a very long scene where they slice pigs in half and all their guts are showing.Also,the bad guys practice black magic, and these scenes may scare younger children.  The cinematography is beautiful. Rachel Mcadams and Kelly Reilly clothes are a direct contract to bleak ,smokey london. The color of their dresses remind me of tulips pushing up through the snow.
0316044938|3.0|The Lovely Bones is the story of a teenaged girl that looks after her family--from Heaven. That is the only spoiler I can give because it would be impossible to write a review without that piece of information. Susie Salmon is a typical 13 year-old girl growing up in suburban Pennsylvania in the early 1970's. Her life is tragically cut short and the remainder of the novel is Susie's thoughts and feelings about no longer being a part of her family in body, but in spirit. We journey with Susie as she witnesses her family's despair when she is missing; to their heartache and grief when it is obvious that she will never come home; to their falling apart in the months after her death. She is present to witness everything that is said, thought and felt---she follows her family, her friends, and her murderer.<br /><br />Alice Sebold is on to something fascinating in this story, but I don't think it ever really takes flight. I found myself putting this book down often and not picking it up again for weeks. I can't put my finger on it but it left me somewhat dissatisfied. It seems that Sebold had a really great idea for a story but didn't really know what to do with it. Often she would start an interesting idea and then get carried away with a discriptive passage. This happened so often that I found myself skipping ahead to pick up the thread once more. I wanted Susie and her family to find closure, as well as her friends, but the events just didn't flow as smoothly as they could have. The most gripping part of the book comes when Susie watches her sister try to uncover the mystery behind her disappearance and how she puts her life in peril to find evidence.<br /><br />I think the book got muddy because Sebold couldn't decide if she was writing a story about a murdered girl and catching the killer, or if she wanted to write about life after death and those dwelling in it. The main plot often got lost in details and didn't really have a clear purpose. It is unfortunate because Sebold was on to something very engaging if only she could have thought it through better.n to something very engaging if only she could have thought it through better.
0385339089|4.0|favorite quotes  Mr. Teal's Secretary - What is your injury  Mark - I uh, don't have an injury  Secretary - Look kid, see these people? They've all got appointments to see Mr. Teal. He's a busy man, and only takes cases involving death or injuries. Go bother someone else.  Mark - Sure. If I get hit by a truck or something ,I'll come back to see you.    Half of this book is a sad commentary on the legal system and the other half is the story of 11 year old,Mark and his 50 something year old Lawyer, Regina Love. Both have been given a raw deal in life, but somehow have survived by being incredibly sarcastic.   All of the characters besides Mark and Reggie are very broadly drawn (they are either really good or really bad)But I can assure you, this thick story is never a bore.  If you like well plotted thrillers where places like New Orleans and Memphis play a major role in the story, give this a whirl. You might like it.

B001CD6FKI|4.0|left their sense of humor home when they saw this film theatrically . granted , i had the good fortune to get this picture new for $2.00 . it was a door buster at the largest retail box store on black friday . i had very low expectations of this film . i disliked the ANIME ? cartoon it was based on from my youth . that toon had really gotten under my skin and turned me off at a very young age . big time . i only knew that the WACHOWSKI BROTHERS had directed . so , for a couple bucks i rolled the bones . when the case reminded me it was a PG film i felt pretty skeptical . of the trio of pictures i saw yesterday (the other two being \\"16 BLOCKS\\" and \\"THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTER BOYS\\") this was the one i wanted to throw my weight behind . for me , the performances , clever script , vivid color pallet , clothing styles , choreographed fights , cinematography and international cast were a real treat . as a matter of opinion i feel if this film had an R rating and was called \\"SIN CITY\\" it would have been heavily lauded for the same reason critics and ordinary folks have spent a fair amount of time deriding it . just one person's take . i like it a lot . the most spectacularly colorful film i've ever seen (in every sense of the words) . leaps off the screen and directly into your happy heart . check it out .

B0000046ZJ|5.0|This recording is more than just a rendering of some jazz standards and a couple of Stan Getz originals. The four players on this team are all classic artists, and all of them obviously were having a good day in the studio on October 10, 1957. Getz was at his smooth and lyrical best. Oscar Peterson on piano and Herb Ellis on guitar prove their skill and taste both on solos and on accompaniment. Ray Brown is on bass, solid as always. No drums, but you won't miss them. The performance is so good, you'll probably also overlook the fact that it was recorded in mono.<br />The selections will give you some tracks for your romantic evening playlist, plus some blues and some things that jump. There's an hour of music here, and all the tracks are keepers for those who love small group jazz from this era. Nat Hentoff's original 1957 liner notes are included.
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|\\"This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is NOT a love story.\\"  So says the narrator right from the outset.  With this line I knew I was about to see something a little bit different.  It's the story of Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a hopeless romantic who falls for Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), a cynic who doesn't believe in true love.    Going into this, I had read the reviews and most being positive I thought Okay this is going to be one of those rare smart well made Rom-Coms.  When I heard the above quote I rethought my stance a bit but still expected the typical boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back and all live happily ever after.  (500) Days of Summer not only doesn't stick to this formula, it plants it with a C-4 charge and destroys it.  I don't want to include any spoilers, but right from the start the movie turns you on your ear and you literally spend the entire film flip flopping from the elation that comes from falling in and being in love to the feeling of just misery for those weeks and weeks after being dumped by this person you literally thought was THE ONE.  This movie portrays that better than any film I've ever seen.  Another thing it does outstandingly well is to display how love blinds you.  It achieves this by replaying scenes that were previously shown and it is amazing the things you notice the second time around.  Probably my favorite scene is one that almost everyone can relate too.  The scene that juxtaposes beautifully Tom's expectations and reality.  It is the scene where essentially all hope is lost and Tom's heart is broken seemingly beyond repair.  I'm confident in saying that if that scene doesn't strike a chord with you then you've never lost at love.      The comedy is ably supplied by Tom's friends McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) and Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler).  Although one of the funniest \\"themes\\" in the film is how Tom goes to his approx 12-13 year old sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) forrelationship advice and actually gets more sound advice from her than from anyone else.  In fact it is her advice that actually saves him in the end from a lifetime of lonliness and wondering what he could have done differently.    Overall (500) Days of Summer is nearly pitch perfect, and will have you reaching the highest of highs and almost hitting the lowest of lows but not quite.  It is a rare romantic comedy that is told from the male perspective without being crass.  It shows how men can be and often are hurt.  Even if we try not to show it.  If you are a fan of typical rom-coms this may not be for you, but I'll say this.  I am no fan of rom-coms and I loved this movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Wow!  Jodi Picoult has a way with words and time!  She tells the story of 2 teens wrapped so tightly in each other's life beautifully!  It was hard to put this book down as I read because I really felt as if there was a connection between the characters and myself!  It is a heavy read for the emotions but well worth every tear shed!
0131177052|5.0|It should be no secret that the majority of commercial software development effort consists of dealing with other people's poorly constructed code, yet this book is one of only a handful of sources that offer any practical advice for such undertakings, and the closest thing to a comprehensive reference on the subject so far as I know.    Here you'll find dozens of useful techniques organized according to the kind of problem that they address, each explained concisely with concrete examples.  Lots of them are things that I've had success with in the past, and of the ones I haven't tried yet, there's nothing in my 19 years of industry experience that leads me to doubt that they work.    A word of caution, though: It understates both the difficulty and the importance of having everyone who works on the same code to buy into the ideas it puts forth.  Negligent programmers will resist change because they tend to benefit from \\"adverse selection\\" (look it up on Wikipedia), and you really don't want to be the only one worrying about code coverage and maintainability while everyone else creates messes for you to clean up.  Appealing to engineering wisdom and common interest is not always so easy as it sounds.    But on the whole, this is fine advice, and every programmer should own a copy.  Not only will it help you to better the quality of your life by improving the state of your most troublesome projects, but also it will teach you to minimize the problems that you create in the first place, as well as how to fix those problems before they become too costly.
B002MW50KO|5.0|I love it.  Okay, he is no Bing Crosby.  What this is, is a fun trip down memory lane with our \\"old friend\\" Bob Dylan and a lot of great orchestration and back up singers.    It takes my mind off of the worries of the day and takes me to memories of Christmas and folkies and 60's....    Each tune is unique.  This CD will continue to entertain us for years to come.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|If you can handle subtitles (or if you speak French fluently) this is one of the funniest movies ever made.  It's a great French farce ... which only the French can do.  Let's face, \\"The Tall Blonde Man with One Black Shoe\\" was extemely funny, while the American version (\\"The Man with One Red Shoe\\") was moderately humorous.  Americans can't make French farces.    But \\"The Dinner Game\\" just keeps building.  It's very slow at first but, it's hold your sides because they hurt from laughing by the end.    Remember though, it is subtitled.

1933771690|1.0|\\"Biocentrism\\" by Lanza with Berman was a supreme disappointment.  I really wanted to learn something new but found myself constantly frustrated as the author spent more time skipping down memory lane and dropping names than supporting his thesis.  Perhaps it was the fact the book is written in first person but whether anecdotes about Barbara, her husband, Bubbles or the near death of Dennis I was not reading science.  As memoir it could have been fairly interesting if a finer hand had performed some much needed editing.<br /><br />While the rest of the world has been engaging in this type of \\"exploration\\" since the invention of LSD its adherents don't use the term \\"biocentrism\\" when making the same claims, they use New Age phrases and play chimes.  And I'm not sure whether I was more offended by the recycling of ideas I had encountered in class work at the University of Colorado in the 70's and in multitudes of previously published titles over the last half a century or by the constant repetition of the message as \\"proof\\" instead of being offered any original work done by the author.  Lanza seems to both acknowledge that his ideas are not new and then insists that they represent not just a new and radical departure but a necessary consideration when solving the biggest questions cosmology asks.  Such cognitive dissonance is constant in this waste of time and money.  Citing pages and pages of decades old experiments he seems to imply that the greatest thinkers of our time were wrong or misguided and abracadabra we've arrived at our next \\"principle\\" of biocentrism.<br /><br />I was initially intrigued as to how this biologist had come to his understanding of consciousness as the prime mover of creation when the study of consciousness seems almost as impossible as the ability to bite your own teeth.  Not only is the claim basically made that the authors were going to demonstrate how it was the chicken who created the egg but there were no details presented as to how the chicken accomplished this task.<br /><br />The prime insight I came away with was the only thing Dr. Lanza did well was to prove he is a legend in his own mind.<br /><br />Now I know it's exciting for those wanting to make a buck off anything quantum to come up with a theory as to how we humans can use the principles to construct our own reality but that really is the telling part.  Since quantum physics tells us that we can never know anything for certain, only its probability, just how is that able to construct squat?  Anyone makes such ridiculous claims knows nothing about quantum physics.<br /><br />So there are those who will still love the mystery of quantum spookiness and will make that work for them and there are others, doing serious research that cannot.  The most recent study is demonstrating that quantum weirdness does not exist in reality, it exist only in your mind.  Once adopting the more thorough and fact based qbist reality the paradoxes of quantum mechanics vanish.  Therefore biocentrism is a mirage constructed by an ego for the selling of books and is not demonstrable in any laboratory or reality.<br /><br />For the proof research QBIST.  Can't put the link here unfortunately.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|What a major disappointment, this has to be the most boring book I've read in 2009. Was the book meant to be a movie script? Dan Brown keeps perpetuating the same old story.  If you've read his previous books, you already know the plot of \\"The Lost Symbol\\". Don't waste your time!

076532413X|4.0|I watched the television series maybe twice. While I was able to tell the series would be the typical drawn-out, never-ending type of thing peppered with obscure clues,  red herrings, and constantly recycled footage, I thought the novel might be somewhat different.    My guess was correct. I was rewarded with a tight, quick tale that worked just fine. In fact, I appreciated that it was a short tale and that it could be consumed in an afternoon. The usual SF fare these days consists of a never-ending story, wrapped into a three-volume (or more) series, and embedded in the jargon of a marketing niche like \\"military alternate history science fiction\\" or \\"techno-babble cyber-punk SF.\\" So, just getting a story that had a beginning, a middle, and an end was as refreshing as a clean sea breeze and almost non-existent in current science fiction publishing.    While I cannot recommend the television series that takes its name--but little else--from this book, I can recommend the book itself.

B001V9LRTM|5.0|Thank you Amazon for the easy processing and fast shipment of my Ultimate Collector's Edition WOODSTOCK order. My wife and I have really enjoyed our purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase it. PLEASE be aware though, if the DVD you are purchasing says Blu-ray Disc it will not play on a standard DVD Disk Player or Computer. When I purchased this item I did not know this and was in the process of returning it to Amazon. I decided not to return it and purchased a Blu-ray Disk Player, I made a good choice.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Having been a Beatle fanatic from the very beginning, I have purchased every release and re-release that has become available. The Beatles Mono Box Set is by far the best representation of their music. The sound quality is outstanding and mono presents their recordings the way they were intended. Most of the early Beatle recordings you get in stereo are really just simulated and are not true stereo. Only Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be are true stereo, which is why they are not included in the Mono Box Set. If you want to experience the true Beatle experience, the Mono Box Set is the way to go.

B001DXS4E2|3.0|This comes with 3 discs (1 B&W DVD, 1 color DVD, 1 music CD).  A wonderful movie in the 40's, unfortunately the movie is racist in any scene with the black maid & her kids and beware of the musical number performed in \\"black face\\" - I guess it seemed funny in the 40's.  George Clooney must have forgotten about this movie during his oscar acceptance speech.  I think the movie is a good reminder of how people thought of blacks, including hollywood, before the civil-rights movement. Overall it is an good movie, I would just be careful showing it to children who may not be able interpret the racist scenes as a sad part of history.

B002WV5A9G|2.0|This movie did not deserve the praises it received.  I would give it 2.5 stars because I watched it in IMAX Dome and that was amazing in itself - the IMAX theatre that is, not the content of the movie.<br /><br />How to explain the movie's content? It doesn't exist. It's inexplicable.  For example, the \\"plot\\" involves something called \\"red matter\\". Never heard about it before? No wonder.  It's just stupidity that doesn't fit Star Trek.  The movie is complete dreck and it's a shame because it could have been really awesome.<br /><br />In many ways the film is a complete rip off of Star Wars.  There's actually a Death Star, no kidding.  And there's the complete remake of a Hoth and Young Luke Scene with a monster.  No kidding.  I didn't want to watch this movie, but for $5 in a dome IMAX I went for it.  If you can watch it in a dome IMAX do it, but ignore the plot. The music is nice too.  But for example there is a ridicilous fighting scene with Sulu with the worst music ever in film history.  It was just too strange.  The movie is a total mess from all angles - directing, shooting, and acting too.  Over the top ludicrous acting by \\"Kirk\\" and Spock is definitely not a Vulcan anymore, not even a half vulcan.  He's more like Riker.<br /><br />Don't watch.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I can't find a way to get Wal-mart to respond to my complaint. So I thought I might post this comment here.They don't want to take back my DVD copy as the movie plays fine. It just happens to be the wrong product in the slip cover that I purchased. There was no way to know both discs were not in the packaging until I opened it. I am highly ticked off because I spent over $20 for a product I don't have and Wal-mart won't do anything about it.
067942850X|4.0|While the movie was inspiring and the soundtrack superb, they portrayed a romanticized version of events. This made for a great movie that moved me and had me thinking for some time. Reading the book (usually I read the book first see the movie second though not this time around)  you get an insight of what made Chris/Alex tick. Well researched and written you get to know what Chris and other adventurers like him were made of and what may have drawn them to take the actions they did. A great read.

B001GCUO16|4.0|When I first heard that Hugh Jackman was going to play Wolverine in the X-Men movie, I said, \\"Who?\\"    But, wow, he does a great job.  My favorite part of the first X-men was, as Jesse \\"The Body\\" Ventura would say, the lumberjack cage match between Wolverine and all comers. (Wolverine was always my favorite X'er) I really looked forward to seeing the Wolverine Origins movie after seeing the preview.  And I wasn't disappointed.    Huge and Liev make a great pair of brothers.  I guess they were destined to play relatives (see Kate & Leopold).  People think that Logan is dark.  Liev makes him look like Little Miss Sunshine.    I don't plan to purchase too many Blu-Ray movies.  Only the ones that are worth it.  And this definitely qualifies (as does Iron Man and Planet Earth).    Great cast and great special effects.  It was much better than Cats.  I'll watch it again and again.
B001GCUNW6|3.0|Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, comes to us as the third installment of the Ice Age animated saga. While it did entertain and hold my interest, it was by no means any kind of blockbuster, breakthrough animated feature. Good but not great. Let's hope this genre does not get drawn out into the interminable sequels, a la, Land Before Time. It's cute, but let's not ride it into the ground. Recommended for animated feature lovers; for kids of all ages and for an enjoyable evening away from the grit of Terminator or the busy frames of Transformers.

B000SKNIWE|2.0|Buyer beware! The series was spectacular on high def TV, so I purchased what I thought would be a true high def package - it turned out to be 1080i, not 1080p and that left me wanting. My projector system simply highlighted the fuzziness of the images and disappointed the family greatly. It needs a warning that it does NOT have the full resolution implied. I did find the right resolution for many of these scenes in the new Disney 'Earth' version in real 1080p, but it does not have the full content or the great narration of the original series.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I had more fun playing this game than I had playing any other game in many years. This game also teaches the importance trade among people, while at the same time being a very fun board game. The only draw back is you must have 3 to 4 players unless you get an expansion pack to use for a total of 5 or 6 players. Of course if you have 6 players and two sets of games you could play as two separate groups.

B000VBIGD6|4.0|Like the \\"Home Alone\\" series this movie has a lot of funny physical comedy in it (though no doubt the scene of the electrocution of a pet cat is NOT one of those instances!)  It is though one of the new 'classics' of holiday viewing, and other than that one scene, is lots of fun.

B000AGTPUK|3.0|The story of 'believing' in Santa just got lost in the repeated 'roller-coaster' action not-so-special effects of this movie.  As many reviewers have mentioned, over and over, as will I (LOL) the animation makes the children 'look' like they've risen from the dead.  The North Pole workshops look like some sort of dark, severe, lonely factories where one could easily get lost... and that no elf would even want to work in for 364 days a year... but then again the elves might have well been robots, by the way they looked acted.... no personality!  I'm sorry but Tom Hanks makes one LOUSY Santa!
044654146X|5.0|If you are related to the fields of entrepreneurship, development, innovation, or macro-economics I really recommend you to read the book \\"Israel: The Start-up Nation\\". The authors claim they have come up with the idea of writing this book, when in a Harvard Business School study-trip to Israel in the beginning of the millennium, they asked themselves how is that this tiny country, wedged among states with which it is unable to conduct trade (due to boycott of the Arab League), and with just over seven million people (and that has to support a defense budget that eats up to 8% of GDP, which is 4 times more the OECD average), attracts more capital from VCs that all of Europe combined... can create more tech-ventures than anywhere else in the world except for California, patents more IP in a month than Portugal or Greece (developed countries with more than 10 million people) throughout its entire economic history, has several Nobel prizes in its faculties and has the largest concentration of companies on the NASDAQ after the U.S.<br /><br />I will just give you a hint, that is to forget the theory of American special friendship, because the inter-state institutional friendship plays a very limited part of the game - further, other European countries receive far much more money that Israel receives in economic aid to development from the U.S. and are unable to play on the same field.<br /><br />It is an enjoyable read, that helps to debunk some myths about economic development - investing in a national pride project (in the Israeli case, the survival of the state) is more important, that investing in pure infra-structure (like highspeed trains and the likes) that end up having low to null return, specially when compared to the creation of wealthy market oriented tech economy.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I originally saw this at the theater and enjoyed it so much I had to buy a copy of the DVD when it was released. I am a big fan of the original Star Trek TV series and movies but did not ever care for the spin-offs. This new take on the original characters was fun. The movie had all the great inside jokes for the trekkers but also was enjoyable for the new fans. My daughter and I sat and watched the movie together and she enjoyed it as much as I even though she has seen only a few of episodes of the original series.  The only thing I wish was different is that on the single disc edition you do not get the deleted scenes. I knew this when I bought it and thought it would not matter, but if you watch the movie with commentary several references are made to the deleted scenes which made me curious to see them.  A fun movie for old and new fans!

B001UHOWXI|5.0|I purchased a colorized version, VHS cassette many years ago, and I found some defective areas in the video.  I wasn't very happy with the product, but that was the only thing available back then.  But now, I found the new two disk set, color and b/w, for those who like the original version.  After viewing the color version, I was overwhelmed with the superior quality and vibrant color and sharpness.  You won't go wrong with this wonderful classic, and it's at an affordable and unbeatable price.  Thank you, Amazon, this one is a real winner.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book is the best! I literally couldn't put it down! Alice Seabold is marvelous!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Check out the other reviews and you'll soon see why so many people love it. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD. Yea, the DVD is not of studio-quality, but if you look into why it wasn't produced by a studio, you'll get a little bit more out of the picture.     Quite simply, this movie is an awesome fun time filled with laughter, catchy songs, and loveable characters.
B001GCUO52|2.0|Most of us agree that this was not the best of the Final Destination movies..It was a re hash of the same plot & Just some more blood & guts splashed over your face. this Blu Ray disc contains both the 2D & 3D versions with 2 pairs of the cheap quality glasses (wonder when we will get superior quality glasses with the superior quality Blu Ray movies??..Hopefully 'Avatar' 3D Bluray will bring that)   This disc contains several deleted scenes & you will be thankfull they were deleted. & also the usual alternate endings. Digital copy of the movie, BD Live & an Exclusive first look at the new 'Nightmare on elm street' movie that is scheduled to hit screens around April 2010.  However on the plus side the picture & sound quality are good. So if you enjoy watching Blood & Body parts being thrown at you..this one is for you!!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This movie was great - I'm a kid at heart and these movies make my day.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|To give this one star for the fact that is not historically accurate is completely stupid and inane. This was not intended to be a historical picture of WWII. If you want that flip to the history channel and indulge to your hearts content. I enjoyed this film greatly, I love his personal style of film making. Yeah it's not for everyone but oh well. This film was well put together, thought out and written. The acting was enjoyable to see and well directed. AND above all IT'S JUST A FILM. I think there may be a fair few people who take movies to a slightly more serious level and forget that in the end it's just a film and we are no better or worse for having watched it. If your on the fence rent it on Netflix or at your local video store. I just don't think one can judge a movie based on how everyone else sees that film. It's better to see it yourself and then decide. And yes that opinion goes for my very own review. I just felt a need to address the fact some people seem to have taken this movie as an insult to the war and the human tragedy that was the result of it.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is a romantic comedy that's a must see for everyone.  After viewing this when it first came out - the DVD was a must on my Christmas list.  I'm a huge fan of Sandra Bullock and as in all her other movies - she nails it.  Ryan Reynolds was also great - they both did an excellent job on their roles.
B000002L9J|2.0|Based on the humor value of this album's title I was sure I'd find more to enjoy. But, I have a problem with Morrissey. I like when his songs begin, but by mid point I'm just agitated. I can't take the F***ing whining. I can't tolerate whining in conversation and apparently less so in song.<br /><br />It's actually disturbing to witness someone suffering so badly, and then even more so to have people celebrating his pain so enthusiastically. Because that's what you are doing when you express admiration for Morrissey. You're not actually complimenting his creativity as much as you are commiserating with a fellow sufferer. Me being such a huge Billy Holiday fan, you might say I'm hypocritical, but Lady Day wasn't whining. She was confessing and testifying and crying. Those are very, very different things. She wasn't so self obsessed that she expected people to be enthralled with the minutia of her distress. She had genuine real problems, unlike the narcissistic fay. Being gay isn't Morrissey's problem, being so unhappy about it is. Maybe that's harsh, but his petty, tedious complaints are meant to be annoying. He has said so himself. He doesn't want to be \\"masculine\\" so he exaggerates his \\"feminine\\" emotional side. It's a forced, unnatural posture. It made him distinctive and somewhat original, but it's distinctly grating. And that's what people are responding and relating to, his overly dramatic self interest. Billy at least was able to put herself in other people shoes and experience life from other perspectives. Check out her stuff, you will understand. Also, Axle Rose has a whiny voice, but he's not whining. He's braying and wailing like a banshee.<br /><br />I suppose the short answer to the question of why Morrissey and the Smiths are so popular is that misery loves company. It's so sad for me to realize that so much of this shared pain is so unnecessary. I'm guessing much of his pain was a chemical imbalance. If they had the amazing medications back then that we do today I'm sure many of Moz's dilemmas would've just evaporated. Not all, of course. He still would have been a talented, intelligent, sensitive artist, but just not swirling in a vortex of his own miasma.<br /><br />2/11/11 OK, in the 1+ year since I first wrote the above comment a few people have bothered to leave responses to my comment that express their deep disgust and outrage at my inexcusable ignorance of Morrisey's and The Smiths' spectacular, superior genius talent. I feel reluctant to do this, but I have to come forward, so to speak (who's speaking? I'm typing), and clear up the ridiculous confusion. What most, if not all, of the people who've read my comment didn't get is that I was trying to be ironic. Actually I was being sarcastic, like so much of Morrisey's best stuff. I like the Smiths, I like the music and I like the feeling it creates. I've listened to them almost since their very beginning, way back when. I was in art school in the mid-late 80s and The Smiths were constantly being played by someone; constantly. So what I don't like, what I really can't stand are the smug, self centered, dim witted, slow minded, hostile hypocrites that worship this music as if it's miraculous emanations from a magical, sacred place, performed by angelic prophets. These same \\"fans\\" perceive the slightest dissent as a mortal threat, and they angrily lash out. Touchy, touchy... It's very clever music that is very comforting for those horrible, hopefully occasional, times when you've been crushed by life. This music is a lot like great old Blues tunes in that way, or a nice fuzzy baby blanket. So anyone reading this now, and here after, know that your precious Moz has not been assaulted by me, has not had his Honor compromised, and does not need you to defend him. I was just yanking some people's chains. Though I feel there's probably no good point in shaking a hornets nest, I couldn't resist. Go about your business, carry on...sure many of Moz's dilemmas would've just evaporated. Not all, of course.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I guess at the begining of it, it wasn't the most interesting but once you finished the first parts.... WOW that is all I have to say. This book is a really good romance, you all at least have to say that. I picked up this book and I couldn't put it down. (Figuratively of course) I can not wait for the next book to come out. (Unless it already did but I can not find it.)  :)

Ive read the book like 7 times already or something like that. Its just exciteing, fun, jaw dropping accounts of amazing races and stories, great charaters, and one to learn from. hope you dicide to get this book (auido is best!) you'll really enjoy it.
B00008BRB5|4.0|'Synchronicity' continues the trends of 'Ghost In The Machine', both good and bad. It is more lyrically and musically ambitious than its predecessor, with an even greater emphasis on the psycho-philosophical ideas that Sting favoured at the time. This makes a more varied but less consistent listen than other Police albums, as not everything the band tries comes off. Some of Sting's lyrics are beginning to drift into that clumsy pretentiousness that plagued some of his solo work. And even more so than on 'Ghost..', Copeland and Summers are quite marginalised; the more polished, synth-heavy production leaves them less equal contributors to the band than Sting's backup group.    I've heard of albums being front-loaded, but 'Synchronicity' is one of the few I've seen that seems back-loaded. A couple of tracks in the first half are pretty weak, while the most memorable songs appear late in the album.    'Synchronicity 1': quite a big departure for the opening track, a breathless synth/sequencer driven song that clearly establishes the lyrical themes of the album.    'Walking In Your Footsteps' : African-tinged song containing some great guitar effects designed to mimic the prehistoric environment. Nice musical departure that is unfortunately let down by some clumsy lyrics.    `O My God': this jazz/reggae tune is probably the closest to the old-school Police sound on the album. Pleasant enough.    `Mother': if you leave the room quietly, we'll pretend you don't exist and nobody will get hurt. This screamfest sounds like it was included purely as the token Andy Summers track. Doesn't sound like The Police, doesn't fit the theme of the album, doesn't deserve to be here.    `Miss Gradenko': this Copeland-penned song could have been so much more. Strong Caribbean feel and a catchy chorus, but seems a bit under-developed.     `Synchronicity 2': driving, forceful rocker, and one of the album's highlights. As the title suggests, this is another song dealing with the album's signature theme, with repeated references to connected events happening \\"many miles away\\".     `Every Breath You Take': a pop masterpiece that proves sometimes it's best to keep things simple. This catchy but disturbing ballad was an obvious single and deserved hit.    `King Of Pain': this synth/guitar driven track is another song to reference the album's theme, contrasting the cruelty of nature with the cruelty toward humans. Good guitar work and nice solo by Summers.    `Wrapped Around Your Finger': strong reggae-influenced track driven by syncopated beats and dreamy synth washes. Lyrically borders on pretentiousness, but Summers and Copeland help keep the song grounded.    `Tea In The Sahara': the original closer is a subdued, poignant African-tinged track. Had been a perfect conclusion to the album.     `Murder By Numbers': this was a B-side that was tacked on to the CD edition. Not a bad song, but `Tea In The Sahara' was a better closer.     No question that `Synchronicity' is a very strong album, but the reality is that parts of it have a closer resemblance to Sting's solo work than other albums by The Police. It's easy to see why The Police became superstars on the back of this album. But it is also easy to see why they had to break up.

B0013FXWU6|2.0|This movie did not appeal to me.  It is a overly long epic on a greedy, crazy, deceptive man, Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis).  The movie is based on the 1927 Sinclair novel Oil!  It begins in 1902 showing Plainview as a mineral and silver prospector in the Southwest.  The first 30 minutes drag on as there is little dialogue. After one of his workers dies in an accident, Plainview adopts the man's orphaned son.  We find out later the mother also died in childbirth.  He names the boy H.W. (Dillon Freasier) and uses him to establish himself as a family man and set a good image.<br /><br />Several years later, 1911, Plainview meets Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) who comes to his office with a proposal.  He knows of an oil deposit under his family's property in Little Boston, California and will let Plainview in on the secret for $500.  Plainview agrees travels out with H.W. asking to camp and quail hunt with his son.  After dinner with the Sunday family one evening he asks to buy the land at $3,700, which he feels is a good deal.  Paul's twin brother Eli (also played by Paul Dano) understands Plainview's deceptive offer and holds out for $10,000.  He wants part of his father's money to found a church.  Finally Plainview agrees and oil producton on the Sunday land begins.<br /><br />Eli asks Plainview to bless the oil well at the dedication.  Plainview, for some reason feels this is a power-play, and grabs Mary Sunday (a family member who does not like to pray) and dedicates the well holding her hand.<br /><br />Soon an on-site accident kills a worker, deafens his adopted son, and also catches the rig on fire.  You wonder if Eli should have blessed the well.<br /><br />Later a visitor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to Plainview's home saying he is his half brother and needs work.  Plainview takes him in, and H.W. discovers flaws in his story an attempts to kill him by setting his bed alight.  Plainview is upset at his boy's behavior and sends him to a school in northern California.<br /><br />The movie then goes into deals and offers with Union and Standard oil, a murder, deals and insults from Eli.  Later, in 1927, H.W. (Russell Harvards) finishes school and marries his childhood sweetheartr Mary Sunday (Colleen Foy).  His father, Daniel Plainview lives in a mansion alone.  He is obsessed with business and alcohol.  H.W. (through a sign language interpreter) to let him establish his own business.  This means disolving their partnership.  Plainview makes fun of his son's deafness and tells him of his origins and that he was adopted.<br /><br />Later, Eli visits Plainview, now head of a larger church and a religious radio show.  He needs money and goes to Plainview.  The odd ending shows that Plainview wants Eli to confess he is a false profit and God is a superstition. Eli finally does so after much humiliation.  The setting is the mansions bowling alley.  More anger and dialogue about land and oil ensue between Eli and Plainview, then Plainview uses an oversized straw to drink Eli's milkshake from across the room.  Then an angry Plainview chases Eli around the room with a bowling pin beating  him to death with it.  The only servant in the house comes down to see what is going on.  Plainview says \\"I'm finished\\" and the film ends.<br /><br />So the film bores, shows the worst of capitalism, greed and deception, and the ending is bizarre.  Daniel Day Lewis does a fine acting job, but the insane greedy character was not worth watching despite all the awards he and the movie received.a.

B001JJBO74|5.0|EXCELLENT book, biting wit, right-to-the-point 1-liners. True, not a complete list, possibly somewhat biased (read the review mentioning Beyond Paradise by Estee Lauder), but there is no substitute for it out there... Read Turin's and Sanchez' words as a rough guide to inform your neocortex, but filter as much as you can (or care, or should I say wear?) through your own ofactory experience. You should only wear what you like, not what any one guru says is worth its while (but be mindful that others need to stand it also).     His star ratings are a good guide for what's what: hyped dross (*), flat/boring blah (**), good/wearable (***), excellent/exquisite (****), unique/the ultimate (***** MIND YOU: not necessarily wearable).     For those among you who are unsure/confused/need help/etc: most of the stuff you might want to wear is marked *** or ****. Tread lightly among the ***** rated, always test your \\"candidate fragrance\\" on a paper strip AND your own skin before plunking down serious money. Go to Neiman Marcus' or Saks' or Nordstrom's fragrance counters and ask for a few spritzed strips. Let them dry, then seal them inside (separate!) ziploc bags before putting them in your pocket, then walk away. Sniff \\"them\\" strips half-a-day or a day later, to see if you want to test them on your skin. Then go back. It's worth the trouble, 'cause it's gonna save you from making some very expensive mistakes...    Yes, the listing is incomplete, Turin's views are it's highly idiosyncratic and sometimes \\"wrong\\" (as his co-author TS says somewhere in the book), but always pithy  and witty with a dry sarcastic edge, thus highly entertaining. (What better concisely worded characterization for Equipage by Hermès than scent of a \\"crumpled gentleman farmer\\"? And so on, and on, and on... I'm not sure, though, why he flames Santos by Cartier, though. It's just as subtle and close-to-skin in its dry-down as Equipage... Well, I quess he's totally not free from fads, his own words sy it:\\"...in a style that has aged badly... If you like this stuff, get Yatagan.\\" Well, I do wear Yatagan, and it smells quite differently from Santos!)    For the ofactorily impaired or those whose sensibilities are (rather childishly) offended: you can read the lists of top-middle-bottom notes for 90+% of the existing perfumes on the [...] site for example (or on many of the Internet sites that sell perfumes). You can also read the various perfume blogs ad nauseam, often written by self-appointed \\"scent gurus\\" (is \\"gurette\\" the feminine for \\"teacher\\" in Hindi?). At most, you will get only a vague idea on how the various perfumes smell and very likely become REALLY CONFUSED, if you spend enough (actually: too much) time reading those reviews. There is no better telling about the esthetic experience elicited by the various perfumes than Turin's brief descriptions. Sample some perfumes that you're not familiar with, then read Turin's description, to get your own book-to-sensory-experience mapping (or key on how to decipher his critiques). Mind you, practicing (synthetic) chemists use their shnozolas as their first-line rough-and-ready alarm system as well as analytical tool, so Turin really knows what he is talking about. That said, \\"de gustibus et colorem non est disputandum\\" and that which you like might not necessarily have his blessing or be to his liking, but that's OK. After all, you use a perfume for causing you, and hopefully those around you, pleasure.  Which also means: beware of loud, \\"foghorn\\" scents, out of deference for other people's personal space, if for nothing else. If you don't like someone to step on your toes, why should someone else enjoy having their nose \\"stepped on\\" by your fragrance?       If you are interested in what's popular, go to [...] for a bunch of user reviews. Although, mind you, this is a self-selected set and therefore biased sample, but if you rather have a popular vote (vox populis) than an informed professional opinion, that's as close as you can get, since the \\"silent majority\\" is just that, silent on the subject. (But not necessarily fragrance/stench free!)
B00005JKDR|5.0|Another Pixar gem!  The movie is smart and easy to watch for both kids and adults.  The monsters are perfectly animated with each hair flowing seamlessly on the blue monster \\"Sulley\\" (John Goodman). Sulley is a whimsical work of art to watch.  He has a buddy and job partner, \\"Mike\\" (Billy Crystal) who is a round green guy, with one eye and much smaller than Sully.  He talks all the time, but means well.  They both work for Monsters, Inc., a large company that specializes in children's screams they capture in a bottle.  This is bottled energy that monster land needs to keep lights on and refrigerators running.<br /><br />Monster's Inc. has an assembly line of doors from all over the world.  Once set up in a large room all the monsters enter and they emerge from a child's closet.  A frightening scream from the child is extracted and then the monsters go back through the door and another one is set up.  Kids begin to get used to the monsters and are not scaring as easily.  There is a energy shortage in Monster Land.<br /><br />Then one day, a little girl, Boo (Mary Gibbs) grabs Sully who she thinks is a big \\"Kitty\\".  He brings her into the factory by mistake.  Wow - the monsters are scared stiff of children and an exciting adventure ensues.  One discovery is that children's laughter gives more energy than their screams.<br /><br />We have to have a bad guy so Monster's Inc. plot includes a villain that looks like a purple lizard.  He can disappear and reappear and he has a evil plan for extracting screams.<br /><br />The ending is happy and you are glad you watched such an endearing tale.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I was turned on to Glass by co-workers who were into \\"trance\\" music.  I am now a fan!
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Rythm and blues hasn't exactly been mt favorite kind of music to listen to nor to buy it but Alicia Keys has something that always catches my attention. Maybe is the way she is as a person, maybe is her integrity as a singer or just the beauty of her awesome voice. Whatever the reason is I know that when she releases a new album I'm so willing to listen to it.<br /><br />\\"The element of freedom\\" is an album that showed me many surprises from her. It's great the way she plays with the elements of pop to let the songs be more \\"pop-like\\". \\"Love is blind\\" is by far one of her best songs ever (really deep and well-structured). \\"Doesn't mean anything\\" and \\"Try sleeping with a broken heart\\" are two of my favorite tracks on the record. Something in particular that I liked about the songs were the synths elements in them. Pretty nice ones. On the other hand, these two other songs \\"That's how strong my love is\\" and \\"Distance and time\\" are just beautiful. Everything about them is just great that makes them sound so perfect.<br /><br />I would say that the rest of the album is just as good as anything she has done before and if she had tried to experiment s little bit more with the pop elements that she showed on the songs I mentioned, she would've realesed her greatest and biggest album.<br /><br />Thumbs uo to Alicia Keys and her awesome talent. I just hope that she never changes because many of her mates are out there selling more than music: image and sensuality. But not Keys, I still see in her that she bets for her talent alone.

I loved how I fell in love with the characters and felt like I was reading about love stories and friendships of real people. When I turned the last page, I wanted it all to be true.

I really wasn't interested in reading them when it first came out but then my daughter read the first one and told me to try and read it too. I did and I was hooked, the story sucked me in and now I can't get enough of them. Try reading them and I know you will love them too.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I saw Avatar in 3D Presentation and I think it is the new step in creating the marvels of entertainment and pure spectacles. It is worth every dollar that has been spent on its amazing effects and visuals. It is a very good action/adventure/sci-fi/thriller anti-war futuristic movie but watching it in 3D is something I will never forget. James Cameron IS the King of the World, the world of great cinema that is. What imagination he's got and the possibility to bring the images born by his vision to big screen in the incredible artistic manner. 12 years in makings, 300 or 400 millions spent, perhaps thousands of the first class specialists in their fields creating the breathtaking world of the planet Pandora and her inhabitants, her flora and fauna.  163 minutes long, AVATAR is an event in moviemaking. It's got many important messages, too, regarding the wars, nature and connection of all living creatures, but first of all it is breakthrough in creating visuals in the modern film.  I think many people all over the world will accept and admire it. Even if they won't love the story which is anything but new and relies heavily on the ideas that have been presented before in the films like Matrix, New World, Dances with the Wolves, Last Samurai, Star Wars, and many more and they find the characters not very deep and their dialogs often clich&eacute;d, there is still a lot to admire in the new film by James Cameron, the visionary who has given us Aliens, Terminator and T2, True Lies, and yes, Titanic. When you go to see Avatar and I think you should, please make it 3D watching - you will be pulled inside the film to the magic world created by James Cameron during 12 years since his last feature film.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|The story is that much as director James Cameron obsessed on this project for the last several years, he also insisted that composer James Horner work on no other score while he composed music for \\"Avatar\\" hoping that the stars would align like they did with a previous collaboration.  Whether success will crown this film and its score remains to be seen.  Horner's score for \\"Avatar\\" is clearly a musical success that works well on the screen and on a soundtrack recording that runs almost an hour and twenty minutes (longer than some films entire).  Much of Cameron's film seems intended to evoke natural awe and wonder and amazingly much of Horner's music does just that.  Together, film and music make for some incredible scenes.  Much as I enjoyed the film and music in the theater, I found the score was often overwhelmed by the action.  I was pleasantly surprised to find how nicely the music played on its own.  Basing a good deal of his score on many variations of a sound central theme (including the vocal by Leona Lewis that is quite good), Horner is given a grand visual stage to augment with his music and he does not disappoint from his action cues to his lovely homage to Pandora and its people.  Like the film this score is sprawling, but it has wonderful and at times powerful moments.  Fine production values and adequately packaged by Fox/Atlantic

B0017U7PT6|2.0|I just saw this film for the first time, as I am generally a fan of Emmerich's films (I liked Independence Day and loved 2012). The PQ and AQ on the Blu-Ray were stellar-close to a 5/5 for me. However the story was so preposterous and the pace so irritating that the film had few redeeming qualities aside from this. Though I am not a history scholar, I was a little unnerved by the total confusion along the timeline. I don't know if Emmerich intended to explain history on his own terms, but why horses and Mammoths and Sabertooth Tigers existed at the same time, as \\"regular-looking\\" horses was a bit strange. I was also a little put off by the smidgeons of humor interjected (the lead character speaking to the Tiger in the pit?). There were numerous stellar shots that panned over the Egyptian pyramid scenes, and several sweeping shots over the journey of the combined tribes but the story had so many holes in it, I felt like I was watching a parody/ Not recommended. If you wish to see this, rent it first.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book- rarely does an author speak to me- and Elizabeth Gilbert did, on so many levels. It was easy to read, it flowed well, and made me want to travel in the worst way- I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little adventure, and learn a little about humanity in general.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is a special album because it reflects the thoughts and personality of Susan Boyle without a lot of professional hype. She has a beautiful voice and I especially loved her comments about each selection. It was very nice to have songs about God in with the others. A nice balance.
B000S8SXL2|5.0|I speak mostly Spanish, and purchased this version of the movie expecting a Spanish option(Movie is under the title \\"La vida es Bella\\"). It has Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and English languages. And they all have great sound. I just got what I wanted.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I got both Teminator Salvation and District 9 on Blu-ray for Christmas. I watched District 9 first I couldn't even make it through half way the new Terminator afterwards.     District 9 had a such a great story. Wikus van der Merwe was such a great character very flawed but makes you think how would you react to the situation he was in. The interactions between prawns and humans done very well.     I'm not one for writing long reviews so if you like Sci-fi that's more than just a special effects showcase, see District 9.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|While \\"Love, Pain, and the Whole Crazy Thing\\" was darker, this album is so fun and light! Listeners can hear Urban's passion in every song, every note, every harmony, and every instrument. I loved \\"Love, Pain, and the Whole Crazy Thing,\\" mostly because you can hear the struggle, the truth behind every song for Urban himself. The lyrics reflect his life and listeners' own lives. \\"Defying Gravity\\" - the very title says it all! Urban has everything going for him right now, and the album reflects that. There are fun songs, romantic songs, and the beautiful \\"Till Summer Comes Around\\" (\\"Hand in hand we cried and laughed, knowing that love belonged to us, girl, if only for a moment\\"). Every guitar lick screams emotion. I love that about Urban. You can feel what he is saying. This latest album is completely different from \\"Love, Pain, and the Whole Crazy Thing,\\" but it is a good different. I look forward to the next one.
B002T921DE|5.0|I will say, right off, that I am a huge fan of GM. Having said that though- I think it's completely unbiased to say that this was a phenomenal concert. I never had the chance to see GM in concert when I was a teenager and Faith was THE ONLY music that mattered, but I got to see George on this 25 Tour in Atlanta, GA. This was as George was just starting to get sick and while he may not have felt his best, he sounded perfect. I don't say that lightly but I say it honestly; George was just beyond imagination that night. His energy, his pitch, his entire show- just brilliant. He filmed this concert less than two weeks later and you can hear that he sounds a little under the weather. Even with that being an issue- there's no way to rate this a 4 star. I've seen the concert 5 or 6 times since I bought it and I love it each time. It's a time machine that moves me right back to the night I saw him in concert- only much closer. If you're a fan of the man and the music, I can't think of a song that you'd want to hear that isn't in this concert. Maybe \\"Waiting for that Day\\" or \\"Cowboys and Angels\\", but there would be a problem fitting it into a wonderfully arranged set. Heck- Fantasy was in here!     The one thing I will say- the \\"I'd Know Him A Mile Off\\" was a bit more of a \\"guy with a camera/behind the scenes\\" type extra and NOT a typical documentary. Sorry David, but you know what it was and what it wasn't.    The last issue that I'd add is the sound. It's not perfect. I've discovered that the entire production sounds better in Stereo than in Surround Sound. Odd, but it helps to fill up the video better than the Surround Sound that somehow sounded 'flat'. It's not a big issue once I found a way around it- but as great as the picture is (especially in Blu vs. DVD), I wish the sound was just as stellar.    Don't hesitate to buy this on Blu Ray. If you only have DVD- get it. It's such an amazing concert and the ONLY official one we've got. This is a remarkable talent and thistour showed why George is one of this generation's most amazing talents- not to be missed by anyone who made it through the 80's and 90's. Buy It- you'll love it!
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I keep losing this movie... So and I keep buying it. This is a testament to how AWESOME this movie is
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Awesome movie! Beautiful MPEG-4 AVC video transfer packed with a lot of special features! the audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1    Recommend it!
B000QGAU4E|1.0|Can't recommend this film.  Dark, damp, dingy, chaotic, and we don't even have much of a hero or heroine.  If you are in a black mood, this movie will complement it.  Not much to say about the actors, since all they did was duck, hide, and push on through the madness.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|I'll start out by saying that I love The Terminator franchise, concepts, and basically the universe of ideas that Cameron spawned within his mind a long time ago.  However, I must say that there were only two things that stopped this review from getting one star rather than two.  One being that Christian Bale was in this movie, as he is one of my favorite actors, however is performance here was lacking.  The second would be the special effects which were very well done.  The rest of the movie though basically sucks, as did T3.  The rest of the cast sucks, even B.D. Howard, and they give a third rate performance.  And the plot?  Don't get me started.  Where is the continuity here?  Fox's \\"The Sarah Connors Chronicles\\" keeps continuity more in line, stemming from T2.  T3 sucked so bad that it doesn't even count.  Thank God for special effects and Bale, or this film could have been T3 part two.  We can always think...what could have been.  Peace and Love,  Jake
B0028RXXE8|5.0|First let me say this has got to be one of the best shows ever made, if not the best! I owned Seasons one and two and sold them to buy this thinking there was three seasons. Wrong! This is just what I had before though they do toss in a few extras, though nothing I would call a must have. I never watch extras on DVD s but for this I made a exception after purchasing just to justify it. There is nothing wrong with this collection though the ending sucks, because well... it's really not a ending. It leaves you wanting to know what happens. I don't want to spoil the plot or anything for those who never seen it, but there needs to add a few more episodes to really end it right. Of course, if it were up to me I would carry on the series. Hey, they did it with La Femme Nakita; maybe we can get HBO to do it with this. Well, one can dream. If you don't own the first two seasons, grab it, you will love it. On the other hand if you do then there is no need to sell them to buy this set like I did. The extra content, though nice, just is not worth it.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|I bought this movie for it's amazing underwater sequences and the location!! Not much of a plot but that's ok...it's not as good as \\"the deep\\" but comes pretty close. Cinematography is superb...acting is average.
B0000844I8|5.0|A wonderful start to a great franchise. I love this movie, and when I purchased the 10 complete series of Stargate SG-1 I had to buy this to kick it off. For under $7 it is a great price for a great film, and will help complete your collection of Stargate material, if you do not own it already.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|I bought the Blu-Ray, 4 disc set as a Christmas gift including the premium for overnight shipping to assure it would arrive before Christmas Day. We all sit down with much anticipation to watch the Blu-Ray version of the movie and although everything else on the disc plays the movie will not play! After several attempts we figure it might be firmware so we port the movie to our other BD Player (different brand) and the Blu-Ray version of the movie will not play! In addition, as a test we tried to play the Blu-Ray \\"Special Features\\" disc and it will not play. I'm not wasting any more time on this defective product to determine if the digital copy will play on the computer. Enough troubleshooting and problem resolution for what should be a simple plug and play function!! Of course the Standard Definition disc plays just fine......DUH!!    As many other Amazon Customers have written in their reviews this is a great movie, but very poorly executed BR discs. I too as others have stated will make this my last Disney and Pixar product purchase. Their executive management team can take their bottom line and, well you know the rest. If Disney likes kids as much as they profess they wouldn't be putting out defective products that disappoint these same kids they purport to serve so well. Disney, quit worrying about DRM, mission statements, peeling your onions back, drilling down, getting traction and all the other corporate hogwash because from the view at 30K feet your poorly executed products are costing you customers.
B002XHN776|4.0|This is War was a notch down from 30SM previous album for me. However that being said I still found that I enjoyed this album. People may criticize Jared Leto but I think they have no right to do so here. It is a solid creation and I hope for more in the future from these guys.
B002VECLVE|5.0|I was not sure-- in spite of all the pre-release positive publicity-- that fashion designer Tom Ford in his directing debut would make a decent movie adaptation of one of my favorite novels. I was wrong. \\"A Single Man\\" from Christopher Isherwood's novel by the same name for the most part succeeds on every level. Colin Firth as George Falconer,  a transplanted Britisher and teacher of English in a lackluster college, gives a really fine performance and is totally believable as someone riddled with grief over the death of his lover Jim (Matthew Goode) several months ago in an automobile accident. Julianne Moore who plays George's friend Charlotte deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress. She is slouching towards middle-age and trying to hold her life together. If only she and George could have had a lasting relationship as lovers rather than friends. (Even though the events take place in one day in Los Angeles in 1962, unfortunately some straight women still think this way.) Finally Nicholas Hoult more than holds his own with Firth and Moore as Kenny, the student who is onto his closeted professor-- it is 1962 after all-- and prettier than a lad has a right to be. It is easy to see why George would be sexually attracted to him.<br /><br />Much of the action takes place in close settings so I understand the use of extreme closeups. The film would have been just as successful, however, if some of the closeups had been edited out. I'm not sure we need to see the pores of George's skin, for example, though that is a minor criticism of the film.<br /><br />The costumes and furnishings are vintage 60's and perfect even to those ugly lamps in George's home-- something we would expect from the likes of Mr. Ford. Two of my favorite scenes are George and Charlotte's dinner and drinking evening that gets dangerously close to a George and Martha event (\\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\\") and George and Kenny's sexually charged skinnydipping frolic that is both beautifully and tastefully filmed.<br /><br />In the end the film remains faithful to Isherwood's novel and captures the essence of the loneliness of life after the death of someone you loved dearly. Mr. Isherwood wrote the novel during a particularly rocky time in his relationship with his lover Don Bachardy and said that he wanted to capture what his life would be like without his lover.<br /><br />Lovers of the film should read the novel if they haven't already. It is even better than the movie.ully filmed.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Not going to lie, I am a Star Trek fan and I loved this movie. Great story plot, good acting in my opinion, great visuals. I recommend this to everyone, cause not only is it a great Star Trek movie it is just a great movie period.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this and show my support for this wonderful lady! Definitely a Cinderella story and love the collection of songs. Hope Miss Boyle will do more!
B0017MO10U|5.0|A good addition to the Stargate world. If you are a fan of the show I believe you will find this movie another good episode, if you have never liked Stargate then walk away now. this movie makes a great addition to my Stargate collection.
0316166685|5.0|When I saw the preview for the movie, I knew I wanted to read the book first. And I was definitely not disappointed. Sebold's storytelling avoids clich&eacute;s, making it unique, intriguing, and engrossing. It taps into some very deep human emotions and issues without being obvious about it. Instead, it brilliantly focuses on each of the characters and their motivations. Again, the lack of clich&eacute;s in this area was so refreshing and fascinating. The story did lose a little bit of steam and credibility for me towards the end when Susie is able to return to earth one last time. The writing did not take me there easily, which required me to go back and make sure I understood where the author was trying to say. And the end of the book seemed very sudden and didn't quite wrap everything up for me. But despite this drawback, the novel really took me to a different world that I greatly enjoyed. I would love to check out Sebold's other novels, and it will be interesting to see how much of the book's magic the movie can capture.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|A long dark film with deep story plot? Heath Ledger selling his soul to drugs to play the role of the Joker? A lot of money spent creating this film? A little dash of acting and story plot?     I enjoyed this film and it makes a great addition to my collection. If you are a Batman fan then this is probably a film for you. If you've never really been into Batman check it out anyways because I think you'll find that you like this film as well.
0156027321|1.0|I had to read this book a couple years ago in school.  It was horribly dull and rather pointless.
B002KREVE2|5.0|Leonard Cohen never disappoints.  This combination of storytelling and musical performance gives insight into the character of Leonard Cohen.  He grabs your attention from the start and never lets go.  His rendition of 'Tonight Will Be' fine is a classic and his 'singing yelling' of this song cannot be found elsewhere and proves to be highly entertaining. Wish I could have been there!
B002VPE1AM|2.0|Warning: This review may contain spoilers-- Classifying 'Avatar' as science fiction is a misnomer. If you take away the whole idea of the Avatar technology, you end up with a standard Hollywood action movie. And the technology is truly dispensable. For the year 2154, I'd rather have a genetically modified humanoid standing on his own two feet rather than an 'avatar'. Both ideas are far-fetched, but the idea of an avatar who is controlled through some kind of vague telepathic commands emanating from a human being deep asleep while in a coma seems much more the stuff of comic books than semi-plausible science fiction.<br /><br />  Without the Avatar 'gimmick', Cameron's story is nothing more than an allegory of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the 'white man'. Cameron harks back to the 17th century where the idea of the 'noble savage' was in vogue. So-called 'primitive' people were held up as 'natural' and 'spiritual', untarnished by the corrupting effects of western civilization. Also at play were deep-seated guilt feelings over the perceived deleterious effects of European colonialism.<br /><br />  In Cameron's tale, the 'colonialists' have been updated to military contractors who have somehow bought the 'heart and soul' of the American military itself (we're told that the adventurers on 'Pandora' are ex-Marines, all there for the money). The contractors are headed by two stock villains: Parker Selfridge (the civilian corporate chief) and Colonel Quaritch (an amalgam of the worst right-wing military types you could ever think of). Cameron makes no effort in humanizing his two antagonists. On the other hand, the indigenous people, the 'Na'vi' can do no wrong. Not only have they mastered their skills in surviving in the wild but have tapped into the mystical forces of the forest which put our own holistic healers to shame.<br /><br />  While the Na'vi are certainly stand-in's for Native Americans, they are not Native Americans of the American West in the 19th century but rather more akin to earlier forest dwelling Indians as depicted in James Fenimore Cooper's \\"Last of the Mochicans\\" (is it a coincidence that one of the stars of the early 90s film version of that book is Wes Studi who plays 'Eytukan' here?) Cameron must bring in other cinematic influences to make sure that this is not simply a rehash of an early 18th century romantic novel. In the beginning, with images of space travelers coming out of suspended animation inside a spaceship, one is reminded of such iconic films as '2001: A Space Odyssey' and the sci-fi horror tale, 'Alien'. And what about all those futuristic helicopters that are constantly firing missiles at the hapless natives? I can only think of mediocre Vietnam-era war movies such as 'The Green Berets' starring John Wayne. Avatar is also derivative of Spielberg films such as \\"Jurassic Park\\" with its emphasis on prehistoric creatures who seem to have a continuous anger management problem.<br /><br />  As for Avatar's plot, it's all rather predictable stuff. The enlightened 'scientists' are pitted against the hard-boiled military, none of whom seem to have a conscience. The film's hero, Jake Sully, already is told that the bad guys are planning to wipe the Na'vi out but it takes him three months to warm up to them. I had a hard time believing that Sully would side so easily with the evil Colonel from the beginning--yes he was offered the 'carrot' of getting his legs back but as a paraplegic wouldn't that have made him wary of the Colonel's unrelenting disdain for the underdog? In other words, wasn't it obvious that the Colonel was a real bad guy from the very beginning? What's more, wouldn't Sully have tried to warn the Na'vi earlier instead of waiting to the last hour? He could have perhaps persuaded one or two Na'vi to form a reconnaissance team and to check out the base in order to convince them that the enemy had the capability to wipe them out. Also, at the end, why did the Na'vi let the defeatedenemy leave the planet? Wouldn't they have slaughtered all of them? (Oh I forgot--they're Noble Savages!).<br /><br />  Despite the derivative and mediocre story, Avatar keeps your interest due to its excellent special effects. Cameron is a master at computer animation and keeps you riveted on all the action despite insulting your intellect. Avatar is a sensory delight but seeing it more than once is not recommended.Wouldn't they have slaughtered all of them? (Oh I forgot--they're Noble Savages!).

B002QEXN2K|5.0|Firstly, John Mayer's newest album is excellent. It is a polished piece of production and engineering. Everything from the cover to track order seems well thought out. All of the songs are recorded very well at his new studio. That having been said, many will not like this album. Many JM fans have come to know him for two different things (and I'm generalizing)...acoustic Pop and soul-wrenching blues songs with tasty guitar licks and tone dripping out of every pore. This new album is a step to the side. It isn't either of those things. It is a new sound. A reinvention of the JM that fans know and love. All of the solos are short and tasteful. There are very few fills or showy bits of artistry here. The drums and bass are incredible, in the pocket, and just enough. He let's his songs breathe. He uses as much silence as sound to create his music here. As a college guitar student myself, the thing that intruiged me the most was his tone. He must have spent a lot of time with his amp collection and engineer to create the sounds that he used. Especially his fat, dirty, grungy sound on his reconstruction (deconstruction) of Crossroads.    Many critics, including the Rolling Stone, criticize this album because of JMs personal life. Try to keep an open mind and listen to the music as if you knew nothing about the person who wrote it. You may just find that it becomes an important part of your balanced musical diet.
B000024E9H|2.0|Each of the two times I ordered this from this very page, I did get an import, from Argentina, but they sound just like the 1994 remaster. It's probably only a reissue. For the NURSERY CRYME to which the first-seen review here refers, you may have to buy the box set where it's found. I couldn't find it anywhere on Amazon singly. It IS a vast improvement over every earlier pressing. But this item ain't that. Maybe it used to be. If you want the 2008, I'd select a smalltime seller and ask them the details. Don't be fooled if you hear it's a Virgin release. The cover date even says 1971, 1994, not 2008! The liner notes are also the exact same as the 94s.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's climb from anonymity to fame is remarkable but not nearly as astonishing as her lovely voice. Three cheers!
045122499X|2.0|I chose to read \\"World Without End\\" afterhearing so much about it and Follett. It could be that \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is a good book (I haven't read it), but WWE falls flat. I kept trying to stay with it, hoping I could get more interested, but after 700 or so pages I had to give up. Follett may have done his historical research, but the story and characters left me completely empty. Compared to the heavyweights of the \\"medieval\\" gerne like Umberto Eco and Bjarne Reuter, Follett just hasn't got what it takes. The story was so superficial that something monumental needed to happen to keep it alive - and it needed to happen WAY before the middle of the book.
B0026P3G12|5.0|The item I purchased arrived in a quick time and giid condition and would do business with seller again
0061537969|5.0|This book is such a treat.  The story is compelling and the way in which it is told is special.  Garth Stein is an amazing author and this book is one of those rare gems.  The dog is precious although the book is about much more than the dog.  It is a serious book with a number of light-hearted incidents.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|I was very surprised, the trailer does not do the film enough justice. It's hard to believe that anyone would not enjoy this. The HD DVD looked really good. It also included nice extra material such as a \\"making of\\"...
B000ATQYT2|3.0|Have owned the VHS version for years, and despite the somewhat negative reviews, decided to get the DVD version. Read the other more knowledgable reviewers who noted the cut of the sappy \\"When Love is Gone\\" song and lack of true widescreen format. Disney deserves a kick in the grundle for this! So, I'm giving this format a 3 stars, although I also think the movie is a 5 star.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This series of \\"new\\" James Bond films is extraordinary. I believe it was said that these films are as the author  depicted James bond. If so, these are an improvement over some of the older films.   I am almost ready to give up my James/Sean Connery for the new combination of Daniel Craig and the upgrade of these  storys. The action is spectacular; the acting of all, outstanding; locations beautiful; all very enthralling. What more could you ask for?
0786868724|5.0|I got this book for Christmas and finished in 2 days!  I couldn't put this book down.  I don't usually read books more than once but this one I will.
0553582038|5.0|This book was like a link between trains. It brought some story lines forward and left the reader ready for Book 5.  Nothing in the writing was missing---if you are a reader of G.R.R. Martin. He always fascinates with fully-drawn  characters and stuns us with the twists and turns of our favorite heros, male and female. Good ones are good, and  the bad ones are REALLY bad. Holding my breath.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This film is as good a western as the highly rated \\"Unforgiven\\". It has it all, from cast to storyline.   The cast fits so well together, I forgot the praised actors in the caracters they portrayed. Kudos to Ed Harris, for this entry to film history; Vigo for his \\"tightly held, close to the vest\\" western hero--so different from his other western caracter in \\"Hildalgo\\". And, Miss Renee, has no limits apparently in acting heights.
B001W79MB8|5.0|the story line is good, but the sword fithing its incredible a must have for anime fans.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this cd because I enjoyed hearing Susan Boyle's rendition of 'I Dreamed a Dream' from Les Miserables. I also found her story endearing. I was surprized at how eclectic the cd turned out to be. I anticipated mostly show tunes or even religious songs, but found her choices to be highly varied. Each song was sung beautifully and had a unique rendition. Included in the cd booklet was an explanation from the artist as to why she chose each song. I was happy with this purchase and would recommend it to those who have an ear for talented singers (regardless of whether or not you enjoy the broadway genre).
B0010X745K|5.0|I will not go into details about what this movie is about.  I will say that this movie being a new up to date movie is quite different than most other scary or thriller movies.  The plot along with the monsters is quite original and different than most other thrillers I've have seen in the past.  The special effects seem pretty real also.  Of course, being a Steven King movie helps give you the satisfaction of not being let down even before watching it.  If you want to be wowed and thrilled, but not quite scared, and enjoy a good story line, then watch it.  You won't be let down.  In my opinion, definitely alot better than most other scary or thrilling type movies where you pretty much already expect how they are going to be which is blood, guts and gore, plus a terrible story line.  Besides most movies nowadays are terrible remakes of original good old classics and are terribly bad, and they are also copying some other bad movie.  That is why most movies today are terrible and boring, but THE MIST stands above the rest with something different and original.  Most Steven King fans I think will not be dissappointed at all.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I've read some disparaging reviews of this album, so I was pleasantly surprised by its quality. Boyle has a wide range of delivery styles and the dreamy ballads don't really do it for me. But when she has the orchestra behind her, and really brings that powerful and rich voice to the front, the songs bring tears to my eyes.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek for a long time and remember the original series (which I still consider to be the best).  This movie helps answers many of the questions I've had about the original series, and characters in general.  It is very well done, and I think that all Star Trek fans will appreciate it.  I'm glad I purchased it on Blu-Ray as this is something I'll watch again and again.<br /><br />Easily the best Star Trek movie I've seen, and the best movie I've watched in a long time.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|I bought this so I would always have a card reader with me for my phone.  It lasted less than a month and ONE use.  I tried it in my pc when I first got it to make sure it worked and it did.  It's been dangling from my key chain ever since, because that's where it's meant to be kept.  I tried to use it this week and it can't be recognized on any pc I try it on.  It appears fine physically, but no pc I have access to at work or home can recognize it now.<br /><br />My advice?  Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I didn't know this until recently, but there was a weird situation with the making of this album. Let It Be is the band's final studio album to be released, but for the most part Abbey Road was the last to be written and recorded.  There were issues with the former's production and the members knew the group was falling apart, so they decided to do one last project as a band before splitting. It was finished and put out while Let It Be was sitting on the shelf, and I have to say it's a pretty nice note to go out on.    While it would be hard to match the eclectic nature of the thirty songs on the White Album, they do a good job of coming close here. It has the best work of George or Ringo, with \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" about tied in my mind with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" as the former's best Beatles song and \\"Octopus's Garden\\" being the only really good song that I'm aware of the latter writing. \\"Something\\" is another good George song, showing that he really was getting good at this. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" is one of Paul's odder ideas, an upbeat though ultimately not-that-catchy tune about a murderer, though it's followed by \\"Oh! Darling\\", which is a bit cheesy but also a hell of a lot better. John's contributions to the first side are really good as expected, with everyone knowing \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" being one of the band's most interesting songs to me, and a long way to come from things like \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\".    Of course the second side is most famous for the medley of unfinished songs turned into a long musical suite, though the couple tracks before it starts are nice too. I already mentioned \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", and \\"Because\\" has a nice eerie quality to it.  The medley does a lot of recalling, bringing back sounds and lyrics from earlier tracks and creating something that feels unique for the band. It has some of their better pure experimental instrumentation and some standout moments, even if I'm not quite sure it reaches the pinnacle of what it could have been. It ends majestically in what is fittingly called \\"The End\\", and then the album closes with a snippet of a ditty called \\"Her Majesty\\". As a recording by a world famous band that was coming apart at the seams, it's a remarkable achievement and a darn good album.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|...who can let thing go. What i mean by that is that its similar to the books, but there are so man little things that will make you mad in the first few episodes that you have to except that its different.     Still a great tv series that after a few episodes, you will enjoy your decision to watch them.

B001OQCV60|5.0|I like that in this movie Holmes and Watson follow up Holmes' rally cry of \\"The game's afoot\\" by quoting the rest of the passage from HENRY V, from which that phrase originated. Credit where credit's due, after all. Critics and others have been slamming this flick as being too revisionist and veering away too much from A. Conan Doyle's time-honored aesthetics concerning the Great Detective. To which I say, it ain't as bad as all that and it doesn't blaspheme as much as the naysayers would claim.<br /><br />I wasn't down with the trailer, no. My concern, that this Sherlock Holmes is way too robust and bare-chested and not engaged enough in cerebral work. The movie bore this out, and the dilemma for me then was to justify the slick action set pieces with my longstanding image of a staid drawing room puzzler featuring an arrogant Brit in a deerstalker cap, an Inverness cape, and puffing that meerschaum pipe. \\"And what's up with the martial arts and the bare-knuckle brawling?\\" complain the critics.<br /><br />Director Guy Ritchie decided to go with a more physical Sherlock Holmes, and my initial gut reaction was \\"What the ef?\\" And then I remembered that Holmes was in fact an amateur boxer (SIGN OF THE FOUR, \\"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott\\") and did dabble in the martial arts discipline of \\"Baritsu\\" (\\"The Adventure of the Empty House,\\" and it's actually called Bartitsu). One thing I really liked was how, even in combat, Holmes' mind keeps on working, calculating an array of debilitating blows and then flawlessly carrying them out. On the other hand, I don't recall Dr. Watson being such an eager two-fisted smiter of dudes, even if he was a war veteran. In fact, he sometimes charges into a melee ahead of Holmes.<br /><br />The year 1890, and England is on the brink of a modern technological age. And yet this is also an era in which many sought guidance from the spiritual world and the supernatural. Five ritualistic murders have been committed, and Scotland Yard has got its clueless thumb up its bum. Tying in to this, Sherlock Holmes's services are hired to find a missing girl, and his investigations lead him and Watson in time to thwart the killing of a sixth victim. The perpetrator is nabbed, the identity that of the satanist Lord Blackwood, snaggletoothed and unrepentant. Blackwood is tried, convicted, and sentenced to hang. Blackwood insists that \\"Death is only the beginning.\\" Not too long after, his tomb is found broken open, another corpse in place of his. \\"The game's afoot.\\" (followed, of course, by the rest of King Henry's speech.)<br /><br />I've read all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, as well as countless pastiches, and I'm saying that I really liked this movie. Guy Ritchie and his blokes seem to have made SHERLOCK HOLMES with an eye towards drawing in the younger, more action-oriented generation. And yet enough of the core elements are preserved to make the film relatable to me, and I'm fascinated by the changes wrought. This Watson, for instance, may not be as brilliant as the Watson in WITHOUT A CLUE (which, given, was more of a broad comedy-thriller) but here he's decisive, very competent and isn't at all subservient, more Holmes' equal than a befuddled sidekick. Watson is not without the smarts, although there's no mistaking the true brains of this partnership. Jude Law has to be the most physically imposing Dr. Watson ever onscreen.<br /><br />A strength of the film is Law's chemistry with Downey, Jr. Rumor is that these two got to be really good friends on the set, and something of that shows in the film. It's fun seeing them play off each other, their interactions often funny and their bickering exchanges reeking of many shared adventures. One cutesy plot device has Watson ostensibly working on his last case with Holmes, as the good doc is about to enter happy marriage with Mary Marston. He's in the midst of moving out of 221B Baker Street, and Holmes, a bit jealous, is doing what he can to sabotage Watson'sdeparture. I know, it all sounds a bit foofoo.<br /><br />I don't think anyone can touch Jeremy Brett as THE Sherlock Holmes actor. Certainly not in ferociousness. But Robert Downey, Jr. brings a fresh interpretation, a more earthy physicality to the role, and a slovenly twitchiness, while keeping the self-absorbed, remote demeanor. And the entire time, Downey embodies a sense of prodigious intelligence. It's not your conventional Sherlock Holmes, what Downey does, but I think it works. One quality that's de-emphasized is Holmes' so-called misogyny, although it's understandable once it's learned that Irene Adler, the only adversary to best the Great Detective, is heavily featured. As \\"the Woman,\\" Rachel McAdams comes off as the lightweight actor here, although she's beautiful as ever. But, to me, she just doesn't ooze that presence one associates with a formidable manipulator like Irene Adler. Still, she and Downey have some nice romantic moments (I know, I know - mentioning \\"romantic moments\\" and \\"Holmes\\" in the same sentence is almost heresy).<br /><br />Secret societies. A possibly dead dog. An absent ginger dwarf. A whiff of the paranormal. A plot against the British empire. A menacing villain who looks more like what Sherlock Holmes should look like, but who also looks like Andy Garcia. There's not as much attention paid to the observational sleuthing as I'd hoped, but there is that moment in which Holmes deduces off Mary Martston (to his later chagrin). The big explanation, when it comes at the end, is executed under flashy cuts and edits, and my reaction verged on the whatever.<br /><br />But I really like this movie, and it's mostly because of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. The plot itself is serviceable. I guess I'm enough of a Sherlock Holmes fan to appreciate new interpretations, but not so fiercely devoted to the old school that I'd get in a super snit if someone mucks about with the mythos, especially when I find myself allowing for the changes.

0385523904|5.0|I find myself fascinated by the lives of North Koreans: So completely different from ours in the first world. What is most fascinating is that they don't even know what they're missing, indoctrinated virtually from birth that the U.S. is evil and their Dear Leader is a god. This book is for people like me, that want to know more about what it's really like to live there, day by day. The book is full of little details like the very modest housing, the lack of heat in the wintertime everywhere, and how rations worked before they were cut off; to say nothing of the many ways to avoid starvation or watching what you say all the time for fear of being reported to the authorities for the North Korean equivalent of blasphemy.    The book follows six people through their lives in the DPRK in the 1990's, including the huge famine which occurred at that time; and, ultimately, their decisions to defect (a foregone conclusion since otherwise their stories would not be told). I found myself fascinated by them, especially how each figures out that their country's leadership has let them down. The author even managed to fit in a love story which, far from being hokey, is especially riveting due to the circumstances. The book is well-written and easy to read, the only mar being occasional repeated information which is easy to overlook.    I feel like I'm barely scratching the surface with this review. If reading this makes you want to know more, you won't be disappointed by the book.

0545123267|4.0|I expected a lot from this book.  I've read numerous reviews, most of which were raving.  I also saw (but didn't read for fear of ruining the book) several spoiler emails in a listserv I subscribe to.  The book really was good.  I liked it a lot and am definitely looking forward to the next book in the series.  The characters were interesting and I liked the plot.  The only thing that threw me occasionally was the chapters rotate between Grace and Sam and the narrator and sometimes I didn't pay attention to who was narrating and got momentarily confused.  I am definitely going to go back and read the spoiler threads now that I'm done with the book because I can't really think of anything major that would have spoiled a twist or anything in the story.  I want to know what people considered spoilers for the book.      If you like books about vampires or werewolves and forbidden love and everything that goes with being a teenager, definitely give this one a shot. It's not too complex and some things seem a little too convenient (Grace's parents never being home) but it was something fun to read and kept my interest.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|With all the Vampire stories out there, this TV series takes the cake! Dramatic, sexy, action, complex issues that reflect current affairs, and edge of your seat story lines that cliff hang better than any out there.

0385737947|5.0|If you liked The Hunger Games, you will probably like The Maze Runner.  While the beginning few pages are somewhat confusing, the rest of the book completely make up for it.  It's almost like watching the TV show Lost.  You keep getting tidbits of information but no explanation so you keep reading in hopes that you'll find out some answers.  It's gripping.    The basic plot is Thomas winds up in a place called the Glade and the only thing he remembers is his name.  The Glade is surrounded by huge walls and has four openings that lead out into a maze that shifts every night.  The Gladers have been trying to get through the maze so they can go home (where ever home is).  New boys have shown up once a month, every month.  That is, until Thomas' arrival.  That changes everything.  Suddenly a girl is sent and word is given that no more will be coming to the Glade.  Thomas knows he has to go out into the maze despite the danger.  He feels almost as if he remembers something about this place.  Could going into the maze trigger his memory?  Does he really want to remember?    This is a seriously good book - one of the best of 2009.  Go read it immediately.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was funny and very well written. The main character Emma annoyed me at times, until she finds herself.

B002RSDW80|2.0|I saw this film at the cinema with my mum and was shocked when a certain 4 letter word appeared during the film. However, the swearing (granted it was only said once) was the least of the problems with the film.<br /><br />The cook, Julia, appeared drunk throughout the entire film - it was funny for about the first thiry minutes, but then it was just annoying. Added to this was the whimpering and odd behaviour of Julie and the movie just became boring and tiresome.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned my last point, and I will too, there was too much focus on \\"let's have sex\\". The amount of references to sex in relation to the theme of the story was out of balance and unnecessary as it didn't add anything to the story.<br /><br />Give this one a miss and move on, it will only irritate you!
0743289692|5.0|A neighbor began sending me anti-Muslim emails (also casting aspersions on the U.S. president because of Islamic ties). He said they would not rest until they have killed every non-Muslim (whom they call \\"infidels\\").<br /><br />I called him prejudiced. He was offended, not only because of his pride, but because of his decades-long study of world religions.<br /><br />Like many \\"open-minded, tolerant people,\\" I said \\"You can't lump all Muslims in with the extremists.\\" He told me Islam is Islam and there is no milder version of it.<br /><br />I shared these conversations with a mutual friend who told me of her experience reading [[ASIN:0743289692 Infidel]]. I got it as soon as I could and read it in two days (it's a page-turner).<br /><br />Written by a woman with a degree in political science, in 2005 named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People, it is a \\"from the inside looking out\\" examination of Islam. One could compare Hirsi Ali to a young person who joined the Hitler Youth, and 15 years later condemned the Holocaust and renounced her ties with Naziism because of the Holocaust. Then the book carries a perspective of \\"outside looking in\\" - but knowing the truth and the intent of the inside.<br /><br />One of the flaws, if this is not too harsh a word, in Dutch society, which Hirsi Ali persistently calls passionate for freedom, is too much tolerance. By being polite and taking a \\"live and let live\\" stance toward the Muslims among them, they are white-washing Islam, making the same mistake I did by believing one should not attribute the bizarre actions of an extremist few to the central tenets of the religion, based on the Quran.<br /><br />Hirsi Ali tested Osama bin Laden's statements, alledgedly from the Quran, knowing she would find them there. She looked anyway. Yes, they were word for word, are word for word. Any literal interpretation of the Quran - and Muslims believe they have no right to \\"interpret\\" so they must take it word for word - demands the killing of all infidels: all non-Muslims. They aren't supposed to associate with the rest of us. We are polluting the world of their god.<br /><br />If cannibals moved into your neighborhood would you think it civilized to look the other way and let them practice their beliefs, their religion, as they wish?<br /><br />Infidel is a must-read book.<br /><br />Others have praised Hirsi Ali's writing style.

6305907145|1.0|Austen purists are snobbish people who always find fault with cinematic adaptations. But with \\"adaptations\\" like this one, can anyone blame us? Does no one feel our frustration when the Hollywood Hacks think they can add something that Jane Austen missed?  Or totally ruin the beautiful harmonious balance and wit of the book with modifications to make it amenable to the modern viewer?  This version is appalling. Fanny is all wrong, Maria and Julia look like baboons, Sir Thomas is very evil and Tom driven to dissolution by the family's Antigua slaveholdings. This last is the most significant departure. While exploring how institutions like slavery morally bankrupted those who profited from it makes a worthy subject, Mansfield Park is not the venue. Especially as it is done with such a heavy touch. The issue is so blunderingly belabored that it completely destroys the movie. Add to this the enragingly pointless scenes where Fanny accepts then rejects Crawford's proposal (WHY?), and this movie is a confirmed stinker.
9113020730|3.0|For the ending of this book alone, it is worth reading. However, while I wish I could say that this book was of the same caliber as that of the prior two books, in my opinion it was not. The book picked up right where the last left off, with Salander in the hospital being treated for her injuries. Blomkvist continues to sleuth on her behalf in order to expose those who have made her life hellish and attempted to frame her for all manner of crimes. Of course, in his spare time he also still manages to attract every woman within a 500-yard-radius like a bee to honey.  All of the other familiar characters from the prior books return.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot of the book, so I will give a general review. The overall feel of the book to me is that it was the least edited and least considered of the three. This would make sense if Larsson had intended to go back and do some more tweaking and editing before publication, but he was obviously unable to do so after his death. There are entire sections of the book that meander on and on with no apparent purpose with regard to moving the story forward. These sections would have benefited greatly from some serious editorial paring.<br /><br />To me, the plot did not at all move along at the same clip as the prior books. The suspense just wasn't there to the same degree. I recall that I simply  could not put down the previous books, but I was nowhere near as riveted by this one. In addition, there were a number of somewhat annoying grammatical errors, sentence fragments, etc.<br /><br />For the good points of the book, the ending (if that is what we can call the last 150-200 pages) is a very nice, tightly written section that ties everything together beautifully. Again, it struck me that perhaps Larsson had written the ending earlier than the rest of book three, as it appeared to be the best-constructed section of the entire book.  For the ending alone, this story is worth reading.  I wavered between a 3-and 4- star review for this reason. Ultimately, I considered whether the book, standing alone without the other two, would be a 4-star book, and I don't believe that would be the case.<br /><br />As an aside, one minor issue is that on the book cover of the copy I picked up while in Belgium, the first blurb says \\"The Trial\\", as if the book is mostly about Salander's trial itself, which it is not. The trial itself takes up about the last tenth of the book. Whether this type of advertising will occur with the North American edition I don't know, but I write this warning simply so you might know what to expect.<br /><br />In summary, anyone who has read the first two books simply will not be able to deny themselves the final installment, nor should they.  Although I did not find the book to hold the same level of suspense and I sometimes found it rather dull, the ending of the book makes it very worthwhile reading. It is a great loss that Mr. Larsson passed away before he could really fine-tune the final book, and before he could write another.eason.

1932100660|5.0|The mere fact that so many prominent medical people and organizations endorsed this book, encouraged me to read contents.  I found the book a shocking eye opener as to foods I've eaten in the past without realizing importance of their effects on my personal health and longevity.  Most encouraging was learning I could not only stop numerous body afflictions, but could also reverse same with proper diet.  I found it not necessary to take chemical based pharmaceuticals for cholesterol if changing to plant based diet, and what and how to digest these things.  Proof of claims is provided to verify these findings. Further, found out about many other ailments that occur because of animal based protein intake.  It also made me aware of the many powerful food industries that pay big money to suppress information from the public that might alter their profits. I have since purchased several more copies of this book as gifts to friends and neighbors that are experiencing extreme health problems that appear incurable to the average bear.  As a newbie to this publication, am anxiously awaiting to see the new me.  In just a very short time, am already feeling certain health benefits.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I love this movie, made by obviously good people and yes, so full of good. That said, on my most recent viewing, the following things caught my eye and made me realize IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE would have NEVER been made today:  1) The police try to shoot George for hitting one of them. Talk about police brutality!  2) In George's alternate life, we find that Mary had the very worst possible thing happen to her: she became an old maid!. Her eyesight aapparently also suffered from this as she ended up wearing glasses too.  3) George and Clarence get thrown out of a bar for talking about 200 year old angels. Those Potterville bars sure had high standards for their drunken patron's conversations!  4) I would also question George's sanity for letting Uncle Billy handle a $8,000 deposit which I'm guessing would represent somewhere around $200,000 of today.  5) The simple, even naive way the movie starts with the stars speaking to one other. There you can also hear someone praying to \\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph\\". I bet somebody would attack that for being \\"un-politically correct\\" these days.  I also noticed for the first time that with all the heavy snowing when George is on the bridge, not a single flake actually sticks to his clothes; Harry's hat in his final scene also seems to be refrigerated as the snow on it stays while that on his shoulders melts. The Christmas decoration switching on and off his arm when he talks to Harry long distance is also very funny.

B0025KVLSI|5.0|It has often been said that The Beatles on this album appear tired, and somewhat uninspirered. If this was so it would not be unnatural, after within two years having recorded four albums and several singles, almost constant touring and with all the buzz around their enormous popularity.<br /><br />The album title and the bandmembers' own slightly weary attitudes seem to support this theory. However, I will choose to focus on the music which in no way seems tired to me.<br /><br />The group has in this album perfected their well-known expression, and their own songs are stronger than ever. You could object and say that several of the six cover songs might not be among the most interesting Beatles recordings; and I would not completely disagree.<br /><br />Like on the later \\"Rubber Soul\\" several numbers are characterized by the acoustic guitar, which gives them a crisp but also a soft sound, on a few songs almost folkish.<br /><br />The great sound and production are also help to demonstrate the group's lush harmonies and their individual vocally strengths.<br /><br />John Lennon was at this point the group's undisputed vocal center - with Paul and George predominantly as harmonies.<br /><br />A quick review shows that Lennon's takes the lead vocals on \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" \\"Rock and Roll Music\\", \\"Mr Moonlight\\", \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"I Don't Want to spoil the Party \\". On the duets \\"Baby's in Black\\" and \\"Words of Love\\" it is Lennon you hear most clearly, and even on McCartney's \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" he sings the first verse lines.<br /><br />There was certainly good reason to leave Lennon lead-vocals. His voice was incredibly powerful these years, and his interpretations of rock and roll songs like \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" is nothing less than overwhelming.<br /><br />McCartney sings \\"Kansas City\\", and actually does it almost equally well; that track as such does not work as well as the aforementioned is another matter. On the Beatles originals McCartney actually only has lead-vocals on \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\".<br /><br />Ringo and George each sing a Carl Perkins number, a thing of which George clearly comes out best.<br /><br />For me, the album's highlights are many, but especially the two delicate acoustics \\"No Reply\\" and \\"Every Little Thing\\", are tracks you never grow tired of. McCartney's \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" are almost as good. \\"Eight Days Week\\" is a classic that could have been a chart topper, but which was hidden on the back of the stunning \\"Rock and Roll Music\\". \\"I'm a Loser\\" can almost be regarded as a precursor to the \\"Help\\" and \\"Baby's Black\\" and \\"I Don't Want to Spoil the Party\\" are just good numbers. Among the cover versions,  besides \\"Rock and Roll Music,\\" \\"Words of Love\\" comes out the best (it actually sounds like a Beatles' song). \\"Mr Moonlight\\", \\"Kansas City\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" and \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" are solid recordings but numbers you could have done without if necessary.Sun\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\".

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I'm a great fan and I must say I never thought it would get such a fantastic treatment. The blu-ray edition is just great.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Thank God for Amazon's DEAL OF THE DAY, or I would never have discovered this wonderful series. I ordered the fist four series and what a revelation!!!!! great writing, fabulous production values, fine casting, music background by the BBC   National Symphony Orchestra of Wales. I'm addicted. Get it, if you love SCI-FI/FANTASY. Oh yes -- very sharp DVD picture. Upscales beautifully on large LCD or PLASMA sets
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|A wonderful film and a blu-ray edition with excellent picture quality. Not for everyone, however.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Now I know how Simon felt when Ms Boyle first belted out her first song.  This woman should have a long and spectacular career.  She shouldn't waste her time with Monkeys tunes even though she can make that sound great.  I'm thinking Phantom of the Opera, Ava Maria, God Bless America (stretch for an Non-American, but she did do the Monkeys).
B001AQMBKA|5.0|That's a real great series, and this top quality blu-ray edition is just what it deserves.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Slayer IS the AC/DC of thrash/Death metal. They put out the same record, generally, every couple years. Some call it a 'come back' each time, some like certain aspects, but they dont stray at ALL from their base sound. This is a good and bad thing, but Slayer is Slayer. You like em? You will like this.<br /><br />I compare it to a mix of 'Seasons in the Abyss' and 'Divine Intervention'. There are tracks like 'Psycopathy Red' and 'Hate Worldwide' that sound nearly Identical riff-wise to 'War Ensamble'. Same pace and tempo. The beginning 2 minutes of 'Snuff' reminds me of 'Ghosts of War' from 'South of Heaven'. etc..<br />Its very good, dont get me wrong. But i find myself, honestly,  unamused at this point. Slayer has been doing this same thing for a generation now, like AC/DC's 3 chord 4 minute songs, but I do enjoy it like comfort food. No one can say they ever 'sold out', only have gotten heavier (Especially in the 'God Hates Us All' Phase). Tom Araya still has that shout vocal in rare form and the Drum is complete overkill (Lombardo better than ever), but it just makes the music steam a bit harder.<br /><br />This is not as heavy and completely over the top as like, say, 'God Hates Us All', and the production level is good enough, I don't understand the negativity. Works for me. A little less 'In Your Face' but very clear. It really does go back to the 'Seasons' sound just a little more Drum heavy, though it could use more 'bottom' to not sound so hollow.<br /><br />There are a slight variations on tracks like 'Playing With Dolls' and the closer 'Not of This God' (which is a very good track with its thick grooved mid-section), toying with tempo changes and slower delivery. But overall you will get another typical Slayer disc. No need to point out every detail, if you liked any of their releases since 'Seasons in the Abyss', this fits perfectly in. Not a whole lot else to say. Well, except 'Americon' is Slayers attempt at (dare I say) a more straight approach. Not their best. The only toss on here.<br /><br />The only thing I dont get are a lot of the seemingly different view points on Slayer Discs at all as they are the kings of recycling and coming up with better material. But this is why I can never seem to give them a 5, because I feel I have heard it all before. Still love 'em though and will see them for the 6th time this year.on here.

B001U0HAYS|5.0|This is one the best action films ever, and the blu-ray edition makes it even better.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Was on the edge of my seat the whole movie.  Tears included.  Have always been awed by his talent, but this blew me away! A MUST HAVE.

0061537969|5.0|As an avid dog lover, I was hooked on this book after the first page. Written from the perspective of a beloved dog, this novel tells the story of the similarities (and differences!) between canines and humans. This book is gut-wrenching, sweet, and honest. I found myself unable to put it down. Stein does an amazing job of making the content and the characters relate-able. Denny, the dog's owner, is a race car driver, and as someone without the slightest interest in racing, I still found the racing metaphors and descriptions riveting. In addition, I do not think you need to love dogs in order to love this book. Stein writes about the journey of life in a much less obvious way than so many books today. At the end of the day, I felt like I was cuddling up with an old friend in this book. You will not be disappointed!
0061650994|4.0|I bought this to read to my third graders. We were comparing and contrasting this story with The Grinch Who Stole Christmas. They loved the story. It helped to talk about Charles Dickens, the era that he wrote the story, and why he wrote it. The pictures are nice, too.
0143034901|5.0|I had high expectations of this book, and I was not disappointed.  This is an excellent novel, and it is extremely well-written.  The setting is 1950's Spain, but the author keeps going back to about 1919 as things that happen in the 1950's are all very connected to the tragedy that played out in 1919.  The book is hard to slip into one particular genre.  It is historical fiction, but there is also a very good mystery in the plot as well as tremendous human tragedy that has long and far-reaching effects.  The characterizations are extremely well-done.  I literally did not want to put this book down once I began it. It was absolutely tremendous.
B00139W3NE|3.0|It is very entertaining and worth the watch. The only disappointment, is the ending. It really leaves on hanging and making them try to figure it out. It is a good watch and special effects are great.
B001JFZ118|5.0|Received the movie promptly and in excellent condition.  The move of course is great.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Enjoyed this very much. Was well done and the plot was one that kept you rooting for the good guys. Well worth the watch and one that I am sure every man would enjoy.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|A great film I must say indeed. I first saw this movie as a young child. Appreciation of cinema has led me back to once watch it again. I Give this film 4 stars, but I do not have the desire to tell you anything about the story, it would't be the same, but I'll give you a hint. Its a combination of a more believable  Alice in Wonderland and Forest Gump in the most delightful way imaginable. I hope you enjoy this film as I sure have.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Now here is a romantic film that is great. Has everything that would make you fall in love with the actors and the places that you see in the movie. I don't think this one I would call just a \\"Chick Flick\\". I enjoyed and am sure anyone seeing would enjoy it very much as well.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|If you have bluray and you enjoy this movie, This is the print for you! The detail is like nothing you have ever seen. the print is clean, and yet there is still a hint of grain form the film. This is the best print by far I have ever seen of this movie. It even blows away the HD version that they play on cable now.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|A great watch. The beauty you see is great. The actors are really great. It is a good watch and a very good one to own. I would recommend this to everyone. Well worth the watch. Really more than a love story to me. Great over all film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I could hardly wait until this item came out in stores.  However, it was sold out everywhere.  My purchase from Amazon came quickly!  At last I could listen to Susan Boyle's wonderful album.  I was not disappointed!  I have been a fan since Susan first appeared on the scene.  Her songs on the album are varied and good choices.  For those who may remember (or not), she reminds me of Kate Smith who was a wonderful singer many, many years ago.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan Boyle has a marvelous voice.  The cd isn't bad.  I believe she needs more voice training and to be more selective of songs that are more suited to her experience level.  In doing this her next cd could be excellent.
B0000542D2|5.0|When a \\"Hard Day's Night\\" came out I was 14 years old. The memories of the songs and the cutting edge black and white cinematography that I experienced as a kid were confirmed, refreshed and renewed as I viewed the movie again! If that wasn't enough this collector's edition comes with a second DVD that includes interviews with the director, Richard Lester, George Martin and others that shed a whole new light on the times, the low budget of the film, the creative genius of each of the Beatles and information that inspires and amazes you further on the fun and power of this film! There was also a large segment of one of the DVD's devoted to the making of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" that added, again, a whole new appreciation of the film!    In these tough economic times in a world filled with too much sex, violence and \\"life on the crude side\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and the accompanying DVD, is a breath of fresh air that can not be missed! There is something very special about the opening chord of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" as three of the Beatles run headlong into the camera smiling and tripping as they are being chased by young girls and boys that can take anyone to the brightest moments in your childhood. Relive the music, the creative genius and fun of the early Beatles through this film, the interviews, insights and information contained in this Miramax Collector's Edition of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" - it really is a blast!
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Brilliant CD, he is doing his best work in his 70's, pushing the envelope. Beautifully produced, clean, crisp even if he does thank his band and singers too much.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|This is one of the best bad movies that you'll ever see.<br /><br />As a stand alone movie it has everything that would make a winner. The actors were good, the story was well told and the look of the movie is spectacular.<br /><br />As part of the Star Trek franchise, it is a disaster. Destroying the planet Vulcan? Making one of the founding members of the Federation an endangered species?<br /><br />NO- the producer over-reached and created something that can't stand beside the existing body of work.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams is great but in this case he screwed the pooch. He re-wrote history and undermined a near-sacred franchise in a way that in completely untenable. You simply CAN NOT do that with a shared treasure like Star Trek with generations of fans that know the story and trivia much better than the bleeding idiots who OKed production of this wretched script.<br /><br />He should have known better.<br /><br />Pretend that it never happened and maybe it will go away.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Out of dozens purchased, as an old guy with a bit of money, this is my favorite of 2009. \\"Get Lucky\\" tells a great story of an old man late in life, and Mark K. is really tackling that edge of creativity. The voice is good, the song writing better. Get this one!
B002OVEB5S|2.0|from reading the reviews, it looks like your either going to love this cd, or hate it. i'm going to have to fall into the latter. as much as i want to like this cd, i just can't. the riffs are dead, the solo's overdone and the lyrics overused.    this cd may grow on me though, only time will tell that. i think it's just, that when your craving those great hooks and riffs that slayer is known for, and all you get is bland \\"heard-it-all-before\\" thrash...well, ya get a little let down.
B001GEJ7XU|5.0|I love the way she plays Bach: so much better than Gould humming or Gulda doddering. She has been recording for DGG since the late 70's and these are all modern DDD fully digital re-recordings with a wonderful acoustic. You can't go wrong with Argerich--definitive performances.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|I have waited a while to get final season and was not disappointed it's all and more than I thought it to be.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|I didn't catch District 9 in the theater but got the DVD.  I heard all the hype but figured this was another \\"message\\" movie like so many these days.  While there is a hint of current events it does not overpower the movie or kick you out of the experience like that 2+ hour salute to lame stereotypes that is Avatar.  From the first scene the movie just runs.  There are no scenes dragging it down and you would be hard pressed to find a scene to fast forward through on repeat viewings.  I find it fascinating that this movie holds up to any over-marketed and over-hyped Hollywood flotsam with a new director and fraction of a typical budget.  While it is sometimes sad to see the aliens forced to live in such squalor it reminds us that societies all over the world are capable of intolerance (not just the US).  And for once I find it refreshing that this isn't another tired critical expose on America but rather a generic study of when two alien cultures collide.  Of course, it's also good science fiction.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great movie! JJ Abrams really does a great job of breathing new life into this franchise. Best movie of the year.
1594488916|2.0|This book is like going to a party and listening to a compelling adventure told by an inept storyteller.  You know there's something interesting in there but the author just doesn't bring it out.  She's fascinated by the wrong parts of the story. If I were her editor I'd have asked for extrapolation on every part she truncates and judicious deleting where she finds the story interesting. Further, she keeps teasing the reader that she was only trying to write a story, until she became intractably involved in the story.  Except that she didn't. Other than knowing where the creepy little petty thief kept his stash --at his mom's house, surprise, surprise--nothing really involves the author to the point of getting her in trouble.  She's not even called by the courts as a witness, so big deal.   And the worst thing is **spoiler alert** the book just ends.  There's no conclusion in the narrative, simply a \\"I never heard from John again and here are my thoughts on that\\".    On the positive side, there were many interesting anectdotes about OTHER book collectors throughout history who had nothing to do with this story.  Whenever the story turned back to John Gilkey, it was just sordid, dreary and dull.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been waiting for this album ever since I heard her audition on \\"Britain's Got Talent\\". What an incredible talent and what an incredible woman to never give up on her dream. She is a great inspiration to so many people.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Very few Hollywood stars can claim they have experienced comebacks more than other stars, but Joan Crawford hovers all in that respect. After MGM dumped her in the early forties citing she was \\"boxoffice poison\\", Warner Brothers signed Crawford to star in this potboiler about a woman who sacrifices everything to please her selfish, ungrateful child and to give her everything money can buy. Director Michael Curtiz didn't want Joan. He felt her shoulder pads and her stiff acting wasn't what was warranted for the role of Mildred. He actually wanted Babara Stanwyck, who turned the role down citing she could never play opposite a character as evil as the daughter Veda. After having a screen test (an embarrassement to Crawford after she had been in films for over 18 years) Curtiz was blown away by Crawford's performance. In one scene during preproduction Joan waited for Curtiz to yell \\"cut, cut\\", but didn't hear anything. She then looked over to the director's chair and noticed Curtiz crying. He told her, \\"I love you baby...you've got the part\\". \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is one of the best films from the 1940's, soap operish at best, but flawless in its cinematography and performances. It's also one of the best in the film noir series that shows a lot of shadows in its scenes, a common occurrence in french films that was brought to American movie making. The highlight to this DVD is also an informative documentary produced by Turner Broadcasting on Joan Crawford called \\"Always The Star\\", featuring interviews with many people who knew Crawford, including Betsy Palmer (her co-star in \\"Queen Bee\\"), Christina Crawford (Joan's daughter and author of \\"Mommie Dearest\\"), Vincent Sherman (former lover and director), and more. There are also a series of neat trailers from Joan's Warner Brother's films.
B00197POXG|5.0|I loved the series when on TV.  Now I can watch and enjoy whenever I want.  Too bad there aren't more shows like this on television today.   Mrs. J. Long
B001BWYZWA|5.0|Great movie.  My son loved it.  My brother has worn his out and gotten his second one!  It is a keeper.
B002P5XXR0|3.0|I was hoping for more from Horner for this score, but the music (especially the action cues) is just average. I've heard better action music from horror-movie scores. And I hate the mixing by Simon Rhodes. It's just lazy-sounding.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Good movie for those who are into sci-fi.  Helps if you knew the original series to understand the depth of characterization and inside jokes, but not necessary.  A family movie for those who like action .
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this film mostly to play in the background while I studied or graded papers.  This is a wonderful film, especially for my little nephew and niece to watch when I babysit.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|\\"District 9\\" is such a great film on many levels. The first thing that comes to mind is the apartheid that hamstrung the country it takes place in, for so many years. It was disheartening to see it resurrected once more, not for the Blacks, but the aliens (which is in itself curious, because there are blacks in the film treating the aliens as they were once treated).  The aliens themselves seemed like animals at times, and being human, we tend to \\"lessen\\" them because of this. Of course, their societal norms are very different from ours, and because of this, they tend to be a bit shall we say....Destructive? So they are segregated.  You are immediately immersed in the film from the very start, because of the \\"Live news coverage\\" nature of the film. The \\"live roving camera\\" style isn't as bad as far as motion sickness goes, and the violence is VERY convincing. The aliens (or \\"Prawns\\" as they are derisively called) for being CGI, are, as well. So much so, that one would probably not bat an eye if they actually showed up in \\"person\\"!  The secretive and subversive nature of the MNU (or \\"MultiNational Union\\") is also convincing, because so many nations already do these sorts of things, already. It's henchman soldiers hark back to the French Foreign Legion, because they operate in much the same way as the FFL did, in it's heyday.  I found the film touching, in some respects, because the Human protagonist, Wikus Van De Merwe, Only found his humanity, when it was finally lost, and the alien protagonist, \\"Christopher Johnson\\", found that not all humans are evil, but just \\"misguided\\".   Peter Jackson hit a homer with \\"District 9\\". He also left considerable room for sequels, as well, which is good, because I would very much like to see some threads resolved.    I recommend \\"district 9\\" not for it's SFX, or it's acting, action, or camera work. It is recommended because it leaves you thinking long after the credits (because my assessment here, is not the only conclusion you maybe left with). easily 5 stars!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  The blue ray quality is definitely worth the price.
B000GY729M|1.0|I am a big Killers fan and found this to me a most dissapointing album.  I have listened and listened to it, hoping it would grow on me, but it just gets worse!  Even for Killers fans, I would advise not purchasing this.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|I like Harry Potter movies but Half-Blood Prince was too long and boring, at 153mins they could easily edit 30-40mins to make it more interesting. I literally fell asleep watching this movie.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when I was growing up.  I am so happy to see that my two sons love it as much as I did.  The whole family now has songs to sing in the car.  This is a great movie for kids of every age.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This type of material is precicely what the BluRay format was made for! And kudos to the BBC and the Discovery Channel for bringing it to the masses! I saw some of the digital broadcasts and could not wait to finally own a copy! An excellent work - this from a long-time supporter of media of our natural world! Thank you.
B001QOGY9U|5.0|A lot of reviewers seem to be parents with small children. I'm not. I'm a twenty-year-old college student who grew up during the \\"Disney Renaissance\\" that was the 1990s so, for me, watching The Princess and the Frog felt like coming home.     It's been years since I was excited (and boy was I; probably more so than any of the five-year-olds in the theater) about a new Disney movie, and I had resigned myself to relying solely on [[ASIN:B0016RO6X8 Studio Ghibli]] for my 2D animation fix. But then this movie came along, bringing everything I could have ever hoped for in a Disney movie: The animation was (of course) gorgeous. The characters were thoroughly charming, particularly Tiana's spoiled but sweet gal pal, Charlotte; Ray, the loveable but slightly dim firefly; Mama Odie, the resident cool old lady and the voodoo queen of the bayou; and Louis, a jolly alligator who wants nothing more than to play jazz with \\"the big boys\\" (which is just plain awesome). Randy Newman's [[ASIN:B002O4J4F2 soundtrack]] (which I can't stop listening to) is a lot of fun and fits very well with the setting. And the romance between the two leads - Tiana and Naveen - is believable and very sweet.    The Princess and the Frog has firmly booted [[ASIN:B000F8O35U The Little Mermaid]] out of the number two spot on my list of favorite Disney movies and may even tie with [[ASIN:B00003CX8Y Beauty and the Beast]] for number one. I just wish they made Tiana jammies in my size.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|If you don't know just how low humanity can sink, just watch this movie.  It's a little slow getting started, but if you can wait for about 30 minutes through the first part, it's well worth it.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Bob attempts to get you in the holiday spirit with various Christmas songs.  Even though the preceeds go to charity, a few of his songs are painful, at best, to listen to; especially \\"Hark the Herald\\" and \\"Little Drummer Boy\\".   I think Bob should stick to his own genre and leave the holiday music alone.  (and maybe just donate your money to the charity of your choice)
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Nothing but glowing things to say about this film but want to add: BEST DOG MOVIE EVER.

B001F12J48|3.0|The 3D quality was poor but, I believe you do get the regular DVD version also in this pack so, that was nice.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|it is simply the best romantic comedy we've watched in a long time. the chemistry between sandra bullock and ryan reynolds is so delicious that you will be inclined to watch this movie over and over again.  the supporting actors are wonderful with betty white....of course.  if you just want a feel-good movie on a dreary day, this is it! you will not regret.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Terminator Salvation is a good action movie, continues the Terminator saga.  Don't go in expecting it to make a lot of sense though.  Just sit back, watch and enjoy.  And as usual in this series, the Terminator is by far the best character and the one you root for.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I ordered Susan Boyle's CD for a Christmas present for my church choir members.   I have received many positive comments on it.  My husband and I played it three times when  we first got it because we liked it so well.  My 23 year old daughter was surprised that her voice sounded   so young.  I was unhappy that I could only order three at a time - What was up with that?  I ended up buying some elsewhere because I needed to get 15 of them.  One of the CD's came with a cracked case - so that's the one my husband and I kept.  I had the second order shipped to my PO Box instead of my house.  They didn't come cracked.
B001PPLIEG|2.0|Loved \\"Casino Royale.\\"  Love Daniel Craig as James Bond.  Didn't think much of this film, however.  Surprisingly poor direction and a script that is confusing and non-engaging.      Example:  At the end, when Bond confronts the villain, \\"Green\\" states that he's told Bond everything he wanted to know about Quantum.  Problem is, the viewer has never seen this scene in the film!!  Incredible, and the fault of the director.    The action scenes have nice set-up, but are also very poorly directed; with the viewer never really sure what's going on.      The theme song by Jack White is the weakest ever for a Bond film, and completely absent is the   trademark Bond theme song.       Even the sound quality is weak, with much of the dialogue incomprehensible.  (This is the only time I've ever had to go to the subtitles just to understand what the female lead is saying.      Hoping this director doesn't destroy another Bond film.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|This is not the John Mayer you know...This album us unrecognizable. Battle Studies lacks any hint of energy, and the monotone beats will most likely leave you bored stiff. I listened to it once and shelved it...I'm not even going to try to get through it again. I'm a huge JM fan, but I'm not impressed with this album. John is going to have to knock me off my feet with his next record to make up for this atrocity.

B000025JJ4|5.0|I love this cd, every song is great.  I can't decide which song is my favorite! (All of them)  I bought this on cassette when it was released in 1993 and wore the tape out.  I'm excited to have it on cd now.  The quality of the cd sound is very rich and full, it really fills the room.  I just can't say enough about this album!  Definatley ranks as one of the top Deep Purple albums for me!  I'm a pretty big fan of both Ian Gillan and Ritchie Blackmore, so it goes without saying, I really miss Deep Purple.  There will never be any band even close.  What a bummer!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The bluray is really beautiful. I saw this film in the theater in 3D and I think they did a good job of converting it to bluray. The colors are vibrant and the animation is really a delight to watch.    I bought this version of the film because I love these bluray combo packs. I have a bluray player (PS3) but most of my family and friends do not, so I can't bring a movie over to my parents' house and watch it with them. This combo pack means I can watch it at home in bluray and bring the dvd with me to my parents' house to watch with them. The digital copy means I don't have to mess around with difficult software and murky licensing to back up the DVD to my computer - I just have a clean, computer-ready copy ready to go for my iPod. I wish all blurays came like this. It's past AND future proof!
0714834491|5.0|Buying 'The Art of Looking Sideways' is one of those must-do things everybody talks about.   There is virtually no way to fully or accurately describe this book. A college professor first introduced me to it, and ever since I glimpsed a few pages from it, I knew I wanted to own a copy.  You can literally have it fall open on your lap, and start reading it at that point. Trying to read it in any sort of linear manner would be difficult and ultimately pointless, because, as the author describes, every page is a shard. It is a treasure trove for inspiration and will never fail to fascinate, amuse, entertain and captivate you.

0545123267|4.0|SHIVER by Maggie Stifvater is what I like to call an emotional book. And I mean that in a good way. What I enjoy msot about romance books is the ability or the writer to convey the emotions of falling in love and being in love so well that we feel we are that character. Maggie has done just so with SHIVER and from page one you get that feeling of being in love, even if it's a wolf.<br /><br />The romance... OHHHH the romance! It went from sweet, to sexy, to passionate, to endearing, so sad... It was an emotional rollercoaster for the characters that fought so hard to be together while trying to learn about eachother and what they stood to lose or gain. Sam and Grace are a couple that you wanted to root for and with the last page, tears probably streaming down your eyes, you breahe a sigh and antcipated their return next summer with LINGER!<br /><br />Unlike Maggie's previous whirlwind books, like LAMENT and BALLAD whose faced paced storytelling is only matched by the characters' vibrant personalities, SHIVER is slower, more meanigful and really exposes those teen emotions. Maggie not only exposed those feelings, but described them so well, so eloquently, so passionately that it was as if me ourselves were Grace and Sam. Maggie did what few writers can do, and that is write a utterly moving and heartwarming story that trenscends all thought but solely relies on the emotions of the characters.<br /><br />It's a great book for fans of romance and, dare I say it, fans of Twilight. Maggie's SHIVER is a series to look out for and fall in love it!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|The movie was new and arrived in its original packaging.  Our family watched the movie Thanksgiving weekend and had some good laughs.  There were no issues with the CD jumping, warbling, etc.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Hopefully, no boring comments about my experiences; blah, blah, blah...  The characters are wonderfully pieced together, the dialogue is what you would expect and the emotions and insights which are represented are truly real.  In one scene there is a close up of the \\"reporters\\" face as they are about to get ambushed... priceless........... no words, merely expressions.    This is what boots on the ground truly looks like, not that glamourous.    Out.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The boys of Monty Python have really outdone themselves this time.  This movie is a clever social commentary on the unfair treatment of witches and the nearly but not quite dead while also dramatically highlighting the lesser known dangers of rabbits.  The quest for the Grail represents our own search for truth and understanding and shows us the importance of perseverance.  I believe this will become a very popular film.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Extremely moving!  From what I know of Miss Boyle, much of the music seems to mirror her own life.  Enjoy her magnificent ability in music!
0439023483|5.0|I will not give a recap of the book as you can read that in the book reviews above.  What I will do is tell you that this is a well written book that appeals on many levels.  It is a suspenseful, fast paced read.  It has compelling, complex characters that are interesting in their own rights.  It raises social and political questions to make you think without feeling like you are being preached to.    I have read some reviews that said that the author uses concepts written about before.  Really, what good book doesn't involve a theme that has already been written about?!  That is an unfair criticism as her story is NOT a rip off of others.  Every story has pretty much been written so when an author makes you feel so interested and engaged in their story that shows talent.  You could make the arguement that every story written is \\"ripping\\" some other story off.    There is a level of brutality in the book that will make it unenjoyable to some.  I will say that I am not a fan of brutal books, but everything was handled so well in this one that it did not bother me.  If you read the premise, you will know that it must entail some difficult situations.  The author never puts in anything gratuitous imo.  She doesn't go for shock value and leaves out the sort of details that would have made it unenjoyable for me.  There are some necessary sad scenes but the key word is necessary.  These scenes will make the book unenjoyable to the most sensitive of readers.  But for me, the sadest scene concentrated on the humanity and winning of the human spirit over death.  It also gave you enough hints of a happy resolution to let the horror part of it go.  Most of the deaths that occur, the reader does not personally witness.  Some of the others are so fast that you move on in the story before you fully take them in.  All but the last are not very deatailed or graphic.  Many of the characters that do die are more adult than child and not the nicest at that.  So for most readers, the subject matter/violence will not turn them off of the book.    If you want to read one of the most interesting, gripping, well written books I have read in a long time than I recommend this book for you.  If you can handle NO violence even if handled tastefully then skip this book.  Also if you read books with a personal agenda of bahsing, then this is not for you either. (You know who you are!  You have heard it compared to your favorite book and can't handle that it fairs well.)
B002RSDW80|4.0|I love all thing French. I saw the movie at the cinema and it was a must have on cd. Great story.Exceptional acting. Meryl Streep was Julie Child personafied.  The chemistry between Streep and Tucci was so believably real. Buy this. Even a husband will watch it.
0823003590|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent review on light and shadow of the head and a technique that is new to me in this medium.  I will try to use it often.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Bad Romance is one of those great songs you just can get off of your head. Either for the song itself or the luring and amazing video. But then, you get The Fame Monster and all the 8 songs in it really captivate you from the first note. What is more appealing about this deluxe edition is that it includes The Fame album. The great thing about this is that the The Fame cd comes with a cover that says The Fame Monster 2. So is not your regular copy of The Fame. The booklet turns upside down to change the cover to The Fame album. Lady GaGa did it again. Giving us the best of her. Enjoy your copy.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|I watched and compared the Blu-ray to my DTS DVD.  Don't support this kind of crap transfers.  I will wait for this to be done right.  I gave it two stars only for the audio.  The video is really annoying!
B000V1Y43W|3.0|Not as good of a value as some of the other DVD's. Great on blu-ray and a great movie.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar is a very entertaining movie with great eye candy. It's basically everything I hoped for from Star Wars Episode 1. The plot isn't as original as James Cameron thinks though. The plot is basically a combination of Ferngully: The Last Rain Forrest and Dances with Wolves. But CGI wise and excitement wise the movie was well worth the expense.<br />  Also, Avatar is less for females than Titanic, it's more for the Cameron fans that loved films like Aliens and Terminator 2. Which to me is a very good thing since I'm a guy and since I only watched Titanic once lol.
B00168OIOE|5.0|you get a blu-ray ,dvd , and digital copy all for one low price I  would highly recommend you get this deal before it's gone.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I'm an avid Harry Potter fan, like so many.  This film is definitely a \\"cliff notes\\" version of the book; probably best if you've read the book beforehand.  (It would have had to be a miniseries to fit in all that the book covers.)  The tone is extremely dark, as the story goes on.  The film is visually dark itself-especially on a smaller screen.  You'll have to dim the lights for some of the scenes at home just to see what is going on.    When I saw the film in theatres, I was dismayed by many of the cuts from the book, and I didn't like the \\"new\\" scenes.  I still feel that way to an extent, but over time I think I realize that some changes had to be made for pacing and sheer time.   I do think this is an amazing cast, and it's been a treat to watch the kids grow into their roles along with their characters.  I was especially impressed by Tom Felton-who finally had more of a role than comic relief.       I was disappointed that this DVD has NO extras whatsoever.  I don't need 30 hours of behind the scenes stuff, but buyers of this version should know that there is nothing but the movie on this DVD.  No commentary, no interviews, nada.  It's just the film.  I think that they are starting to \\"force\\" people to buy the deluxe blue ray versions, and I resent that.  I suppose it was coming, but it still grates.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is another great value and a great movie. You get a Blu-ray,DVD, and a digital copy all for a great price. I wish all Blu-rays came with this deal.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I combined this with a laptop PC.  Small size with a magnetic base.  Works great in my plane.  Acquires sate-lights quickly.  No regrets.
0743454537|4.0|I am still reading this book - about 25% done. I absolutely love her writing. This book is actually a little harder to read emotionally than others I have read. She is just such a great writer - very hard to put her books down.
B0009SS00A|2.0|If you are expecting something more engaging such as The Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons from the same author, you are in for a disappointment with Digital Fortress. The main characters of the story are poorly developed and the plot has more loopholes than twists and turns. Several of the scientific and technological details in the book seem hard to believe and poorly researched. But the real letdown of this book is poor style of narration. Overall a very mediocre read.

B001OQCV60|5.0|From the opening when horses seem to be galloping from the back of the theater, through the gray skies and industrial grime of the exteriors and the dinginess of most of the interiors, relieved occasionally by gorgeous jewel toned luxury, this Sherlock Holmes is grittier and much more raw then its predecessors--a Holmes for the millenium.<br /><br />Robert Downey's Holmes is a brilliant brat. He borrows Watson's clothes without permission, insults Watson's fiance at their first meeting, and drives Mrs. Hudson to her wits' ends, but he's also a guy who knows his way around a boxing ring and the one you want on your side when facing doom in the form of Lord Blackwood, an executed murderer who resurfaces at the head of a black magic cult bent on world domination.<br /><br />Jude Law's Watson is an understated sidekick to the flamboyant Holmes, but their relationship is more of a partnership than in typical Holmes/Watson duos. It's fun to watch the verbal sparring and exasperation which underlying affection makes sparkling rather than mean.  The supporting cast is excellent, as well. The movie plays fair with the viewer.  When Holmes explains how the crimes were carried out, we realize we saw the same clues at the same time he did. No deus ex machina here--it's all elementary.<br /><br />This Sherlock Holmes is neither Jeremy Brett nor Basil Rathbone.  Viewers who expect to settle into a predictable detective yarn will be disappointed.  This Holmes is edgy, action packed and slightly uncomfortable, but more believable because of it.  It's smart and atmospheric, and well worth seeing.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|No matter what the source of crime, these heroes gave it their all in the protection of human life.  Even though these epics were of action and adventure genre, they were best portrayed with dignity and comforting manner.
0307454541|5.0|I actually picked up this book for a gift for a relative. Had it all wrapped and ready to go when I ran out of good books to read one evening, so I ripped it open, and I'm really elated that I did. Larsson is a fabulous storyteller who draws you into various plots that stay on course and don't end up being tied up until the very last delicious moment. I am already devouring his second novel and will have my niece pick up the third while in Europe next month. My only regret is that Larsson is no longer with us to continue this intriguing journey. By the way, I rewraped the book and it is now being enjoyed by another.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I purchased this product for my mother who absolutely adores this show but can't always stay awake for the now 10:00pm airing time! It will also be shared among all the grand kids who also enjoy the show!
B0009353IW|5.0|I came across this album from a friend recently and, having heard of Mr. Cooder's work over the years but never owning any of it I decided to give it a shot. I quickly found myself listening to it over and over. It's become one of my favorite albums (and I have a lot of albums). There's lots of variety in the songs and the music just knocks me out, even if I can't understand the words. I've read the story surrounding it and never knew the history involved, so it also served as something of an educational tool. One of the last songs, 3rd Base, Dodgers Stadium is one of the most hearbreaking songs I've ever heard, disguised by a simple conversation regarding a mutual love for baseball. If you've got an open mind and an appreciation for something different every now and then, I highly recommend it.
B0024FAR5M|1.0|Seriously ??? I read the good reviews on this stupid show and thought I'd check it ...I have gotten through (barely) four episodes and can't believe that people can even dare to compare this to the Sopranos ... there are so many holes in this story and so many things that are just way to unbelieveable .... (Spoiler alert)  1. fire dept dude covering up dead bodies ... okay maybe if you pay him enough ... but not likely  2. Dr. Girl - is like 25 and had some association with the bikers in her previous life (WHEN SHE WAS WHAT 10 years old??)-- it takes a long time to go through med school - esp to become a newborn/pediatric surgeon (15 years including college) -- plus how the hell are they doing newborn open heart surgery in a hospital in a podunk little town ...   3. Dude in the gas station gets in a fight with biker - there is a shootout and the guy gets killed by the gas station attendent -- nobody looking into that ??   4. FBI dude witness a huge gunfight between 2 gangs with people getting shot and sits in his car doing nothing ... seriously??  - there are probably a million more that I am missing -- at any rate to compare this show to the Sopranos is a joke ... the Sopranos was well written and thought out - this on the other hand is not.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a great buy. I got a PS3 for Christmas and wanted to get some Blu Ray discs. My girlfriend and the kids love this movie, so it was one of a few that I purchased at Amazon. This movie came with a Blu Ray disk, a DVD, and a digital copy, so we can watch  Blu Ray in a LR, the kids can watch a DVD in their rooms and my GF has it on her iPhone and laptop. I bought a few other Blu Rays at Amaon and with my Prime account I get free 2 day delivery, so under $20 a movie, I get it to my door in 2 days. Thanks Amazon.com
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I can't believe I just watched this movie for the first time! I'm sure I'll watch again and again. It really is new Christmas classic. They've struck a perfect balance between holiday film and love story. Even though there are a bunch of connected sub-plots it all works together quite well. This film has a lot of heart and I think anyone with a warm one will enjoy it.
B000063V8U|5.0|I received the DVDs a lot earlier than I expected and they are just what I expected I have enjoyed watching them. The work perfectly on both of our dvd players. Thank-you so very much, if I had to buy them here from a shop they would have cost almost double the price as they are hard to find now.  Thank-you again Tracey V.K.  ps I cannot tag this product as it just wont allow it, I have tried several times. If I could I would tag it \\"Great, amazing\\".
B00008WT5E|5.0|Powerage is known to be one of the best albums AC/DC has ever made.  It's definitely a classic. All songs are great and some are even brilliant. If you are not yet familiar with the first say 7 or 8 AC/DC albums I'd recommend this one first. There's really no chance you will be disappointed. Best songs are Down Payment Blues, Gimme A Bullet and What's Next To The Moon. Hails to AC/DC ! Hails to Bon Scott !
B000H1RFKA|4.0|I did not care for the film the first time I watched it....thought it would be more action-oriented in the vein of \\"Smokin' Aces\\", or \\"Lock, Stock...\\".    However, I gave it another chance, and I now rate it much higher......in fact, I've seen it about 4 times now.  Enjoy.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I bought three of these for Christmas gifts. I am not able to give a review as I did not watch the DVD. THe people who received the gifts seemed too be happy with it.

B001SN78JO|3.0|First it was that he couldn't lie. Now, Jim Carrey can't say no.    I watched this movie over vacation, and decided it was good enough to review. Basically, it's Jim Carrey in another wild movie about a man who denies life, but in a strange turn of events, becomes a YES MAN, and can't refuse anything- no matter what.    Leading to some funny, ridiculous scenarios and some classic Jim Carry scenes, there was certainly some very funny scenes in this movie, and the relationship between Jim's and Zooey's characters is very sweet and believable. And yet it wasn't the kind of movie I'd want to buy.    It's really just the kind of movie you should rent every once in awhile, because the funniness of Carrey didn't envelope the whole movie, and it didn't feel like one of his best. With some slow moments and a bizarre sex scene between, well, Jim's character and an old lady, it's not one of my favorites.    So it's a definite watch, but not exactly a good buy. The acting was alright and the funniness usually made me laugh, but there was something weird about it that just didn't click- and why this isn't on my movie shelf.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Personally, I give this album very high marks.  I liked it better than I had expected it to be.  A very nice mixture of easy listening songs, different from what you heard on the TV performances.  I later gave my daughters this album, and they too thought it was wonderful.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|The album's promise is in GaGa's ability to write. She's very clever and it definitely comes through in her music. There were some songs that were highly influenced by Freestyle dance music, which I'm not a fan of, but overall, the entire album is satisfying.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I'd never seen Bound when it came out 12 years ago. So, I recently decided to see it on DVD. As a crime drama, it really packs a punch.     The storyline centers on a gangster moll named Violet, and her plot to steal over 2 million bucks from her 'common thug' of a boyfriend, Caeser. Caeser is involved with the mob, and is laundering the huge sum of money for them. The money belongs to the mob, and Caeser must turn it over to them, after laundering it.    Their neighbor, named Corky (played with flinty perfection by Gina Gershon), is a lesbian ex-con. Corky is a plumber. She's doing some repairs in an apartment, which is right next to Violet and Caeser's place.    Tired of the violent, criminal world that she's been a part of through Caeser, Violet wants a fresh start. She soon winds-up seducing Corky, and enlists Corky's help in a scheme to steal the millions in cash from Caeser. Having fallen for Violet, Corky agrees to help her steal the cash from Caeser, then set him up to make him appear to be the culprit.     Corky tells Violet how dangerous it is to risk stealing from the mob, and that their plan has to be fool-proof. Their brilliant plan goes well-at first. But it starts to unravel, and then the thrills really begin. From then on, the film features harrowing plot-twists, and plenty of nail-biting suspense.    The acting in this film, was top-notch. Especially the performances by Gina Gershon, and Jennifer Tilly (who played Violet). When this film was made, lesbian characters were beginning to turn-up in mainstream movies, in larger numbers than ever before. And Bound was especially cutting-edge, by featuring a lesbian character as one of the main protagonists in the film, rather than as just a supporting character.    I would give Bound a higher rating. But I was a bit put-off by the excessive, gory violence contained in this film. Otherwise, Bound is an exciting, powerful crime drama, which will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I read this book in 2005 before the allegations towards the author surfaced. I found the book to be exemplary, a facinating read that gave me new insight into a world which i knew little about. i decided to re-read the book in December 09 and although I knew some parts were embellished, It is still an exceptional read and I highly recommend it. Buy it, it is worth every penny.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|This book was not as enthralling and wonderful as my favorite Brown, The da Vinci Code.  I am a strict, staunch Catholic, but I loved the book as a piece of fiction.  I remember reading it a few years ago on our boat, and being called to have dinner with others.  I could hardly wait to escape to get back to the story!  This volume took me 3 months to read.  Granted, I was working daily (read da Vinci during summer, off work), but it didn't hold my interest as did his other books.  I have read all his books, and enjoyed all of them a LOT (I want to see the movie Angels and Demons, but I want to re-read the book first; always find the book much better than the screen version).  I liked this book the least of all his other titles.  I will still buy his next title, but this was my least liked of all his other books.  Sorry, Dan!
1577314808|5.0|When a master wakes up and frees from the Cave as in Plato's parable, how many people will recognize that and listen to him? In Mr. Tolle's case, probably more than two million. Understandably, there will be defensive reactions from the readers as Tolle clearly points out that the shadows this world takes for reality are actually illusions. One will need to escape the Cave also to see the light or to accept his words for it first and make the conscious shift. While earthly accomplishments have their virtues, sooner or later and at last in the deathbed, all have to let go and become as lucid as Shakespeare when he wrote \\"We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep (TEMPEST, 4:1).\\" THE POWER of NOW helps one awaken from the dream to see what is and what is not; a modern spiritual classic that connect us to the truth that are known and buried in us all.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Bob Dylan is pulling our chains.  This album is a total goof.  The fist tip off is the art - traditional sleigh ride on the cover, cheesecake Santa inside.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt is the most powerful, well-acted drama of 2008. The story is set in 1964, at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The plot centers around the school's priest, Father Flynn. He is suspected of instigating an improper relationship, with one of the students at the school.    Meryl Streep plays the stern nun and school Principal, Sister Aloysius Beauvier. Sister Aloysius is often at odds with her subordinate, Sister James. Sister James is a much younger nun, then Sister Aloysius. And Sister James doesn't agree with the harsh methods, that Sister Aloysius insists on using to deal with the students.    A black student named Donald Miller is admitted to the school, and he's the only black attending. Mass integration hasn't yet been implemented at the school. So, Donald is often singled-out by the white kids, as a target for their racism. Donald seeks advice from Father Flynn, about his interest in becoming a priest. Father Flynn also gives Donald morale support, when Donald is harassed by some white students.    One day, Sister James witnesses Father Flynn summoning Donald into a private meeting, in the Rectory. She also sees Father Flynn place Donald's T-shirt, into a locker. When Donald returns to his desk after his meeting with Father Flynn, Donald seems upset to Sister James. She also notices the odor of alcohol, on Donald's breath. Suspecting that Father Flynn had lured Donald into a carnal tryst inside the Rectory, Sister James goes immediately to Sister Aloysius with her concerns.    Meanwhile, Father Flynn wants the school to become more progressive, and reach-out more to their congregation. His philosophy is in direct opposition, to the old-fashioned mentality of Sister Aloysius. She thinks that order and propriety, are more important than the more congenial values, espoused by Father Flynn.     After Sister James confronts Sister Aloysius with her terrible suspicions regarding Father Flynn, Sister Aloysius is 'certain' that Father Flynn is guilty. And she's determined to prove that the seemingly benign, compassionate Father Flynn, is truly a proverbial wolf-in-sheep's-clothing.    Meryl Streep should win an Oscar, for her stellar performance as Sister Aloysius. As a woman on the cusp of being a senior citizen, Meryl fit nicely into the role of the dignified, elder nun. Phillip Seymore Hoffman, was also a good choice to play Father Flynn. Hoffman portrays Father Flynn with just enough of a smarmy aura, to make the view believe that he could really be a devil-in-disguise.    Doubt is a deep, and moving drama. It's an intelligent film, that makes the viewer question their own assumptions about human nature. I highly recommend it, especially for Meryl Streep fans.
B002MW50KO|4.0|If you are a true Dylan fan this Christmas CD was great.   His voice is going gravelly and the arrangements are a little hocky but you gotta love Dylan for being Dylan.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|This is total rubbish. It doesn't even feel like a James Bond Film. Craig, IMO, doesn't fit the bill. This film is so overburdened with Political Correctness, it's intolerable. This film would have been a total bomb if it had to stand alone (without the JB genre to back it up); which is the only thing that kept it afloat, at the box-office, IMO. Christ, I watched Octopussy after watching this atrocity and was so glad to see such wondrous things as Maurice Binder's Title Sequences, Pre-Title Sequences that were actually believable and had actual stunt work, and the beautiful and dynamic music of John Barry (which in this sad excuse for a JB film, only arrived at the end credits - yes, I know, attributed to Monty Norman, but everyone knows Barry actually wrote the James Bond Theme). Anyway, this movie reflects the current state of the world - which is crap. \\"Cubby\\" must be rolling over in his grave; after all, he told Barbara and Michael not to screw it up - that is, the recipe for JB. Apparently and most ostensibly they did. R.I.P. James Bond. You're dead if the rest of your movies continue in this vein.
B0026P3G12|5.0|WOW!  Susan did not disappoint!  Her first (one of many I hope) CD is fantastic.  All beautifully arranged and beautifully sung covers of wonderful songs.  Not a bad one in the bunch!  Her style is authentic and her journey is remarkable.  How can you NOT like her?  While I was surprised to see traditional hymns in the song list, I was stunned at how her feeling about those songs and their meaning shone through every word.  Thank you, Susan, for the wonderful Christmas gift of YOU and your AMAZING voice.
B002VECMAY|5.0|Son of acclaimed director/producer Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Jason Reitman was born into a life of filmmaking. Even his first kiss took place in front of the camera during a scene of his father's movie, Kindergarten Cop.  After launching a career of his own with the critically acclaimed films, Thank You for Smoking and Juno, Reitman is quickly establishing himself as one of the most talented and unique directors working today. None of his films follow any of the conventional Hollywood formulas; they tackle real-life issues head-on in a smart and genuine fashion, yet are always tagged with his dry and witty sense of humor. With Up in the Air, only his third film, Jason Reitman seems to already be at the top of his game.<br /><br /> George Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, whose job is to be, more or less, the bearer of bad news. His company employs him to fly around the country and lay off workers for companies who are too afraid to do it themselves. He also, on occasion, is hired as a motivational speaker where he preaches his message that the only way live life is to void yourself of all relationships and emotional attachments.  They are, as he puts, \\"the heaviest components of your life.\\"<br /><br />Being on the road for over 300 days of the year, Ryan practices what he preaches. He has mastered the art of flying and manages to have little possessions outside of his suitcase and his only people he stays in contact with are his sisters, but even talking with them is a rare occurrence. He recognizes names and faces of flight attendants, but the small talk with them on a flight or a one-night stand in a hotel are the extent of his interactions with people.<br />Ryan soon finds himself challenged by an up and coming employee, Natalie (Anna Kendrick) who has created and easier and more efficient method for firing people that would essential make his position obsolete. He also meets a lady friend along the way (Vera Farmiga) who is essentially a female version of him and seems to be the first person in a long time he actually connects to. Both of them force him to reflect upon his life and make him question whether not one can go on in this world without forming any serious relationships.<br /><br />One of the many things that make this film so great is the remarkable on-screen chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga. It is so natural and effortless that one can only hope that this isn't the last time we see them work together. Each of their performances here are near-locks for Oscar nominations. Reitman's directing is spot-on, as well. He seems confident and assured as ever behind the camera. To make a film this good so early in his career shows limitless potential as a director.  An Oscar for Best Director seems inevitable for him at some point.<br /><br />Despite originally being written years earlier, other projects prevented him from releasing this until now. Ironically enough, this delay may have helped the film out, as its release comes during one of the worst economic downturns in American history. This film will no doubt hit home for anyone who has last his or her job recently or has had a loved that's suffered a similar fate.<br /><br />With a cast of A-list actors each at the top of their game, and a director who knows exactly what to do with them, Up in the Air proves to be a perfect reflection of the current social and political climate in America and is easily one the best pictures to be released this year, of not the best. Jason Reitman may only be 32 years old, but he may have just created his masterpiece.<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan (DoTheRightReview.com)to be the first person in a long time he actually connects to.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|I was disappointed in the quality of Megadeth albums for a long time (1999-2007).  I started to have hope a couple years ago when United Abominations came out.  Now we have Endgame, which is a great listen.  From start to finish it holds up to their previous thrash gems.  The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is the song \\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go...\\" it has the same riff from \\"Tears in a Vial\\" (...System Has Failed), and no one needs a reminder of that song or album.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|It took long enough to get a new Star Trek movie, and they hit a home run.  I look forward to additional movies with this cast!
0553212443|5.0|I give this five stars as much for its compact form as its literary value. To write a compelling story in 300 pages is difficult, but certainly possible; to weave a complex tale in under 100 requires much greater skill. Dickens does just that, drawing you in with a sparseness of prose that is wonderful. Over-explanation has been excised, and we the reader benefit.<br /><br />Having seen at least five variations on this story, I was surprised at just how simple the source material was. Clean, clear, subtle, and leaving far more to imagination than description, this was a wonderful Christmas read. What else is there to say? It's Dickens in under 100 pages; this is not to be missed.
B00000F214|5.0|Spacey has concocted a nice little mystery.  It flows nicely and keeps one's interest without overtaxing one's mental abilities.  It is convoluted, and has a sort of Hitchcock style surprise ending, but doesn't really require your full attention, unless you try to out-sleuth the detectives trying to untangle the convolutions
B000F5GNX8|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A wonderfully funny movie for people who have seen too many movies and know every single cliche, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is often accused of being \\"too clever by half\\" but let me be the one to assure you that its cleverness and wit are distinct virtues; if you want a smart, amusing movie that'll have you laughing out loud and quoting it endlessly to your friends, watch this hilarious comedy.    3/4
B001OQCV60|4.0|Dropped into my nearly capacity-filled theater today and checked out Holmes, a story modernized and reimagined from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's imaginings some hundred years back.  Wow, what a movie!  But Director Guy Ritchie's version may not sit well will dyed-in-the-wool Sherlockians!<br /><br />The non-stop action was really top notch.  In fact the action was a bit too non-stop.  We're introduced to a woman whom Sherlock has some \\"history\\" but that history is only hinted at, not explored, which I think is a weak point in the film.  Without giving too much away, Moriarity (Holmes' arch-enemy in the novels and the Rathbone films) doesn't play much of a part, though he's always in the background.<br /><br />Mysticism:  The bad guy is a mystic, running a cult of blood and sacrifice, who has plans for world domination.  In fact, one of Blackstone's first acts is to survive a hanging, kill everyone in Parliment and then move on to \\"take back the Colonies\\".<br /><br />Fighting:  Holmes is great in analyzing where to hit and what to break on someone's face!  Powers of deduction will satisfy any Holmes' fan.<br /><br />Explosions and pugilism:  Yeah, there's boxing, drinking, smoking a pipe and an explosion or two.  The CGI Industrial English background and Tower Bridge are realistic but not overly done.<br /><br />Watson:  He wants to move out and marry Mary, a woman that Holmes figures out just by looking at her, which earns him a face full of wine!  Watson is a smart guy, not this foil that is bounced off of from Holmes as the old movies were.  In fact, he joins in the fighting in great style.<br /><br />I found the musical score fast-paced and mood inspired.<br /><br />Bad points:  Not enough plot, really.  Lots of character development of the main characters and lots of loose ends are tied up in the end.  But more story would have been nicer!<br /><br />A must-see for the end of 2009!

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|We really enjoyed this in the theater and it translates well to home blu-ray. The only downside is that it wasn't made available in 3D.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Great movie. I loved it. Russell Crowe is great in this movie. I love it. I would recommend this movie to you
6304698623|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Though A Little Princess sometimes veers too much towards stupid-kid-cinema (e.g. awful reaction shots of little girls snickering while some evil adult gets his/her comeuppance) it's a pretty good adaptation of the classic children's story that (mainly) resists amping up the drama and is directed with a deft hand by Cuaron; it's not great but it's a family movie that won't make adults reach for the nearest handgun.    3/4
0143116371|5.0|I was suprised at the size of this book. It's on the smaller size but very thick and inside I found so many great fashion photographs. It really made me want to dress up and travel the world! I especially loved the photos shot in Paris--so stylish! Overall, this is a great purchase and I am so glad to add it to my collection.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|The Ultimate Collection Box was really worth getting - even tho I already had almost all of the songs and the DVD. There are some previously unpublished songs included and some absolute pearls among them. The booklet is great too! And all this is packed in beautiful covers. Me like!
B0002Y69NG|2.0|Overall the package looked brand new. But once I got to the 3 rd movie it skipped a lot. The CD was scratched. Even with cleaning did not help. I would have prefered the package being a little worn and the movies be perfect.
B00168OIOE|5.0|This is quite a value, especially if you don't already own the DVD. This is one of Pixar's best and the extra content and extra sharp blu-ray images are worth the investment.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I got this movie on preorder before it came out and was able to get it for a Christmas gift. My brother likes action packed movies and this was the one of the year. Brad Pitt is hilarious in in this movie.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I think this is one of the best comedies ever.  My son is a computer geek and he loves it.  Sheldon (Jim Parsons) brings geekieness to a new level. A well made comedy with few weak spots.    Also got a great post black-friday price for it at Amazon.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Having been a fan of Quentin Tarrantino since Pulp Fiction, I had to see his latest. I really liked it though I think I was under the misconception that this was a comedy of sorts. While there are some comedic elements, it's really not. However, it is an enjoyable film and I loved the ending.

B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD quality was as good as any CD on the market. The producer had Susan Boyle sing a variety of songs to show her range. I was well satisfied and I believe she will make other CD's that I would purchase. [...].
B002T9H2L0|2.0|I waited until the movie came out on DVD and wish I had waited longer....like forever. \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" was typical Tarantino with blood and violence and little else to offer. Two and a half hours was way too long and the story was predictable in the extreme. Brad Pitt's character was certainly interesting but, not up to his performance in \\"Snatch\\". In this case I think the previews for \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" were better than the movie and it will be a long time before I buy a Tarantino film again....if ever. This movie was not even up to his efforts with \\"Kill Bill\\". I suggest he spend some time with Guy Ritchie and learn how to produce a story with a more interesting and less predictable plot and characters with more depth. I'm at a loss to understand why Tarantino and his films enjoy such a great reputation especially after seeing this, his latest effort.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|A bit repetitious in the character morality lessons but that's just from my adult perspective.     For Kindle Users:  Recommendation - if want a fabulous fully illustration version, mobileread has it. Note, Amazon keeps editing out where elsewhere to get this. If they do it again, the alternate site begins with m, ends with d, and has ten letters in its name.    Do a search for Little Women illustrated and look for the Mobi/PRC version posted Oct 25, 2009 by richough3 - it's listed as the 5th item down from the top.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Got this for Christmas. Picture quality great, to go from VHS to blu-ray BIG difference. It's small compact in the skinning cases boxed in together. It's all 6 Star Trek Movies with lots of extras on each disk, including commentary. I don't own the DVDs so I don't know if it's all new stuff, but for me it is. The 7th disk (which claims to be new never before seen)is an interview hosted by Whooppie Goldberg with Picard, Riker, Kirk, and Spok (forgive my mis-spelling) I found part 1 a little boring with parts 2 and 3 more humorous.  So for the advid fan you may already own all 6 movies, if you currently own the VHS I'd recommending up grading to this set on Blue-ray. If you have been holding out then this is the set to get. If you already have the DVDs then you might be fine (you aren't missing much with the 7th disk).
B002BSHXJA|4.0|What can I say,  if you love the Beatles go for it!   I saw them twice,  Candlestick Park and the Cow Palace in San Francisco.  Nothing like the real deal!  The Mono Set is the way to go for the experienced listener.  I was a recording engineer for many years.  The fidelity and mix are clean and present these masterpieces in all their glory.  Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!  One suggestion,  do a little \\"A\\"-\\"B\\" testing,  listen to the mono mix and then play a stereo version.  Nuf said.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|So sad when L Staley passed away, but the new A in C singer is fab and does an amazing job allowing the band to continue with their signature sound.  First half of this disc is great, gets a bit monotonous in the middle, and then turns back around in track 10.  I don't think you'll be disappointed if you are a fan of this group.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|In Blu Ray, the picture quality is a little bit better then you can hope for from a standard DVD, but much better then you'll see on the ole video tape format.  In this Anniversary Edition, I enjoyed seeing the extended version and the scenes that were edited out.  The extended scenes are worth the price.  Same excellent music, and dancing. If you're a Dirty Dancing fan, you'll love this edition.
B001OQCV60|4.0|I haven't read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories in probably 25 years, although as a teenager, I read them all.  I was also an avid fan of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce versions of the stories.  (Although I'll state right now, the Rathbone films varied a great deal plot-wise from Doyle...however, the presentation of Holmes which he presented are probably the most widely accepted \\"visions\\" of Holmes even today.)  Regardless of the long absence from my reading schedule, I certainly remember enough to know that Holmes purists will have a difficult time with much of Guy Ritchie's unmistakably modern take on the character in SHERLOCK HOLMES.    However, if one can get past that, SHERLOCK HOLMES is a very enjoyable Holiday season entertainment.  It is NOT a great film, nor has it particularly aspired to be.  It exists to entertain exhausted family audiences looking for a break from the gluttony of Christmas-time.  It exists to be a hit that will spawn sequels.  And taken in that context, it is probably a better film than it needed to be.    The Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) & Watson (Jude Law) in this film are a much more physical bunch than we remember them.  Holmes is an excellent pugilist.  In fact, there are some excellent early scenes when Holmes is in a fist-fight and we hear his inner narrative as he puts together a logical plan for physically defeating his enemy.  It's a fairly clever way to mix the \\"elementary, my dear Watson\\" cerebral side of Holmes that we all know with the earthier qualities Ritchie and company want for him in this film.  On the other hand, Watson is young, dashing and quite smart himself.  This is actually nice, because so many films present Watson as a bit of a bumbling fool.  Conan Doyle did NOT present him this way...the man was a medical doctor after all.      The plot of the film IS a bit disappointing, because it feels like warmed-over DA VINCI code type stuff.  There is a secret society (not called the freemasons, but might as well be) that dabbles in science and magic and believes it can combine those to wield influence on the political world.  Naturally, one evil guy (Lord Blackwood, played by Ritchie favorite Mark Strong) has violent, nasty plants of his own to not only take over leadership of the society, but of England itself.  With everything from NATIONAL SECURITY to ANGELS & DEMONS relying on nefarious secret societies, I sure wish they could have come up with something else for SHERLOCK HOLMES.  The fun of the film is the verbal wit, the striking visual imaginings of London and many of the performances.  The writers apparently felt that a big-budget HOLMES required a James Bond villain, and to me it was actually a distraction because if felt SO very tired and unoriginal.    Rachel McAdams also makes a rather wan appearance as the one criminal (apparently a first-rate con artist) who \\"got away,\\" but is also the one woman who has stolen his heart.  He will actually make bad decisions because of her.  I get the idea of giving  Holmes a love interest...but the film misses the fact that Holmes & Watson are really a \\"buddy team\\" and that Holmes mostly loves Watson (platonically, of course).  If Downey & McAdams had generated some serious heat, perhaps it would have worked...but her character feels somewhat perfunctory, and as much as I usually like McAdams, there just isn't much for her to do here.    But the film has many strengths as well.  As I mentioned, it has a strong visual sense.  Extensive CGI is used to create sweeping vistas of a mid-19th century city.  We feel the dirt, the noise and the squalor.  And for the most part, the work is done very seamlessly and results in some moments that are quite lovely to look at.  There's a terrific scene set in a shipyard, where Holmes battles a very imposing bad guy.  They fight amongst a giant metal ship that is only partially constructed, and when all hell breaks loose, the combination of live action and CGI works very wellto create a highly original climax for the scene.  Later, there is a lengthy sequence of explosions, shown in slow motion that really shows all the craftsmen at their best.  Holmes & Watson are thrown about very convincingly!  A much later scene, set on a partially completed bridge across the Thames is less successful in creating a suspension of disbelief...the scope of what they are attempting is just too big for the viewer not to think \\"hey, that's all done on computer.\\"    And what of the core of the film, Holmes & Watson?  Well, Jude Law makes a very charming Watson.  He is exasperated with Holmes, yet clearly feels a strong bond with him and secretly enjoys their adventures, however inconvenient on his love life.  He's smart, sexy and suave.  While I don't know if Conan Doyle would ever have used \\"sexy\\" and \\"suave\\" to describe Watson, I think Ritchie's take on the character isn't actually too far off the mark.  And Downey is always a pleasure, even if his Holmes feels a little unlike the guy we know from the books.  He certainly doesn't don the deerstalker and the huge pipe.  He smokes a \\"normal\\" pipe and tends to costume himself in a variety of clothing.  But Downey lets us see the sharp mind that sees and analyzes every detail almost immediately.  Holmes comes across as just a tiny bit of a savant, a \\"Rain Man\\".  He talks to himself a great deal in a mumbly voice that he clearly can't stop.  He has difficulty caring about being socially correct.  Yet he's not a simplistic character.  He CAN care for people...he just expects them to accept him exactly as he is and understand that he can't change and wouldn't if he could.  Downey is a very smart actor, and so in many ways, this role is well suited to him.  He doesn't wear the part quite as well as he wore the role of IRON MAN, but he's still fun.    If you're looking for escapist entertainment, and understand that for this film, great \\"art\\" was not the goal, then I think you should be well entertained by this excellently crafted, energetic SHERLOCK HOLMES.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I've heard a lot of music in my 64 years and find Radiohead's In Rainbows to be one of the most tastefully creative CD's I've ever heard. They don't overwhelm you with their creativity but offer it in dabs like a painter and his brush. You never know what to expect. I've always liked new experimental sounds and this one is quite inventive. They create new moods with their sounds and I've become a fan. I'm checking out their other CDs too.

0307277887|3.0|Now, I might be biased since I got hooked on the show first and then decided to read the book, but I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. I can see why they would want to make a show based on the book, the premise is interesting and new and the story kept my attention, but the whole time I was reading it I was thinking the changes they made for the show was much better. The story is about a blood spatter analyst who is also a serial killer, but follows a code of only killing murderers. He becomes intrigued by a killer who starts leaving wrapped, bloodless body parts, seemingly to get Dexter's attention. As far as the book is concerned it was alright, but definitely didn't leave me wanting to read the rest in the series, but I probably will just to compare them to the show and to see how the series was originally intended. As far as comparing the book with the show, I kept thinking \\"I wonder if Jeff Lindsay watched the show and was thinking, 'I wish I had thought of that!!' \\" I think the show is much more creative (having Deb date the Ice Truck Killer!) and the characters were much more likable and relatable, where as in the book I never really connected with any of the characters, especially Dexter. All in all, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book, unless a friend wanted to compare it to the show.
0316779237|4.0|Classic Sedaris!  The first vignette is the best, I even burst out loud reading \\"Season's Greeting to our Friends and Family.\\"  It is perfect if you think your family is screwed up, they do not really measure up.  Sedaris moves on to what is actually an uplifting, yet disturbing act of charity in his short entitled \\" Dinah, the Christmas Whore.\\"<br /><br />After those first two, the remainder of the book takes a familiar Sedaris dark turn, especially the disturbing look at competitive \\"giving\\".  You will probably still enjoy it, but the final chapters seem to sputter out compared to the first couple of chapters.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown has yet again created a work of art that makes the reader really think... fantastic!
B002L9N4DS|5.0|So much better seeing it the second time; I also had the advantage of a blueray player and the picture and sound is excellent. I mainly purchased it because of music I have heard over the years and couldn't find the source anywhere. After much searching and finding the answer I was amazed to find it to be the Forest Gump Suite by A. S. (don't want to go back and look as it is on my iPod) The music quietly plays an integral part.  I was also quite surprised to see that the movie has as timely a meaning pertaining to  the economy and government now as it did then. However, it seemed to have more meaning to me this time.   The more things change the more they remain the same.   I didn't have to buy it it blue ray but thought I would to see how much of a difference there was.  Still won't know unless I rent a regular, but updated, version so that digital will be factored into the clarity and possible the sound.
0061914177|4.0|Crush It! is about turning your personal passion into a career. Gary Vaynerchuk took his father's local liquor store and turned the $4 million business into a $50 million business. After which he created a wine blog, Wine Library TV, where he discovered the power of Internet sales. In the book Gary shares his experience and advice for using Twitter and Facebook to monetize your passion.<br /><br />Crush It! contains virtual no new information but Gary Vaynerchuk's enthusiasm comes out in the book making Crush It! extremely engaging. The book is written in a step-by-step format that allows anyone to follow his advice. Vaynerchuk believes that the Internet makes it possible for anyone to make a living by turning what they love into a personal brand. I'm less optimistic that everyone can turn a passion, like photography or horseback riding, into a career. Such an event would flood the market place and change the price elasticity of ad revenue or service fees in the market sector. I believe people will be able to turn a passion or hobby into a part time income if not a full career. Overall, Crush It! is a good book that contains valid information in an engaging way.

In any case, I hope that her advisers will protect her from over-exposure.  Susan is a private person, and we all need to respect that.

B000KJU182|5.0|Billy Budd (Terence Stamp) is a young sailor who is drafted from a merchant vessel onto a British fighting ship (HMS Avenger) in pursuit of the French navy in 1797.  His new colleagues take an instant shine to young Billy, who is extremely naive and kind.  He has a way about him that charms everyone on board - everyone, that is, except for the Master d'Arms, John Claggart (Robert Ryan).  Claggart is an evil man, fond of harshly punishing his men for minor or imagined offenses.  Despite his animosity toward Billy, Claggart finds himself slowly being drawn in by the young man, which infuriates him all the more.  He sets about trying to destroy Billy.<br /><br />Peter Ustinov, who plays the patient and understanding Captain Vere, also co-wrote, directed, and produced \\"Billy Budd,\\" which is based on the posthumous novel by Herman Melville.  The story is a classic battle between good and evil, and Ustinov handles every aspect of the story with subtlety and sensitivity.  Key to the movie is the astounding debut performance by Stamp.  In lesser hands, Billy could end up as a simpleton or too angelic (or a charming flirt).  Stamp manages to create a three-dimensional character - one who chooses to focus on the good in people and situations; Billy's actions are wholly believable because of the fine balance that Stamp finds between the character's many qualities.<br /><br />I'd say that Stamp's performance, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, is as good as any I've seen in a 1960s movie.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I dont know about others, but I love Keira Knightly! This movie has been done with others playing that role, but Knightly takes it to another level, completely. She is truly Elizabeth Bennett. If you like movies about the rich and richer, you will love this movie. The music score is enlightening and many of the scenes are set in a richer person's house. All the characters blend quite well to make this movie a must see event. The Bennett family is interesting, funny, and sometimes annoying but true to the time and circumstance of their position in life. Watch and engulf yourself in all it has to offer.
B001MS7IBS|4.0|I liked the show, but ultimately don't have much to say about it.  This is essentially another X-Files series with a seemingly bigger budget and more eccentric, yet less admirable/likable principle characters.  The storylines are a little more scientific than Chris Carter's conspiracy series.  I don't know if the science has any reality behind it, but it's presented believably enough.  And the ongoing plotlines, so far, appear to be more sophisticated than the basic \\"government cover-up\\", separating the show with at least the sense of a fresh atmosphere, even if it's really not all that fresh and doesn't have the charm of its predecessor.<br /><br />Warner did a fine job on the BDs, aside from the studios apparent apathy for fan outcry asking for lossless audio.  But as the sound design was intended for TV and not likely as sophisticated or as well recorded as a feature film, maybe it's not that big of a deal.  I guess we'll never know.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|Entertaining. Everything you've come to expect from a Hollywood rendition of a comic book. Decent special effects.
B002TIWQNK|4.0|I've been a PetHead (Pet Shop Boys fan) since \\"Please\\" and I have bought every album and a lot of remixes, singles, etc.  I haven't been crazy about all of them, but always pleasantly surprised at how Neil and Chris can change their approach and sound, and yet always remain essentially the Pet Shop Boys.<br /><br />I first heard \\"My Girl\\" on the radio in Toronto, and searched in vain for the recording: Nice to see two versions here, but one would have sufficed (the \\"our house\\" mix is just a longer version of the single - but I love the pun in the remix title.) The Coldplay cover was a nice surprise in their last concert - and it really works well in the studio version.  And, of course, I had a copy of \\"It doesn't often snow at Christmas\\" - but I really like this version - basically the same as 12 years ago, but \\"tighter\\". The bells are perfect (and remind me of Dr. Seuss...)  My only disappointment is \\"All over the world\\" - the Nutcracker music works for this album of course, but I prefer the version on the Yes album.
0307588335|2.0|The book is a tale of the infamous collapse of Lehman Brothers. The author Lawrence McDonald is former vice president of distress debt and convertible securities at Lehman Brothers. He was at the firm for the boom and bust years from 2004-2008.     When I received the book I was very excited to start reading the book, curious about an insider view on the mistakes that caused the collapse of the huge investment bank. I normally am not a very picky person. I like most books if they are informative and decently written. However, the book overall was a big disappointment in my eyes. I was looking forward to a book that would describe in depth the role Lehman brothers played in the sub prime meltdown and the actions of management that led to the biggest bankruptcy in history.     The big is more a biography of the author who only spent four years at the firm, rather than a tale of the inner workings of Lehman Brothers. The first quarter of the book had nothing to do with the firm, instead it was a detailed account of the author's personal life. This included tales of the author's career as a successful pork chop salesperson( I kid you not). Once the book got into details of McDonald's career at Lehman Brothers it was still a disappointment to me. The author tried to make himself to be the hero who attempted to save Lehman Brothers. He claims that he knew for many years that the mortgage department was taking huge risks and he tried to balance that out by shorting stock in lenders, and shipbuilders. He glorifies his department in the distress debt and convertible bond and coverable bonds department for attempting to rescue Lehman Brothers from its mess.     Richard Fuld and Joseph Gregory(the president and COO) were made out to be darth vader like figures aloof from the rest of the firm, and completely naive to the huge risks the firm was undertaking. He claims that Fuld did not have the firms best interests in mind, and actions taken by Fuld such as overpaying to buy leveraged hedge funds were done out of jealousy to the success of Blackstone and Goldman Sachs. I do not know if the way he presented the picture is close to reality or not. However, it smacked of self righteousness, arrogance and an attempt to make himself and his department heroes while making Fuld and Gregory into the bad guys.     The biggest disappointment was the end of the book. I hoped that the end of the book filled with exciting details of the final days before the collapse of Lehman Brothers would redeem the rest of the book. However, the author was laid off by the firm in March 2008 several months before Lehman declared bankruptcy. His details of the final hours of Lehman Brothers were based on his former colleges who were still working at the firm. Although, he was able to provide some good detail into what went on behind the scenes I felt it was inadequate. Being at the firm during those days as opposed to hearing second hand is like the difference between storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day and being in your unit based in the safety of the US, hearing accounts on the phone from fellow soldiers.     There is a great book to be written on the subject. A tale that focused on Credit Default Swaps, Collateralized Debt Obligations and Lehman's overall role in subprime lending and securitizartion market would be an interesting and informative book for both regular Americans and investors alike. I look forward to that book coming out in the future.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up with TOS &  at first I didn't like the story line. But after I finished watching it & the ending cleared up the story line. That is the New movie is a alternate time line.    This could be a great series. If you're a fan of the old series & don't think you will like it go get it. You will like it.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|Just so I don't get stuck reviewing the content instead of the actual dvd set, I will start with a nod to the packaging, which is just cool enough to make me feel like I'm super hip and not some under-entertained single mom with not much else to do in the evenings...yes! The show itself is just smart enough to be engaging and just dumb enough to remind me that it is, after all, a network tv show. But, again, the fact that it goes on and on and on over many seasons is great for me, because I have nothing else to do until someone asks me out on a date. And when they do, I won't be able to go because I'll be watching \\"Lost\\" and admiring the transparent slipcover to the cool foldout dvd case thingy.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|If you love watching the season when it was on TV this is the best way to experience the series. Plus, this is the final season so this is a way to keep the L Word around. It is definitely worth every penny.

B0007TKNCY|5.0|What a shame that the world isn't like this movie. Silly, harmless people dressed in beautiful cloths caught up in crazy situations. Nobody hurt, nobody harmed and the lovers united. And what costumes! Even in black and white the gowns worn by Miss Hepburn are stunning. Pure escapeism!
0316789704|5.0|This book has opened up a whole new world for my 8 year old.  She loves to draw and after just a few minutes with this book she was delighted at all the new things she was learning.  Thank you for sharing your gift with the world Ed Emberley.

0307341550|1.0|honestly think that this is one of the two worst books I've ever read.   I had to give it one star, because the site wouldn't let me give it 0   or negative stars.
0307454541|5.0|I was apprehensive reading SHANTARAM and I was so wrong.  It's the foreign influences that usually throws me. Now THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO presents the same issues, a Swedish story.  Again I was wrong.  This is one of the best novels I have read this year.  A wonderful intricate mystery that is amazingly detailed. Stieg Larsson has past away or I would tell him, thanks.  I give a lot of 5 ratings in AMAZON but this book is a 5 anywhere.  Looking forward to the next book in this trilogy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0307454541|5.0|This is such an amazing book.  Once you start-it's hard to put it down.  I have given 3 copies of this book as gifts.  The people are of various ages and sexes-but, I think they will all be enthralled.
0385504209|5.0|This book swept the reading public by storm a few years ago and created quite a furor. Several articles and TV specials were created to discuss the veracity of the book (or lack thereof.) There is even a mock book, \\"The DaVinci Cod.\\"<br /><br />The book is an incredible page turner and the author paints a vivid picture while injecting some of his own weltanschauung into his characters sayings and actions. The important thing to bear in mind is that this is a work of fiction.<br /><br />Hours of enjoyable reading are guaranteed...
B002VKE0XA|5.0|I thought this movie was exactly what it promised it would be, if you seen a preview for this movie that showed footage of the movie, and you were dissapointed by it, then i dont know what the hell your problem is, but maybe you shouldnt build things up IN YOUR OWN HEAD.<br /><br />Also i am a pretty big movie fanatic, and a huge music nerd, and i love to come on here and write reviews about how awesome things are, or how some stuff isnt that great, but seriously, look at everyone taking sides and arguing over if this movie is good or not, its an opinion, and its a movie, just enjoy it, I hate movies too but i dont go around like \\"F you cause you like M. Night Shamahamahams The Village!\\" its even funnier that people dislike movies so much that they have to tell people NOT TO SEE IT, No, dont see it, you dont need an opinion of this movie you think-for-yourselfer.<br /><br />If you like suspenceful movies where you dont see alot happen but ALOT DOES HAPPEN, like blair witch or something like that, you will probably dig this too, if you need Blood, Mayhem, Monsters, Unbelieveable Rubber suited creatures (which is all also good stuff) go watch buffy the vampire slayer or Land of the dead, or dead alive or something
1401323820|3.0|I was beyond excited when I heard about this book. I know that it is completely gimmicky, but the marketing genius behind it is fantastic: release the fictional novel in the popular ABC police comedy/drama Castle as a real one. Talk about score -not only does the novel already have a built-in fan base as well as already-existing hype and advertising (the show itself) but it fits in with the nature of the show perfectly. The popularity of Heat Wave (it was a New York Times Bestseller!) shows just how much America is in love with Rick Castle.    ABC even went to great lengths to make the book seem \\"real.\\" Nathan Fillion's picture is on the back cover of the book as \\"Richard Castle\\" complete with bio. According to a friend in LA who attended, ABC held a book signing of Heat Wave, and Fillion appeared in character (from what I've heard, he was hilarious).    I wouldn't say that I was disappointed in this book though -just not impressed.     The good: the story is fast-paced and Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook are easily recognizable as Detective Kate Beckett and Castle (come on, the guy's name is `Rook'). The writing can seem a little elementary at times, but fits into the pulpy, suspense-thriller novel genre a la James Patterson perfectly. The novel also allows ABC to do some things with the Castle \\"universe\\" that they can't do on broadcast TV -like curse or include little adult comments from/about characters. While Heat's character is a little more fantasized version of Beckett, I thought Heat Wave helped give some additional insight into Beckett's character.    The bad: while Heat Wave was shown as a massive novel in the series, it's only 200 pages. I felt like it was simply too short and just read as an extended episode of the series (even though it plays like a movie in your mind when you read it)-I was hoping that it would go more in-depth and give more insight into characters and situations. I also think that this book wouldn't be able to stand-alone very well without the TV series. Heat and Rook feel like relatively flat characters without previous knowledge of Beckett or Castle to back them up.    I wouldn't say it was a horrible book, but I was just looking for more. In the Castle cannon this book was meant to launch a new character and a new series, but in reality it tends to feel like an extra element tacked onto the TV show.
0786868724|5.0|\\"In the beginning, there was a question.<br />\\"In the end, the question gets answered.\\" - Mitch Albom<br /><br />I just finished reading Have a Little Faith by Mitch Albom.  I'm not sure why I picked up this novel to read. Perhaps I was bored and needed something to do,  perhaps I was looking for something to feel a void; or perhaps, just perhaps, I needed a little bit of faith.<br /><br />Have a Little Faith is an amazing story about a Rabbi, a Christian Minister, and a man with very little faith.  This book will take you through an incredible journey with a beautiful message in the end .  I felt inspired after reading this book.  Sometimes in life I forget to look up and thank the man upstairs.  I forget to thank him for another day, another blessing, another lesson learned.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone from any religion.  Funny, I'm a Black-American woman who has been dating a Jewish man for two years.  I often wondered how our two different religions could mix.  This book taught me a little something- regardless of religion, \\"faith is employed similarly.\\"  No matter our beliefs and religion, our faith is tied to the same God. This book will help you to find comfort in believing in something bigger than herself.<br /><br />Keep the Faith my friends, and go purchase this book!
0439023483|5.0|You wont be able to put this book down. I dare you to read chapter one and not be hooked. It has a seemingly horrific premise, but it is dealt with in a creative, satisfying, and responsible way. Both teens and adults will enjoy this book.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Now don't get me wrong, this was a good MOVIE, but it was not a good BOND movie.  This and Casino Royale both lacked certain elements that define a Bond movie: the hilarious, witty puns at the perfect moment, the womanizing, Moneypenny, Q, the get-out-of-any-situation-without-a-scratch element, the vodka martini.  The new Bond has some potential, but these movies don't give him the chance to become James Bond.  He's way too emotional and is (I hate to say it) a wimp!  He can barely survive the most basic fistfight or chase scene with anonymous henchmen.  He's become very feminine, and because of that I believe Bond in general is losing his appeal with his male audience, who used to look up to and idolize James Bond, the ultimate Ladies-Man and Man's-Man, or in other words, THE man.    By the way, I think Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond, who agrees?
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Magical, creative, suspenseful with most of your time spent on the edge of your seat or you hitting the person next to you, mind-blowing special and visual effects, and it still leaves room for heartwarming moments!

I wanted it to end differently, as did my friend who was also reading it but it was good. We are really looking forward to the movie coming out! This was my first Nicholas Sparks book and I am looking forward to reading the rest. Next one on the list is \\"The Last Song\\" a movie is coming out for that one too =)
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I have many of the Bee Gees releases, but the quality of this compilation surpass all of them.  The DVD is great to have seeing them from the early days to their latest videos prior to Maurice passing. I highly recommend adding this to your collection.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I was a little disappointed with the last few movies.  I wasn't sure if it was because I had gotten older and they no longer sparked interest, or if they were just getting worse.  Either way, the Half-Blood Prince seemed to find a solution to both those possibilities.  The movie was not only put together really well, but it also has a lot of appeal to an older audience.  Maybe not to people over forty, but for those out there like me, who were 11 when the first movie came out, you can bet that Harry Potter 6 will bring it back home for you!
B00000DQSV|5.0|Some hardcore fans might want to burn me at the stake for this, but I personally consider Roger and Andy to be the weakest members of the band and their absence helped create what I consider one of the best albums the band has ever released.    While there are certainly stronger songs than others on Notorious, I can listen to this album start to finish and it just flows. I often put Hold Me, Notorious, Skin Trade, Meet El Presidente, or So Mislead on repeat while I'm working on something at my desk. It's a great album.    I remember when I first heard this album I was shocked at \\"Rogers\\" drumming skills after hearing how simplistic the drumming on the earlier albums were. Turns out it isn't Roger. While he certainly isn't a bad drummer, he just holds it down and doesn't have any real chops per se. The session drumming here is awesome and fits perfectly with Johns relatively busy basslines.    Nicks keys and Simon's vocals are excellent as well. The production is typical 80's, lot's of reverb and slightly low on bottom end, but I have absolutely no complaints.    This is a fantastic album that has received constant rotation in my collection since the late 80's.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|I'm really disappointed. I bought this album in the US even before it was available in Germany. I think I wasted the money: extremly odd guitar sounds, an exhausted voice, really uninspired songwriting, exerted lyrics - and there is no continuous basic sound of the whole album. Where is the sound of John Mayer? Where is the sound of a John Mayer Band? Too much intention and a poor result. What a pity!
B0026P3G12|4.0|Really enjoyable CD with good variety of songs. My only complaint is it was too short, would have loved at least four more songs, some more show tunes, as well as some semi classical and religious. Next one should include at least 16 songs!

B0000009TT|4.0|We all know the story of Lather. Zappa had planned this as a six album set in the late-70s, but was in court with Warner Brothers, who chopped the major work into [[ASIN:B0000009SU Sleep Dirt]], [[ASIN:B0000009ST Studio Tan]] and [[ASIN:B0000009SS Zappa in New York]]. Lather finally emerged as a three CD set in 1996, three years after Zappa's death.<br /><br />So, how is it? Well, this sure is massive to assimilate: there is classical, jazz, hard rock, and lots and lots of sub-genres of each. \\"Bogus Pomp,\\" the opener, is so rich, it is filling enough to be an album. \\"Spider Of Destiny,\\" \\"Navel Aviation In Art,\\" \\"Punky's Whips.\\" have this same density.<br /><br />Zappa had of course harnessed ambition before: [[ASIN:B0000009SB 200 Motels]]], [[ASIN:B0000009S1 Uncle Meat]], but never with the tickness or diversity of Lather. Even if you know the 70s fragments, Lather can take months to chew.<br /><br />Also remember this was attended for vynal. One to five cuts per side, a break, then on to the next. At seventy plus minutes per CD, this is a major undertaking for the listener. Pacing is important for a multi-disc, and Lather mskes the Beatles White Album seem like an EP.<br /><br />Still, this set does, to a huge degree, encompass the massive musical reach of Zappa, and taken piece by piece will provide revlelations about many corners of his approach.<br /><br />This monolith may not be essential to understanding Zappa, but may be one of the best single works to do so.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|As usual, Streep doesn't disappoint.  This actress is undoubtedly the best of all time in her field.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the priest was excellent as well.  Well worth watching.
0307473465|4.0|Naturally I wouldn´t critizice the quallity of the novel itself, as the film, it´s a masterpiece, though I was hoping to have a fine printed version of the book and not this very ordinary booklet with the cheapest paper and print quallity you could ever find. A total disapointment on that sense. Not recomended for collectors.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book was so amazimg and touching! As a teen reader i felt this book was extremely encouraging. Anyone who says teens should not read this is wromg because this book encourages both people who know someone who is suicidal and people who are suicidal. This book encourages teens to reach out to thier friends who are suicidal and it encourages sucidal teens to reach out to someone! So if you have the chance READ THIS BOOK!

Netrebko is as beautiful as her voice, and Villazón is powerful, funny, loving, and heartbreaking in turn. Every other member of the cast plays his/her role to perfection, and the direction is sublime.  I'll be watching and listening to this one many, many, many times.
0312570740|5.0|Rich began his commodity career working for Philipp Brothers, (now Phibro) - a part of Occidental Petroleum - before launching his own firm in 1974 with Pinkus Green and Alec Hackel. The new firm was to be called Marc Rich + Co AG. Rich is a Randian and was known for making large commodity deals on handshakes.<br /><br />Most international companies, including the Seven Sisters, had legitimate offshore entities to better manage their tax liability, among other reasons. So that Marc Rich + Co AG had several such entities should not have come as a surprise to any international commodity dealer.<br /><br />If not for an overzealous US Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, Rich undoubtedly would be in the United States. He was indicted for dealing with Iran during the hostage crisis. Yet, according to Ammann, each of the American Seven Sisters - through subsidiaries - were doing business with Iran all the while...obviously a double-standard.<br /><br />Giuliani, no stranger to the perp walk, saw an easy target and literally made his case. Giuliani got his political win in that he very publicly seized tens of millions of dollars in frozen assets in the US.<br /><br />However, he didn't drop the case as he often did after all the fanfare and press that he got BUT he didn't bring the case to trial either. Had he taken Rich through the court system and lost, he would have lost much political capital.<br /><br />This is a great book. You can hear a podcast I did with the author Daniel Ammann at my blog [....].
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|This movie is really gripping. You watch and you find yourself very intrigued in what you think is just an affair of an older woman and a much younger man.

This is now my fav Brad Pitt movie and all the actors in this film played their roles very well,  even Hitler was spot on.  The action was great, the effects were very well done and the realism was great, no corners cut here, honest and brutal.  Great story, great film and I hope to see more like this soon, awesome job!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|This movie is the best 3D movie I have ever seen. I went to see it 2 times in 2 days. I thought I could improve my viewing the second time around by sitting in different seats than the first time.  You might try sitting eye level and closer to the screen so it sort of envelopes you. The first time was awesome, the second time was outstanding.  I highly recommend this movie.

0765309408|5.0|This is a \\"Space Wars\\" novel that induces Giggles and some laughter from the reader. It respectfully lifts from the S.F. authors that I've been reading since my childhood in the 50s & 60s. Other reviews mentioned lots of those earlier Author's works.    Add Andre Norton's \\"Judgement on Janus \\" to the list... It is in there, too.    If you grew up waiting for Heinlein, Norton, Clement and Asimov to write their next books, Try this one.    Once you finish it, you'll debate getting his next one vs re-reading something that \\"Old Man's War\\" reminded you of.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Leonard Cohen's Live In London is an incredible Album in every way.  With a quiet salute of his hand and a warm smile he greets his audience with humor, recognition of their grasp of what he is about to perform and a humbleness that becomes a person who has lived hard and well in his 80 plus years.         Then the marvelous orchestra begins with individual muscians thrilling all of the audiance with their perfect skill and magic sounds.  Mesmorized we listen to the gravity of the words he sings and knowingly nod our understanding of all he is teaching us. The DVD album is the best I have seen and leaves all who see it indelible musing long after having watched the performances.         This performance by Leonard Cohen, his singers, (Manhattan Sisters of Mercy), and his outstanding Orchestra, is a magic musical experience you will play over and over again, marvaling at the total grasp of his muscianship.

1416562605|4.0|The way Aravind Adiga writes...its really a fantastic book. I finished it in two days.  This was a text my native Indian professor requested that we read prior to our departure to India for a study abroad course.  Her goal was to use this book as a way to introduce us to modern Indian culture prior to our arrival.  The writer brings such vivid imagery to mind that I feel like I already know what its like to be there before I've even been.

I only had a small time frame to give the dvd to them in person before i left the country to move back to the uk - and it came in plenty of time for me to do this. and they saw it and they loved it! and i earn brownie points for being a wonderful, kind and generous man! thank you Amazon.com for allowing to achieve this goal!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|I always loved Clint Eastwood as actor, but once he started directing I understood the true power of this man.  So when \\"Gran Torino\\" came out, I knew I will have to see it.  This film is a work of genious on so many levels. It is setup in the working class Detroit that inevitably like most cities, keeps changing.  Eastwood's characted Walt Kowalski is no so keen and eager on adjusting.  It is the death of his wife and her funeral that break heart watching this growling man come to terms that the term \\"dysfunctional family\\" has a whole new meaning for his own.<br /><br />Alone, retired and left to his own devices, Walt is forced to accept his Hmong neighbours who in turn take care of him in their own way.  How can a man so full of bitterness, prejudices and contempt for the world around him adjust to this arrangment?  Well, you have to see the movie because it will break your heart.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is building his own legacy that will remain a legend on its own.  This is one of the best movies I have seen lately.

B001ED7C58|5.0|All music are just great!! This soundtrack is really worth listening over and over again!
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Production: Dark, eerie and actually how I always envisioned it. The entire mood fits the music perfectly. I love the addition of the ghost.    Lucia: Anna Netrebko offers a more than adequate rendering of this difficult role. In my humble opinion, Sutherland, Devia, Callas and June Anderson are among the best Lucias with Mariella Devia and June Anderson being my personal favorites. Keeping in mind that every singer misses notes on occasion, I think people get hung up on how many notes Ms. Netrebko misses and seem to forget that she not only has a beautiful instrument with superb breath control but she's also a fine actress. She's smart in her vocal interpretation as she carefully maneuvers around the difficult coloratura passages. In the mad scene, I was particularly impressed with her staccato notes, and am thankful for her attempting to, and subsequently nailing the high note at the end! Thanks to her riveting acting and singing, the mad scene does not disappoint.     Edgardo: Piotr Beczala has an elegant and almost regal sound to his voice and his acting skills are exceptional.     Enrico: Mariusz Kwiecien is menacing and kind of creepy. He has a sturdy and strong baritone voice and is also an excellent actor.     Raimondo: Ildar Abdrazakov is sympathetic and convincing with a great voice!    Bonus: Natalie Dessay is the best hostess in each of these Live in HD series.     Bottom line: A fantastic recording of Lucia that I highly recommend!

I carry my Nikon digital SLR W/extra lens, battery & charger, my camcorder w/extra battery & charger, Garmin Nuvi & auto accessories, iPod & accessories AND the manuals for them and still have room to spare.

Some of the songs were sung at a slower tempo than the should have been I wanted to send Jerital to the band that acompanied her and the second song sung at the computatuin wasn't even on the albin. I would hope someone better would select the song of her next record. as i said in the beging her voice is great but the song selection was teriable
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I bought the first & second seasons of Stargate Atlantis for my son's fiance. She had them on her wish list, so I ordered them.  She opened them & proceeded to play them at my house for the next several days. I got hooked on it from the first episode! Never thought about the show when it was on TV; not a big TV watcher. Even though I never watched the original series, I could figure out what was going on because it shared enough of the plot & actors as if it was the beginning of a new show.<br /><br />I'm an old Star Trek fan, and still love sci-fi. All the futuristic technology was so well done & believable. The relationships between the characters were realistic, and the dangers were quite realistic!<br /><br />I guess my initial attraction was spurred by the fact that there is a mythology about Atlantis, & they incorporated that, but the ancestor souls who designed this place came through the portal from another galaxy. They left their portal here on Earth, under the sea, where the south polar cap is now. If you're a sci-fi lover, you won't be disappointed.
0525421033|5.0|Everything about If I Stay was perfect. I am 20 years old and still love YA books, but this is a book that people of all ages should read. The writing was wonderful, especially how the author weaved Mia's memories in with the present. I fell in love with all of the characters: Mia's parents, Teddy, Kim, and the nurses. Each character was unique, textured, and important to the story. The story flowed perfectly and explored many serious themes in a short number of pages. While what happens to Mia and her family is devastating and heartbreaking, If I Stay is  story is about the power of family, love, and hope.
0316001821|3.0|This book is by far my least favorite.  While I'll agree that the author has talent, hence the three stars, I never felt drawn in, and while the story for obvious reasons is not a \\"happy\\" one, I missed the emotional connection that I often crave when reading a book of this magnitude.  My heart just wasn't in it, no tears were spilled unfortunately.  Plot spoiler:  The fact that the murderer died mercifully left me with unresolved issues.  Additionally, my vision of Heaven is so peacefully euphoric that I was deeply disappointed by its design in this book.  The idea that anyone would have to watch their family mourn them and then subsequently fall apart seems more like Hell in my eyes.  This is not a book I'd recommend, however, it's obvious by all the amazing reviews and Hollywood's desire to put its hands on it that I'm a rarity.
B002M27QQK|5.0|I bought this item from amazon at sale price around 76.00. That to me was a great deal compared to [...] for 100 plus shipping. Loved the book and posters I do not mind having the unedited version of songs but a few extra tracks would have been nice. The real fan knows the importance of have a limited number of production. To the person with the missing items please look again I myself didn't realize that the posters are double sided and I can not locate my 3-d glasses either but I'm sure they are in the package. CD's were tucked in pages which I saw on a fan website so I knew where to find them. Thanks to Amazon for price matching when they lowered the price.

B002RSDW80|3.0|I thought the movie was excellent with one exception. Seeing the movie before reading either book, I certainly got the impression that Julie was depicted as a sweet, somewhat obsessed, Meg Ryan character. Didn't we all feel terrible that \\"stuffed shirt\\" Julia snubbed her? Could it be that Julia simply didn't want to be associated with someone that uses the \\"F\\" word in almost every sentence, not to mention other serious character flaws? Read Julia's book, avoid Julie's and see the movie in spite of this distortion.

I do not mind violents if serving a point, but in this film it kinda was just stupid. I guess if your into history and you like films to be realiztic this is not one of them. No way were the Nazxi this stupid and americans so smart in such small number.
0307269981|5.0|amazingly talented writer who died so sudden and so soon. have already got two books out and both immediately adapted into very dark and suspenseful movies. i often wondered why there so many talented writers, actors and great directors in these three freeze-ur-butt-off countries. maybe the coldness is the major factor like russia, a country also so cold that had created so many great writers for the literary world, sweden, demark and norway are also produced so many superior creative genes.<br /><br />these two fantastic books with their movie adaptations have also created a heroin who's not as perfect and normal as we usually have found in most traditional suspenseful novels with a female character. a twisted minded, homosexual, bi-sexual, cruel, fierce, smart, tough-as-nail, evasive and dangerous computer hacker with a big heart and tenderness, a person who fights human evil with evil. a very memorable and shockingly likable female character who has so strongly impressed me.<br /><br />couldn't hardly wait for the 3rd and the last one, and in the meantime, regretfully to realize that will be the last installment of the trilogy.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|Wow! I rented this movie at the Red Box for a $1 and I still feel ripped off! If this is as one reviewer says \\"A new direction for SciFi\\" I hope they make a U turn quick! I'd give my 4 stars to Star Trek ANYDAY. I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this space fluff :(   I think its just a lot of Peter Jackson worshippers out there trying to pump this film up. No Thanks guys.    It was just so campy and ridiculous. I could also compare it to Evil Dead, which I could never completely sit through.    I think a lot of people are going to be scratching their heads about this getting so many good reviews....Next!    I'll be watching the $5 bluray rental of wolverine tonight, I hope it will not be as disappointing.
B00005614M|4.0|This innovative breakthrough album ends on a bum note. Why did anyone think Kenny Hagood was a good singer? He almost sounds like a Bill Murray parody. At best, his vocal performance is workman like, at worst, it's boring and trite. Birth of the Cool is much better listening experience if you just skip the last track!
0316010669|5.0|When an insightful friend started to refer to me as \\"Blink\\", I decided to sit down and explore the reason behind my new nickname.  \\"Blink\\" paints a picture for those of us who speak or act without careful consideration.  I liken the word blink to \\"gut feeling.\\"  It's the phrase we use as justification when whatever we have said or done is over.  For instance, after I have taken an exhausting exam, I look back at answers I may have changed because I started to reason out why it might be a different answer.  But Gladwell confirms that when we think about an unconscious decision we made, the conscious and the unconscious don't match up.  Hence the reason why you should always go with your gut on an exam.  However, Gladwell also points out that when we act on something driven by an unconscious mind, or if put on immense pressure or stress, if we aren't practiced in that area of expertise, we might find ourselves acting on false pretenses.        Not only was I able to relate his findings to my own personal life, but I found his various pieces of research and historical events riveting.  As a graduate student, I can better appreciate his theories due to the careful examination of data and real world occurrences.  His suggestions regarding discrimination could provide new opportunities for those often burdened by aspects of our social system.  If it doesn't provide opportunities, it at least allows readers to understand how we often associate negative thoughts to individuals different or historically discriminated against, without even meaning to!  It seems when most of us make quick judgments, we aren't making them based on logical reasoning, but on appearances and superficial ques--Gladwell backs these statements by detailed and astounding examples.  I also found his findings on relationships interesting; although, I would only trust the most highly acclaimed to predict one's marital success from listening to a short conversation and then thin slicing based on tone, facial expressions, and words used.      Often our gut can get us into trouble, but \\"Blink\\" offers a case by case description of how being referred to as \\"Blink\\" may not be such a bad nickname after-all.

1433502410|5.0|I am a youth ministry major at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO and I have found this bible to be really helpful. This bible gives great insight to the word and makes it easy to understand. Also the bible comes with a program online which is amazing you can access anything that is in the bible online and can add your own notes or highlight the bible. Plus the translation of the bible is the English Standard Version which i like better than the NIV. If you want a bible that will really help you study the word then i would highly suggest the ESV study bible.

1590200918|4.0|I enjoyed this novella, but I really wish that the idea had been expanded upon... it just seemed like there could have been so much more to this story. It did seem like a very classic type of ghost story - the sort to be further condensed and shared at sleepovers and camp fires. All in all, it was intriguing and enjoyable. I would definitely read something else by this author. Her writing really had a sort of timeless quality to it and the premise was interesting.

B000P0J06U|4.0|In spite of the fact the horridness of Gothic City was probably inspired on Blade Runner -Los Angeles, 2019- (Who cares if you die?), there are many interesting details worthy to remark around this peculiar second entry by Tim Burton.<br /><br />First at all, its undeniable admiration for the outlaws. The Penguin is by far his main winner card. His mysterious origin, his disparity as human being, his hands (Tim Burton cites himself in Edward scissor hands), the way he makes his own codes of violence and above all his peculiar residence the sewers of Gothic City. Then, the presence of the Cat woman, magnificently performed by Michelle Pfeiffer (whose bullet proof sensuality doesn't admit any doubt), and how he describes her origin (Watch her for instance at the moment when Bruce Wayne meets her in the party and her look is a close resemblance of Burton' s real wife Helen Bonham Carter. On the other hand, the use of the stage to present the essential drama. The major, the opportunism of Chris Walken who sees in The Penguin, a crucial device to put on march his dark ambitions, as well as the weird behavior of Bruce Wayne, the misogynic millionaire who simply refuses to be trapped by this alluring secretary.<br /><br />If it's true the script is not solid at all, the fusion of these disperse details, hovered by the eternal night of this City makes it interesting to appreciate and delight it.
B001OQCV60|3.0|The film is about two Victorian Era Londoners; one is called Watson and is a doctor, the other's name is Holmes and he's a genius. They are friends. And that is all, folks.<br /><br />Well, that is all this film has in common with Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Which in itself is not bad. As long as the new version provides $[...] bucks worth of entertainment, I'm all for change! However, Guy Ritchie's Holmes comes up about a dollar short. For one thing, there is very little story to this film. We learn the story mainly from quick dialogue exchanges during short breaks from fights, explosions, and chase scenes. The fights are so saturated with marshal arts moves, it makes you wander if there was a dojo on every corner of the Victorian Era London... (no, there wasn't). Consequently, Ritchie's Holmes spends more time doing high kicks and leaping out of tall buildings, then deducting. In fact, Holmes and Watson could have fallen back on successful careers as body guards! After the initial amusement wears off, well, there is not much left.<br /><br />As for the story itself: for about 90% of the film we are led to believe Holmes is chasing a master of dark arts, a warlock. This makes you resist the story, since it is integral to Holmes' character to always have two feet firmly planted on the ground. You hope there is an earthly explanation for all the \\"works of the devil\\" our heroes encounter, but when it does come, it is already too late. By then, you have given up hope and thoroughly cursed Ritchie for \\"ruining\\" Holmes.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few more minor problems one can mention, such as some parts of dialogue spoken incomprehensibly, choppy editing, and odd direction. Nonetheless, none of it would have made a difference if the story were still lacking. And Holmes has always been about a brilliantly clever story. It is what's missing here. No amount of kung fu hi jinx can make up for the lack of an intriguing plot. As for the film's entertainment value, it was there at points. The film was OK. A strong three star movie. Neither great, nor terrible, just \\"meh\\". Sometimes it's enough, even if a film does not live up to its potential.nts. The film was OK. A strong three star movie.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|How very disappointing. HPaTH-BP is a very slow movie with very little by way of character or story development. Very little actually happens. Basically, it's setting things up for the final film. The film was dark (visually, I mean) and, now that the kids are no longer young and cute, we're left with the fact that they're not very good actors. This installment comes nowhere near the quality of the last film. I guess that, like me, if you've already committed to the series, you're going to watch it regardless, just don't pay full price for this; it's not worth it.    Not recommended.
B002VECM36|2.0|This film was so bad I was actually laughing at times at the poor dialogue and acting. Still, this was an entertaining experience, if lots of brilliantly choreographed and very bloody marshal arts action sequences were all you came to see. If you hope for anything other then that (clear and coherent story, for example), please look elsewhere.<br /><br />Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris), a Europol agent, has accidentally stumbled on an international trail of murder for hire that eventually leads her to a centuries old clan of assassins. Aided by her boss Ryan Maslow (Ben Miles), she follows the trail and eventually her actions become a threat to the clan. Enter Raizo (Rain), a rouge assassin seeking personal vengeance against the clan, his former family. He is the lone saviour standing between Coretti and death. (or something like that...;o) )<br /><br />You may be familiar with Rain. He is a South Korean entertainer (singer, actor, designer) who appeared in the film \\"Speed Racer\\". Easy on the eyes, with moves that look fantastic on camera. He is worthy of seeing.<br /><br />I was extremely surprised by the appearance of the two British leads. Both are accomplished, Harris is a Cambridge graduate. You may remember her from \\"28 Days Later\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", as Dalma/Calypso. Miles has a career spanning more then two decades now (he was brilliant in \\"Coupling\\", the original UK version). So, what were they doing in \\"Ninja Assassin\\" delivering amateur rank performances? ... Still a mystery...<br /><br />Anyway, set aside your typical expectations of story/acting, and you will be rewarded with a fantastic action movie, true to its roots in the golden era of \\"kung fu\\" film.
B001GCUER0|5.0|A+++++ series. Sophisticated, captivating and high TV standards.  I can't wait for the next season.
0307266303|4.0|I'd only heard about what a great book this is, so expectations were high. After 50 pages, I kept saying to myself: \\"this book could be shorter,\\" i.e. it's a good story, but he's stretching it out unnecessarily so. Clearly, McDougall bought the story of this tribe, hook, line and sinker.     That being said, the information surrounding the story is interesting, i.e. Annie and the Leadville 100 and Nike's chase for profits (at our expense) and this tribe does offer a stark contrast to the way we live.    The book was given to me as a gift. I polished it off in three days and hope to incorporate some of the ideas in my running life.     Interestingly, I googled \\"persistence hunting\\" and found there are still tribes that chase their prey by foot, e.g. I watched a video of an African tribe track down a big antelope until it collapsed (8 hours later).

B002VECLVE|4.0|There is an aching rawness at the core of this handsome 2009 drama which marks the feature film directorial and screenwriting debut of renowned fashion designer Tom Ford. As one would expect, the film carries a pronounced aesthetic identity from someone who obviously has an eye for frame composition, visual flair and period detail. At the same time, Ford's preoccupation with the visual elements can get disruptive as he unnecessarily punctuates scenes with exaggerated changes in the film's color palate. Fortunately, what grounds the production is the sensitive work of the ever-dependable Colin Firth ([[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice]]), who plays George Falconer, a 52-year-old college professor struggling to cope after the death of his longtime partner. The actor skillfully brings the pained nuance out of a protective character caught in an emotional straitjacket due to the repressed year that was 1962 when the story takes place.<br /><br />Based on the 1964 novel by Christopher Isherwood ([[ASIN:0586047956 Goodbye to Berlin]]), this is a somber tale of what George is planning to be his last day alive. Jim, his partner of sixteen years, died several months earlier in a car accident, and George just cannot move on with his life. Resigned to his fate, he spends the day going through the details of getting everything in order to ensure no one has to pick up after him. George cleans out his office, empties his safety deposit box, arranges his clothes neatly, and prepares to send farewell letters to his circle of friends. As he draws closer to what he expects to be his final moments, he becomes more immersed in memories of his past with Jim. However, two flesh-and-blood people figure prominently that day - his best friend Charley, an aging alcoholic socialite with whom he made a long-ago attempt at a fling, and a smitten student named Kenny, who appears to be grappling with his sexual identity through his obvious but inarticulate attraction to George.<br /><br />Firth holds the film together with a genuinely thoughtful performance. You can sense the tortuous anxiety and resigned complacency that he brings to every scene, but none of it overwhelms the character or the viewer. Take note of the way Firth economically handles the heartbreaking scene when George finds out over the phone that Jim has died. Obviously crestfallen, George maintains his composure as he is told that he is not invited to the funeral. Stuck in a mid-century time warp of her own doing ([[ASIN:B00005JLQH Far From Heaven]], [[ASIN:B001F0TM4Y Savage Grace]]), Julianne Moore still manages to impress in her relatively brief scenes as Charley, bantering with George over gulps of gin in that recognizable balance between knowing indifference and unrequited romanticism. Nicholas Hoult ([[ASIN:B00005JL7Q About a Boy]]) projects Kenny's eagerness a bit too easily, but he manages to convey the right level of vulnerability otherwise. Matthew Goode ([[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen]]) plays Jim in idealized flashbacks, while Spanish model Jon Kortajarena smolders appropriately as a down-on-his-luck hustler George meets in a liquor store parking lot. Ginnifer Goodwin ([[ASIN:B0011UMC72 Big Love]]) and Lee Pace ([[ASIN:B001FB4VZ8 Pushing Daisies]]) show up in brief cameos.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|Must say I loved this movie from the moment the starship in the first scene turned sideways, vertigo in space.  The little nods to the Original Series made it fun too.  Good characters, not bad story, great effects.  I didn't walk out of the theater feeling like I'd waisted a couple hours.  The blooper reel on the DVD was delightful.  Quinto as Spock was definitely the star of this show.

She was also in the Go-Gos. Any young singer could do well mining the old songs written by Schock, Jane Wiedlin, Grey Eye Glances, John and Mary, The Public Library, or This Island Earth.

It explains a substance called myelin which coats neural circuits and makes them fire faster and more reliably with extended practice.

B0009MAO46|4.0|I was so happy to find this movie!  As Disney does, it was not available in stores.  My son had recently become quite fond of the movie after watching it at my sister's house and the only place I could find it was here!  Thank you so much!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I have always wanted to read the classics but never took the time. Having a Kindle has allowed me to read a LOT more than I used to, I carry it everywhere.  This was the first book loaded (my husband pre-loaded it for me prior to presenting the Kindle as my birthday gift).  I dove into the book like I have never read before and cannot express in words the joy I felt when I was finished.  It is by far the most wonderful book I have ever read and do not know how I have lived 47 years without having read it.<br />There will NEVER be an author born the likes of Jane Austen.  Give the gift of reading to all people you hold dear, it is a gift they will cherish forever!
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|This item was what I ordered; although, it did not specify \\"widescreen\\" when I purchased it and I would have preferred full screen.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love this musical blend and have given the CD/DVD to family for Xmas.  What is great is that the proceeds help develop more music schools for children in Africa & India.  Hope you enjoy it too!  M.Burke
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Love the way the Shea Stadium concert was woven into the Citi concert.  Paul's a real true showman, but his music and his love of touring wins the day!!  Loved this DVD & songs!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar seems to always put out gold!  This movie certainly belongs in the top half of Pixar films.  This movie brings you to tears in one instance, and then sends your into a fit of laughter the next.  The story is excellent and Ed Asner is fantastic.  This movie should earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination if the Academy know what they were doing.  It is a MUST buy.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This classic concept album \\"The Element of Freedom\\" is about the freedom in risking your heart to fall competely in love.     Alicia Keys began evolving with her third studio album, \\"As I Am\\".  It revealed a great deal about her in several songs and this continues in \\"The Element of Freedom\\".  All the songs are very moving and the melodies take you on a journey of love and hurt as each song moves along and uplifts your spirit.    The songs are well crafted and well written from Pop to R&B.     Alicia Keys continues to amaze, \\"Life's too short to waste one day, I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall, Sure Looks Good to Me that is \\"The Element of Freedom\\"......
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This was a great movie and the cars that came with it was just the cherry on the top
0340840323|2.0|Off to a good start, and then slowed to a crawl with a totally predictable ending. Protagonist seems a little lost, yet sincere and then unconvicingly switches gears to be coniving ... not believable and characterizations of others were silly.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|got on black friday sale for 70% off and love it... got the whole saga. i mean the movies themselves are eh, but the slim cases are nice for storage and cover/disk artwork and special features disks are all there and its an amazing value. def recommend!
B000002IAZ|5.0|I love this cd.  I was just a kid when this come out and remember my older brothers listening to Buffalo Springfield, but I will never forget the great sound that came from all these's talented people. If you like these guys this cd is the one.    Diana M. Diaz  Seattle, WA
0316067598|5.0|This should be required reading in all middle  schools or in every families personal library.
B0024FAG1W|1.0|This was not a good version of the movie which I would bet plays much better in a regular DVD format. Lots of panning across the screen and lots of blurs when the actors move about at a  pace faster than a regular walking speed, all very annoying.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I am not in a Reviewer's state of mind this morning - I misplaced that particular hat. I'll just keep it short. The special effects exceeded what I expected and loved one particular twist in the film. A lot of gaps were filled. Like the new Star Trek movie taking a different direction due to so many time line changes - you have to keep that in mind as you watch this movie. Future events thrown off track here and there yet with the main dynamics still soundly in place. Its worth purchasing or renting.  See, I told you I misplaced my reviewer's hat. Its really too early in the morning and not enough brain juice (coffee) to get my creative thinking processes going.  OH! And for the record - Christian Bale doesn't wear his cape this time. Darn! :-)
B000AYQLX6|4.0|This is Lennon's lost masterpiece & is definitely up there with Plastic Ono & Imagine as one of his 3 great post-Beatles albums. If there's anything wrong with this CD it's \\"Whatever Gets you Through the Night\\", a throwaway song that sounds out of place on this collection. Lennon should have had Nilsson sing it with Elton.   First of all, the singing is phenomenal on Walls & Bridges. Listen to the bluesy phrasing on \\"Bless You\\". Can anyone else in pop/rock/blues sing like this? Hell, no! \\"Going Down on Love\\", \\"Scared\\", \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" & \\"Steel & Glass\\" are great songs that only Lennon fanatics seem to know about. \\"#9 Dream\\" is a cool radio song. You can hear the influence on Wilco, World Party & The Flaming Lips from this era of Lennon, in production, singing & sometimes even blatant stealing of chord changes or melodies.   My only quibble about W&B, is too many songs have horns & strings. It would be nice to hear a few of these with more guitar & less pomp, but this record is so much better/more consistent than Mind Games, Double Fantasy, Live in NYC & Milk & Honey, that any self-respecting Lennon fan MUST own this.
0061914177|5.0|I had heard about Gary Vaynerchuk from a few folks when I decided to attend his talk at Book Expo America 2009. Naturally, my first response was, \\"Well, this guy is a little over the top for me...but I'll see what I think.\\" Far from being put off by Gary, I was charmed by his laid back no-baloney cut-to-the-chase message. It was then that I decided to get and read his book. Now that I've read \\"Crush It,\\" I'm convinced that, like Seth Godin's books \\"Permission Marketing\\" and \\"Tribes,\\" \\"Crush It\\" is a book that everyone needs to read. And hey, if you are at all down in the dumps after what has been a tough year for many, I highly recommend that you drop whatever you are doing and read this book. I'm not sure that passion can replace a paycheck in anything less than six months to a year, but certainly, if you have ever contemplated that possibility, this book will give you the nudge you need to focus on your strengths and turn them into prosperity. I look forward to reading more of Gary's books, which I hope will be coming down the publishing pipe soon.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a joy to listen to this wonderful CD!  God Bless Susan Boyle, she has come a long way and truly deserve her successful.  I love most of the songs on this CD. I've given them as Christmas gifts and have heard great comments.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is a must see! Violence and making your own interpretations of a film not your thing? then stay away from this. Also, if you are a feminine then don't bother with it neither. I can't count how many of them hate this movie thinking is so misogynistic and what not. But everyone has a different view on this fantastic film. So this is how it goes, a traveling automobile company employee suffering from insomnia, attends support groups pretending to be a victim. After a flight home, he meets Tyler Durden. And that's where it begins baby! You hear about this movie all the time and now, I suggest you buy it already. The ending is so intense and confusing you'll find out this movie is really not about fighting. It's much more than that. Best movie of the 90's and probably ever (that's right). Brad Pitt's performance is so memorable that it shows you he is underrated as an actor. You know, since his good looks where the main focus on him. And let's not forget Edward Norton, the man really makes Fight Club shine too. First rule of this movie... is to own it!
1594488916|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and read it in 2 days.  I wanted to respond though to the three main themes put forth by those who reviewed the book negatively.  One common complaint was that the author inserted herself too much into the story.  There is no doubt that she did make herself a part of the story and ever more so as the book went on.  So to that extent, the charge is true.  However, this did not bother me at all.  I thought that the moral (and possibly legal) dilemmas she found herself faced with were interesting and I see no great crime when the author is, or becomes, part of the story, if that is part of the natural flow of events, which it was in this case.     The second criticism is that the \\"protagonist\\"--Gilkey--was merely a two-bit thief who was not inherently all that interesting.  Here again, I think that there is some truth to the charge.  However, I think that, whether he was actually interesting or not, she made him so (and in so doing made the read compelling), which to me is simply evidence of her skills as a writer.  So this criticism didn't bother me either.    The final one is that, by not turning him in, given her knowledge, she may have been committing some ethical crimes herself.  Again, there may be some truth to this one as well.  First however, that has no effect on whether the book was enjoyable to read or not (and it was).  Second, she is after all a journalist and not a detective or law enforcement officer.  If a professional photographer sees  someone being wounded in battle, should they not take the photo and tend to that person instead?  Third, the fact is that he was repeatedly arrested and put in jail anyway.  So the \\"system\\" was aware of what he was up to.  She obviously can't control the length of his sentences, and if the justice system felt his crimes were serious enough, it could have imposed longer sentences.  Finally, she indicated that she wanted to try and find out where the unrecovered stolen books were hidden--whichsounds reasonable to me.      Anyway, I really liked the book.
B002RSDW80|1.0|I absolutely love Meryl Streep but after about 45 minutes I couldn't stand any more of this affected and boring movie. Ms. Streep played her role like an over-the-top transvestite and the other Julia - well, she was just downright dull. The bit I reluctantly chewed off just left a bad taste in my mouth :)
B0026P3G12|1.0|Ordered this CD as a birthday gift three weeks prior to the date I needed it.  It did not arrive and after numerous emails letting this party know I hadn't received it yet, I canceled the order and demanded a refund.
B001FB55M6|4.0|Another funny movie from Jim. Not nearly back to Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber form, but still a pretty funny flick!!
B001F12J3Y|2.0|The 3D option does not work well on the flat screen tv. It is much more effective in a movie theatre.
0375826726|2.0|The book was ok - just took forever to get to the point.  Origionally the series was supposed to be 3 books, I think it was a mistake dragging out the material into 4 - the book is slow due to it and not that great of a read.  Would have been better if the author slimmed down the fluff and left it at 3 books instead of dragging things out.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|I bought this cd because ever since i was a child i always heard this cd at christmas time playing...and i always wanted to own one....so finally when Michael passed i decided to get it. I love it and my daughter loves it too.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|I was leary of a pre-order as I have been burned by other websites.  But, this was a fabulous experience.  The charge to my account did not occur until the CD's shipped and the package arrived on time and in great shape.  After my pre-order was placed, the price decreased, and my price reflected the lower amount!  Of course the movie is great.  But the purchase process really exceeded my expectation for a pre-order.  Thanks!
B002GOAH1U|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my daughter for Christmas.  She watches this DVD over and over again.  She loves Amanda Bynes as an actress.  I think this was a great purchase and Amazon make the experience easy.
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown has done it again. The Lost Symbol grabs you from the first paragraph and takes you on a ride of ups, downs,  twists and turns. You're never sure what will happen next and cannot anticipate the next change in direction. Brown gives a positive representaion of the Masonic mysteries and beliefs. Washington, D.C. is shown as most of us have never seen it before and the ending of the novel is teriffic, giving us the meaning of the \\"WORD.\\"  I highly recommend this book to those interested in science, mysteries and hidden meanings in the Bible, the Koran and other religious books.
1596434252|5.0|This little book is pretty one of the greatest conversation pieces you can have in your living room. It's applicable to all ages and has added bonus being a teaching tool and a work of art all in one package. The pop-ups are phenomenal, creative, and fun. It's pretty much the perfect gift for the artist or graphic designer in your life.
0140340203|1.0|Myself I'm atheist and don't believe in anything supernatural. I'm a very free thinker and have a keen sense of humor. Nonetheless I find Dahl's book to be offensive on multiple levels. Firstly, this book disparages women. The book states \\"Only women can be witches\\" and all witches are actively engaged in harming/killing children. Secondly, as stated by others here, there are many people who [think they] practice magic, some even to the degree of a religion, lifestyle or profession. I don't believe that there is magic, but it is a person's right to believe in magic and express that if they choose. It is spiteful to vilify them. Thirdly, some impressionable children will actually believe this crap or get nightmares, or it might get wedged into the subconscious as a lifelong fear. Dahl is instilling irrational superstitious fears into some of his readers/listeners. Fourthly, there are many wonderful stories of fiction in which witches can be a force for good. Do not let Dahl pollute your child's imaginations against such other stories.<br /><br />Perhaps Dahl would say \\"Take it easy. It's all supposed to be fun.\\" Yeah, minstrels in blackface said that, too.<br /><br />What motivated Dahl to write this book? Is he a misogynist? Does he hate his mother? Is he jealous of women? Compensating for something?
031606792X|5.0|I also bought this for my Mother for  x-mas. Now she has her own complete set and doesn't need to borrow ours anymore. I can't wait for Stephanie Meyer to finish Edward's Perspective!!! That ought to be amazing!! For all you Twilight fans, you can preview it on her website.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|My wife and I both enjoyed the movie. We are both fans of the Star Trek tv series and many of the past movies. This was a great way to reset the Star Trek universe and allow more people to enjoy it.  The cool thing was they way they maintained continuity of the characters behaviors and mannerisms from the original cast of Star Trek.  The image and audio quality on the Blu-Ray disc were fantastic as well.  I enjoyed seeing this movie as much the second time at home as I did the first time at the theater.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this the Wednesday before the week of Christmas and didn't think that I would be able to give it to my husband by Christmas.  It was shipped by that Saturday and he opened it.  What a butthead!!  He loved it and wanted to start watching it but I still wrapped it and he didn't get to open it till Christmas Morning.  It was shipped very quickly even with all of the Holiday shipping going on.  He loved it!!
B001TH16DS|5.0|I have always wanted to own the first season of Star Trek, however when it was on Video Tape it used to be very expensive, then the DVDs came out and were still pretty pricey. Now on Blu-Ray this first season seemed to be a great deal.  I love flipping back and forth between the enhanced and original version to see what they updated and how they integrated the changes.    It is fun to watch the original characters as I remember them from when I first watched the series. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed (unless you get a bad copy or it get's damaged, though it seems like Amazon is trying to fix this problem).
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|Every song on the CD demonstrates the bands incredibly tight approach to their music, not to mention the degree of difficulty to play these songs is on a much higher curve than that of most rock bands you'll hear...      The Songs that are standouts on this CD are: Lazarus, the band's MOST downloaded song on the net...the softest song on the CD, but beautifully gripping.  \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is frankly, a joy ride.  \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" SHOULD go down as one of the musical masterpieces of the decade, I mean \\"Hall of Fame\\" type of credentials for that effort. \\"Open Car\\" is lyrically, playful and a GREAT song to drive to!  (If you know what I mean!?) The harmonies are mesmerizing in Mellotron Scratch.     A Porcupine Tree specialty is their creative \\"breaks\\" within their songs...and the breaks on each and every one of the songs where they delve into that...are not only creative, but brilliant, especially in pulling it all back together into the main musical theme once again.      This CD is NOT to be missed by ANYONE who likes driving Rock N' Roll...if you're looking for the \\"Metal\\" demonesque vocal, this band does NOT feature that style in their singing...The band HAS played in Metal Festivals live before, for the purposes of exposing their music to a new audience primarily...    One more thing, I attended the concert for this tour as well, and PT is one of the most incredible bands I've ever seen perform live.  Their attention to detail, especially in tonal quality is once again, on another level compared to many other bands that I've seen over the years...    Enjoy!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm so glad they finished the series to tie up loose ends. So many times (Surface and those other 2 weak SciFi shows last year or so) they just end the series and the actors go off to other shows, so this was a nice change of pace; to actually finish the series. Love the show! The movie won't disappoint.
1840225564|5.0|This book was given as a gift to my granddaughter.  She was thrilled to get it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series should have been continued. What a romp into space with some funny, quirky characters. Certainly better than the drivel on the tube now. Follow the group as they take the Firefly into space for adventures. I love this series!
0385341008|5.0|What a wonderful little book.  I throughly enjoyed it.  I highly recommend it.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I learned to cook by working my way thru \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking\\" by Julia Child. I still have my very used 2nd printing 1961 edition which I still use. I would like to believe if we had computers back then I too could have done a successful blog as I learned to cook my way thru it. So good for Julie! I also followed Julia Child's life and have read every book about her and by her, plus watched all of her TV shows and interviews.     I started watching this movie for entertainment and that is what I got! Pure lively, funny, absolute entertainment. BTW my husband loved it also. I thought Nora Ephron did a stellar job of combining the two stories. As soon as the movie ended I took Mastering and \\"My Life in France\\" and handed them to my husband so he could see where the Julia story came from. Then I got out some mushrooms and made her Creme of Mushroom Soup...and it was, as always whenever I cook from Mastering-excellent.    So buy it, watch it and enjoy! Bon Appetit.
0316069906|5.0|I've flirted with both vegetarian and vegan diets for the past 20+ years.  I've read \\"Slaughterhouse\\" and Erik Marcus's \\"Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating\\"... various John Robbins and PCRM tomes... John McDougall... Victoria Moran... etc.   Yet, for some reason, this book... coupled with a viewing of \\"Food, Inc.\\" was what it took me to simply say no more to eating animals.  I think I always knew on some ethical level or health-level that it was the right thing to do... but I needed something like this to turn the switch for me.  I simply cannot support the factory farms anymore.  The level of systematic cruelty inflicted upon both the animals and workers is too much.  Learning that not even Bill Niman will eat Niman Ranch beef was eye-opening.  I'm done.   Thanks Jonathan Safran Foer.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I've watched this movie in the theater many, many times. I'm a huge FireFly fan, and I attend \\"Can't Stop the Serenity\\" events every time I can. This gives me a chance, at least once a year, to see this movie again in a nice theater with great sound.<br /><br />The DVD really did the picture quality pretty decent justice, but the SOUND in this film is a big part of the experience. The DVD just doesn't compare to the BluRay version in the sound department. I finally really hear and feel those initial explosions in the film (during the \\"Earth-that-was could no longer sustain us ..\\" part), all that great music, the battle with the Reavers just beyond the Ion Cloud ... WOW.<br /><br />This movie really forced me to finally get a BluRay player. I can't watch the DVD after watching this on BluRay. It's so much closer to that movie theater experience for this movie.<br /><br />I'm no BluRay fan-boy yet, but if I see more movies like this, I might become one. I'd give it more stars if I could! :)
B000C20VPA|3.0|The Disney-ization of Los Vegas is seen as a bad thing?<br />Here the street wise bookie becomes a Casino boss<br />and everything goes well until his marriage hits<br />the rocks. The Robert de Niro character survives<br />but everyone else dies in this modern tragedy<br />that reminds one of a Shakespeare play.<br />My take on this is that the next generation<br />crime bosses are the ones behind the laundered money<br />corporations that run Los Vegas now.<br />The fantastic profits are still there and<br />still being sent in suitcases to the people running things,<br />but just in a way that is apparently completely legal.<br />Cheaters in the Casinos still gets treated pretty much the same?<br />There are still holes dug in the desert...
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you love Firefly and are looking at the BluRay, just get it. The picture quality is amazing. The color looks so much richer. It's really wonderful. Even the first part of Serenity (the battle of Serenity Valley) looks better, and that is saying something as the source wasn't too great to begin with.<br /><br />I will happily give away another set of DVDs to some lucky friend (who isn't hooked yet *evil grin*) knowing I have this edition. I'm very happy with this purchase. I put off purchasing this for a LONG time due to the steep price.
1402766904|5.0|Folk's, this is the UNABRIDGED \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  Unless you've read it, you have no idea what your missing.  Yes, Dickens moralizes, but, he also shares his love of Christmas, his wit, and yes, his humor.  A Great read.    So, before you get burnt by acid rain, read the book!    Sorry, couldn't help the last line, it just came out.    Gene

B002HWRYJE|1.0|I'm so disappointed with Damon Lindelof putting his name to this garbage, the screenplay was juvenile (and that's an insult to children every where by the way).  The Uhura and Spock romance is just plain silly, it added nothing to the story (was there actually a story?) whatsoever.  How about Kirk jumping from punk, rabble-rousing rebel to cadet then on to starship captain in about three years; including being suspended from the academy then promoted to first officer after being discovered as a stowaway on The Enterprise, all within 24 hours.  Whatever happened to military promotions and protocol?  Did Lindelof and Abrams hire high-school drama writers to write this junk?<br /><br />I can handle this film being terrible, I was never much of a Star Trek fan anyway.  I do know enough about the franchise to know that these characters were not playing even remotely to the characters fans know and love.  Come on, Vulcan teens teasing young Spock and giving him a shove?  \\"That's right Spock!  You're such a little tool.\\" (ok, I made the dialog up but it was equally as bad) Highly improbable and illogical.<br /><br />The writers (and producers) even gave Scotty (who doesn't even appear until the final 20 minutes) a cute little alien side-kick that looked an awful lot like a dwarf version of The Creature From the Black Lagoon (only without menacing teeth and claws).  This figure looked like it was created with a glob of green play-dough by someone around 9 or 10 years of age and quickly painted.  Maybe it was played by Gumby, middle aged and fat?  Maybe it was a pile of moldy cheese?  It sure was \\"cheesy\\".<br /><br />I found the writing very shallow and predictable, despite the character \\"twists\\".  What really amazes me is the fact that both JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof think this film is something they can take pride in having made (I read pre-release interviews with both guys and they thought this project was so special). It's special alright but not in a good way.<br /><br />What disturbs me the most is that I've spent fives seasons heavily invested in \\"Lost\\", a fantastic television series that includes some of the better story and dialog writing in television history, and those same guys produced this garbage.  Why does that disturb me?  If JJ and Damon can take pride in their Star Trek, then I am very worried about their upcoming resolution for \\"Lost\\".  I sure hope this was terrible because they were putting all their REAL effort into \\"Lost\\".  Take us out Mr Sulu.  Warp speed away away from this turkey.  On to The Planet of the Baritone Women!<br /><br />PostLostScript:  Damon Lindelof turns out to be the turkey I was worried he might be.is that I've spent fives seasons heavily invested in \\"Lost\\", a fantastic television series that includes some of the better story and dialog writing in television history, and those same guys produced this garbage.

B001NE80P4|3.0|It was great to see the gang together again. But there was TOO MUCH SINING for me, they should have saved that for the music CD.
1565117700|5.0|This is a great audio book. Gary Sinise captures each character of this classic with a fluidity that draws the listener deep into the story.  After reading the book several times, and seeing both film versions, I felt like I was experiencing the story for the first time.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Well, the movie was fun and it was great to see Arnold, well kinda, back as the character that started it all. The movie is well worth watching and the picture is awsome. The so called director's cut, leaves alot to be desired. The rating is changed to an \\"R\\" because of 3 minutes that are lame and could have been more. We see a all to brief view of Williams breast, and, I do mean brief and from the side. This does NOT improve the movie or add anything to the plot. I am happy that this version came with the set, if, I bought this version for the extra scene it would have been a big let down. I hope that a version with more extra scenes is released soon.
1400096936|4.0|Don Winslow, narrator par excellence of nefarious activity in his beloved southern California, has got religion of a sort.  The endless \\"war on drugs\\" has long since gone off the rails, linked ever deeply into the violence and corruption of Latin America's political culture and the USA's own ill-advised geopolitical meddling in that unstable region.  Winslow tells the story of this destructive, hopeless campaign from the mid-70s thru the late 1990s, focusing on a Mexican crime family and an honorable DEA agent who slowly loses his soul.  The author's narrative skill is in evidence through most of the book -- economical, evocative prose that drives the story along in fine style, descending only on occasion to borderline preaching and gratuitous, over the top violence.  His characters are, as always, fleshed out in three mostly tragic dimensions.  Reading this book may shake the strongest convictions on the political right about the drug war -- there has been and will continue to be far too much collateral damage.
B001493FK8|5.0|This series has me hooked like it does so many others. I eagerly await the next series as well as the HBO series. Each character is compelling and draws you into their own individual story lines. This is the fantasy novel for those who think Sci-Fi & Fantasy or too out there.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I have long been a James Cameron fan, but Avatar far exceeded even my expectations.    While there are obvious allegorical threads tying the plot together, the grand conclusion that this intelligently written epic offers to us is that beyond Gene Roddenberry's vison of One World, One People, there lies the ultimate Truth - that we are One Universe, One Consciousness, and Love is the greatest force there is.    If you think that's a sappy assessment, you have missed the entire point of the movie.    The special effects and non-stop action are second to none, and the entire cast, including the mighty Sigourney Weaver, give 100%.    An outstanding work of art from a true genius.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I listened to this, expecting something nice and sweet, like a needlework sampler. Instead, I was blown away. There is a reason this woman (should have) won X-Factor; she is stupendous! I can't believe that such a beautiful, rich, and passionate voice is coming from a woman who is nearly my age! Well, she's been practicing a long time, that's for sure.    Especially noteworthy are the goosebump-inducing \\"Wild Horses\\", which puts the Stones version to shame, and \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\".
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Braveheart is my all time favorite movie and I have seen this movie over 40 times (no kidding) so I felt there was nothing about the movie itself that was going to entice me anymore. Inspite of that, I bought the Blu Ray disc to experience the hi-def version of the movie I love so dearly.. and boy, what an experience !! The highlands of Scottland, the war scenes, and just everything else in the movie just dazzled a million times over with the Blu Ray. I realized I was enjoying earlier whatever was possible with the standard def but I now get to see so much detail that the same movie becomes enticing all over again.<br /><br />If you are a Braveheart fan, you've got to buy this one and experience the magic. And I am going to watch it 40 times all over again in Blue Ray - no kidding !!<br /><br />Someday I might start a Braveheart Fan club. Meanwhile, enjoy this one !!<br />-Deepak

1592332803|5.0|Just made lemon bars and the chocolate chip banana muffins, and both turned out fantastic!  I was really pleased  with the results.  It didn't have that odd twist or sacrifice for being the 'vegan' version.  I've been trying   plenty of vegan recipes lately, both from cookbooks and online.  Many have been disappointing (granted I wasn't  much of a cook pre-veganism) but I have been truly pleased with the results from the recipes in this cookbook.  highly recommended!
B0026P3G12|2.0|I am so disapointed in this c.d. Although Susans voice is beautiful, the songs recorded on this c.d. do not do her justice.They are too SLOW, and her voice is not the forceful and strong voice I admired on television but very meek and almost dirge like. This c.d. would go over great at a funeral but I won't be buying another one anytime soon.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There were a lot of Italian westerns made ranging from really pathetic to really good. This is one of the best of the bunch.  One thing that notice early on in the film is that the story is being told as much by the visuals of the actor`s faces as by  the dialog. Nothing is rushed, everything is slow and deliberate except for the violent scenes making a surprisingly good  contrast. The build up is almost painfully slow and then explodes and is over in a couple of seconds.  Another that sets it apart is the casting of Henry Fonda as the bad guy. Fonda was almost always the stereotypical good guy.  But in this one he proves he can not only play the bad guy well, but a truely cold blooded monster. In one scene he almost smiles  and you can see glee in his eyes as he coldbloodedly murders a 10 year old child.  Another is the western visuals (which mostly were NOT filmed in the west or even in the US) that really catch the eye. The very edge  of civilization. Everything is rough and half build, right down to the rough hand hewn lumber and logs. People making due with what is  on hand, just as they have always done in hard times. Giving a real authentic feel to the picture.  The story and plot are old ones that were well used even by the 60s when the film was made. But in this case it`s not so much the  story as how the story is told that gets you hooked.  Overall it`s an excellent western.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I started watching Lost as part of my Cardio Workout and it is perfect. I had never seen the series before but heard a lot about it and now I'm hooked. My incentive is that I have to be on the Precore working out to watch the show and it works because the show keeps me interested. I'm looking forward to Season 5 (I just ordered it from Amazon)
B001FB55I0|3.0|I fell asleep after about of hour of watching this movie....it was ok i guess looked great on blu-ray but as far as the movie goes....nowhere near as good as the other 3 terminator movies
B002NC8JEC|5.0|i have the album from back in the day matter of fact one of the first holiday albums that i have ever had. Michael Jackson sounded soulful and strong on this set. great vocal harmony and overall Production.  these songs sound great after all of these years and so much soul and harmony. fantastic.
B0014E9188|5.0|If you are a Porcupine Tree fan than you must own this DVD.  If you love Neo-Prog/Progressive Rock, you will more than likely want this as an addition to your collection.  The surround sound production is amazing. The concert captures PT on the \\"Deadwing\\" tour in top form.  There is not much more to say except, enjoy the musicianship, the songs and best of all, the atmospheric surround sound.
B002R0F3Q2|2.0|Alicia Keys is a Polished studio act who covers a wide range of the past riffs and notes and enough commerical elements and stylings to blend something familiar and throw in a modern vibe. but the formula has been set from her first album til now. the problem is that none of the songs are what I'd call money tracks and her vocal range is alright,however I just feel that alot of what she does is very run of the mill. for me hearing one Alicia Keys album is like hearing them all. she makes what I call cute songs, which are sugary, but not  anything with much bite.  tracks feel just sorta there without much progression. she has a formula that works and that is how she rolls.
B000VFGQUC|1.0|Picture but no sound.Tried on computer xbox and dvd player with same result. I want my money back.Very disappointed
031606792X|5.0|I love the series and especially this book. It was suspensful and exciting. I read it one day.
B0026P3G12|5.0|An absolute delight to listen to ----- good choice of songs ---- I highly recommend this !
B002T921AC|5.0|Our 12 year old daughter wanted this CD for Christmas. She loves it and it was a few dollars cheaper on Amazon than in stores. Plus we saved w/ free super saver shipping.
0143034901|2.0|A good friend of mine loaned me this book. \\"Feel free to keep it after you're done\\", she said.  I thought she was being very generous. Now I know why she didn't need it back: it is utterly boring.<br />To be fair, the first 200-300 pages are interesting.  The story and the characters are  unusual.  The quest of a young boy and his uncle for the lone copy of a book by Julian Carax are (or I should say: could have been) extremely appealing.  So I kept on reading, hoping that a mid-point in the book, something  would happen.  Well, it did:  Half-way through,I was so completely confused by the labyrinthine plot that I forgot where I was, and why I was there.  (Not good, especially when some readers may think you are the next Gabriel Garcia Marquez).<br />In short, if you are curious about it, get it from a library or at used book store.  You might find my copy there because I promptly traded it in.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Filmmaker Wes Anderson is a specialist in comedies about the fault lines in the American dream. \\"Rushmore\\" concerns a prep school student, a middle-aged millionaire, and their romantic rivalry over a woman who doesn't want either of them. \\"The Royal Tennenbaums\\" examines a family of former prodigies and what happens when their estranged, deadbeat father re-enters their lives, while \\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\" imagines a Jacques Costeau type adventurer as a combination of Don Quixote and Captain Ahab. Anderson's new film, \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\\" is the story of an aging family man who risks everything to recapture the thrill of his youth. It's set in an imaginary England where all the animal characters talk with American accents, and, along with the steampunk-influenced \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" it's one of the two new pictures I've most enjoyed this year.<br /><br />Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) writes a newspaper column that even his friends don't seem to read, but it provides a comfortable living for his family. The trouble begins when he buys a new home near those of three grotesque farmers: rotund Boggis, dwarfish Bunce, and pencil-thin Bean (voiced by Michael Gambon), the smartest and most dangerous of the three. Mr. Fox, despite his promises to his wife Felicity (voiced to self-possessed perfection by Meryl Streep), reverts to his wild side in a series of nocturnal raids that brings down the wrath of the vindictive trio on himself, his family, and nearly all the wildlife in the area.<br /><br />Even without all this, there's trouble in the Fox household between the Foxes' sad sack son, Ash, and his visiting cousin Kristofferson, a martial artist, athlete and student of Eastern meditation who outclasses him in just about everything. Ash responds with all the petty adolescent cruelties at his disposal, but he remains basically invisible to his father, a master thief and escape artist who can't understand why his son can't do much more than dress up like a comic book superhero.<br /><br />The passage of time is an important part of this movie; two human years equals twelve fox years, and Mr. Fox notes that his father died at almost the same age he is now, leading him to wonder if he stopped being true to himself by giving up a life of crime; you get the feeling that he enjoys using the word \\"existential\\" without knowing what it means. It's underplayed, as all Wes Anderson comedies are underplayed, and the stop motion puppet animation looks, paradoxically, more lifelike than the typical CG animation we're now used to. One reason I find this movie so enjoyable is that it's an absurd, wickedly funny, thoughtful comedy that leaves the viewer time and room to think and savor the many verbal, visual, and musical jokes that pack the film (as opposed to the bludgeoning sitcom stupidity of most recent animated comedies).<br /><br />I haven't found myself awaiting a home video release this eagerly in years.ro.

0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson's first book of the Millennium triology \\"The girl with the dragon tatoo\\" combines mystery, suspense and contempary issues like no other writer has done to my knowledge.  His research on violence against women in Sweden is admirable and revealing, one of his character being a survivor, the hacker heroine Lisbeth Salander. Storytelling at it's best, complex,absoring and engaging until the last page, the book doesn't let you rest. No wonder it has become an international bestseller. Luckily I already have the sequel \\"The girl who played with fire\\" at hand and am happy to say that Lisbeth is with us again, inviting us to join her on a new quest.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|great pic that fills the gap, and like the other films has the terminator as the savior
B000ETQR3Q|3.0|My 6 year old son recieved this for Christmas and was so very happy.  We got out all the pieces and he started playing with it instantly.  The gun is just a little too long for my 6 year old to handle.  Also the gun has gotten jammed a couple times.  If the bullets aren't perfect the clip will get jammed up and has caused my son a little frustration.  I think once he gets a little bigger and can reload the clip better it will be a much better toy..  but for now it's just OK.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Fabulous documentary.  Tough to put into words how well this dificult subject is managed without letting any one of these guys get completely outshined by the others (or alternately come off as a complete Rock God wankers...).  You will leave with a much better understanding of why these 3 are so special and great choices.  A GREAT film for any fan of music but man if you play guitar you really gotta see this.  You'll be talking w/ your freinds about it for weeks.  The Blu Ray is particicularly good looking (and understated in the soundstaging as well).  Also, like another reviewer said, the silly grin on Jack White & Edge's face when Jimmy starts playing Whole Lotta Love (or alternately when Jack teaches the others to play 7 Nation Army) easily is worth the price of admission.  Just really great stuff.
B001KP2Y3K|3.0|Peyroux's recent outing suffers from material that fails to arrest attention.  \\"Instead\\" that opens the set paints a sweet mood and is probably the best track on the disc.  \\"To Love You All Over Again\\" her vocals are warm, but the music just plunks on repeatedly.  \\"You Can't Do Me\\" almost works, but also suffers from the chronic banging of Jim Beard on piano.  Many of these tunes remain faceless after repeated listening from \\"Bare Bones\\" to \\"Love & Treachery\\" and my least favorite track on the disc, \\"The Lady of Pigalle.\\"  Even when the material isn't great, Peyroux the singer manages to be interesting.  This disc is neither awful nor remarkable; spin it a few times and move on.  Enjoy!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This cd is wonderful listening. Susan Boyle's voice is amazing and her choice of songs is great.  I've listened to the cd 3 times today so far and haven't gotten tired of it yet.  Susan is so gifted!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This review is more for Amazon than the actual product, though I know that Planet Earth is excellent. I bought it as a gift and even though they said it would not arrive until after Christmas, it actually arrived 2 days after ordering it.  I ordered several items from Amazon and they all arrived promptly with no problems.  I have ordered from Amazon frequently and only once had a problem.  If I shop on-line, it most always will be Amazon as I am usually assured of good service.
0312539525|3.0|Archer is a good author, with a flair for writing. It is his writing style that makes this book an interesting read.<br /><br />However, this book is based on the true life of George Mallory, a  mountaineer who attempted to climb the Everest. Even for those who don't know the story of George Mallory, the prologue (which is actually a flash-forward), reveals how the story ends. The knowledge of the ending, and the lack of any suspenseful subplots makes this book easy to put down.<br /><br />Essentially this book reads like a well-written biography.<br />Read it only if you like biographies, love mountaineering, or must read every Jeffery Archer.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album is such a joy to hear....it's so nice to \\"listen\\" to good music for a change, rather than having to watch a production. Certainly makes you remember what good music is supposed to sound like.
B000002H38|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I just cannot fault it. Anita's voice-vocal range, sound, notation, emotional capture is 10/10. The lyrics-unforgetable, intense is 10/10. The music-sound, instrumentation, chords, rhythmn section is 10/10. The songs are all beautiful and flow perfectly well. The album is the perfect package. This album has stood the test of time and will continue to be played in 100 years time.     Till this day I continue to hear these songs being played in shopping malls and train stations in Brazil, Chile, Thailand, Hong Kong, USA, UK, France, Holland, Germany, South Africa, Nigeria, Italy, Australia to name a few.    No wonder Anita Baker is adored by so many other musicians including Pavarotti, Mary J Blige, Faith Evans, Celine Dionne, Tyrese, Snoop Dog and many others. Mary J Blige once said this album saved her life. I say, Im not surprised because it made mine.
B002T45VX6|5.0|I have to say this is my favorite album of Shakira!!! I am her fan since her beginnings in 1996 and i love her evolution is like a roller coaster she tries everything ballads, rock, some hip hop and electronic pop... This album is so much fun and different from others out there that sound the same. The fusion of sounds are incredible!!! I totally agreed with the experts given this album four and five stars. She is very talented and smart artist so if you purchase this album part of the money it will go the her barefoot foundation so is totally worth it!!!!
B002VPE1AM|4.0|I have waited for this moment for months. Now, it is an anti-climax of sorts.  Avatar is what I had expected and is also a disappointment. There is absolutely nothing original here. Anyone who has read a few sci-fi novels (you don't have to be a fanatic like I am) that are examples of the main genres will find bits of influences (and downright plagiarising) everywhere.  There is \\"Winds of Altair\\" (where there is a six-legged panther which is remotely controlled by a human), there is \\"The End of Winter\\"(where there is entwining of tails)... I could not come up with all the references, I must confess. I hope due tribute is given to the original owners of the ideas somewhere...  The movie is striking visually. As expected.   The world of Pandora is well-built. Obviously a lot of thought wnet into designing the flora and the fauna. And it shows. Whether plagiarised or not, it is an incredible effort to be applauded.  However, there the originality ends. The subject matter is very very very familiar.  It is, in brief, \\"Pocahontas\\" meets \\"Aliens\\" (with a lot of \\"Dances with Wolves\\" in between). The references to the Native Americans is so strong, you can't help feel Jim Cameron is trying to apologize for what the white people did.  Don't get me wrong. You enjoy every second of the movie. You don't even feel the 3 hours pass by. But this movie won't age well. Repeat viewing will not be so much fun without the 3D (meaning at home). And when you remove the visual splendor, the remainder is not that strong. There are better movies that tell the same story.  Still it is a must see and will certainly be a cornerstone in movie-making because of its technology. Just don't expect anything more...
B001C4CI8U|4.0|This is a well written show.  At times it is gross and always weird.  The actors are wonderfully cast and seem to get the most out what the writers give them.  Thu not a show for everyone, but it is for scifi fans.  I've enjoyed this season and hope the next will be even better.
B00005MP58|5.0|simply put, this is the most accurate and well versed rendition of the beloved classic that I have yet to find
B000002O51|5.0|Best Boston album and one of the best symphonic rock albums ever.<br />As Scholz relates in the liner notes, they took around 6 years to make this record. It's impressive, such a stack of sounds mixed and linked, lots of troubles with the the oldest tape tracks (they got stuck), a man with long arms to fix the tapes from different desks and most of all, a \\"space\\" travel full of space ships and other UFO sounds made without using violins or synths.<br />Brad shows a great voice from sweet modulations to the highest tone rates!<br />I've listened to it lots of times and I never get fed up with.<br />I really recommend it. It's great!<br />---------------------------------<br />El mejor disco de Boston y uno de los mejores discos de rock sinf&oacute;nico de todos los tiempos. Como cuenta Scholz en las notas del disco, tardaron casi 6 a&ntilde;os en hacerlo. Es impresionante el mont&oacute;n de sonidos unidos y mezclados, montones de prblemas con las pistas m&aacute;s antiguas, las cintas se pegaron, necesitaron un tio con los brazos largos para fijar las pistas de mesas diferentes y sobre todo un viaje espacial lleno de sonidos de naves y otros OVNIS para los que no usaron violines ni sintetizadores.<br />Brad saca una gran voz desde las m&aacute;s finas modulaciones hasta los m&aacute;s altos tonos.<br />Es un discazo, lo he oido montones de veces y nunca me canso.<br />Lo recomiendo un mont&oacute;n. Es genial
