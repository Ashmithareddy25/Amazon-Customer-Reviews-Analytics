B008AUGEFC|5.0|I'm not going to lie to you, this book took a tremendous amount of effort and, while reading it, I hated almost the entire thing.  I say this as an avid reader and an outspoken lover of literature.  My favorite authors are Chabon, Proulx, Auster, and McCarthy, so it's not like I'm unaccustomed to challenging reads.<br /><br />But then something miraculous happened ... After I finished the book, I started to like it more and more.  It's almost like how exercise stinks while you're doing it, but when you see the end result, you love it.<br /><br />I can't explain the book.  I just can't.  It spans centuries, there are six different story lines that brush against each other, Mitchell splits up the six story lines into two different sections strategically placed within the larger context of the novel, he plays with language and sentence structure to the point it's nearly incomprehensible ... just read it.  Or don't.<br /><br />I read this book for two reasons.  The first, and strongest, was pride.  The smartest guy I work with read it and loved it and challenged me to read it ... how could I say no?  The second reason, and you book lovers will relate, I wanted to experience it before the movie came out and altered my perceptions of the characters and settings.  I managed to get it read right before the movie came out, but it's taken me this long to work up the nerve to try to review it.<br /><br />Maybe I should have listened to my instincts and resisted that urge.<br /><br />Okay, try to focus, Scott.  The book is difficult but ultimately rewarding.  It is not a page turner, but it will join your essence after having completed it.  You will be confused much of the time, but through thought you will appreciate it all the more.<br /><br />On a side note, I still haven't seen the movie, but I bought the soundtrack and it is excellent.  I listen to it all the time as I write.  It gets my creative juices going.<br /><br />Scott William Foley, author of Andropia
B00127RAJY|4.0|Received on time. DVD works. Hard for a beginner . There are no breaks but you can def. feel all your muscles the next day, sore! I finished the video each time but I had to take a few small breaks during. :) so I cheated!
0525478817|2.0|I really really wanted to love this book, because really, what kind of heartless bitch could find fault with a story about two terminally ill cancer kids falling in love.  And I believe that it is this same wish that has so many other readers lauding this undeserving book.  Any author who has the courage to attempt to tell a story about two terminal cancer patients has my deep admiration.  Unfortunately as lofty as the aspiration is, the finished product falls short.  The writing is at best, mediocre.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems I had with the book was that most of the characters are not fleshed out; they are empty and boring.  The ones that aren't flat out boring are weak (the father,) horrible (Peter Van Houten) or not developed enough to elicit a sympathetic response from the reader (the mother, Hazel Grace, Augustus' family.) Frankly, nothing about Hazel Grace was attractive so I didn't really give a rip about her.  As I was reading about this uber cool kid Augustus falling in love with the utterly ordinary girl Hazel Grace, the \\"Twilight\\" similarity was impossible to ignore.  Like the Twilight story, I was completely unconvinced that either of the males in the stories would fall in love with either of the females.  There was nothing unpleasant about Hazel Grace (Bella), there was just nothing notable about her.  She never registered on the personality detector.  And I am actually amused by people talking about any comedic tones in the book; like Hazel Grace's personality, they never made a ripple. This book was a huge disappointment mostly because of the potential there was in the premise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! I was hesitant to read out but I'm glad I did. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0085OELXK|1.0|I couldn't access this file, and I love the movie. I actually bought if from itunes so I could actually watch it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Usually I read a book before I see the movie but this time I did the reverse. Both are equally good and I'm excited too read the second book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didnt know anything about this book when it was &#34;assigned&#34; to us for my book club. I finshed it in 2 days. Amazing
B00632HWOG|3.0|DO NOT BUY FOR THIS IS JUST A CALANDER OF DATES TO READ THE BIBLE - PAIED FOR SOMTHING I COULD OF DID MYSELF AS IT HAD NO MONITORING SYSTEM OR BACKGROUNDD
B0041VXGRS|5.0|I just finished this book and I can't wait to get started. She makes it look like a lot fun. Her imagination is so good I'm gonna try some of these cake pops. Her explanations are very thorough.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoy Nicholas Sparks work. Safe Haven is a page turner in wanting to know if there will be a happily ever after or will her past catch up to her .
B007M45PMU|5.0|I heard the Lumineers on the grammies and liked their sound so I decided to check them out. I love this sound. It onebof those that just brightens your day.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This app is fast, fun and best of all....free!  Everyone in the house is addicted, kids and adults.  Lots of easy upgrades and controls are simple.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple 2 is ten times better than the first one. I can't put this game down. The graphics are amazing. If you liked the first version you will LOVE this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read!!!<br />Loved<br />This book, would read any of his books any day , can't put them down indecision start
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I like G5 games just wish they would let you know from the start how much the total game is so that you can be prepared if you can't help but want to finish. I realize that is the object, to get you to buy the unlock. Just would like to know before I go though the whole download. Love the graphics and game play, keeps you interested through out the game.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I watched this with my 87-year-old mom and we both loved it. As she put it, &#34;It satisfied all my expectations and more.&#34; So true! The characters make this movies.
B003U53GK8|5.0|I loved the whole series and Season 6 wrapped it up satisfactorily  The violence that permeated the whole series was a little disturbing for me but manageable.  I loved the characters and their interactions and finding out the significance of the island itself.  The writers introduced something completely new--flashes forward and sideways, as well as back-flashes, which maintained a strong level of interest.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Much ballyhoo was made about this movie having a strong female protagonist. It certainly does have that. I was pleased it didn't devolve into the strong-female-just-for-the-sake-of-a-strong-female territory. The mother/daughter storyline gave this movie real depth while the caricature of Scottish men gave it a sense of lightness. The animation quality was to notch, as expected, nay, demanded of Disney/Pixar films. All-in-all, another terrific Disney/Pixar feature.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this mouse is very feature-filled for its price.<br />Color changing LEDs along with a very ergonomic design, OMRON Micro switches, and a weight-tuning system really drew me to this mouse.<br /><br />Without further ado, here are my thoughts of this mouse:<br />DESIGN / ERGONOMICS:<br />- The mouse is angled slightly in preference for righties. It feel really great to hold onto and has a non-slip coating. I have a slight claw grip and I found that mouse to be very comfortable even for long periods of usage. I would compare the shape of this mouse to something like the Logitech G500. It's definitely one of the large mice, but it does feel great. In addition, the design is very subtle and understated. The Anker logo may deter some, but I personally like it.<br />BUTTONS:<br />- The buttons all work well and give a very nice tactile feel when pressed. The only grippe that I have is with the buttons on the side. I tend to do a lot of productivity tasks that involve surfing the web, so I programmed two of the side buttons to be a forward and backward switch. However, the middle button gets in the way at times. It's a minor annoyance really. Otherwise, the software included works very well at customizing the buttons to your liking.<br /><br />LED LIGHTING SYSTEM:<br />- Works well. I love changing the colors to match my mood and desktop wallpaper. However, there is a lack of a pure white color. The white in this mouse has a purple tinge to it. Also, the mouse wheel cannot be disabled individually, it's all or nothing. Pulsating colors and effects are a nice touch though.<br /><br />WEIGHT TUNING SYSTEM:<br />- The weight tuning system is simply amazing. The mouse came fairly light for me, so I fiddled with all sorts of combinations of weights. I finally found my niche and it's great. It's all about customization with this mouse and it really shows.<br /><br />SOFTWARE:<br />- The software is very extensive in my opinion. You really can customize how everything works to your liking. I've spent some time adjusting every little thing with this mouse so that it suits my style and usage better.<br /><br />THE VERDICT:<br />- It's all about the customization. This mouse allows you to tune so many aspects of it its really crazy. I personally believe that this mouse is a great value for the price that you pay. It's feature-filled with features that rival some of the more expensive mice on the market today. Furthermore, it feels very sturdy and well-built. The major flaw to me would be the inability to turn off the blue scroll wheel. Pick one of these up for yourself and see what Anker has to say for itself in regards to gaming peripherals.omize how everything works to your liking.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Best book I have read in a long time. It really shows the compassion in people. Took a while to get interested, then I could not put the book down.!
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone, because anyone could use some inspiration. It's well written and there is suspense entwined within the story as well. The only thing he could have done better was maybe talk about his family a little more, but maybe he was just protecting his families privacy which is understandable. I gave it four stars because he offered lots of good life advice that I think he can give since he is so accomplished.
B0024SQW2Q|5.0|The Underworld series is one of my all time favorites and this movie did not disappoint! Plenty of action with an excellent plot makes for great entertainment. Highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was totally addicted to it.  Very good variety of characters and totally involving.  Very well done.  Love the English and Scottish scenery.
076781326X|5.0|All the other version completely lack the absolute range of emotion and experience that this movie delivers. I still forget the it was a musical! The weight of the drama, the humor, the adventure perfectly engages you the entire time. Who cares about special effects, it's the expert story telling of the director combined with simply good character of all the actors.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|For every reason I loved it! It follows the book pretty much exactly and the stars they've chosen to play the characters are excellent, especially Tyrion.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Could not put this book down. I think Rothfuss is now one of the leaders in the fantasy genre. I immediately bought the sequel. Can't wait for the 3rd book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Love James Bond movies and this is another great one. Love the story plot and Daniel Craig is one of the better Bonds!
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|Read \\"Fooled Again\\"'s review and concur with 99% of it (other than his opinion of \\"Bounce\\" and \\"Diamond Ring\\", one of their worst songs ever). Pointedly I loved Richie's solo album, the experimentation,the dramatic changes from one song to the next and hoped Jon could take inspiration from this but sadly this is not the case. This is the bland Bon Jovi that began with \\"Saturday Night\\" all those years ago and hit a terrible highpoint with \\"Lost Highway\\". Jon's voice is indeed gone, Richie's solo's have been reduced to brief flirtations and there's not an up-tempo song other than one of the four bonus songs on the expanded version. Jon has claimed in interviews that he still appreciates opinions from those \\"he doesn't employ\\". Unfortunately he needs to find an old fan (like myself) or two to give him the harsh truth. \\"Have a Nice Day' was a great album but it's been dramatically downhill since.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|A nice continuation of Cranford.  All be it a little too short.  Again as in Cranford, they seemed to kill their characters a bit too frequently.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I enjoyed reading this classic - again. The story of the girls and the family take one back in time. Real life situations, emotions, actions, all of it, are well written and enjoyable. I suppose that's why it's a classic.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I love the way J.J. Abrams has kept up the pacing and excitement of Fringe throughout the three seasons so far.  Walter and Peter continue to be my favorite characters, although of course I love our Olivia.  I am dreading seeing the end, knowing that there are only five seasons. . .
B00005OMTT|5.0|If you are a fan of Enigma great cd and it shipped very quick  and it sounds great played in the house or in the car.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Prepare yourself to watch an excellent anime! Beautiful graphics! It's the whole series chopped up and extra scenes added to better explain the series (if you didnt get it the first time lol). If you are fan, it's a must have! (plus you can get someone who dosent want to watch the whole series to watch this and get a good idea of what it's about)
6305784116|5.0|I bought this DVD because I had it on VHS years ago and it's a great and fun movie...Everybody wants to be a cat is a real cool song.  Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a very nice entertaining game for kids. Keeps them quite busy specially if you are on Road.  The reason for 3 Star is the biggest difference what we have noticed, the same app on apple iPad / iPhone responds quite fast in comparison to Kindle.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Wonderful movie and the music is fun, very exciting you will enjoy it from start to finish.  Enjoy with little ones or you and your honey!!  Enjoy!
B001CDZZI6|4.0|I believe the Strength Finders assessment  tool enables people to gain valuable insights into their unique combination of personal traits and capabilities
B007ZXK08C|2.0|It didn't hold my attention at all. I kept putting it down and forgetting what I had last read. Didn't finish it and wouldn't try to go back to it at all.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Puzzles are more challenging than the books I have purchased in the past.  So a moderate puzzle is more like hard in a book. Definitely more puzzles than I will ever do.
B00340O3KQ|5.0|I don't know why I love it so much but I have wanted to watch it for weeks and no one locally had it for purchase so thankfully we were able to find it on Amazon Prime. You guys rock.<br /><br />John Travolta and Nicholas Cage act so well together.
0425263908|5.0|If you are looking for another good book like fifty shades, this IS the book for you. My aunt recommended this book to me and I thought it wasn't going to top fifty, which it might not the last book has still yet to come out, but so far it's gotten pretty good. Make sure you order the second book when you're about half way done with this one, so it's there on time for you to start reading.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|This made me laugh so much.  I especially like the episode in which Sheldon is obsessed with figuring out a problem in physics and uses various spherical objects to model the problem.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Phillippa Gregory always tells  a good story.  I hate for the books to end.  She is a star and I love her books.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The book was an amazing well written follow-up to this enchanting story. I originally selected this series to read & screen for my daughter then quickly became captivated!! Well done
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Kept me interested all the time, everyone has done a great job, can not wait to see the third season!!!
B000002TP7|3.0|\\"Sabotage\\" is the best song on this. \\"Get It Together\\" sounded like they were free-styling and Q-tip made it awkward by using the N-word in mixed company. This album must be where they really got into making the lyrics difficult to hear and understand, thus spawned the title.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fast pace game with entertaining random events and believable problems to be solved. All of building and farming are setup to support each other.
B008OJ291W|1.0|I was made aware of this album by the docudrama on cable, where various artists commented for an hour about how great Jeff is, and Jeff croned out mostly acoustic vocals with Tandy on piano sometimes, that went into the making of this album.<br /><br />Basically, Jeff says, \\"I've learned alot over the decades, and figured I can make these songs better now.\\"<br /><br />So he sets out to make them better, largely by playing every instrument himself, with his voice which is IMO definite not better.<br /><br />As a long-time huge fan of ELO and Jeff, I found this documentary offensive.  He gives 100% credit for ELO's success to himself alone, and makes zero mention of his band mates.  Zero.  At the end, it shows him playing a song, with different versions of himself - thanks to technology - playing different instruments of the song... Jeff on bass, Jeff on drums, Jeff on vocals, Jeff on guitar... it was so lame.<br /><br />I guess Jeff is a little full of himself.  Frankly, I like the old songs, they didn't need to be improved, and weren't.  They're classic, they were genius, and they were performed by ELO, not by Jeff solo.  Frankly, I'm not a fan of lead singers who ditch their band that made the group famous in the first place.  Jeff, Sting, Belinda, Morrissey, ... no thanks.<br /><br />I found the whole thing a blatant exercise in Egomania, and it turned me from huge long-time fan, into pity for the guy, a bloated old guy who lost his voice, had amazing talent, but no respect for ELO or his fans.<br /><br />No thanks, Jeff.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Fantastic series, unbelievable for TV!  Follows the books pretty well.  Glad I started viewing the shows, and I can't wait for the next season.  Waiting for the next book.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I give this book the rating of four stars because from the very beginning I did not want to stop reading. One almost feels as though you are part of the story and are there along with the author. A not so untrue tale of how Germany during the war became so hated by all due to their own actions. They don't even like or trust each other. The main character does what is needed to survive those terrible times with such conflict the reader is always sympathetic and rooting for him. A great story done very well.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|This was a present for my granddaughter, and she just loved it. It is her favorite of hers, and it arrived in plenty of time for her birthday.
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|I've read all of the author's books. Always high quality, well researched, practical and entertaining. This was no different. I took action with the weight loss element to trim down a little. I've lost 8kgs in as many weeks and quite enjoy the food intake. Give it a read, you will benefit.
B008220DGE|5.0|With stars such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Joaquin Phoenix this is a MUST SEE film; add the amazing photography and the great attention to period detail, leaves the viewer stunned and mesmerized. This is FICTION but seems to be some sort of an attempt to tell the story of Scientology's beginnings. That plot line was for me a bit blurred and confused in places, but it holds your interest all the way to the end. With three academy award nominations and generally positive reviews, this is a good film for an evening of intellectual discussion following the film and the questions it raises about \\"faith\\" and \\"Meaning\\".
B0042FZWC0|5.0|I like a unique message. I like an author with an opinion. The best authors have both... along with a life story that proves they've been there and done it. Chris certainly has the goods.<br /><br />This book has it all within an economical writing style. I say that because the author doesn't beat around the bush. He might offer a story or two, or throw in an analogy to explain a new concept but essentially he gives it to you straight. I like that.<br /><br />I particularly like the balance the author brings to some of the more outlandish and unlivable freedom strategies that are offered in too many other titles.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a great game. Eat what is smaller, avoid what is bigger. You can play on mute but it's coolest with headphones. It does get frustrating at times, but it's really fun and worth getting.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the way it is written.  Sometimes I watch two episodes at a time because I want to know what is coming next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Smart, entertaining, addictive! I absolutely loved this show! The actors are brilliant in portraying their roles to create this dual \\"family\\" series of early twentieth century life in the aristocratic side of England. From the downstairs servants situations to the upstairs family situations, it is so addictive to watch!
0736083863|3.0|I've studied anatomy & physiology so I understood the content, but it was much more than what I wanted in a pilates book. Otherwise, it was a good took.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|Completely over acted.  Terrible story, terrible acting.  Did I mention the acting is really bad?  Well worth watching.  10/10, would bang.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Needs more fun.  My fun only lasted about one hour.  Would have liked my fun to have lasted more than one hour.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It just doesn't get much better than this:  Excellent writing, great casting, beautiful setting, impeccable acting.  And it's such an enjoyable way to learn a little about history!  Trust your friends, Downton Abbey is downright addictive!  In fact, although I rarely enjoy watching a program more than once, this series is so well done that I've watched each episode multiple times.  Each time, it's as fresh and enjoyable as it was the first time.  This is what TV should be, and could be!!!  Highly, highly recommended.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is so talented! I love his music, I always listen to him. Buy it, you won't regret it! Best buy ever!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|With out giving anything away...all I can say is wow.  If you are a fan of the comic at all (or just read it and didn't hate it) then this movie is for you.  THIS IS BATMAN.  He's not a cuddly bunny rabbit.  He is a stalker of the night and in this movie you see that.  The acting is far better in this movie then all the others and the main antagonist is suburb.  I would &#34;buy&#34; this movie instead of just renting it.  It is something you will want to watch over and over again.  When they talk about batman movies in the future...this will be one of the few we want to remember.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Ultimately her life is revealed and the story ends well.  Bottom line: life is not nice for anyone.  Well balanced.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Lois McMaster Bujold has told a solid story about Miles VorKosiagn's cousin Ivan VorPatril.  The thing to realize about this story is this is a book much more like the Sharing Knife series rather than the manic space opera of most of the rest of the VorKosigan books.  It's a tale of the meeting and romance of two individuals not interested or comfortable in the high stress lifestyles of their respective families.<br /><br />Its an interesting story and perspective but a buyer should understand the story is *not* about a Miles VorKosigan Version 2.0.  Its an interesting contrast to the novella Winterfare Gifts.  Overall I give this book 4.5 stars because it doesn't have the same magic as some of the other books in the series but is still a good read - writing the review did make me want to re-read the book.  :)
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Anthony Beevor illuminates WWII like no other Historian before him. His uncanny ability to intertwine Operational and Political History with the personal memories of common soldiers and civilians gives the reader a deep and intense perspective of a conflict that lasted almost ten years and touched every continent and ocean on the planet.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|The idea behind this story is genius - operating on a retarded adult and making them smart. It is not easy to fine original and creative plots in books anymore. Please, read this. Each stage made sense. I wondered if the author would be able to keep up with the changes Charlie was going through, but he did an admirable job.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love The Big Band Theory and so does my family!  They are hilarious and a joy to watch!  Love it!  Makes a great gift too!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|loving the game so far. only problem is I cant visit neighbors due to having a different version of the game.  some quests require money to buy gems. however the game does give gems just takes a while to save them up. my gameloft id is twix711 if you need a neighbor add me I gift daily.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I could almost hear my CEO's voice in my head as I was reading this. The book changed the way I do presentations, and to an extent changed the way I'm approaching my career.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|This movie rocks. Who would have thought Timberlake would be such a big time actor... Anyway, I thought it was a sweet concept, and my girlfriend liked it too. And it's impossible to get her to like sci fi type movies, which is what I put this as.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love this series. Book 3 is possibly the best book I've ever read, but this one and book two set the tone. All great books.
B003PAXONC|5.0|I bought this because it was as cheap as the regular one was. The extra ending I thought was stupid, and the other stuff that comes with it I have not and probably never will use. But I wanted to see the alternate ending, and it actually made me think the ending they chose was a lot better than I previously thought. So it all worked out haha.
B004LWZW88|3.0|The idea of having a cute hero of a cat fighting and dancing so vigorously is awesome, but the story line sucks. It's predictable and put me and my husband to sleep.
6303023355|5.0|I would have rather had the dvd but for the price I am glad I ordered the vhs.  The movie was just as it was advertised to be and I am glad to have it.
B00003CXBK|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki has a very creative imagination combine with japanese culture together is pretty awesome. Although I think its pretty violent for my kids to watch.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|Wasn't what I expected, but very thought provoking.  Thanks to the family who shared this story and to those who made it into a movie.
B00993FEUK|4.0|Concept of the movie is very intriguing. Story line keep you pretty much awake. I like it, my kids like it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game. The only drawback is that you get pop ups while playing. Pretty easy to advance in the game. I would definitely recommend this game.
B003Y5H5AQ|3.0|Definitely a must have for all dvd, blu-ray collectors. Movie is pretty bit boring, but I bought for my kids so they like it.
B005BUZJ6O|5.0|I play this music when my high school students are working independently. They LOVE it. We discovered it on the Pandora radio station &#34;Classical for studying.&#34; We liked these songs so much, I had to buy the album itself!
B00540G3G6|3.0|Tim Burton sure does have a dark, but kid friendly imagination. If one would be from a religious family point of view this movie would not be acceptable.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I teach high school English. These books fly off my shelves...the students love this story. This is part 2 --so make sure you read the first one before this one. The first is called If I Stay.
B007MDB548|5.0|I think this is the best movie so far that Tinker Bell has ever made. Very touching and teaches the value of having a sibling. Sisterly love kinda movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game. The movements are real and this game is amazing. You should get this game to.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. It was long, but wonderful, especially for my vacation.<br />Very creative writing - it really held my interest!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We bought the wubbunub so it would stay on our sons chest while he was in his car seat. It didn't really work for that until he was around 3 months. Then the wubbunub became his best friend!!! It was a security blanket and binky all in one. The best part is that it has the soothie pacifier on it (which was the brand he loved).<br />Pros:<br />- Easy to find in a bag because its bigger than a regular binky.<br />- Easy for a baby to find when they want their binky.<br />- Easy to wash: I just threw it in the wash when I washed his clothes.<br />- You can easily seam rip the binky off when you're ready to wean the binky and your child can still have their security toy.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is an emotional roller coaster. I enjoyed every page of it. I think the writing was absolutely superb, and I haven't felt this about a book in quite some time. I don't want to give the story line away. I do want to stress that if someone would have told me I could love a book pertaining to the subject matter or the ages of the main characters, I would have thought it doubtful. I am quite pleased to have given this book a chance and my time. This is the first book I have shed actual tears in quite some time.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|hates this game. its so stupid I could feel my iq dropping while playing it. amazon shouldn't sell an app this moronic. it really drops their legitimacy factor
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|After the first two in the series, you really need to read how it all unfolds. This is not just a love story about werewolves. It is a testimony to self redemption, true friendship, loyalty, and just how far people go for the ones they love, It's a lesson in not labeling people, and I enjoyed the suspense, The first book of the series is still my favorite. It was an emotional roller coaster which made me cry. Not easily done, I loved every minute of this series. Thank you Ms Maggie Stiefvater. Well Done!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The story is interesting, if somewhat unbelievable in places. It's also a bit depressing at times, but it does end with a ray of hope and promises another series to continue the saga.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|The first book of this series moved me to the point of tears. This rarely happens to me, so I consider it to be very good writing. Storyline could be considered average till you actually read it. I never thought I could believe 2 people so young could truly fall in love so strongly. Maggie convinced me otherwise.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|My mom is actually the one that rented this movie - she liked it and said that she loved all the animals that were in the beginning of the movie -
0439023513|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two. Nice easy quick reads, but the third was kind of predictable and on going for way to long. I wish they would have been a little more creative with the ending. I just wanted a different ending.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|my husband loved this movie more than me because of his dry personality - but overall had me laughing from time to time!
0385536828|4.0|in 1972, Serena Frome (rhymes with \\"plume\\") is a Cambridge student without much direction in life. She begins an affair with a professor, Tony Canning, who teaches her to keep up with politics and current events. Little does she know that he's grooming her for the MI5, part of the British intelligence secret service. She keeps the job long after the affair is over, though she's mostly doing clerical work. Until another love interest, Max, helps her get into the project known as \\"Sweet Tooth,\\" which seeks to combat Communism by funding anti-Communist art and literature. Serena's job is to check up and keep tabs on a young author named Tom Healy. She loves his stories, and when she meets him, she finds herself falling in love with Tom himself. But how can she love Tom while also spying on him? Will she choose between her man and her job, or will the choice be made for her?<br /><br />I knew I had to read this novel the moment I heard about it, because McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" is one of my favorite books ever. However, once I started on \\"Sweet Tooth,\\" I quickly became bored. Make no mistake, this book gets a slow start. We hear about Serena's school and work life, but these things tend to be a bit dull. We also hear a lot about her love life before Tom, but, with the exception of Tony, none of her love interests are particularly interesting. Even if they were, we know from the beginning that none of these affairs are going anywhere, because Tom is the main love interest of the novel; everything else feels like build up. And we don't even see any of his stories, let alone the man himself, until almost page 100. However, once Tom's stories are introduced, things start getting more interesting. The stories within a story are great, for one thing; I wished I could read them for myself. And the romance between Serena and Tom is sweet; the characters had good chemistry together, and I wanted to know what would happen to them.<br /><br />The characters on their own are good, too. Serena is honest, and nowhere near perfect. She can be vain, petty, and self-absorbed, but she's also smart and caring about her friends. She wasn't as real to me as \\"Atonement\\"'s Briony, whose thoughts and fantasies mirrored my own, but as fictional characters go, Serena was a good one. Her narration is conversational, but also witty, and observant. Tom has his own kind of vanity, and sometimes thinks his stories are better than they are, but it's impossible to not sympathize with his hopes for success and acclaim. He gets quite a lot of development at the end, which I enjoyed. Tony was interesting when he appeared and more so when we hear his back-story, and I also really liked Serena's friend Shirly, who comes from a working class background.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this novel is how timely it is. The Britain of the novel is in economic decline, and paranoid about terrorism and the Communist menace. While I was reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about how similar it sounds to modern times. I live in the United States, and our ideological wars are against different forces, but there's that same sense of dread that we're in decline, that our time is over. The novel evokes a strong sense of the period it's set in, and I didn't get the sense that McEwan was trying to draw a comparison within the text. The comparison is evoked more by the fact that McEwan chose to write this novel when he did. The only thing that bothered me was that there were a lot of references to events during the Cold War, mostly in Britain, that I wasn't familiar with. This is more my fault for being ignorant than the book's, I realize, but, well, we can't be experts in everything. I don't have easy access to the internet, either, so some historical notes would have been nice.<br /><br />Thematically, I thought \\"Sweet Tooth\\" was good, but, once again, not as good as \\"Atonement.\\" McEwan loves themes about how reading inspires us to try to understand things from other perspectives, and that's strongly present here. But it seems a bit of a step backward from \\"Atonement.\\" Suffice it to say that certain characters might be too assured that they can truly understand others. Also, it's hard to say how without spoiling anything, but the way McEwan brings this theme to the surface might seem a bit cheap to his fans.<br /><br />IN SHORT: I was hoping for another \\"Atonement\\" when I picked up this novel. I didn't get it, but \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is still a good read. If you can stick with it through the first hundred pages (which are rather dull, I'm afraid), you'll find strong and likable characters, an involving romance, and an evocative period setting. The social themes McEwan writes about immediately call to mind modern hopes and fears without being obvious about it. I would have liked some historical notes, as Britain during the Cold War is not one of my areas of expertise, but they weren't necessary to understand the plot, or the general mood of the era. The themes about trying to understand \\"the other\\" aren't as strongly felt as they were in \\"Atonement,\\" and they feel a bit less developed, less mature. But overall, this is a strong novel that makes you think about society- where we've been, where we are now, and where we're going.s, and that's strongly present here.

B004ZNB12O|3.0|Average recording of one of my favorite groups. I expected better fidelity but am happy to have something of theirs to play on long trips.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|It may be I liked this movie so much because I am the grandparent of a special needs child.  While he is little, he is surrounded by people who love him and care for him but he will grow to become a man and will undoubtedly feel what men feel and yearn to have what men have. I would hope he might, one day, encounter people who can look beyond his limitations and love him in a mature, genuine and fulfilling way. At the same time, knowing how contemporary society places style and grace over intelligence, sincerity and patience, I had little hope for that ... until this picture!
B00APUQRPC|2.0|a typical story with underdeveloped relationships between the characters. It's sad to see an icon like Clint Eastwood in a mediocre production like this
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is ridiculously twisted, but incredibly well-written.<br />Really fast read with lots of raw, real story lines.  Loved it.

B009VA1FN6|5.0|I haven't read any other books by Kate Morton and really enjoyed this book.  I found the format interesting (skipping from the present to the past) and was truly amazed at the way the threads of the story were woven together to that fantastic conclusion.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.

B0091WL8TA|5.0|I'm always into watching Elvis documentaries and this one is a good one too. Unfortunately I was too young to actually get to see Elvis live so watching these behind the scenes documentaries really helps to see what I missed.
1616550414|5.0|Need I say more?<br /><br />A must have for any Zelda or Mr. Miyamoto fan. This book finally outlines how the Zelda timeline is devised, the reincarnation of Link and its multiple storylines. I enjoyed every page of this book, and wished it had more. Highly recommended.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Thought it was ok but Jason Mamoa is no Schwarzenegger. He looked a little weak in the physique department compared to Arnold. If they had a more physically developed actor for the part would have been much better. A little disappointing in that area otherwise not bad and worth watching.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie - The Next Day<br /><br />I just got David Bowie's new CD, \\"The Next Day\\" in the mail from my pre-order from Amazon. I'm listening to it now. Too soon to give a decent critique, but I will say that it has some \\"pop\\" to it (in parts). For those that know, the cover is a recycle of the \\"Heros\\" album hidden behind a large white square with the album title printed across it. A message there? You bet. This CD is Bowie's first in a decade, and features all new material on 14 tracks plus 3 bonus tracks. He does give value for the money! \\"The Next Day\\" is being touted as Bowie going back to his \\"roots\\" (what ever that means) ;) I don't know about that, but I can say that from what I've heard so far, it does recall a certain period of his music, say the \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Lodger\\" era. Give a listen to the vocal phrasings found in \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" and perhaps, \\"Valentine's Day,\\" to see what I mean. I'm a Bowie fan from the get-go, so I was hoping this CD would rekindle the excitement I first felt upon hearing \\"Hunky Dory\\" or \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", instead I got mixed feelings.  Perhaps upon more play I will come to like all of it.  Still, it's not a \\"bad album\\" by any means. I gave it 5-stars because it is all new material and nothing on it seems regrettable. Like a lot of Bowie's albums before it... it tkes some \\"getting use to\\", to fully appreciate.  I hope this helps.<br /><br />Postscript (3/15):  I've had a chance to give more spins of Bowie's new album, The Next Day... getting more acquainted now... love \\"Valentines Day\\" (eerie tale of a school serial killer) and \\"Dancing Out in Space\\" with its poppy beat and bent chords.  I also like the anti-war statement in \\"How Does The Grass Grow\\"... cool tune reminiscent of things off Aladdin Sane, except the riffs are much more sophisticated.  Finally, the amazing resemblance of the track \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" and Bowie's \\"Five Years\\" (from Ziggy Stardust)... check it out... even the drum fade-out from \\"Five Years\\" is repeated here.  The song itself alludes to impending danger, as it did in \\"Five Years\\".  His voice is a bit more \\"mature\\", which is especially noticable on \\"Dirty Boys\\" and \\"Where Are We Now\\" tracks... but otherwise he sounds like the Bowie we all know for the most part. The more I hear of this album in its entirety, the more I am liking it.ars\\" is repeated here.  The song itself alludes to impending danger, as it did in \\"Five Years\\".

B000R7I3LY|3.0|Sara Barellises album &#34;Little Voice&#34; reminds me of a performance at a secondary stage at a Fourth of July event.<br /><br />Her lyrics are interesting,figurative,and noteworthy;yet sometimes, a little too targeted for all audiences. I would recommend this<br /><br />album to aspiring (instrumental/vocal) artists that aren't interested in going mainstream. Sara's music seems more fundamental than<br /><br />classic.
0345803493|3.0|Maybe it's just me, but I thought Darker was better than book one.  It still has an overabundance of repetitiveness (his lips must have formed a hard line about 800 times throughout the book...what does that mean anyway?), but the writing is a little better and although there are still too many sex scenes (We get it, they are two horny lil kinky toads, I mean, come on really!), the love story is shining through the redundancy. However, I find Ana to be a tad more whinny in Darker...but over all book 2 is a better read than 1.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin continues to expand his world with new characters and places. He does a great job keeping the reader engaged in the story. This is meant to be read along side A Feast for Crows, but I think this has the more exciting characters involved. Don't listen to people who disliked the book, the book is great and sets up the story for an amazing final two books.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|His best written novel of the 21st century. It was long and somewhat ponderous but I loved the ending and could have gone a hundred or two more pages.  Best book I have read this year so far.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks, but a good solid read. There are a few surprises even I didn't expect and now there's a movie.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Here is a series that takes you back to England in the early 1900's.  It provides a look in the life and attitudes fothe aritocracy and those who work for them.  The series is fun to watch, but you must be willing to accept the British humor.  The storyline is somewhat predictable but this does not detract from the well written and well acted story presented.  I haven't seen anything on US television this fresh or fun to watch in a long time.  Downton Abbey provies that you can produce a television series that doesn't require violance and/or sexual situations.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This is really good to have, have when your out and you want to read a book or something you can check here,yes you have the little battery at the top but this lets you know exactly how much time you have,love it!<br /><br />  Thank you<br />  Jamie O'Donnell

B001UV4XFG|5.0|The book series were even better, but the movies were great, too. I do believe we own the entire story now, and we never tire of watching this movie in any order.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The usual unflappable Pendergast is on his heels most of this book.  It has more twists than a Twizzler.  I simply could not put this one down until the end.  Long term relationships are refined to the extent that it is hard to know where the next book in the series will go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My nephew had begun the story while in school and he recommended it to me. I really got hooked and really enjoyed the story a lot!

0062225677|4.0|First in the Discworld series. I've heard it doesn't matter where you start or go next in this series...although...there are some subseries with the Discworld. I am chronologically obsessed so as I find them, I'll tell ya...<br /><br />My Take<br />Crack me up! I love that Pratchett begins with the Indian belief in the world carried on the back of four elephants standing on the back of a turtle. And then he just goes crazy from there as he ties together an unconnected range of ideas: poking fun at gullible tourists with their cultural projections and dictionaries; heroes, their quests, and their true purposes; and, tossing in odd bits and chunks such as the role-playing game of the gods, Death with his scythe, the weird things magic does, other authors and their storylines, highjackings, and the classic pay-off of geniuses, scientists and old beliefs.<br /><br />It rather reminds me of Piers Anthony's Xanth series. Especially when Twoflower starts explaining inn-sewer-ants.<br /><br />Pratchett's writing makes me a bit nuts. I do wish he'd learn to use commas, so I wouldn't have to go back over his sentences to figure out what he's saying.<br /><br />Hmmm, I wonder what Ghlen Livid is supposed to represent. I wonder what kind of scotch Pratchett drinks...<br /><br />Poor Scrofula. Death has put him in a bad position, LOL.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's a naive, eager tourist who sets things off as he pushes to explore the world outside his own land.

B000002HRE|5.0|I bought RELOAD when it came out, back in 97.....I was a HUGE METALLICA fan from MASTER OF PUPPETS JUSTICE FOR ALL ERA, the BLACK album is fantastic and LOAD got some great songs......The first 2 songs are HUGE HITS from METALLICA, but in fact most the songs are GREAT!!!! Ok, this is not THRASH METAL at all, but is HEAVY stuff without any doubt!!!! Even the 2 ballads UNFORGIVEN II and LOW MAN´S LYRIC got heavy guitars.....Look, open your mind and listen to tracks like PRINCE CHARMING,DEVIL´s DANCE, BAD SEED and FIXXXER and say that RELOAD sucks....No, just don´t expect fast THRASH METAL....Common, man, all the great bands (except SLAYER and EXODUS!!!)slow down a bit their heaviness after 5 or 6 albums....METALLICA is a METAL legend, and after so many years i can appreciate the greatness of RELOAD!!!!!WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!

B000QE1U9K|5.0|Yes, i think the cool ALIEN is a trilogy, and this is the point when it should end as a perfect classic from the sci-fi action world....ALIEN and ALIENS are my favourite movies of all time....Really, i like other movies, but i just can´t get tired of those 2....Than comes ALIEN III....WOWW!!! It´s a great movie too!!! I really like the dark story, Sigourney Weaver shining as Ripley and the coolest ALIEN ever again....I´m a HUUUGE fan of ALIEN and PREDATOR, and if you like them you just got to see ALIEN III.....It´s way way way better than RESSURECTION, prometheus and the ALIEN PREDATOR ones!!!!WELL DONE!!!BRAVO!!!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I felt that the movie starts of great with the interest of not knowing what direction the movie was going.<br />Was he going to get away with it or not.
B005MMYT76|4.0|Not exactly sure how to review this.  It is a pretty bizarre movie, but also very sweet.  You just have to watch it I guess.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|Having grown up to the &#34;original&#34; Rumours, initially purchased on vinyl and then topped up on cassette until the CD format arrived, the expanded version is truly a collector's item, consisting of the album as it was originally launched, live versions of the songs, and studio outtakes. Brilliant! Only regret is having to pay the local courier, who delivered the package to me in Mumbai, a sum of Rs.700/= as fees without reason and without a receipt.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I've got both the soundtrack and movie. Both are absolutely fabulous!!!! I love the music and the fact that the cast sang the songs made it even better (wasn't crazy about Julianne being auto-tuned. I heard she sounded 'too country' for the role. She has a fab voice.). Everything was pretty much on point for the year. It was very entertaining- saw the movie in the theater 3 times. This movie renewed my interest in Tom Cruise; I was pleasantly surprised to see him in that type of role, for me it was a slight departure from some of the norm for him. If you weren't around for the 80's music scene, this will give you a little taste. I loved the small girl big city vibe, the 'good' (Catherine Zeta Jones) vs 'evil' (Tom Cruise), and everything from the 1st scene through the closing scene. We sang along with the cast in the theater every time. Get the movie. Get the soundtrack.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Fantastic show!  I never watched it when it was actually on TV, but I am really glad I found this on Prime.  It's original - not at all formulaic like many shows on TV these days.  It reminds me a lot of the sopranos in the sense that it is very hard not to love the main character even though he's a bad person.  He struggles to be a good man and often falls very (very short).
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is not difficult to sharpen due to the large blade size my schrade schf3n is much easier to use and sharpen and does not dull easily,  I like the 440c stainless blades better than I do the 1095 for all the praise it receives it is overrated , my stainless knifes do not rust but the 1095 Schrade will, I also purchased a large survival knife on ebay and it is much easier to sharpen it is also a much larger knife and it is also stainless it takes an edge right away but the schrade is hard to find the correct angle to get a good edge and dulls faster than it should! Schrade needs to go back and produce more of these knifes for the open market I would buy another! even though it has a few short commings I still really love this knife and so do my friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have really enjoyed both seasons of this excellent series.  it is well done and I am hopeing the third series will be forthcoming<br />soon on prime time.  You definitely feel close to each of the characters and are drawn into the challenges which occur
0811876373|2.0|Great pictures but the print is really really small and tiny.  I almost sent this back as its a pain to try to use.  I could live without this and wouldn't purchase it again or if I had seen the actual size of the print.  Some good ideas but might look elsewhere to get them.
0399160744|5.0|It's a great coffee table book that is sure to entertain guests as well as a bit of inspiration for silly dioramas in your neighborhood.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Great album. Janis Joplin had a desperado yet sultry raspy sound that was truly remarkable.<br />No one has come close to sounding like her. Could have been a combo of her beloved whiskey<br />And cigarettes, but my guess is, it really all came from her heart and soul. She was one of a kind.<br /><br />Cry Baby and Me and Bobby McGee are well known beloved cuts, but check out the other songs<br />You may not be familiar with and sit back and travel in time. What a trip ! Thank you Miss Joplin.<br />R.i.p.
B004DNWPY4|1.0|What a terrible analysis of data!  These two authors use a linear scale to justify their finding.  To give an example, because Kobe Bryant is young and makes a lot of money, he would need over $600 million dollars in the bank to be considered wealthy by their scale.  I think we all would be happy with $20 million in the bank.  They glorify not thrifty people but CHEAP PEOPLE!!!!<br /><br />I am sorry, I cannot respect a person that has $5 million in the bank yet will drive 120 miles to a different airport to fly Southwest Airlines to save $50 on bag fees.  They devote an entire chapter to NOT GIVING your children gifts.  Of note though, they close with a small paragraph about how the millionaires in the end up paying the government in taxes.  Plus their children end up paying estate taxes.  Why not give the gifts when you can enjoy seeing your family enjoy it?<br /><br />If anyone says “This book saved my life” means they are too stupid to live below their means.  DO WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS IF YOU HAVE MONEY!  I was personally insulted to be associated with such CHEAP PEOPLE!  Feel free to enjoy what you earned, that is why you earned it!
B004DSX5B6|3.0|I like the way this multi-tool fits into my hand.  My one comment about that is the plastic feel of the handle can make one think that it is not sturdy enough.  However, this is basically a rubberized cover over steel/Aluminum and is very strong.  There are so many useful tools included in this item and the locking mechanism to allow you to use it without fear of it closing on you is great.  My first Leatherman always had the problem that if you held it wrong the knife blade would start to close on my hand (the same with the other tools).  The positive locking (when opening) a tool here, prevents that.  The locking release is easy to use, but does require two hands to close, instead of one.  But it is a nice multi-tool that should provide years of good service to anyone.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|My daughter and I started watching this to see if it was appropriate for her 8 & 10 year old girls.  We found it's great for any age person.  We all love it and are now watching it again to refresh our memories of the details.  It's a wonderful story and very, very well written.  The acting is so fantastic that it's breath taking to watch.  The costumes are exquisite and the special effects are top notch.  So from 8 years old to grandma's age (that's a secret), we all love it.  It's amazing that they found the &#34;perfect&#34; actor for each character, and then they make you love them in some scenes and hate them in the next.  It's just wonderful and we want the writers & actors & all concerned to know how much our entire family appreciates their work.  We highly recommend this series and once you start it, you will be hooked.  We wait all week for the next installment.  I hope it never ends.
B007EECSFA|5.0|loved this book, couldn't put it down...Great transition between 1941 London & present day!  loved the characters.  Kate Morton writes great books
B00A83075M|1.0|Stupid, annoying, lousey plot and just not good at all. I'd rather watch Monsters inc, Toy Story or Finding Nemo any day.<br /><br />Plus the fans are so obsessed with it its really stupid, some friends of mine that are fans get snappy with me since i don't like it.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I enjoyed this a lot with my family. Lots of hidden treats for those who played video games in the 80s.
B00371XIJE|5.0|If you are a doglover/owner -- you will love hachi ---just a &#34;little&#34; problem -- you need a good amount of tissues
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Best white noise app I have found. Great selection of &#34;noises&#34; to choose from. It tTook a little while to find a easy way to exit the app and the mix capability wasn't immediately apparent (at lest to me).  I still love and use it almost veryday!
B007KW5N9Y|4.0|Great movie with a young but talented Christian Bale.  He seems to have had the spoiled brat part down pat early in his career.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|A good film. Suspenseful, somewhat, but I believe it was Affleck's consolation prize after he was snubbed for Director. Fine.
B00094OBS4|5.0|There's nothing like the Stratocaster... For those of us that enjoy rock concerts on DVD it should be required viewing.
B004C3DLJ8|5.0|Grandkids love it too. Great graphics. What more can I say? I Recommend to all with kids in the house.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Best series ever on HBO.  Better than True Blood which strayed from books.  This series is very like the books and wonderful in atmosphere and locations.  I can't wait to watch the next season so I can read the book.  I want the series to surprise me first.  Can't tell you how refreshing it is when a great series of books are made into films.  True Blood had better change...the fans are not happy.  Buy this series...you won't be disappointed.
B009GED3HS|5.0|It's one of the greats. It helped me through my break up and I have a soft spot for Ted Mosby. It's a really great show
B008C20TDG|5.0|&#34;It Starts With Food&#34; is indeed a life changing information source. I never have any health issues in 67 years of my life  but I love sweets even though sugar had never dominated my life. I gave the the Whole30 program a try as an experiment to see if my sugar demon can go completely from my palate. For 40 years I have been drinking coffee, only a cup, in the morning with creamer because I don't like black coffee. While on Whole30 I gave up coffee entirely. When about three weeks have passed after the initial program I had coffee with creamer---I got violently sick from the sugar in the creamer! My experiment has been successful. I have conquered the sugar dragon! Coffee with creamer is all I wanted to reintroduce in my meal and that is not to be so I am giving up coffee altogether and feel good about it. I lost about 15 pounds in 30 days which I know mostly water along with being completely sugar free and loving it. Any one who wants to give up medications this is the program for it. My husband gave up two medications after being 20 years on them and he does not have any withdrawal symptoms for it.<br />My son who was asthmatic since birth does not need his inhaler any more after 30 days and he is thirty one.<br />My whole family was on this program and all of us have been benefited from this program on different issues.<br />Thanks Whole30, you are indeed a life changer for any one who wants to be free from any kinds cravings thereby improving morale, self esteem, sense of well being and peace of mind.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I can say this book was not bad, but lacked any real sense of story line. But I did finish it.
B007SGM084|5.0|its one of the best books have read so far, used 4 day to read the whole Trilogy. love love loved it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|pintrest is an incredible waste of time and I mean that in the most positive way I can. it has so many great ideas I just wish I could do them all.
B004OZZ624|5.0|This movie is an investment, if you can stick through the beginning which examines how russel crowe's character changes over time you'll be thrilled and moved from beginning to end. It leaves so many thoughts in your head by the end of the movie, you can't help feeling that this is one that will keep you awake at night thinking about the possible scenarios.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Having good luck so far! It's been dropped and is still alive.  Sound is good unlike other reviews. No complaints.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I Liked the other jewlel game so I thought I would try this one and I ended up liking it even beyter
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book was very well written.  It took a little while to remember all the characters, but the more I read, the more I remembered who they were.  There is so much written about WWII, that it was good to read about WWI for a change.
B0058W74UY|1.0|This wasn't explained what it wax to be used for or how to use it so I deleted it out because didn't know what it would be used for
B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie seems often overlooked but is one of my favorites. It's suspenseful and heartwarming. And interesting to see what happened in the Vatican.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|After I ordered it it didn't understand what it was for. It wasn't. Explained that I comprehends it or what it was to be used for
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's cool, it's cool... I mean all my friends read this so I did to... you could say I was forced to read it but I'm glad I ended up reading it.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|I thought it would give me offer on books I like.  The ones they offered weren't in the type of books I liked so I deleted it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Amazing, that's all you need to know. If you read the series before this with Percy Jackson then you'll love this one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is brilliantly written. Intriguing, engaging, and masterfully done! I love the characters, the costumes, story-line, and the setting. Thank you PBS & Masterpiece classic for quality television! Bravo!
B008M721MS|4.0|Stay in close touch !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!  !!!With friends & family!!! It is amazing how you can be so close with them ,seeing live video.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If your a puzzle lover....this is puzzles at their best!! No lost peices, no interrupted games. I highly recommend this game to any and all puzzle enthusiasts. My 7 yr old loves this game too!!
B003U4UNPK|5.0|This is the best season of lost yet!!! The action was intense and it leaves you wanting more.  Check it out!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The actors are brilliant, the story line compelling. You really care about these people. Tough and gritty as they come but also humanity at it's worst and its finest. A must see but not for the faint of heart.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game! I got it two days ago and now I'm a tiger shark.(my favorite shark)  Great graphics,  and great game play. I'm surprised that it is free!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Very good crafted, excellent extra contents, awesome saga. I´ts a great opportunity to relive the best moments of the Star Wars universe.
B00186DV1U|5.0|Picture and sound are great and it was awesome to have seen this movie again. Hopefully you will enjoy as much as I have.
B004W10S9G|5.0|If you are a Christian or not this is a movie that the whole family will enjoy.  Strongly recommende. HD makes this old movie look new.
0316069434|3.0|A very silly ending to what would have been an above average Harry Bosch book. Lately Connelly has been doing much better with Harry's brother Micky.
0345529057|5.0|Amazing books and great quality.  I can't put the books down.  The action and descriptiveness makes you want to keep reading.
B0086213XW|2.0|I'll keep it short.<br />Despite the excellent cast this did not engage me.<br />All in all I found this rather depressing.<br /><br />However, I did like a handsome Seth Rogan. Who knew?
0553801473|5.0|Everything looks pristine about the book.  Hard cover is in good shape, and it will be a great book to read after I finished the first four.
B005544V6A|5.0|I recommend this series to those who enjoy smart yet sometimes distasteful characters<br />who you grow to love and dislike.<br />This well written and acted series is a must for those that like<br />to escape into  the world of corparate and interpersonal ethics.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|very addictive. love to get new dinos<br />and level them up. a must have for Jurassic Park fans<br />five stars all day
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The acting ,writing and production values made for a taught,<br />engaging drama. I look forward to the next seasons tensions.
B003CBVU30|3.0|Superstar is Saturday Night live but over an hour and a half.<br />The result... Saturday Night live should stick with the half hour show.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I give this five stars as the packaging and delivery of the product was sound with no issues. That said it was also a great 3D flick and one of the better ones I've seen. It's a short simple story that you end up wanting more. In that I would give it a three out of five but overall it's a nice purchase if you have a 3D television and want to enjoy it for what it was made to do.
0062238868|5.0|Great book, love it.  I think it was well written and that it is worth a read to everyone. Quick read too.
B001NHNG64|1.0|One has to suspend their belief in reality to like this book.<br />Too many plot holes and unrealistic solutions to the hero's dangerous situations.<br />I had my reservations after reading the first book in the series, but witheld<br />my review, giving Child the benefit of the doubt, before giving up on<br />the series after the second one. No competition for John Sanford.
B00942G4UA|5.0|If you're interested in taking care of your health, you need to watch this movie. If we keep on buying processed foods, food companies will continue making unhealthy foods for us to consume.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game subway surfers is an ok game. After a while it can get a little boring of they don't have special offers like the egg hunt where you get a free hover board to ride. I would suggest to get it if you really like to play games all the time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and it's characters.  Did not care for the movie.  Would suggest to all to read would like to see 2nd movie .
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A very touchy movie. Good acting and entertaining. Filmed in the beautiful city of Paris. Passing the subtitles you will find one of the best movies of the year.
0439023491|3.0|The story is still interesting, even if it is a bit recycled from the first book.  You never get a sense though that there is any closure though, never really giving the reader a chance to relax and enjoy the moment. Ever.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|My 3 year old daughter enjoyed this movie but I didn't realize it would be so violent. There's also guns in it.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|The acting was excellent, but how Joe Wright cultivated the production was poor. I rented the movie, because I enjoyed the novel and the older versions of the film, but this is not worth watching.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|After watching FLIGHT this movie didn't seem as good as I expected although it's really interesting and well done. I guess it's just a matter of taste. I highly recommend it as it is a good movie and full of suspense.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Still reliable without the bells and whistles. Easy to display lists. Like the recommendation features. Replies easy to find and display.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I thought this movie was great and Denzel's performance is exceptional. I highly recommend it. It made me reconsider several of the movies and actors in the running for the Oscar. Don't watch it if you're getting on a plane the next day!
B008K93302|2.0|It was odd that we had have two kindle fires and it worked on one or them but not the other. We had to eventually install the vista pro version. On one kindle it was free from the apps store and on the other one there was a charge? They do work most of the time, but sometimes you have to shut down and re boot the kindle in order for it to work.
1616550414|5.0|I have purchased this as a gift for a relative and the value for money is amazing. the content is stunning and would recommend to any Zelda fan!
B0055Q5F36|3.0|Otterbox didn't fit model of phone stated. Product packaging and service were great though. Would buy again, but with a better product description.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Although this is technical a soup opera the story line is really catching. I enjoy seeing how the wealth Brits lived and how they are brought into the lives of the commoners even if they do not want to. Excellent series.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Our book club is reading \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" for Spring Break. It is familiar to all because of the Judy Garland movie of long ago, but as it usually happens to me, the book was a far better story.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Another must listen from JG. The blend of styles was wonderful and I keep listening to it and still am not tired of it. :-)
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is by far the BEST stage performance I've ever seen. Sierra Boggess (Christine) was born for this role. From start to finish she is Christine. Her acting is superb. This is as close to a live performance you'll ever get. The timeless music is of course wonderful. Ramin (The Phantom) is spectaclar. The feeling he puts into the performance is captivating. You can feel his despair. The entire company is one of the best I've ever seen. They're so in sync from start to finish. So I applaud the casting director. My only complaint is I didn't see it in person. Also, I could see others not enjoying the stage. What I mean by that is if you're used to the normal stages and way plays and operas are usually performed on, this might be a bit much for you at first but give it a chance because it's so well put together. The lovely Sarah Brightman also makes an appearance at the end. That should be enough to make anyone want to buy!!!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Always useful and lasts a pretty long time. Definitely get this over the basic product, and I dunno of any professional ones that beat this for the price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Suspenseful!! The Walking Dead always keeps you wanting more! This is one of the best TV series ever made! !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome<br />Great book amazing<br />A great book one of the best I've read this book was amazing i loved it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I want to watch more!!  I have to wait until the other seasons are free on prime.  Can't wait! :)
B00899F0G8|4.0|While there are certainly some questionable morals in the story itself, the show is so &#34;over the top&#34; in many ways, that my twin 13 year old girls seem to understand that none of what happens is real. It is suspenseful enough to keep my interest, glamorous enough to keep theirs.  It is half mystery, half romance, somewhat gothic maybe.  It is definitely one that I would recommend watching with younger teens so you can talk about any issues, but we have enjoyed it together.  I love that the group of girls remain loyal and friends with each other no matter what - a good quality.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|A refreshing CUTE movie for the whole family. Acting was great! Storyline was on target for the times. Brings smiles!
B002DEI4NG|5.0|Love this show.  Completely appropriate, very, very funny, highlights a beautiful relationship between a mother and daughter.  It is not always perfect and they both have their flaws, but they find ways to work through them.  Great supporting characters.
B007MJSNS8|5.0|Wonderful and entertaining!  Beautiful relationship of young, old and &#34;others&#34;.  Maggie Smith does not disappoint, she is absolutely wonderful and 5 star!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My kids and my wife loved it.  The plot covered all the bases and loose ends without pandering to the audience or taking the easy way out with cliche characters or methods.  Strong female leads.  Good development as well as relevant topics.  80's video game evolution was icing on the cake.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks writes and words everything in each chapter perfectly. He gives you a glimpse inside the character's head to make the reader feel like a part of the book.  Overall great book and would highly recommend it.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I was looking for a doll for my soon to be 2 year old's birthday. After reading about dolls in general, I decided I definitely wanted Corolle dolls (I also have a 4 year old and bought her a Les Cheries). I originally bought the Les Classiques for the 2 year old based on the manufacturer's recommended age, but when I received it, I was very disappointed in how huge it was. Way too big for a 2 year old to carry around, and just looks wrong. I don't know why - just not the right size for a doll. The Les Cheries arrived the same day and I loved it - it will be perfect for my 4 year old, but I digress... so I returned the Les Classiques and thought I'd give this one a try. My other choice was getting a cloth waldorf-style doll. I really want a doll that will become &#34;the&#34; doll and have an heirloom quality to it. This doll arrived today and I love it. I mean, LOVE IT. It's the perfect size, has a very satisfying weight to it, and of course the vanilla smell is divine. The clothes are very simple and cute and easy to remove, and the hat is tight enough that I suspect it has a chance at staying on the doll's head for more than a few minutes :) The arms and legs and face details are so precious. I didn't realize how crappy our other dolls are until I saw this one. It's truly beautiful, like a real baby. Ultimately, though I tend to like more natural fabrics and toys and shy away from plastic, the vinyl body on this doll makes it more lifelike than any cloth doll will ever be, and I suspect my daughter will love it. I immediately just wanted to cuddle it when I saw it! If you're considering a doll for your toddler, I can't imagine something better than this.
B0095P29EG|5.0|i love this movie the speical effects r a mazeing . and i would tell everyone to c it if they haven't .
B00B4VXQC8|2.0|This sounds like a modern rock/pop equivalent to todays Country music. It's chock full of cliches and is pleasant enough as background music, but is indistinct and far too generic to stand up to serious listening and attention. The whole cd sounds inauthentic like writing about hypothetical situatons rather than actual experiences lived and lacks the earnestness in the music and delivery that writing from experience would help bring. Songs are built around cliches and lots of shallow inspirational lyrics, delivered with only a little bit more intensity than singing a telephone book, which make them sound like Jon's just mouthing words he thinks people want to hear. That results in Jon sounding as insincere as a salesman's pitch or politician's speech. It's almost sounds like someone else wrote a bunch of songs they thought sounded like Bon jovi and then the band went ahead and recorded them with little gusto or intensity and this cd is the result. The most catchy and musically interesting track to me is \\"That's what the water made me\\" which lyrically sounds almost nonsensical, but has a catchy chorus and a good keyboard hook to it. Nothing here comes close to their best work, No \\"Lay Your Hands On Me\\", \\"Never Say Goodbye\\", It's My Life\\", \\"She Don't Know Me\\", \\"Tokyo Road\\", or even \\"Have A Nice Day\\". In fact, Richie Sambora's recent solo CD is MUCH better than this (I'd rate it 4/5 stars) as the songs are more personal and musically intense and lack the phoniness of this cd. To sum it up, the band sounds like it's simply run out of things to say here, it's all pleasant, but these guys are way too good to be this bland,shallow,safe,and complacent.
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|I have heard what a wonderful movie this is.  While this movie is the most stunning beauty I have ever seen and digital special effects awesome, it is slow and sometimes boring.  The first 45 minutes except for the visuals and digital special effects at the very beginning are quite dull.  Then there is a ship wreck.  I've seen many movies about that and this one is different because there are animals in Pi's very small boat.  He learns to tame the tiger and become close to the tiger and this saves him.  However, not much else happens for most of the movie, some high frightening waves and spray and then back to the boy and the tiger doing the same thing for an hour or so.  I won't put spoilers in here.  However there is a second story and it is confusing and hard to follow and at that point after two hours, I turned the movie off.  The movie should not contain a second story which I understand after reading what the heck happened on google is horrible for someone seeking spiritual life.
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|of my phone? $3 seems like a lot to pay. So, Mr. Developer, why does this game need full internet access of my phone? An acceptable explanation gets you 5 *. Otherwise there's no reason to allow this on my phone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|So far so good.  Seems go be a great game.  Looking forward to playing it more.<br />Good job on the graphics

B000LB7G00|4.0|Set up was easy, and it worked right away in Trimble SketchUp 3D CAD software.  It also has profiles for many other software products, and makes panning and zooming during Photoshop very easy so you can keep the tool you have selected, active.  This is one of those, &#34;How did I ever live without this?&#34; devices if you do a lot of CAD or Photoshop detail work such as photo restorations.
B006S07YAU|5.0|Great movie! Family friendly and just a good flick to enjoy! It just proves that a movie does not need sex and nudity to endure!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm always looking for books like this one.  I kept wanting to read just one more chapter.  Really great book!
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|This show has sucked me in and won't let me go!! I watch a show every night before bed no matter how late or how tired! How did I ever NOT watched this when it was on TV? I would recommend this show (and do all the time) to anyone that will stand still long enough to listen!
B00499NHLC|5.0|As a Sherlock Holmes fan, I was skeptical about a new series set in modern day.  Episode 1 won me over and I am hooked.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Pages are slow to load and can't find where personal watching file is.  Is okay.  Does get the job done of bidding and winning or not.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Listening to this CD, I was reminded of the phrase which was also the title of the Righteous Brothers' breakout album: Some Blue Eyed Soul.  Boz Scaggs has it.  His voice is as silky as ever.  He doesn't quite reach the low notes at the beginning of Rainy Night in Georgia, but once he hits his stride it's smooth sailing.<br /><br />I love that he picked some lesser known songs by iconic artists.  This is the first cover of Bob Dylan's Corrina, Corrina that I have ever heard, and it's as good as the original in a different way.  I did not recognize Pearl of the Quarter by the title.  When it started, though, I was able to sing along.  I listened to a lot of Steely Dan back in the day.  Again, who else has covered Pearl of the Quarter?  And what a great song it is.<br /><br />Love on a Two Way Street is one of the better known songs from that era.  I remember a co-worker at Burger King using it to prove why hard rock was the only kind of music to listen to (as in, the alternative was Love on a Two Way Street - except I told him that I liked that song and lost his respect forever.  Too bad.)  Admittedly this is not the deepest song ever written, but Boz elevates it with a certain seriousness and sincerity.<br /><br />The spirit of Al Green shines forth often.  Pretty cool how much Boz sounds like Rev. Green when he has a mind to.<br /><br />This is simply great music to kick back to.  It puts a smile on my face.  This is the first Boz Scaggs music I have ever owned, and it won't be the last.  I like this CD a lot.
B004GYY714|1.0|I ordered this app through the Amazon store and  have tried and tried to get it to download but it refuses to appear in the cloud section of apps to be available for download. I have no idea whether it's me, the program or the device, but is sure as frustrating in the extreme.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The story is well-written and the acting is good.  I'm not sure that I would have selected this as the best movie of the year, but it was good.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Excellent novel . I hope the movies lives up to the story. Love does conquer all evil and Have faith and believe in love.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|downloaded this game twice! my daughter and I both enjoyed it! but after reaching the higher levels it crashed both times! the third time wont be a charm because I'm burnt on restarting the stupid game even after I spent money on it! don't bother!
0061978078|5.0|Full review: [...]  My Opinion: I just finished this book and all I can think is: Holy freaking cliffhanger, Batman!!! I kid you not! I haven't been this excited to start the third book in a trilogy in a long time because I HAVE to find out what happens next! I'll try to calm down a little bit and give you my thoughts on this most awesome book.    Lena has made it over the fence and into the Wilds, but unfortunately Alex didn't, and now Lena has to try to find her own way in an unknown and terrifying new world. Near death, she is found by a homesteader, Raven, one of a group of people who live and work together just to survive. There she begins to slowly rebuild her life and find a new purpose.    The chapters switch off between \\"then\\" (when she first got to the Wilds and the months following) and \\"now\\" (approximately six months after that). Both time periods are interesting and the \\"then\\" chapters help us to understand how the \\"now\\" chapters came about.    When you're reading a really good book, a story that you enter completely while reading it, and things are going well for the characters, you just know something bad has to happen to them to shake things up. You feel the dread building up inside of you, knowing it will happen but hoping it doesn't, but at the same time anticipation is building because you know when it does it will catapult the story into whole new exciting places, so that when it does happens you just have to cry out loud \\"Oh my God!\\" THAT's the moment when you know if the author is a good one or a great one. If you can't turn the pages fast enough at that point to find out where the story is taking you now, then it's a great author, and I can unequivocally state that Lauren Oliver is definitely one of the best!!    If you can't tell yet, I devoured this story in less than 24 hours because I didn't care what was going on around me (yeah, I have to apologize to my kids who kept annoyingly requesting things like food and drink, only to be told \\"Just 5 more minutes!\\" Of course, they are kind of used to that by now since this happens a lot with me when I find a really good book :D) and would give it 10 stars if I could! I highly recommend it to lovers of dystopian stories since this is one of the best I've read to date. Since I can't give it 10 stars, I give it a very, very enthusiastic 5 stars!! Now, I have to go bug everyone I know for a copy of Requiem so I can read it right away :D
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun but I don't have the time to figure the game out. Did not  have the time to play the game.
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|First and foremost - I am a HUGE Bon Jovi fan. I bought this album even knowing I thought it might not be the best work they have done. Unfortunately, I wasn't wrong.<br />I gave this 3 stars because of how much I love this band, nothing more.<br />These songs are more of the same formula that Bon Jovi has been coasting along on for years.<br />In a word, this album is boring.<br />I wish they could freshen up their sound.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I can't get Vampire Diaries on TV or computer so I have to wait for the DVD.  I  like the books, but I never thought I would love the show, I am anxiously awaiting the release of season 4!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy will keep you captivated. You won't be able to to put it down! I love the characters and can see the words transform into a movie in my head.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The whole series is one of the best I've seen in a long time! The acting is great and the scenery is magnificent!!
B003U51EE8|5.0|Lost is my favorite tv series bar none. This is my 3rd time watching all the seasons. Streaming was good, quality of the picture was great.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Pendergast, the lead character is built with a solid base, but takes on a superman quality that pushes the limits of acceptability.  Everyone enjoys a good read, but it is hard to accept the premise that the Nazis have stayed true to the course of world domination the past 70 years...
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should watch this.  You must form your own opinions.  Do not watch this before or during a meal.  I wish our leaders would put our land and our countryman above their own interests.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I get interested in the characters and their interaction. I like the two world concepts and the differencies.  the action and suspense are done well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What a fantastic sequel that I ate up in a day. This book pulled on every string that my heart contained. There were joyful moments that made my heart swell and I swear I heard birds chirping in the background to a beautiful melody and then there were moments where my world came crashing down on me, my heart was ripped into pieces, and there were no more birds in the background. I seriously sat during lunch, reading this book and completely forgot to eat.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon are still struggling through their relationship and every event either tears them apart or bonds them together; and there are a lot of events in this book. It is an absolutely intense relationship and book. Gideon's possessiveness and protective side is at its fiercest level in this book. In most ways, this made him so super hot! Eva surprised me with gaining some strength closer to the end that I didn't know her character could possess. And the secret that we have waited for came out in the opening.<br /><br />I love Day's writing ability in both of the Crossfires and I cannot wait to see what is in store for the third. Her writing is beautiful and so in-depth that I could feel the characters emotional struggles within my own head and heart.<br /><br />While reading this book, Kelly Rowland's song \\"Motivation\\" came on and I felt like this song should belong to Eva and Gideon. Just take a second to listen.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />~BookWhisperer Reviewer MC~
B003JTHXOK|3.0|There really was no moment of element of surprise in this story.  The characters and the plot were ordinary and predictable.
B0073X0IOA|5.0|it gives interesting problems and shows nice solutions.<br />when people get less interested in mathematics, this book can help recreate the enthusiasm.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Freezes up at odd times.  Kicks me out of the game when I try to play the second video in the first world.  Hopefully they fix this with an update.  Love all the other angry birds games.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|interesting and fun game. lots to seek and find  finished in about 5 hours. My kids loved this game too.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira is versatile, sensitive, and pure delight in this beautifully crafted growing up tale.  Whether young or old, this story defines a spirited life....
B009YX02T8|5.0|Beautiful! I enjoyed it as well as the movie played it over and over especially fire on the water song
B00005JGAB|5.0|I first heard about The Ramones in 1995, but I had never heard so many people talking about them until 6 years later when they were featured on shows like VH1's 100 Greatest Albums of All Time, and it was then I started realizing just how important they were. Before then I wasn't that interested in them, but once I saw things like that, I slowly started becoming obsessed with the Ramones for a while that year, and thought they were so cool. This album contains many of the songs that have become their most popular throughout the years, and Blitzkrieg Bop is STILL getting played in several places, from classic rock radio, to TV commercials, movie trailers, you name it! And this album is one of the reasons the Ramones have had such a major impact on the punk bands that would come in later years, including another punk band I was starting to become a huge fan of around the same time I became a fan of the Ramones:Green Day, who I also before then wasn't much interested in. While I don't actually own the original album and only have it as the first half of the 1990 compilation:All The Stuff (And More) Volume 1 (so technically I do have it, but you know what I mean), it still holds its legendary status and is may just be the most important album in the history of punk rock.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really loved this book. I will never look at flowers the same again! Also the relationship she tried to achieve was heartbreaking.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I loved this book! Gorgeous writing, wonderful if not tragic autobiographical depiction of Plath's breakdown. I am reading it again right away I liked it so much.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Determination and hard work have resulted in the rise of Jiro Ono as a world class sushi chef.  All future chefs should see this video if they wish to achieve high acclaim.  Great video!
B00005K3O4|5.0|Remember watching this on late night tv with my brother when I was still in elementary. Epic in 4 words, cotton candy human melting coccoons...  This is one I would love to see a remake of!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Not enough Taylor Momsen but Blake is ok<br /><br />Chuck Bass is the greatest though more scoundrel in earlier seasons go
B008O9V4C2|3.0|\\"Sunken Condos\\" represents a big step backward from Donald Fagen's last release \\"Morph The Cat,\\" which was, for the most part, a really fresh and funky change of pace from the stagnant, repetitious jazz groove Steely Dan has been mired in for a long while.  Two unfortunate exceptions on that 2006 album were \\"The Great Pagoda of Funn\\" and \\"The Night Belongs To Mona,\\" both of which basically repeated the recent, way-too-familar Steely Dan formula. Sadly, \\"Sunken Condos\\" picks up where those two songs left off, so it's pretty much déjà vu all over again from start to finish. Not a bad thing, I guess, if that's the kind of repetition you're looking for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is better then the movie. So much more details. I can't wait to read the next book. Very sad.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was doing Insanity but I just couldn't get into it.  Switched over to Jillian's many DVD's and love them.  She kicks butt and makes it quick and easy to get in a good workout.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed, fast paced story, with twists and turns in every page of the book. Looking forward to read the sequel.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I found this book most interesting and thought provoking.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to think &#34;outside&#34; the box - no pun intended.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie has an exciting plane crash, but other than that, all you get is foul language, boozing, and drugging by the main character until, surprise, he uncharacteristically changes his ways.  I suppose miracles do happen, but there's no mention of divine help in this story.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Ditto what has been said about EC mailing this one in, sounding uninspired and all the rest of the mediocre to negative comments.  I'm glad if this CD reflects his contentment with his life but this is definitely the last time I pre-order a CD before its release date and don't know what I am buying until it's too late.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a fairly predictable series about alien invasion of the earth.  I'll keep watching, hoping it might get better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This purchase is worth its cost. I see it benefits already and its ease of use is tremendously fabulous and worth using as an application
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Recommended by my niece - fell in love with the story premise, read the second book and can hardly wait for the final book!
B0086700CM|5.0|This purchase is worth its cost. I see it benefits already and its ease of use is tremendously fabulous and worth using as an application
B00BKEMX28|5.0|It's good the first time you listen. It gets better each successive time until finally it's great. It's exactly what you'd expect given Trent and Atticus recent work together and that's a good thing.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is the kind of game I like!!! Good story and plot! I love big fish games wish there were more available for my kindle fire!!!
B004R1164C|4.0|The husband plans an escape attempt for his wife. The escape attempt is clever. There are some moments of danger and almost getting caught along the way. Interesting.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Claire Danes at her best.  Believable and exciting.  Fully developed relationships.  Even Carrie's sister is a real person.  Can't wait for the next season.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I never wanted to see this movie because of two reasons- the director and the title. The director's personal life aside, the title lead me to believe this was a drama set in Chinatown. There is one scene at the end in Chinatown. This is  a detective murder mystery. There are some very clever detective tricks used in the film. Very low budget and common sense stuff and not all the Dick Tracey futuristic gadgets. The director makes a brief cameo in a memorable scene. This movie is a classic for good reason.
0767817478|5.0|This is a GREAT Godzilla remake. It doesn't have Godzilla doing Karate, or fighting strange other creatures or fighting robots. This is a straight &#34;Godzilla&#34; creature doing what creatures like it do. And in doing what they do they &#34;sort of&#34; damage and destroy stuff.<br />A GREAT addition to any Sci Fy collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I have NOT seen the movie, but I was interested enough to want to read the book.  I am glad I did.  Just from seeing the movie trailer, the book is VERY different!  Be warned, if you buy this book looking for Bradley and Jennifer frolicking around the dance floor, you won't find it.  Pat's story is much better than that.  While the writing can be simplistic at times, the story is well crafted.  Pat is the narrator, however, what Pat doesn't &#34;see&#34; is often supplied through &#34;letters&#34; from Tiffany.  I am not a big fan of this kind of literary strategy, but the author had to find some way to fill in blanks.  If you have seen the movie and loved it, you might not like this.  If you haven't seen the movie, you will like the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series! It has everything a drama should have. I have even gotten my husband into it!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Another one of our favorite TV series.  We added this series to our TV collection.  When TV gets a bit dull, we just slip one of these dvds into the dvd player and enjoy the rest of the evening.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It totally met my expectations of a bond movie with a couple of surprises.  I can not wait for the next one to come out
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We bought this for our collection of movies and bought it as a present for my son and his family that live out of time.  The color was so vivid and beautiful.  Anyone who buys this movie will enjoy it for years to come.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|This record is in my TOP 10 of the last 10 years.<br />GENIUS !!<br />Not at all what I expected but everything I'd hoped it would be.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  This is my most favorite TV series.  I've added it to my collection.<br />Fun to watch when summer arrives and most of shows on TV are all repeats.
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Tracey Thorn has been my favorite vocalist since the first time I heard an Everything But The Girl song.  There is no doubt in my mind, that I will listen to this for the holidays, as long as I live.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|One of my favorite TV series and we bought each and every season for our collection.  Tons of hours of the exciting housewives of Wisteria Lane.  Romance, Comedy, and Drama...all in one!
B002O2THRO|2.0|Very slow and lethargic.  Almost feel asleep in this one. Without the coatails of the writer and the stars, this would be buried.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The continuing saga of interwoven stories of fear, evil, trechery, deciet, honor, power and the unknown told in a sweeping tale of victory and woe...
B00005JLIU|4.0|These girls do ad great job and are fun to watch.  It was fun seeing them in their younger years and the acting levels were at.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Got to see the first season and now this 2nd season.  It just gets better.  Can't wait for Season 3.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Besides written in a impeccable literarily style embedded in poetry and transcendence, brightened with wonder and amazement, sparkled with spirit and sense of humor, Life of Pi is a narrative of the epic character of a human journey for those who dare to be alive and live and love fully.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|A sad depressing read but well written. Feel that a younger person reading this might become very depressed by it.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This cd takes me back to my senior year of high school. Everyone seemed to have a copy of this cd or swapped books 1 or 2 with someone else
B0017SWPXY|5.0|filled with humor, twists and racing, this book made me appreciate my dogs that much more. a brilliant book that made me laugh out loud, tear and want to just throw my hands up in the air in despair.  great writing.  i share everything with my dogs and this book made me reach out to them even more.  love it.
B004PR71JC|4.0|The cd is really good. I enjoy listening to it on a good day. I have to admit that as much as I love the cd I love to hear the music while watching the movie. Every time I hear a song I picture the scene from the movie
B006X5L6VS|5.0|The night sky is easy to setup and comes with complete instructions on how to use it. The best feature is that it can be used outside and away from your wifi connection. I have always enjoyed looking at the stars and planets. I only wish they had this years ago.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|\\"You know you can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes, right?\\"<br /><br />My mind is left wondering about what lies ahead... Wishing it wasn't over, yet. Best way to end a book in my opinion.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a quirky and seriously funny book full of unbelievable coincidences. It somehow links all the world leaders in the 20th. Century to the books hero Allan, with some amazing plot developments along the way. Highly recommend for book clubs as we had a very animated discussion.
B00932AA5G|5.0|Liked the story and acting was good. Watching it has so much action and its like readinng a spy thriller boo. I love foreign films cause its subtitled and the scenery as well. Its worth renting free or buy it.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|The game was frozen half way through.  It was okay until the part where it just wouldnt move and I literally had to turn my Kindle off and back on.  I have a Kindle Fire HD btw.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|CGI and actual actors and scenes work together very well . characters REMAIN the same as they are in indepenednt flicks .  wanna save the world from aliens .....
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This is a epic film!<br />They Definitely did a great job creating this film!<br />I loved it!<br />I especially like how they kept the same actors for the same parts...
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great actors and great plot lines. Good stories told well. It's a shame that they stopped with only one season.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a awesome game to play you get to create your own car. Also you get to race and earn coins.and blahhhhhhhhhh to reply comment by an independent worker and my family thought this was a great way to play for the advice and Justin beiber love you can get a great book is my one of y'all are goo the x factor of y'all are goo to put the shadows of yo cousin and I know I have you been on a diamond ring in only that's ratchet the shadows of y'all are goo and my family video games and Justin beiber love me and the advice on how does a great book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book was daunting at first. But I really dove deep and the craft pulled me in. I deeply respect this author's work and phraseology and ability to &#34;read&#34; Jobs. I suspect he is right about Steve. Maybe underestimates his importance to history and even right now.<br />And I read this book on an iPad2 and am writing this review on it...<br />RIP Steve.......
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you read the title then you know that im serious. this is the best game i have bought on amazon. it is worth every penny. the multiplayer is what got me. if you want a GAME this is it. great graphics even better gameplay and it is smooth. i love it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Almost made me forget how disappointed i was in Quantum of Solace!  The blueray copy is awesome, the DTS Master makes my ears happy and Daniel Craig makes my girlfriend want to watch an action movie more than once... win win win
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a period piece that moves very fast; you will fall in love with the characters both upstairs and downstairs. You will become enthralled with Downton Abbey. One note of caution: do not google a single thing about this show or you WILL be hit with numerous spoilers. Seriously, if you want to know who plays a role or what episode a certain song was on have someone ELSE do it for you!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the story and it had some great hot scenes! Would love to read a follow up book on this couple.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I learned about this app from my friend and have played it A LOT since then. It's really fun on my phone as well as my tablet and is kinda like temple run except way better. It dosent freeze or anything but at the start of the game there is always an add which dosent interrupt u all that much. It's really fun and if u haven't gotten it yet I would highly recommend it for all ages.
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|Edward Prince of Wales was 5'5&#34;; James D'Arcy is 6'3&#34;: he towers above the future duchess, when in reality she was just a couple inches shorter than the future duke, which creates a strange image of these well-known persons. But what really lost me in this rather odd confection was the announcement--ostensibly made by a newsman in 1936--that King George III had died. Why is it that no one with a brain helped to edit Madonna's first film?
0143120530|4.0|A man sat in a meeting hall with a lot of playing cards in his hands, trying to remember the order of the cards by making up a story with bizarre images in his mind in time order. He had his own understanding of every card, which was not easily comprehended. That young man was Joshua Foer, who was a person with nothing special in memory one year ago. However, he became the champion of USA Memory Championship that year. This huge change in that year would be fascinating for everyone if it happened to him or her.<br /><br />This book consists of parts of Foer's experience when he was participating in USA Memory Championship and some concepts of memory. The combination of personal experience and scientific knowledge helps this book to be both interesting and helpful for readers.Furthermore, it fits Foer's purpose which is to claim the importance of memory and how to train memories. If readers try to train their memories by those useful methods, they are going to have good memory as that of Foer. However, the structure is not that clear and this is one of the shortcuts of the combination because personal experience and scientific knowledge are mixed up. Nevertheless, nice stories and useful researches will keep your patience to read. At least, this book is not going to make you bored and fall asleep, so just read the most dramatic experience and learn how to have amazing memory.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Once started into the book i had a hard time laying it down. Looking forward to start the next book.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is not a splashy adventure movie.  It is a wonderful portrait of Lincoln and the passage of the Emancipation Act that freed the slaves.  All of the actors due a wonderful view bringing the story to life.  I think every one interested in U.S. history should see it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has been great for both me and my girlfriend.  It is a great mix of hot, forbidden, sex and a heart warming love story.  Well done to combine the two so seamlessly.  Not quite finished with the third book as I write this but, will be sorry when I through with it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is my first experience with Instant Video.  I am totally hooked on the show.  The audio & video quality is excellent.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I typically can't find time in my day to dedicate towards reading but once I started reading book one I couldn't stop.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|nice graphics interesting concept, good for kids to learn as well. it's better with headphones it says which is true.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stayed up and read this book all night.... literally, it's 5 in the morning as I'm writing this. Best book I've read in a long time!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton is very enjoyable.  Even my husband got hooked.  While season 3 is controversial season 2 was great.  Enjoy it.
B0031RS7MW|3.0|Found the story very repetitive and kept expecting more to come of the storyline but it never did.  Came close to putting the book down without finishing it but kept going in hope that it would improve.  To me, it didn't.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Very interesting game. Great physics.  Wonderfully unique and a pleasure to play. Controls respond quickly.  Hard to put down once you get started.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|While I enjoyed the first two books in the series this one was the best.The story seems to be more exciting and you can't put the book down.I have been a big Jeffery Archer fan. After this book I am a bigger one.Thank you for the many hours of pleasure you have given me.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|AWESOME! AWESOME & MORE AWESOME! Met my expectations, great quality and sound, and BEAT!! Bruno is truly talented artist !
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I absolutely love this series, very eventful and entertaining. Couldn't stop reading the book once I started, will definitely finish the series.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Once you start watching you can't stop. Great character development and a good window into a period of history. The perspective from the different personalities and classes forms a kind of mosaic. But the real fun is that the intrigue and drama are as juicy and addictive as a soap opera while the acting is far superior to a soap opera.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was the first book I read on my Kindle App, absolutely loved it! It was completely intriguing, amazing word choice, and very discriptive. I give 5 stars but if there was more, I would give it 100%.
B00908DDZM|4.0|When I first heard \\"Thrift Shop\\" on the radio, I thought it was a silly but catchy song.  I hadn't heard of Macklemore and Lewis, but just assumed they were going to be a one-hit wonder.  Then I saw the stellar reviews of album as a whole, and decided to purchase it.  I am glad that I did, because this is a very good album with a bunch of terrific songs.<br /><br />This is not your typical hip-hop album.  For example, Track One (Ten Thousand Hours) is based on a concept from Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Outliers\\".  Track Five (Same Love) is a song that fights for gay rights.  Track Eleven (Wings) is about our society's obsession with material items.  There are some catchy beats, but this isn't an album you'll be blasting at parties.  It's an album that will make you listen carefully to the lyrics and think.  My personal favorite is Track Twelve (A Wake), which a beautiful and haunting song.<br /><br />Don't buy this album expecting to hear a bunch of songs similar to \\"Thrift Shop\\".  Go in with an open mind and you will hear a promising new (and different) voice in the world of hip-hip.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|My children as well as myself find this movie mesmorising . We have worn 3 copies of this movie out . I recommend it for all ages young and old alike
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun game for the family and kids love it.  Good way to pass time when waiting around on something. Can't beat the price or fun.  Addictive.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|After a long day, music is great to relax with and even go to sleep with. I recommend this app.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love to play any type of matching game and this is one of the best. The 3-d affects are unique and fun. I love it, and it plays great on my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Most Bible versions are included. If you want audio, someone reading the versus, it is available too. With the Kindle Fire, this app is a great for travel also. I lead an adult Bible study and I use this app often.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|this review is made on the blu-ray disc of the movie -<br />movie - 4.5 / 5<br />video - 5 / 5<br />audio - 5 / 5<br />super movie all around. already viewed 4 times already.<br />video is really, really clean and the audio rocks, especially during the number<br />of incoming tidal waves. visual effects were very very realistic.<br />highly recommended for your collection.
B005O607U8|5.0|Paul Simon is that rare musician who keeps trying new styles, new combinations of players. He reaches out to the best, most interesting folks he can to make the most interesting music. He is always soulful, often funny, and the rhythms are usually on the complex side. This album is as good as anything he has produced over the past thirty or more years. There is no same old-same old in Paul Simon.
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|this review is on the blu-ray disc ( 2D ) of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 4 / 5<br />video - 4 / 5<br />audio - 4 / 5<br /><br />great visuals, but just needed that little nudge to get it to 5 / 5.<br />was expecting the video to blow you out of the water, but it disappointed a bit<br />with regards to the hd viewing impact that was expected to pop even in 2D.<br />should be viewed on a screen no less than 55\\" to appreciate the visual storyboard.<br />score could have been a little more exciting.<br />still recommended if you like circus performances.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Sadly characters seem to have wasted their lives. Nice tale however I found it difficult to really like or be interested in main characters.
B00899EOIS|4.0|How can I get subtitle on here?? If this movie has subtitle, I would rate 5 stars for this. But It doesn't have subtitle as on Netflix.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I usually don't do spinoffs. They usually suck. Like most spinoffs, Atlantis borrows the same &#34;freak of the week&#34; formula as SG-1 only with a new, ever more formidable enemy: the Wraith - like vampires meet the Goa'uld, but without the whimsy. This time, they're in the new city of Atlantis and the new enemy is super strong and its their fault the Wraith are awakened (sorry for the spoiler, but you find this out the very first episode so no real surprise).<br /><br />Anyhow, the dynamic is a little different and the storylines and arcs unsurprisingly similar to the first few seasons or so of SG-1, but the formula works, the characters are genuine (or at least earnest) and lovable, and the special effects are much better. This show is a close second to SG-1 in my book, but a worthy spinoff. I haven't tackled Universe yet, but we'll see.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|this was the best movie that I watched this yr, I watched it 3 times in 1 week and I am going to buy this one I say go get a copy for yourself.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Well written, good heartwarming story with life lessons to live by. Really enjoyed the story and it flowed very well.
B00AKS656U|5.0|Although we are Garfield fanatics, this is a fun, basic game for kids of all ages.  Moves pretty well and very entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Keeps you reading, you want to know what happens. It keeps you guessing and pulls you into the story. It has surprising twists and turns that you don't expect!
B005HSL626|5.0|Have this game on my Kindle & on my pc,...great little game for passing the time.  Highly recommend it to people of all ages.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Saw their concert to kick off their US tour a couple of weeks ago and fell in love. Ordered this and have been listening to it ever since.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I play this on both my Kindle & my pc, great game with many levels to always test your abilities.  Highly recommend it.
B00BM9WM2C|5.0|Never disappointed with a Bon Jovi album. Absolutely love it.  You can definitely hear the passion for music in Jobs voice.  Richie is amazing on the guitar
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Need more games like this one.  Good variety of puzzles vs gameplay.  Would be five star but game stops to have you buy continuation just as you get hooked.
B009KHCT94|2.0|Could have been a lot better , with a little research and better writing. This is a poor attempt at comedy with weak special effects.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wish I could give this book more that 5 stars. Book was so well written. Took my breath away at times,  made me cry, made me happy etc.  I was full of so many emotions and was sad when I needed to put the book down to get some shut eye. The characters protrayed were so realistic & I could relate.  I will forever be a fan of Colleen's writing and look forward to reading Slammed.  You will not regret buying this book.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This has to be the most vanilla vampire book ever. The dull plot drags on and on, and there is absolutely no chemistry between the protagonists. These characters are simpering nicompoops who are, at best, annoying when they're not downright aggravating. For God's sake! Our leading man, supposedly an ultra sophisticated bad-tempered milleniae-old vampire, actually takes his romantic interest, a super sporty and academic reluctant witch, to a yoga class on their first &#34;date&#34;!!! That did it for me, I had to reach for the bucket. I don't know about you, but when I look around my yoga class, the only men I see are either gay or granola foreigners.<br />I think the author should spend less time doing downward dogs and more time in the sack with live ones.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The storylline draws me intro their world. The characters and are so well developed. The actors play their role to perfection. The location is absolutely stunning. It's fun to root for the characters you like and to enjoy the antagonists getting their 'just rewards'. I have watched each episode several times, which is something I never do. The wardrobes are breathtaking and historically accurate. I can't wait till the next season, but I will continue watching the past 3. ENJOY!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book is not politically correct, but it is a great novella, hard to put down once you start reading it.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|This show has an intriguing story line that keeps you guessing what will happen next. I have been a Damien Lewis fan since Band of Brothers and the two short seasons of Life. The thing that turns me off of this show is the nudity and horrific language. I would be a fool to think that a Showtime series would not have foul language but I don't think there is a sentence without the &#34;f-bomb&#34; in it.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I have order this product exactly It identity on the site,  but when i recieved it,  it doesn't<br />fit the phone,  It was a wrong item which is not for Sprint Samsung Galaxy S ii
B000JLQSWE|4.0|This is APPs first album lacking a full orchestra. The recording quality is still second to none but I miss the complexity of the sound which the previous albums had like; Tales of Mistery and Imagination, Turn of a friendly card, Eye in the sky, Gaudi etc.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|Cute picture on the cover ...... that's where all the cuteness ends.  Dysfuctional people all around her, ( her mother, father, girlfriend/ stepmother)it's not surprising that she turned out to be a screwy person with no moral compass.  Unlikeable.
B001N26GFC|5.0|This was a hilarious, thinking person's feel-good film with superb acting that my husband and I both enjoyed!  Can't wait to share it with my &#34;cool&#34; friends!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|one more convenience for the 20th century tech...who goes a day without using a calculator?not in my world ;) luvit!!
B0073PPKNM|4.0|Didn't enjoy the cuts on this one as much as her &#34;My One and Only Thrill&#34;, but still glad to add it to my collection.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Subject matter is very compelling.  Style of writing and organization is not of highest quality, but that's ok.<br />There was a lot of repetition but she had to make it long enough to be a book!
B001NESPHC|5.0|Perfect in every way, what this beautiful new gifted artist can do with a song! All twelve tracks are flawless!
0399159029|2.0|Prague Fatale was my introduction to Philip Kerr's writing and, given his popularity, I expected so much more. Bernie Gunther is such an unrealistic character. He is absolutely too good to be true, combining his heroic, knightly qualities with open disdain for the Nazi regime of which he is part. We are asked to accept that Bernie is some kind of demigod, while the others, the real Nazis, are a bunch of buffoons. I don't think so. My acquaintance with Mr Kerr will be a short one.
B000002UTY|4.0|Though most of this, time-wise, is Ellis McDaniels (Bo Diddley) tunes, I find this a very fun and rockin' album.  Of note is a stretched-out version of &#34;Who Do You Love&#34;, with various jammages inserted in the middle, and named like, &#34;Where Do You Love&#34;, &#34;How Do You Love&#34;, etc.
B00BGZ8TVA|3.0|It was a different movie, seemed a bit slow but the concept kept your attention. I will say I did like it, but I don't think it was worth the price.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This is a bit on the cute side, as Paulie sometimes is prone to be, but he's a first-rate musician, singer and songwriter, so I'm happy to indulge him when he's exploring different territories...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Woah.<br />Holy crap, that was good.<br />The wife disappears on their 5th anniversary. The husband's story starts right before the disappearance, and hers starts at the beginning of the relationship when things were roses. And even after you learn what happened, it just gets more twisted.<br />Masterfully written with so many twists and turns and red herrings and deliciously screwed up people and my gosh, can I gush more about this book? Now I know why my e-library had 1,047 holds on it.
B00005R8FI|5.0|It was a turning point, both for John Mayall personally, as well as being an album of blues that even generally non-blues fans could like and give the genre some more exposure...loved it back then and love it still!
0345803493|5.0|Love the second book in this trilogy.....&#34;Fifty&#34; is getting more and more relaxed with Ana and letting her in on some of his &#34;dark secrets&#34; -- the reasons he is the way he is.......and I just LOVE the ending.......and now looking forward to book 3!
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Some originals and some unexpected treasures.  He's in fine form here, at his Chicago night club.  Keep on, keepin' on, Mr. Guy!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie wastes no time at all, and you don't want it to. Rented this to watch before seeing Taken 2 in the theater. Don't expect anything profound but if action is what you want for around 90 minutes, look no further.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Even though the app is free, it's not worth it on the kindle. It doesn't work on the kindle like it works on your laptop or phone!!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The psychological elements of this trilogy are enlightening. The romantic portions are cheap imitations of a steamy Harlequin sex novel. Reality never meets Harlequin. The central character's history and constant drama are a decent read though, and shed introspection into the lives of some who endure tragic childhood.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Did not know the story of the Americans that were saved by the Canadians.  I remember the fall of the Shah and the frantic flights that went into Iran to bring people out.  I had finished my service as a US Army Captain in December 1978 and my family and I were flying back to the States from Frankfurt, West Germany.  Our flight home was delayed many times because planes were re-directed to Teheran to get persons out of there.
0375850864|5.0|At the beginning it's a bit boring but then it sucks you into this amazing world of time!<br />I could not get my head out of it.<br />I convinced my mom and brother to read this book, and they loved it!<br />BEST BOOK EVER!<br />You will LOVE it!<br />Written by an 8 and a half year old.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Ever since I started watching Season 1 on Netflix, I've been hooked on The Walking Dead. I'm not one to religiously watch a TV show, nor did I think I'd like this show that much as I'm not really into zombies, but I just watched Season 3 in about 3 days. Love it. The characters are just perfect and it always stays interesting. Can't wait for the finale!
B0014ERKO0|5.0|if you know the history of the plot, you will love this section.  IF not you may need to read about it to get up to date...
B00499NHLC|5.0|A great update on the classic stories.  I especially like how the writers sometimes take only a small detail from an original Sherlock Holmes mystery and weave an entirely new tale around it.  Excellent entertainment!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love every episode. Characters are witty. It is beautiful to watch and I like the period aspect of it.
B00BNPZAEM|4.0|I loved this album from beginning to end...looking forward to his **Secretive** tour he's planning for this album.  Go with the special edition, the bonus tracks are equally as great!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Post apocolypse, aliens, drama, intrigue. I like it. Excellent scifi. Not so tech oriented that you need to be a scientist to enjoy.
0316044938|3.0|Was OK.  Kinda was ready for the book to end.  Was surprised at the redundancy.  Overall was something good to read.  I really liked the movie!
B009FZFONO|5.0|just watch it! Emotionally charged show with breathe taking visuals you will be on the edge of the couch for every episode the 43 minutes goes by too fast. Plus there’s Darryl Dixon enough said.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is a great show...better than a TV recording...no commericials...great to be able to go back and review characters and stories.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Never expected the ending. I had tears in my eyes and a smile on my lips. The trilogy doesn't disappoint. And I know I will be reading it again.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I just finished watching this with my children and they LOVED this movie. Even I enjoyed it. This movie wasn't about one holiday or another, it was about bringing back all the magic of childhood. What a wonderful film, completely enchanting. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a little magic in their day or wishes to give it to a child.
B006LSZECO|5.0|well written, and with the distraction of a poorly written novel gone, i could read without pause, and i did. The story was a mystery maze. At first i was disapointed. I feared another sweet love story, or sad tragic tale. But, the story, though exagerated, was one close to the truth about relationships. People present facades and accomodate the needs and desires of others. A psychological dance leads many into relationships and then out. Fasinating tale, intricate puzzle. I want to read more works by this author.
B005HEF8OC|4.0|I have always been a lover of Star Trek, there's no exception here.  I really like the approach of tell the story from how it all began.
009193768X|5.0|Classic recipes, can't wait to make them!  Small and compact and genuinely lovely.  I think it'll be readily used in my house!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This a wonderful weaving of the present and war torn London.  It was suspenseful in a good way.  It had wonderful character development.  Interesting ending!
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Such a great movie with so much history - loved learning all about Sound City and the great story behind all the awesome records.  Dave did it justice - I definitely cried in the end!
B008BU70HW|3.0|this book  really worthles.  there was no new information just a repeat of old in formation.  if u watch the series u know this already.
B000002J1X|5.0|I bought this CD together with the Yes - Yes album...originally this was a double longplaying and I've once owned the album, so this was a renewed meeting with this great band...
B003CNQPNS|5.0|I loved this show as a kid and watching it still entertains me. Plus my kids love it too!! Great show!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Found this as a recommended read when searching  in other favorite authors, e.g. Phiip K Dick. Dystopian tale of a future that seems quite possible on several levels. A good and enjoyable read. You'll like this.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Cher & Christina what a great combination to make a movie. Not only they both have total different voices that fit perfectly, but also their acting style works superb together.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game was free and normally I don't give reviews but this game is pretty cute. it helps me pass the time at work...
B00BHMF578|3.0|I liked the beginning of the movie and the idea of it. In total I'm a bit disappointed as it has been dragged out on several occasions.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I was JUST wishing I could afford this 'higher' priced game browsing on Google Play. All the reviews were so positive. Plus this is a different kind of game, than most. A SMART game. With GREAT Music too!! You will be pleased I'm sure, especially if your a science geek like me. A little tip, most phones work better if you turn off the gyro thingy on your phone if u find the game isn't working right for you try that. This game reminds me of opposite reaction type. Unless your actually knowledgeable in This Science.... I was lucky to pick this game up on FAOTD. But its worth the money if your looking for something different, soothing sounds and game play..The SMART SCIENCE Part is a Plus if you understand that/this sort of stuff. Samsung S3.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Well, once again Martin ignores traditional episodic plot structure with clear beginnings, middles, and endings. Most characters' stories don't achieve closure unless they die, which is usually much sooner than you expect. And then there are the characters who are miraculously still around. I truly never expected Cersei to survive this long, but her chapters are frequently some of the most compelling, and her harrowing ordeal near the end of the book is a great moment in the journey of her character. She's awful, yes, but one wonders if she is truly evil, when we see what happens to most of the characters who try to be good in this world, like Ned, Robb and Catelyn. Is it wrong to want to survive? In this world, you either seize power, or you're ruled by it. &#34;There is no middle ground.&#34; And if I had to live in Westeros, I think I'd rather seize it.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This is one of the best cartoon movies of 2012.  My kids and I both love this movie.  The youngest child of mine wants to watch it everyday and she is 3 years old.  Very family friendly and very original movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Has a little of everything....drama, suspense, pseudo science and true science, romance, along with some great actors, my favorite being &#34;Walter&#34;.  If Walter ever leaves the show, I don't believe I would enjoy it so much.  I hope the series goes on and on and on !!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this one of the best series I've watched was not sure it was my style of shows but was
B00785P2QC|4.0|its an ok app I just think that more should be avalible for free and not constantly tell me to buy something but overall its a good app for being free
B0090EIILU|3.0|This movie was mediocre. There were some funny parts, but it wasn't great all around. Being a huge Borat fan I was exited, but came out disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Last chapter was a something unexpected!  Would recommend this trilogy for the story line as well as the knowledge of a different side of relationships that can spice things up.
B0069VRKG6|5.0|I love this movie.  Extraordinary stars, wonderful story.  A little bit vintage.  I<br />enjoyed every minute of it.  Watch it.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|This book was a good read! There were many scientific facts and even though some situations were hard to believe I feel this book did a great job on creating the environment.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was so much better then i thought it would be!  I learned some history while watching this exciting movie and didn't want it to end!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|...and believe these Truths...and then the vibration of our planet will soar and benefit ALL of God's Creations...Thank you Dr.Alexander for sharing your beautiful experience.
B002RI9ZRC|5.0|Enjoyed the book. Comprehensive overview. Could have included progress up to Feynman. Some coverage of manhattan project would have rounded up the issues nicely.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Excellent movie! Sean Penn did an amazing job but Emile Hersch was awesome. There was no happy ending but it still reflects the battle between man and nature.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Great nostalgia and story-line. Pretty much what you'd come to expect from a pixar movie.<br /><br />Five more words are required.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is really a great set. Great movies, great Blu-ray transfers, and it just looks great! Plus, the discount in the collectible memorabilia that comes out this year, which is a major bonus.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|I remember when I was a child.... &#34;Wanted Dead or Alive&#34;, you miss him Steve! No comment. A very good performance. Inevitable S. McQUEEN's movie.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Intriguing.  Interesting array of characters, and their perceptions of life.  Suspenseful.  Touching. I recommend reading, it's definitely worth your time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you love the series you'll love the DVD.  Really no review is needed.  It's just fantastic!  One of the best television series ever made.
B008133MDK|5.0|Awesome.  Can't wait for season three in the fall.  much better than any other crime show available mini-movies no commercails
076781326X|5.0|love this dvd<br />hard to find from my childhood memories of watching it on tv<br />its great and unique<br />love it
0399160450|5.0|Why do you need me to describe my purchase in nineteen words or less? Cant I just type good to go?
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I gave Skyfall 5 stars because it, like all the Bond movies and its unique elements that added surprises, excitement, and entertainment. Seeing Bond's original home gave the character depth and personality. Other major events in the movie laid the foundation for future adventures and changes. I would recommend Skyfall to anyone who has enjoyed previous Bond movies.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|i enjoyed the characters, and the plot had enough twists and or details that it didn't feel too overdone like many childrens movies. The characters were really well thought out and interactions between them was really fun. As a gamer it was nice to see all the different game characters. Would have loved some gamer gags and references, but it was pretty general. That's why it got 4 stars. they could have really played to the gamer audience especially the old school gamers by doing even little things in the background, but they didn't.<br /><br />I wouldn't' mind owning this movie.
1451613512|4.0|The first few chapters of this were a huge relief in the amount of information that I was given and how much history was covered. Yes, a few things are a bit biased here and there, but they never claimed to be writing an exponential piece. This book is a great source to fill in the blanks of the increasingly pathetic public education system. After reading this book I felt cheated by my K-12 education.
B0094KT8PK|5.0|Good pairing of Reynolds and Bullock. Betty White always adds her comedic touch to any scene she is in.<br />A must watch, be sure to catch the bloopers at the end of the film.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This has enough twists and turns to keep everyone reading, guessing and smiling. Grisham is an excellent story teller no matter how complex or not the plot.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|WOW is all I can say. I cant wait for the movie. I did not put it down for 3 days what a story !!!!!
B00A3VLJCE|2.0|The program uses the photo shop name in its heading but has very little of the abilities I was looking for in doing photo enhancements
0345803485|5.0|This book was everything I expected it to be and much more. Being that it is, I wasn't sure what to expect, I was given mixed feelings about the book from friends. However, I did enjoy this book very much. I think every mature women would enjoy this who doesn't mind reading about sexual activities.
078322740X|5.0|Great movie!! This is so funny and does have a happy ending.<br />It did leave you wondering for awhile. Both Martin and Hawn are wonderful actors.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The actual DVD gets 5 stars for being in great condition.<br />Just to the movie makers, this was good but nothing beats Matt Damon in<br />my eyes.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think this is the best overall James Bond ever.  Equal amounts of drama, action, character development, tying up loose ends while setting the stage for the &#34;old characters&#34; to start over again.  Excellent.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've been wanting a backpack for my cameras and this one is perfect.  I can fit both my Canon cameras and three lenses.  Also enough room for my lens cleaner and pamphlets.  From the outside noone will realize its a camera back.  Great for security.
B0094K1K8I|4.0|Paranormal activity was great. It takes you back 2 when they were kids & tells the story of how this entity started messing with them girls. I loved all the movies & i think they should make a 5th one about how the grandmother made a pact with this entity for wealth & power. That would b great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it is great the calculator works perfectly. from time to time I need to do some mate work and it make it really easy.
B008Y78M60|4.0|Very revealing, different angle. Story you never hear about! Great family movie, and a learning experience for all. Would recommend.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Left me speechless, great book btw. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quick read. Took me a day to finish it I believe.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a fantastic series! The dvd is  of great quality.  This is an optimal program and I recommend to anyone needing something worthwhile and of SUBSTANCE!!!!!!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If you haven't read this book yet go watch the pacific its the HBO miniseries that is similar to band of brothers. You will find out who E.B. Sledge is.. That's what made me buy this book and I was glad I watched the miniseries first. It helped me to figure out who all the characters were in the book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Fast delivery, high quality dvd. This series was absolutely one of the finest I have seen in a long time.  We have thoroughly enjoyed this product.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|I ordered HD.  It was terrible. The quality was poor. At one point the screen goes dark.  The system was loading more of the movie.  The  movie looked as if it was a cheap copy of Skyfall filmed inside a cinema with a video camera from the 80's. I was disappointed. A waste of money.  I still want to see the movie.....I think I'll rent it from Redbox.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|Justin Hayward still is the romantic troubador, penning songs with a touch of old English charm blended with the Moody's modern rock and symphonic sound. The new material here is especially strong, The opener, &#34;One Day, Someday&#34; is especially good, &#34;Western Sky&#34; and &#34;The Easter Sun&#34; equally good, especially the bare &#34;Eastern Sun&#34; backed by Hayward's gentle guitar picking.  &#34;In the Beginning&#34; and &#34;On the Road to Love&#34; pick up the pace, and &#34;Lazy Afternoon&#34; is the perfect musical accompaniment to a Sunday morning in summer.  &#34;Captivated by You&#34; is also interesting - gentle verses, rough bridges and choruses, warring in the song to good effect.<br /><br />The songs that mar the album are the uncharacteristic ones, the countrified &#34;What you Resist, Persists,&#34;, and &#34;It's Cold Outside of Your Heart,&#34; - not because they aren't well done, I just don't prefer country music.  The countified reworking of &#34;Broken Dream&#34; from Hayward's earlier &#34;View from the Hill&#34; is more successful, largely because it is nearly impossible to mar the beauty of that song, one of his best.  The dance remixes of &#34;Out There Somewhere&#34; could have been left out there, somewhere as well, as Disco / dance remixes are also a musical genre I've been actively attempting to suppress all memory of.  Buy the album, if you like Hayward.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Every now and then, a book comes out that will change your perspective of life. Corny, but true. This book had me up until 2 in the morning reading it was so good. It follows the stories of two lovers: Park, a geeky half- Korean kid who likes comic books and punk music, and Eleanor, a big girl who is the eldest of five children, who has a drunk, abusive stedad. They fall in love, and the story talks about their lives with eachother.<br />  This novel was beautifully written. I STRONGLY recommend it to ANYONE who loves a wonderful story. Cheers to Rainbow Rowell!!!!!!!!! Excellent novel!!!! :)
B005K2XUPK|4.0|This is a solid &#34;basic&#34; holder for my Kindle without any bells and whistles.  It is solid, well made, and attractive in the colors I chose.  It does not have a stand, it doesn't attach to the kindle, there are no additional pockets, and as I said, there are no extras.  The velcro flap holder works very well.  I found that it gives excellent protection for my kindle, and would recommend it as extremely good for what it is.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno does it again. His songs are new and fresh but you still get that vintage feel. I love it!))
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This is a good basic app for Ebay users.  The interface is not intuitive, and there are many things that cannot be done here.  As  primarily a seller, I basically just use it to check when something has sold, but have to do the majority of my Ebay work at my computer.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I purchased this book because I finally felt like getting in shape. I've done countless routines ranging to 5x5's, All Pro and 5 day splits and this is the best i've come across. Thanks Mike!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Ending falls flat. The story takes too many turns and is just stupid in the end. I give it three stars
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I got these shoes for my husband, who just loves them.  Very comfortable and also just the right style of casual-chic.  I will say that I disagreed with some other reviews that said to size up when you fall between sizes; we had the opposite experience.  My husband is a 10.5 normally, and the 10 in these was perfect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is an awesome app as specially for my kindle fire.  It runs perfectly and its almost<br />as good as the original thing.  It's very fun and good for long trips.  It's<br />worth more then $7.  You should get it.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|My kids are getting older and have recently discovered Glee. I have thoroughly enjoyed re-watching some of the old episodes, and hearing them talk about it. What a great show!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friends and I make really cool worlds, then we have get-togethers and play minecraft together. You can make a dream home on creative, or create a society fighting for peace on survival. On creative mode, I have made houses out of many materials including stone, wood, obsidian, glass, diamond, gold, and various colors of dyed wool. You can make a ton of stuff on minecraft, and I love it. The only downside is the fact that it costs quite a lot.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This novel is unedited King - very long, but very well-written, entertaining and thought-provoking.  King created characters in this novel that I cared about and made me think about possibilities I never considered.  There are so many reviews that I won't re-hash the plot, but I can say that this is storyteller King, not horror-storytelling King, and he can tell a story.  The sheer length made me give it four starts, but I'd recommend it wholeheartedly, as it was one of the best reads I've had in some time.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love this game!  The tiles are easy to see and there are many levels. I would recommend this my friends
B001NHNG64|5.0|Late convert to Lee Child. I saw the Jack Reacher movie starring Tom Cruise, and thought the Reacher series may be worth reading. I have read one short story and novels 1 and 2 via a Kindle, and have not been disappointed yet. Child builds the plot like a good stew...bits and pieces abound unlike early Tom Clancy who bogged down with minutiae. I highly recommend.
0765325950|5.0|perfect and realistic ending ,, thank you RJ and may you find the eternal Light.<br /><br />the last Last Battle was more than what i had excepted ,, the brutality of of was vividly described ...<br /><br />i give 5 stars for the final book and 4 for the overall series
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|I bought this app for my 5 yr. Old grandson and he loves it.  After he had figured out how to get the highest score he taught me how to play.  Now we play together and he loves it!  There are numerous types of rollercoasters and they bring back fond memories for me which I have shared with him.  It has been fun watching the expressions on his face as he realizes that grandma used to be a little girl!!
B000RJO578|4.0|I like the Brit style of comedy. Very funny but turned a little strange in the middle of the movie.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 5 yr.old grandson LOVES this app.  I think I may have a budding artist on my hands!  I enjoy seeing his creativity.  I may soon have to invest in another Kindle so his 2 yr. old brother can have equal time during their visits.  What a great idea!  Grandma get's to upgrade to the new Kindle Fire HD, for the grandsons of course! ;-)
B00005JNQS|5.0|I first bought this DVD for my 2-year-old niece.  She loved it so much and played it so much that she actually wore<br />the DVD out.  I managed to find another copy on Amazon.com and sent it to her and she is now a happy little girl once more.  She absolutely loved this DVD.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|The sound becomes garbled about 30 seconds in and then drops in and out.<br />I called customer support and they were very courteous, but unable to fix the problem.  They said they would report the issue, but no one has contacted me.  They admit there is a problem and yet did not offer a refund.<br /><br />It was worth it to me to find out there are still issues with downloading movies from the internet.<br /><br />I guess I will stick to buying DVDs for a couple more years.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just wish you could make money easier...<br />Very entertaining though. Me and my daughter love it. Great for any age.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very entertaining, prices for up grades are high, but guess I just have to keep playing ! Passes the time tho.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A brand new constraint on human existence lets us look at the human condition through Hugh Howey's unique lens. Involving, compelling and I now need to know what happened before and what will happen next. The first I have already started on in the prequel series and then I will have to wait and hope for a sequel.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|My son LOVES this movie. He's only 2 and its surprising he loves it as much as he does, but he adores Walle. I do think they outdid themselves on this.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I think the casting and the plotlines of this show are a bit different than the usual police procedural.  I enjoy the sparring that goes on in the relationship.  Reminds me of Moonlighting.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins does a great job.  Very believable.  Will appeal to thr baby boomer generation.  I would watch the movie again.
B0045HCJGC|3.0|Last night my bargain-rack movie was the \\"Demolition Man\\" DVD staring Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes. I've been watching Chuck Norris action movies and thought I'd switch action characters. Well, it was a switch, all right. I hadn't watched a Stallone movie since the early 80s. I gave up on them because he was such a bad actor. Well, the acting in this movie is atrocious, but I'd guess it's supposed to be as part of a comedy-like background. Snipes is awful too. Plus the movie is filled with all kinds of jokes and some of them are even kinda funny. Most are lame or low-brow, but, again, it's kind of a humorous overtone this movie is attempting to push, and it's partially successful. I was laughing here and there. Mostly I was groaning. Well, it's hard to take the movie seriously in any way and I was foolish to even try. Even as an action police thriller, it's hard to get wrapped up in the story. Is it an entertaining movie? Yes, I'd say it was, but the entertainment value got to be less and less as he movie progressed and by the end, I was happy to see the closing credits.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the future, 2032 to be specific. Both Stallone, the aptly-named Demolition Man, and Snipes have been frozen, preserved and then brought back to life in an ultra-moodern Santa Barbara-Los Angeles-San Diego mega-city known as San Angeles, or something like that. The city is really high tech. It has automated graffiti-making machines and automated cleaning-up devices. It's sorta funny on many different levels. Stallone and Snipes continue their late 20th century battles, which consists mainly of indiscriminate gunfire and the destruction of everything in sight and receiving tickets for their abusive language. Lots of tickets. It's not much of a story and wears thin as.the movie progresses. Well, I enjoyed it, sorta. Would I watch it again? No.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B008OOYALE|5.0|THIS IS A PRETTY CUTE GAME. THE ONLY DOWNSIDES TO IT IS HOW LONG IT TAKES TO EVOLVE AND HATCH THE DRAGONS. ALSO THE FARMS SUCK BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOREVER TO HARVEST SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT OF FOOD...
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|Based on the novel by Leo Tolstoy, this is a tale of Russian high society in the 1800's. Much of the film takes place on a stage as if to say &#34;Life is but a stage...&#34;. Sounds improbable but it is a powerful tool as used by the director and cast. Wrenching emotional impact of how Anna Karenina faces a life of neglect from her philandering husband and meets a dashing and aggressively forward Count. They start an affair which changes her life but of course in 19th century Russia among the aristocratic set, there are consequences. Extremely well done, powerful story, deserved best picture but only won Best Costume Design. Don't miss this one.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|What a great movie!  My young boys continued to smile and laugh throughout the whole movie.  I would recommend watching.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|To some, Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. I'm in that camp. Seeing this restored version, scanned at 4K resolution, is a wonderful experience. The image is flawless, the music soars, the desert so intimidating, the huge battle scenes of hundreds of Arabs on camel or horseback breathtaking. The huge sweep of this film is something you will never see in a contemporary film. The story of the brilliant T E Lawrence will captivate you. A must see.
B009O36EO0|5.0|I stumbled upon Loreen when I saw her perform live at Allsang in Stockholm in June 2012. (youtube it!) The moment she opened her mouth, I was so captivated I swerved to grab my best friend and spilled my drink all over myself. This dark, mysterious woman was the winner of the Eurovision song contest in 2012 and has feverishly toured Europe for the last year. She has great range, and a luscious, heartbroken voice that is showcased especially on her slower, more stripped down songs. (Do We Even Matter, In My Head) She manages to fit dance, downtempo, acoustic and trip hop all into one brilliant album. There really is something for everybody if you are a general pop/dance music fan. I personally love her up tempo dance tracks, but was pleasantly surprised by her slow songs...they evoke such emotion and heartache. The production is very sharp and modern, and that voice...is just a must hear. I hope more people in the states discover this unique and wonderful talent from Sweden.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Easy to snap on an off, No more fumbling with the tablet and inadvertently trying to put micro USB charger into the micro HDMI port!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|For those that enjoyed SG-1, the lost city has been found. Featuring a new cast, the adventures continue in the Pegasus galaxy, with an all new enemy race, the Wraith. A must watch if you are a true Stargate fan.
B00406O7YK|5.0|In these days of information overload of drone strikes and politicians/pundits on 24/7 jabbering about anything that is bothering them at the time, this movie was an oasis in the desert of the 24 hour news cycle we have on cable tv and the worldwide web.<br /><br />I didn't realize that this movie was an intergral part of the movie by Pixar, Wall-E, where a desolate earth destroyed by mankind (I am guessing, since I didn't see it) is seen through the eyes of droid-type robot that is captivated by themes that resonate through this movie.  Boy, I really think the world would be a little better off digging their eyes, minds and fingers off their smart phones and ipads to see something like this movie to put some humanity back in to our daily lives.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite books, It puts a nice face to the work monster. An helps little ones see that not everything has to be scary.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|After reading s.t.'s review, I am not sure I can add in any way to what was written.  His review was remarkably thorough.<br /><br />That said, I originally debated between 4 and 5 stars for this album. My dilemma was simple: \\"Do I compare this album with David Bowie's past classics?\\" No, I think that would be a little unfair. Music has changed and so has Bowie.  Rather, I believe it is best to compare the album with the music that is current or at least music from the last ten years. Comparing this to \\"current\\" rock albums, the genre it mostly aligns, this is a five star album.<br /><br />Granted it is not an album for everyone. Still no album is. I give little credence to those who criticize this album for not being like today's \\"pop\\".  Bowie's music is not \\"pop\\" nor is trying to be. Those in tuned to music mainstream will likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Musically its style is often discordant with heavy guitar riffs, orchestral swills, and drum and bass beats. At times it takes an 180 degree turn and goes into an acoustic strip down. This can be disheartening to those unfamiliar with Bowie who may not understand these transitions.<br /><br />It is an emotional album, but not the same sense as one might consider. It emotions are those that reside deeper into the spirit of the human condition. These are the dark emotions we often try to keep hidden and certainly do not sing about.  The album is not about love, romance, happiness or subjects that dominate today's radio mainstay. Isolation, alienation, war, misunderstanding, and revenge are themes on this album. Mixed with cryptic lyrics with uses of references to history, philosophy and culture one has to think when listening. Not always a pleasant experience when I am looking just for relaxation.  However, I know there are other Bowie albums fit that bill better.<br /><br />Would I recommend this album?  If you like Bowie, classic rock, complex and layered compositions, and intellectually challenging lyrics, then yes, this album will sit well. If you want music that is catchy, easy to sing and filled with mainstream familiarity and happiness, then no.n yes, this album will sit well. If you want music that is catchy, easy to sing and filled with mainstream familiarity and happiness, then no.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|When you are level 8 and you get the collect 500000 lifetime coins challenge, the bar gets stuck and you won't pass the challenge. I'm over 500000 and I never got the challenge accepted. Very frustrating.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is a different but fresh take on Sherlock and Watson!!  Once you start watching, you can't stop.  Each episode builds and defines the characters.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I love the fact that I can get a quick glance and see what my schedule is. I don't have to click on the day and see what appointments I have...it is there in a glance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Each season just get's better and better. Those mid-season breaks are not any fun though, I can do without that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombies, Zombies, Zombies! This season is so exciting. I'm glad Rick is getting past his loss. The group is small but stronger than ever. Great show!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love this. It tells you exactly how much battery life is left and how long it will take to charge.  Not sure about the comments on battery life as I use my Kindle a lot and charge it every night. Would recommend it.
B009YVBZO6|1.0|Do not waste your time with this app unless all you want to do is to listen to some mindless music.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Enjoyed it and the acting is good and the show decent. You can recommend to a friend. Watch and not be uncomfortable with the story, which is not the case of most shows nowadays.
B004XISI4A|3.0|I'd read the next one to find out, but a little slow paced for me. More Dragons and more Wights!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I've got close ties to this movie, so I may be a bit partial. However, it is a movie that I can watch multiple times and find something new every time I watch it. While it isn't a scary movie, I wouldn't recommend it for children since it deals with more mature subject matters that young children cannot grasp or appreciate. The animals are not cutesy &#34;Noah's Ark&#34; fluffy cuddly animals. They are *real* animals with real animalistic tendencies. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone wanting to get away from the usual movie plot.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This is a awesome move & price.I was actually surprised because I was afraid it was not going be the actual movie.Certain companies you need to be careful.To sell a product for cheap can be good/bad.Just all depends on the item you are getting & by reading the reviews too.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I love a good murder mystery. And the mystery is maintained well into this book. But I am also a reader who likes to know &#34;who's side&#34; I'm on. As I found with the movie &#34;Grifters&#34;, I didn't really stand on anyone's (I mean ANYone's) side in this story. I believe characters can have flaws and still be likeable, but somehow I didn't bond with any of the characters in this book. But it held my interest pretty well considering this &#34;fault&#34;! My &#34;It's okay&#34; rating is a high Okay. More like a &#34;Pretty Good&#34;.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Fun game. Learn to plan as you go along. Can improve with every game. I like challenges. Would buy again.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The plot moves quickly and there are many interesting characters. And the sets are amazing. I like knowing that its all historically accurate, except for the plot.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This app is very cute and entertaining. My 15 month old loves it, especially making talkingTom see stars and pur.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|With a strong overarching plot (Xindi) to the entire season (with a few standalone episodes thrown in), this is probably the strongest season of Enterprise.
B00009NQQO|4.0|My 15 month old loves playing with this in the tub, Its durable and sticks well to the marble walls
B00BHMF578|5.0|While I'm sure that some of the facts of the event were changed somewhat in the movie, the basic act was one of significance.  The movie gives you an appreciation for the risks that Americans are willing to take for each other.  The acting is outstanding and you feel like you are right there with them.  Since my family and I spent two years in Iran just before the fall of the Embassy, this was very real to me.  There is no surprise in it being the Oscar picture.
B004S26HB2|5.0|Down to earth and logical.<br />Although much of what Enchantment talks about is basic common sense, seeing it written on a page makes it come to life and practical.
0399160450|5.0|I agree it's not on par with the early Clancy novels, but it is still the best in the genre. The narrative flows nicely, but the character development is rather shallow and impersonal. Overall, I believe it to be highly entertaining and a great insight into the threat of cyber warfare.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this series.  It's wimsical, but with great suspense, action and even a little romance!!!  Thoroughly enjoyable!!!  Totally and completely exceeds all of our expectations!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The truth is that god made man with all heart, soul, and spirit.<br />God loves and cares for us-always. I love you god.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Good book but it is a little too confusing but besides that it was a awesome book but it was a little too confusing
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good show entertaining a breath of fresh air TV the way it used to be. Something you don't have to change the channel when the children walks into the room.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|this movie is how I met my wife. great quality and funny movie that is great for kids and adults.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started slow but then really took off...loved the suspense  and reading both sides and opinions  of the same marriage.  Wasn't crazy about the ending....I see a sequel in the future.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I am excited to see an enjoyable original series on history channel. I watched the first episode twice. I am hooked  for the rest of the season
B00BESKTMG|1.0|Worst ever kung-fu made, this movie has incorporated all the those so kind of movies. And it just boring, you've seen all these movies before. And who really has the Iron Fist? There are so many which might have these fFist, very confusion.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|If you like the acton genre, then 24 has a lot to offer.  It has lots of big-screen touches for a small-screen show.  Its like a 24-hour long movie.  Car chases, gun fights, and explosions.  If you drive a Subaru or a Prius or a Leaf, you will probably hate this show.  No doubt watching 24 leads to school violence, domestic discord, and even global warming.  Jack is trying to save THIS country--not the country that needs a big change.  We need more Jack Bauers!  Enjoy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very readable, but not quite as good as hunger games because the heroine did n poo t share in the ending. She was knocked unconscious and did not come too until the revolt was in full swing. Her companions kept the whole thing a secret from her.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great love story.  It moves quickly and the character development is rapid.  I enjoyed this book and had trouble putting it down.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|love this game totaly recomend definatly worth $2 lots of patch puzzles love the different sound effects for the sets eg...metal glass paper etc..
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I love this CD. There are so many great songs on it. I got it for just one song but ended up loving all of them.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|my greatgrandson looked at it over and over and over and over again. This movie captured his attention and kept it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What can I say but AWESOME!!! The movie was great in theaters and is also enjoyable at home. Awesome movie!!
B0098VVOVG|4.0|While not as good as the first season of \\"Spartacus,\\" season 3 adheres to the same high standard as the previous 2 seasons, making Spartacus (still) one of the best shows on TV.  I watch the show mostly for the intrigue and tactical maneuvering, and less for the fighting and swordsmanship.  So I could do with fewer of the slow-motion, prolonged and highly-choreographed battle scenes.  I could take or leave the gratuitous violence and nudity, but I suppose that these elements are historically accurate and realistic for that era in Roman society.  Looking forward to next season.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|If you saw grand Torino then you can pass this movie up. Clint hasn't lost a thing. If you need something to watch here it is
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this app is really fun and addictive I played it for almost two hours<br />but they should add a joystick or a steering pad
B0036UMM84|5.0|One of the best Streisand movies, not all of the song are my faves. The story goes with the time period.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Listen to it at night while I'm falling asleep, in the car, at work.... Andrea Bocelli exudes passion and his voice is exquisite.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies our family has watched together! My son liked it so much we watched it 4 times in two days!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I WISH I COULD PLAY IT ON MY LAPTOP BUT I CANT SO I HAVE TO PLAY ON MY KINDLE FIRE
B007IK44CK|4.0|good movie i like tom cruise. he did a good job. i would recommend this movie. he put his all into this production.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this set! It's hard to put down! Makes for some short nights of sleep but well worth it! Though not recommended reading in public.
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|Really is this the best they cld come up with? as usual theres one decent song then the rest is extremely avg . Will bon jovi fans buy anything , just make slipery when wet 2 !
B00A1AF4DM|4.0|If you like other books by Michael Crichton, you will find this one entertaining too. It's his typical formula but I liked it. No surprises but an interesting explanation of the science (not sure how accurate or feasible it is) and fun to picture the world the characters enter. A must read if you like Crichton since it's his last. Preston did a good job of finishing it.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Even years later, Enterprise is a great show.  How about a kickstarter for a movie? Like the Veronica Mars kickstarter project?
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I PAID FOR THE UPGRADE SO I COULD PUT A CUSTOM TUNE FOR THE CLOCK. THE IMAGE DID NOT STAY ON MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES AND. THE SCREE N WENT BLANK. SO I Did not do anything. AND I waited TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.  AT THE RIGHT  TIME MY TUNE CAME ON (GOOD)  HOWEVER THE SCREEN WAS STILL BLANK (BAD) SO I COULD NOT SEE THE TIME AND COULD NOT  PRESS THE SNOOZE BUTTON (FRUSTRATING),  SO I HAD TO POWER UP THE KINDLE TO ACCESS THE SNOOZE BUTTON OR TO DISABLE THE ALARM.  THAT'S NOT SATISFACTORY.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Grew up within a family of women who followed fashion and sewed up their own, including suits with soutache trim.  My mother went to the museum exhibit of Chanel's actual confections, noting every stitch and sequin on the gowns.  We also were expected to be writers.  This movie was in my blood, so how could I not love it.  :)
B006ZNRD06|1.0|This video player cant do anything that the basic Kindle player can't.  I was not impressed when it wouldn't recognize a lot of video extensions.
B000Q1EZ9A|4.0|This album brings back so many memories. Simply sublime. Grease remains one of the most special theatrical experiences I have ever had.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Mobo Player works perfectly.  I tried the other paid video players and MoBo was the only one to find and play my video movies.  Including .avi extensions.  Buy this app if you need a video player to play your videos.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I liked the film a lot, but I didn't LOVE the film.  Denzel Washington was masterful in his role.  I primarily bought it, because I was curious as to the content.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Denzel and anyone interested in a fast moving drama.
B005UDD1R6|2.0|Very Unimpressed with this apps ability to play downloaded Movie video extensions like Mp4 or avi.  If your looking for a video player to play videos other than standard extensions, this is not the one.
1432794426|5.0|I love this book! Thank you so much Karen for this great job you did. This is a must--have for every fan!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids love this movie so much, and as an adult I appreciate the thought and attention to details that went into making this movie. We will definitely be watching Wreck-It Ralph for months to come.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I'm so glad we found this app for our two year old.  Our little one loves it and has learned to identify and clearly state all the letters of the alphabet in a very short amount of time.  It's also great at teaching little ones how to properly and carefully use a touch screen device.  Very interactive, colorful and educational.  :)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Easy to play,  addictive,  and comical.  Defineatly would be worth paying for if it were not already free!! I am a collector of classic video games and I thoroughly enjoyed this app!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It really is like a dream! No adds, no trying to haggle you out of your money, and on top of all that the game itself is actually really fantastic as well! The controls are great (I went for the tilt version), and the graphics are stunning on my Kindle Fire. In short, GET THIS GAME!
B006S08RLU|5.0|This movie is really nice and different! I didn't even mind the subtitles. I've been meaning to watch this for years and now I'm glad I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love the male and female characters in this book. They are INTENSE to say the l least. Very good book.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show has become a definite favorite.  I am so glad we found it.  The writing is so good.  Each episode answers a question and then in the last minute give you 3 more to figure out.
B009FZFONO|2.0|Too melodramatic for me. How can everyone get infected even when not bitten? This makes no sense for a reason of infection.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Probably offend a few die hard Stones fans by my thinking it their best.  I found the tunes on youtube, listened to the whole album online one night, and then had to own it.  In my truck now as a frequent player.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I thought the ending was very Hollywood as in over the top. I'm sure the Iranian's weren't so stupid as to not be able to notify the tower so the air traffic controllers could block take off. I hate it when the USA film directors utilize this low brow use of sentimentality.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has been around awhile but I'm just now encountering them.  I listen to a wide variety... mostly country and classic rock so I was surprised at how much I have come to enjoy Tool.  Certainly not the same old same old sound coming out of my truck CD player.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a world war 2 history buff I found the story captivating, and couldn't put it down.  I finished the book in only three days.  Franz's story was of particular interest as I've read so little about German Luftwaffe exploits. As for Charlie Brown and his \\"silent ones\\", they truly acted as a crew throughout their mission. And give Boeing an A+ for building one heck of an airplane in the B-17, still able to fly after ... well you'll have to read the book.  Roger Eddy - Kingwood, TX
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|The Shield is raw and energetic.  The players and the story lines capture and hold my attention.  In spite of the sex and violence, swearing is at a minimum and I haven't heard the &#34;f&#34; word yet.  I think the constant feeling of impending doom and danger keeps me at the edge of my seat.
B007SGM084|5.0|I think it gets better every time just like pretty woman!!!<br /><br />Hope the movie will be able to do the books justice.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|East of Eden was a good read.  John Steinbeck has a way of describing Salinas that was awesome.  I could see and smell the fields of flowers - The ending I thought was a surprise.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This games has the potential to be great, but right now it's got a long way to go. I would have rated this 5 stars, but because of ALL the CRAP you have to go through just to PLAY I am giving this 1 star and uninstalling.  The first complaint was how long it took to load the first time I played, but it finally did and I got to play so I got over that. I had made it to level 7 well about 80 percent of the time I open the game ALL of the graphics are blacked out in the game, but you could see the actual dinosaur (nothing else) so I got over that and played. The final straw for me was when I discovered why this app wants access to your other apps. I was hesitant when I saw this, but downloaded anyways, well it will not let you open ANY other apps while this one is open if you try you get an error message and the other app you are trying to open will close. I played around even that until it started closing and even glitching my other apps while jurassic park is CLOSED. I finally couldn't take it anymore and uninstalled today.  My tablet finally works correctly again, so yes this game was fun, but until they fix ALL the issues and stop asking for access to other apps I can not even have this game on my tablet or it causes to many problems. SO VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|so funny love fat amy!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />there should be more fat amy's in the world shes a real woman who says it like it is.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|This booked lacked a distinctive voice.  The title and the use of photographs were inventive.  The book itself did not live up to the promise of these two elements.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Too bad only 14 episodes are available, plus one movie. I will stop doing any reviews if this crap about minimum words keeps up
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The journey of mark watney right down to very nitty gritty details of pretty much everything mars or NASA related!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The music in this game is so relaxing.  A great time killer if you want to be in a zen mood lol. I would definitely download it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I am a Patricial Cornwell fan - normally love Scarpetta Novels.  This one was OK - too much detail that really didn't help the story.  Underlying story was great but you really had to dig through everything to find it and follow it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I say this book is tragically short not because of its length, but because the death of Stieg Larsson prevent any fan from delving further into the Milennium world. This was the best book in the trilogy and yet left me with so many questions and a bit frustrated knowing Mr. Larsson had other books in various stages of completion that fans will never read. If you don't mind that kind of disappointment then snap this book up because it's an excellent gripping tale that allows a more indepth look at the characters that are glimpsed in the movie and a few more nice additions that the movies couldn't include because of time.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The set included all the episodes plus extra scenes.It also included a wealth of background material on the series, and all the actors, and their characters.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I saw the movies first, watching the American version and then moving on to the entire trilogy in Swedish. This book takes a fan of the movies much deeper into the world of Stieg Larsson. If you love detail and don't mind becoming immersed totally in a book then jump in and relish every morsel Larsson feeds us.  Fans of Swedish murder mysteries should read this.
B00BESCJII|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Acting was terrific and the story was great. I would highly recommend this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I first started to read The Perks of Being A Wallflower I didn't know what I was expecting. As I read I found myself being able to relate to the book so closely that it was scary. I wanted to ask who was watching my life. I couldnt stop reading it. I finished this book in a day thats how much I couldn't put the book down. All I was thinking was how realistic this book seemed. I can say now that The Perks of Being a Wallflower was - is one of my favorite books. I can take away from it that every one goes through different things durring their life and they are not what they seem just from a surface glance. The Perks of Being a Wallflower changed me in ways I can't even explain. This book deserved this rating because it is just that good of a book. I am gald that I read it because it has changed me for the better.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 was good.... there was quite a bit of interpersonal drama like season 2 but not as much (thank goodness). Some big character shifts take place. Zombies become less of a threat than other people, and Rick starts heading down a distrustful humanity-losing slippery slope. I miss all the zombie-related deaths and constant fear of bites.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun game that reminds me a lot of the movies. Very addicting and fun! Couldn't ask for a better app.
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of my favorite recent Bond Movies hands down.  Great purchase, have yet to meet anybody that doesn't enjoy a good bond flick and SKYFALL was ON POINT!!
B008GJV19Q|5.0|I've loved this movie since it first came out. A great 'do your toe's' type of movie that isn't overtly sappy or overtly drama ridden. The inlaid comedy is perfected by the performances of the main actors and their supporting actors. It inlays the time (mid 60's Europe) perfectly; and continues to teach a lesson for us in this present day.<br /><br />Great date night film if your guy is open to a chick flick without the tears.<br /><br />Pamela Olson<br />Citrus Heights, Ca.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show.  I look forward to next season.  It is well written, well acted, and the story line gets you hooked.
B0012GMU8Q|5.0|I bought this Vinyl because a really liked the movie and I remmembered that I liked the soundtrack. It was kind of a shot in the dark, but I am really glad I bought this album! It´s fantastic!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I think it was easy to read and a good love story with some twists wich made it hard to put away!
1401307450|5.0|This book shows an honest behind the scenes look at the real life of a rock star. He doesn't hold anything back and is brutally open with the details of his life. After reading the first page I could not put it down.
B004Q9TK98|5.0|I have read a lot of Jodi's books and this one kept you guessing until the end and made you unsure which way you wanted it to end. Excellent read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent easy read book!! Cannot wait to see movie to see how they compare. It was also a good price for kindle download. Hope you enjoy as much as I have!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I also like this game as does my husband. When he is watching Swamp People (ewwww) I sometimes play this b/c I just can't watch the murder of those alligators.....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like subway surfed but the things that u can get in mystery  boxes. Like the egg board make them buy the board for1000 coins/dollars. Please try and fix it
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I do like this game. It's fun and is challenging, well for me anyway, six more words needed here now
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This shows politics at it's worst, intrigueing power and corruption brilliant acting a superb production. This is a must for anyone who is interested in politics. It will be interesting to see the US version of House of Cards.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This games is awesome I play the game none stop I will never stop play the game<br />Mojang is the best
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have 3 kids, ages 15, 8 and 4 and they all love this game!  Very addicting if I do say so myself!
B008VBYN80|5.0|Really, I had my doubts about this game, but really it's a good game, with an amazing storyline  I recommend this to anyone who likes little simulated games.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|9 yr old likes, I haven't played it myself! I really don't have much elsse to say. she seems to like
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I couldn't wait to get a tablet just to play this game<br />It is really fun and keeps you busy for hours
B004SBS8LA|3.0|9 yr old likes...she spent  a lot of time enjoying this app, so I think it is a winner..yeah I think!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Another fantastic story by David Baldacci.  He has a way to get the reader involved in the story from page 1.
B00BNNJHXO|5.0|Soilwork shows that they belong among the Metal elite.  This album has plenty of the melo-death that Soilwork fans love, but they incorporate some Progressive and Death elements as well.  Excellent production.
0062014536|5.0|I love love love this series and Olivers last book didnt disappoint me at all! She is a fantastic author and kept me hooked clear until the very last page...which by the way, ended exactly as I hoped it would. I am a true fan of her writing and look forward to more books in the future. Bravo
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really enjoy this app..I can look at my battery status and the graphic is awesome. And I really like how it tells your kindle 's temperature.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Great movie! Loved learning more about the man. Anthony Hopkins does a great job!  I highly recommend it to anyone!
1433535734|5.0|Was looking for the ESV study bible with the 2011 minor edits and this came with it even though it doesn't show on the preview on Amazon. It has everything I need and it's going to make a wonderful study bible. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to do a deeper study of the bible. Awesome design also!!
B00AHH0XOY|5.0|This was a very funny and touching story of a villain who never got a chance to know what it was like to be loved by everyone. With the help of a superhero who no longer wants to be a superhero, and a set a circumstances that led to the creation of a new, more powerful villain, Megamind would have to become the superhero and fight against the city's newest enemy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|5 stars are for keeping the children attention on watching the movie! Wonderful antics and colorful scenes that children can understand.  Recommend this for most ages of children that will be an exciting adventure.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great app for just a basic, quick calculator. It is easy to use and read. No complaints. It does exactly what I need it to without a lot of extra buttons. Definitely recommend it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have enjoyed this game from the first. You see nice pictures and the story is good.  It is worth the price.
B0059R5Q08|5.0|This was a great story, told well through excellent actors. I loved this movie and would watch it over and over again.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I knew nothing about this series when I started watching it-I was hooked right away. I found it to be not only scary but slightly disturbing! If you are into horror, this is definitely worth checking out. I can't wait to watch season 2!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Really unique loved it. The story was full of plot twists and turns keeping you guessing right until the very last page.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|One is given the impression that he knows what he is doing in the beginning of the movie, but after time goes along we find he is a thief and manipulator. Perry Mason he was not. Perry probably would have gotten 4 stars, only because he failed only in two cases in his whole carrier.<br /><br />A fear came over me in watching the movie, which was &#34;wondering if LA lawyers were really that bad? If so it provide with one reason why so many are in prison today.<br /><br />On the good side: This was more entertaining than watching &#34;Howard the Duck.&#34;
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Not the kind of story I would normally read but the book surprises you.  Really sad until the end and written with thoughtful insight into a difficult topic.
B000002H6C|5.0|I have been listening to heavy metal since 2005, and this one of my favorite albums from them, as they have that energy and speed with<br />great lyrics. The fact that they are able create a nine minute song keeping the speed and energy consistent throughout was extremely<br />impressive, the only other band that I saw that was able to do that was Black Sabbath with Megalomania in the Sabotage album. With that said,<br />I highly recommend this album to any metal fan, as this is one of their greatest masterpieces.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Good action and plot.  Enjoyed the acting and all the CG they did.  Would watch it again!
B0002EXH4K|5.0|If there is any album that gained my interest to their band, it is this one. There are quite a few songs in this album I like quite a bit, especially<br />Architecture of Aggression, where Dave's amazing voice talent shines the most, but most of the other songs were excellent as well with the energy and<br />speed they had with this one. As you can see, I'm an energy and speed kind of person, especially when it comes to music. This is without a single<br />doubt Dave's best album, and recommend it to any heavy metal fan, especially those looking for speed.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Modern version of asteroids ...without the guns!!  I could make a picture of my chums and program friends and germs...teachers. &amp; zombies....math &amp; cities...etc.  so many ideas...like gram positive/beg...antiBx &amp; power ups...darn the slow keyboard....it stifles communication
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I was a youngster when Dylan was still trying to convince the big record companies to let him sing his own, unique way. I find his voice on this cd to be great! It is real, it is raw, and it carries his lyric mastery in a new and impressive fashion. Old guys rule!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A story of a person who, despite odds, accomplished so much with his life.  A fast read I couldn't put it down because I found myself quickly intrigued by Adam Brown and to learn of the journey he would go through.  It puts things in perspective, it's not how hard we get hit but how we choose to react that can define us.  Adam did not posses an uncanny physical prowess that gave him an edge over anybody.  It was his humanity, his love for his family and his faith in God that made him shine.  Being a father myself and having lost two family members in a drunk driving accident I understand the loss and the pain that not only his family but the other families of the SEALs who were mentioned in this book have lived through.  Read this book if you want to be inspired or have your faith rekindled.  Thank you to all those who have served.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|If you like Kate Bush, this is going to please you.  If you don't like her voice or musical style, you might not find this to be your fav cd, but give it a listen anyway.... It is easy to listen to, a voice of gentleness in a music world that too often attacks and overwhelms the listener. Elton John fans should recognise his guest appearance...
1616550414|5.0|simplemente espectacular, algo que todo fan de zelda debe tener para poder disfrutar aun mas de esta gran y sorprendente saga.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|well it ended the series and that was good to read the closing book. However, i felt like it was shorter than the others? maybe not, but i seemed that way. I liked the book, but it just ended a little short for me. I would have liked to have seen it continue a bit more. One of the main characters, just ends walking around aimlessly wandering? idk, i love reading and this one left me unfulfilled. (i know, this is young adult and not to be compared to more mature reading)
B0081336FO|4.0|For me Sherlock will always be Basil Rathbone, but this fellow and his Watson run a close second. The venue is modern day London but the mysteries are the same thrilling adventures that the Rathbone movies provided.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|my husband and I loved this, it was a great action movie with good acting. much better than the original one. Im not a movie buff but I  am fairly picky. I enjoyed it.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|There will be an extended edition of the Hobbit that runs 3+ hours. If you're as sick as I am of getting ripped off buying movies twice then you'll be waiting like me from now on. The fact that there will be an extended edition rates this release 1 star because every fan of the Hobbit will want the extended edition.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book was a mix of world or war craft and everything that was awesome about the 80s. The action was great and the story was better. The author did a wonderful job of making us care about Wade and is friends, and truly despise the Sixers. I bought this book just looking for something new and different and I'm very happy with my selection.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A balanced biography that shows the brilliance with the awkward personal relationships.  Glad Steve told his story to Walter Isaacson, and the book was very fun to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just wish training didn't take do long other than that it's a really fun gamer for horse lovers on the go
B008ODZNLG|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from this documentary, but it was really interesting and goes to show that hard work and dedication go a long way. I was dying for sushi after watching this!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very interesting book,sometimes amusing insight into human nature, and fallacies. The author proves her talent in adult fiction as well as the younger reader.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Great movie, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Good court room drama. The only thing is I wanted a more definitive ending to the story. Same with 12 Angry Men. In real life you won't know, but this is fiction. In fiction you do know. It's fiction that's part of the definition. Even so a great film. Jimmy Stewart is awesome.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Short, enjoyable and easy to read. I read this book in a night it was well worth buying (infact purchased all 3 and look forward to the 4th)<br /><br />A+!
B007P6VM04|4.0|I  like this CD but felt there should have been more songs from the first season. I recommend this CD and suggest you go to Itunes to download the songs missing from this CD.
0385742886|5.0|This book was a pretty good book. I've only read four or five books that I liked and this one is one of them. Most books don't catch me but this one did. I highly recommend it to every one.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Great CPU for the price. I recommend this for anyone who wants a fast CPU but don't want to spend so much.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I keep going back to Die Hard every Christmas.  It just never gets old.  I'd far prefer this movie than Miracle on 42nd Street. :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|For some good mindless fun and drama watch this series.  Definitely candy for the brain, but oh so different from the candy we've enjoyed at different points in time over the years.  Cheers to PBS for bringing it over!
B003SHYVO8|5.0|Great Movie!!  I Luv the music that they used to dance too!  I highly recommend watching this movie....you will not be disappointed!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really a fun app. I even tried it and it was really fun to play the game.  I highly recommend it.  Even as a parent, I enjoyed it. I have it installed on my phone, my daughter's phone and on my Kindle.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a must watch tv show,  fun, intense, and full of excitement, and suspense. Benedict is amazing!!<br />Got hooked on the very 1st episode and had a marathon of watching all of them in one day!.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series.  The characters are great and the actors are believable.  I can't wait for the next segment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Started watching this show just over a week ago and I'm already on season 3. Great story line, lovable characters and characters you love to hate. I'm addicted!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I am a 48 year old woman and I don't have kids....and I LOVE this movie, it is so cute, for all ages.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show has continued to blow me away time and time again. The acting is good, story can feel a little slow at first but there's always enough to come back for. As the season progresses it gets much much better. Especially with the gradual add of the time on the island in flashbacks. Overall it has become my favorite show
B004DM0UII|5.0|Like I said I think this app is better then Pandora especially with them no longer having free unlimited basic. I love this app always clear and fast glitch free streaming.
B004AQR29C|3.0|Upsetting to see them aging.  I enjoyed the movie but was upset to see how old everyone got.  Makes me feel old.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|A great break from the &#34;fluffy&#34; books I have read lately. It gives hope even to those in a dark time. Can't wait to see the movie; however, I  sure it will not be as good as the book.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The music and acting were great.  It was a pleasure to watch with my grandchildren, who watched it more than once.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game!The way that  every month you would  have a  different location to be surfing from, and subway surfer ROME is so fun because you're in ROME and it have cute little Easter eggs to collect when playing the game.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Lots of laughs with my grandchildren.  I do so enjoy a good clean movie to watch with them etc, etc..
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|excellent series  I cant wait  to watch more.<br />looking foward to it, whymust i write somany words on this series?
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Always been a favourite of mine to see on the screen. I can't imagine that I haven't read the book til now. Of course the written story is better than the adaptation to television and I'm glad I finally took the time.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Got into the book right away. Great read.Loved the characters and the humanity of Robie.i really liked the twists and turns of the story.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I think it should be all the way review because.  It tells all about the things u need to  now so you just look in here
B00APKIN1I|4.0|I had been following the progress of the documentary Sound City, and this Album that was produced in that film for a few months now.  If you are a musician, or at all interested in the making of music, you will enjoy the film.  Some of the best parts of the film are the parts when they are actually in the studio recording songs on the spot.  This album is the fruit of that process.<br /><br />The samples you are going to hear on here are compressed versions of what is essentially a tribute to Analog tape Reel recording.  But the actual downloads or CD should be a higher quality that should bring out what is great about this album.<br /><br />The Bass lines on this entire album are fantastic, warm, and inspiring.  There aren't any tricks in this album except for what comes out of the musicians hands.  There are some hits and misses on this album, but everything featuring Alain Johanes or Joshua Homme is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I pretty much had the song \\"Mantra\\" on loop for the past 24 hours and i love it more and more each loop.  It features the 3 powerhouse musically creative minds in modern rock from the last 20 years, Dave Ghrol on Drums, Joshua Homme on Bass, and Trent Reznor on Keys (all three add other layers in there with harmonies and other nice touches).  Its a simple arrangement that thrives on the human component of the whole recording process.<br /><br />My review isn't going to do all this justice, But i will say that it is one of those albums you want to throw on and turn up the volume.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|please update by adding more trails or challenges. I have played it tor a long time and starting to get bored so add some serious challenges
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I am loving this show, and Amazon Instant in general.<br />Definitely a must see :)<br />Sex, scandal, and politics aren't usually my thing, but I love it here!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|hard to follow... grinding .. Great cast.  poorly directed.  boring.  boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow, this book was  just amazing. I cannot believe the emotion of this book. The love, the hurt, all of it together. Just wonderful!!!! Great job.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|If you're looking to watch a beautiful movie with a heart-warming plot and a happy ending, this is NOT IT! If you are looking to watch something avant guard with I'm sure a lot of great reviews from film critics who like movies that are different, then this is for you.<br />Disjointed, takes place on sets like a play, goes in and out of plot. Someone thought he or she was clever, and he or she was, but I'm not looking for clever in a movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome<br /><br />I loved how Katniss showed her venerable side while maintaining her strength and courage while still saving the day
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I tottaly reccomend this game. It is probably the best free game I have gotten. I would pay $5 if it was that much! love love love &lsaquo;3 get it! Its a amazing game and a good time passer. :) little kids love it too!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This game is fine for the younger set.  My granddaughter hasn't played it that much yet, but it looks to me that it will address coordination and planning.  I think she will like it.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Started watching SoA during season 4.  Had a chance through Amazon Prime to go back and watch the first three seasons.  Not disappointed at all!  Plenty of action you'd expect and provides the background to the story.  Highly recommend watching every single show of this series....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I love it and it's good to have a challenge in a game. Me and my friends all love it, we all have this app.
0316056871|5.0|This book is so funny, I couldn't put it down! I've already purchased this book for other friends because it is a must read! Tina Fey is hilariously brilliant!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game.  Each puzle offers its own complexity.  Can't imagine getting bored for a long time to come.
030758836X|5.0|This book was so good! I love suspenseful, well-written books! Gillian Flynn is a superb writer and with so many twists and turns, I couldn't put this book down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its very fun because you get to see how it is to own a horse and what its like to see a horse compete
B0096PYUE2|1.0|It just doesn't work.  Dont waste your time on this one.  It doesn't work on the Kindle Fire.  It won't play flash videos.
B001RUXW48|5.0|Excellent story, lots of action and great cast including Oscar Isaac in a small good role. Dicaprio is very good. Crowe plays the man to hate very well. Ridley Scott tells an almost timeless story. Mark Strong is excellent.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book really changed my perception of how much better IT can be if DevOps could be deployed within any organization. As a former enterprise engineer, I could relate to all the issues that kept arising within the book, I have lived them. If I had only had this book and known about the three ways then. Just a great book that I have told all my co-workers about. As the IT industry keeps evolving into ITaaS, DevOps will be come more and more important. I can't wait for the DevOps Cookbook!!!
B000OLRH10|5.0|And DJimon Honshue is great in this. Jennifer Connolly is excellent, also. Blood Diamonds are produced by slave labor and life is cheap across several South African nations. A story worth telling that includes the making of child soldiers from kidnapped boys.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This season ( I don't want to spoil it) is full of action and suspense. I really liked seeing more of Dexter and how complex he is as a character. Just make sure you watch the seasons in order because they follow and you don't want to miss anything! Enjoy!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|He really like this game . It is always one of his go to games.<br />I would get again for him
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. It was filled with suspense and excitement. Peeta  and Katniss are a great couple!It was also really romantic.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I want the 5th season on Prime. I found the series to be riveting. I couldn't help wanting to watch each upcoming episode.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Definitely an emotional journey at times! The cast is now progressing through the 20s and it's fun to see how the director and production crew helps the era come alive though the character's lives.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00BHMF578|1.0|Was the film funded by the tobacco companies? There was so much smoking going on it was a complete turn-off for me. I'm sorry I supported it by renting it. Too bad - the real story in itself was a good one - but I couldn't t get past all the nastiness of the cigarettes.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|This band is great. I saw them on SNL recently and I loved Brittany's passion and the band's genre is right up my alley. I actually first bought Hold On off of iTunes to have it to listen to in the car and a couple days later my Mom bought the CD so that was funny. I had to have the vinyl though since it was only $10.00 Again, great vinyl, no scratches or skips, totally happy.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I love Bruce Willis, but I found this movie so depressing I regret having watched it. I gave it three stars because the concept is intriguing and the movie was well done.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great book, very intellectually stimulating. I also have the audiobook and whispersync works well although it is expensive.  No matter, this book is worth having both.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The trailer made me think it was about the spectacular flying, but it was actually a drama about a man with an addiction. I found it frustrating at times and really did not like the glorification of substance abuse. Also, there was way too much smoking - has Hollywood gone to the tobacco companies again for funding?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints, and Safe Haven may be my favorite yet! I began reading and could not put it down!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|If you want to learn how to love yourself and love others unconditionally, this is a must read. As a Pastor, I use this book all the time for pre-marital counseling because it provides the wisdom necessary for successful long-term relationships.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I freaking loved this movie. It followed the book so well. Line for line in some parts. Yeah they used more CG in this one than in the other movies, but that's just the way things are changing in the world of movies. Anyway This is the best movie of the year.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Alexander, a neurosurgeon and thorough skeptic as far as things like near death experiences go, had his mind changed completely when he himself had a near death experience. Now he is using his medical training and careful arguments to try to explain and convince his colleagues and his readers of what he experienced. It is different from many other books about NDEs because of his own skeptical approach and his ability to de-mystify and counter most arguments against NDEs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best.  Full of suspense with a surprise ending. Left me wanting more and sorry when I finished it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the most captivating and moving stories I have ever read and I have read a lot of them. Ever since I was young, I have read everything I could get my hands on, especially histories and stories about World War II. There have been many that I could not put down as they have been upforgettable. This book tops them all. True, it is a story pretty much about the German pilot involved in this incident, but it does show that among those who fight in war, there emerges from time to time one moment when the combatants rise above the killing and recognize that there is a higher power that governs their actions, no matter what the situation. The situation was a common one; the German pilot happened on this American B-17 that was hopelessly crippled and could have easily shot it down, completing the work that his countrymen had started. It was a legitimate trophy of war - it did contain the enemy to his country - it would have earned him much credos from his comrades. But in the final analysis, he didn't. In fact, he covered for the bomber as it continued home, protecting it from the flak batteries that lined its route back to England. The Me109 pilot covered up his deed throughout the remainder of the war and it wasn't until afterwards when his story came out many years later that he was subjected to criticism and threats from his own countrymen. It is interesting when people criticize those who exhibit such traits that those who criticize usually have not been in situations like this man found himself in.<br />We tend to catagorize the Germans during WWII as being all Nazis and rabid killers when instead many of those who fought did so out of patriotism to their native land. There were many who were patriotic and opposed the regime, men like Dietrich Bonhoeffer for example. There are those who answered their nation's call to arms and, while in uniform, did all they could to honor their commitment to arms and opppose the will of their Nazi leaders when they could. That is the legacy that should come out of this book.<br />Would I recommend this book to others? Absolutely and without reservation! But be warned - you will find yourself crying as you read it and you will not want to put it down.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Old school blue-eyed soul, a little R&B, a little zydeco, a little jazz...just pure Boz. Love it. Can't recommend it enough. If we could only go back to this type of music. Musicians and singers who don't rely on gimmicks or auto-tune, just excellence in their craft. If I had 20 thumbs, they would all be up. Kudos to you Mr. Scaggs.

B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I've been waiting for this video to come out on dvd for years.  I still have the VHS tape and did watch it.  This is one of MJ's best.  There are few parts missing, but overall its great.  Anyone who enjoys/enjoyed watching and listening to Michael will enjoy this.  Miss you Michael for your music, dance, videos, and the meaning you gave the world.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I probably shouldn't be reviewing this, since I love dinosaurs above many other things, so I am biased from the start. Still, I will try to remain objective. I've played a few town builder games, and this one has a few strengths. First of all, the charge currency (you know, the thing that makes everything go faster and the game actually playable, but costs real money) thus far has not been exclusively attained through cash. You get some on levels and sometimes missions. Not a lot, but hey, that's their deal, right? So I enjoy having some as an option, and I appreciate the game for that reason. Second, I was surprised by how long-term the game can be. Sometimes these games will be really awesome for about a week, and then you lose interest, or you run out of things you can do without paying real money, and those are no good. I've only been playing this game a few days, but I notice all the dinos have a placard with 4 spaces for stars above them. When I got my triceratops to level 10, I was able to re-tune it's DNA, and bring it back at 1 star with a slightly more vibrant skin... so the potential for getting each dinosaur to 4 stars and looking their most awesome is huge. For such games, it is well designed, and not nearly as infuriating as it could be. Also... FREAKIN DINOSAURS MAN!!! IT'S A JURASSIC PARK GAME! DID ANYONE HERE PLAY JP OPERATION GENESIS?! THAT GAME WAS SWEET! IT IS KIND OF LIKE THAT, BUT DIFFERENT!!
B0045HCJRG|5.0|It's one of those movies that I never tire of watching.  It's amazing to see how things have changed since the early 60's up to now and be able to laugh about it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a truly well thought out adventure story if you had a technical background and could understand the heroes solution to the various problems encountered.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Without getting into too many spoilers, I will say that I loved Hunger Games and adored Catching Fire. Suzanne Collins returns with the third book in the series with Mockingjay - a book I wanted to love. In reality it's just okay. The storyline takes a hard right turn from the previous two books, which took place in the competitive field of the Hunger Games. I get a sense that Collins was running out of ideas when she wrote this book. Some of it is just plain silly, and most of it is boring. In addition, after creating what I thought was a very interesting character in Katniss Everdeen, Collins seems to loose her grasp on the principle of the story to the point she's not very likable. If you're read the first two books and are invested in the characters, you may as well read it. If you aren't too hot about the first two books, I'd skip this one.
B00633W614|5.0|Relished every page of the book.  When I turned the last page, I was 'disappointed' to learn that the final sequel book had not yet been released.  Wish I could get an advanced copy, but I'll just have to wait along with everyone else.<br /><br />A friend recommended the 'Clifton Chronicles' to me and I have been highly suggesting others read it.  It is a 'can't put it down' book.

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This one stands out among them.  Brandon Sanderson gives us another taste of a world where symbol magic has deep and strange powers.  I am a rabid fan so there may be some bias here, nonetheless this is a great read and a shining example of the artistry with which Mr Sanderson weaves his worlds, characters and magic systems into beautiful tapestries.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Full of bad acting, I will not watch again. Doesn't compare to Aliens in the least bit as far as story and acting.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I have always been a fan of Doctor Who of the 70's.  When I heard of the franchise coming back, I did not think I would enjoy it.  I was wrong.  It took some getting used to when the series relaunched, but a few episodes in and I was hooked.  My wife and kids are even hooked on it.  The new doctors are fun and refreshing.  I love the modern take on the series.  It is House, Fringe, and X-Files all mashed together.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|It is an entertaining story of how the movie Psycho was made and the friction between husband and wife at the time.  Not sure whether this is pure fiction or based on the truth, but it was entertaining enough to watch once.<br /><br />That said, the performances by the actors was well done.  Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock was quite enjoyable.  Helen Mirren brought humor to her role as his wife.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this season. This show is a fantastic science fiction. From time travel to other dimensions to mutants, Fringe delivers.
B006VA3ZEG|5.0|Little action, hardly any death, and no nudity...  Doesn't sound like I should like it, but I really did.  I can't tell you why, I'm still trying to figure that out.  But it's a great series with incredible acting.  Maybe it's the British accents?
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Really enjoy this series - we wish they had continued it past the fifth season...  I guess everybody has to move on at some point though.<br />Hope that a decent replacement will be produced!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've been hooked since season one. Season 2 wasn't as good as the first. However season 3 is as awesome as the first.
B005HSL626|4.0|I really enjoy this game as well as my five year old son if he's in the room when I start to play he runs over and says I'm next my turn.  Great game for all ages.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Arrow started out as a revenge kind of show. After a bit it seemed to change from revenge to something of a Robin Hood. Don't get me wrong, it still has revenge in it though. Mixing the 2 helps to create the conflict needed for the show. Great season 1
B005OCFGTO|5.0|it was very inexpensive and it is nice that is all together and consolidated all eight separate discs would have been a hassle.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|I LOVE this movie, have watched it many times and hopefully will watch it many more.  It has an eerie spooky quality to it.  I ordinarily don't watch movies more than once but this one is an exception...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is very interesting, once again Nicholas Sparks keeps you wanting to read all night. One of his best.
0525953728|5.0|A fantastic read.  Once the SEALs arrive in the OBL compound, I couldn't put the book down.  It's informative, educational, and gripping.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|I have a confession to make, which will probably get me stoned by an angry mob: I never really liked the original \\"Fright Night.\\"<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that I hated it or that it was bad, but its campy style just didn't appeal to me. So perhaps it's not surprising that -- without nostalgia goggles -- I found myself thoroughly enjoying the remake that eventually got made. And a lot of that is due to Colin Farrell's brilliant performance as a laid-back, casually creepy vampire-next-door.<br /><br />Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is understandably annoyed when his estranged friend \\"Evil\\" Ed Lee (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) claims that his new neighbor Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire. Then Ed vanishes, and Charley discovers -- by breaking into Jerry's basement -- that his new neighbor is indeed a vampire. Unfortunately, Jerry also knows that Charley knows that he's a vampire.<br /><br />Who can Charlie turn to for help? Why, Doctor Who! No, seriously. David Tennant is in this movie as a leather-clad, foul-mouthed Vegas stage magician who ALSO happens to be a vampire expert. But when Jerry destroys his home and kidnaps his girlfriend Amy (Imogen Poots), Charley decides to take the fight to the vampire.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is a big part of what makes \\"Fright Night\\" a good movie -- he acts mellow and laid-back all the time, often chuckling to himself as if the humans' struggles are just an amusement to him. But he never descends into camp cheese. Even ordinary, un-vampirey dialogue is somehow underlaid with menace when he speaks it (\\"Catch you later!\\") -- how often do you see a vampire who can sound scary just asking for beer?<br /><br />It's also really nice to see vampires that aren't misunderstood sad-eyed woobies who just need love. These vampires are vicious, malevolent and apparently possessed by an evil force -- the only moment when you feel sorry for them is when they briefly revert back to their human minds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie actually reminds me a bit of the classic \\"Dracula\\" -- you've got Evil Ed as Lucy, Jerry as Dracula, Amy as Mina, Vincent as Van Helsing and Charley as a composite of all the other male characters. There's lots of tongue-in-cheek dialogue (\\"Don't do anything I wouldn't do. That doesn't narrow it down. That's like, mini-golf and sushi\\") and some bloodily hilarious moments (the battle between Evil Ed and Charley).<br /><br />Biggest problem: the CGI for the vampire faces is pretty horrible.<br /><br />None of the rest of the cast are QUITE as brilliant as Farrell, but they are all pretty good -- Yelchin is pretty convincing as an ex-nerd who is now trying to be non-\\"dweeby\\" enough for his hot girlfriend, and Mintz-Plasse gives a deliciously warped performance as Evil Ed (who seems to have a bit of a crush on Charley). Toni Colette and Poots are also quite good, although Colette's character seems kind of superfluous.<br /><br />And David Tennant... oh, David Tennant. He completely steals the scene whenever he's onscreen, cussing up a storm and slouching around in very tight leather pants. Not only is he sexy, but he's uproariously funny (\\"Midori me!\\").<br /><br />Normally remakes annoy me, but the remake of \\"Fright Night\\" ended up being one of the better vampire movies I've seen -- bloody, funny and weird.s me a bit of the classic \\"Dracula\\" -- you've got Evil Ed as Lucy, Jerry as Dracula, Amy as Mina, Vincent as Van Helsing and Charley as a composite of all the other male characters.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is an AWESOME family-friendly movie. My husband & I got so many laughs out of the jokes & video game references. The whole concept is very clever and very entertaining. Also, we didn't experience any problems with the amazon streaming service, which is always a plus :)
B00AG472DS|2.0|Lately I've been on a bit of a serial killer spree, checking out movies about/based on real-life serial killers and the times they were active.<br /><br />So I was fully expecting to be blown away by &#34;Zodiac,&#34; David Fincher's account of the Zodiac Killer (whom I had never heard of before). But Fincher's talents are drowned in a sea of minutial facts here, leading to an interesting but not very compelling narrative about a cartoonist who becomes obsessed with catching a serial killer. It doesn't help that most of the best actors are wasted.<br /><br />In 1969, San Francisco Chronicle began receiving encrypted letters from a serial killer who called himself Zodiac, taking credit for past murders and mentioning his plans for future kills. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is only a political cartoonist, but his knack for puzzles allows him to figure out the code that Zodiac is using. Despite not being taken seriously by his fellows, crime writer Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) begins to listen to his theories.<br /><br />After three more killings, police detective Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) is put on the case, and Zodiac begins threatening Avery, and even calls a celebrity lawyer on the radio. Then... he vanishes without a trace. But Graysmith remains obsessed with Zodiac's identity -- and when the killings and phantom calls begin again some years later, he contacts Toschi in hopes of finally identifying the serial killer.<br /><br />David Fincher is an absolutely brilliant director, and he's clearly trying to do his best with this movie. But his talents seem to be squandered in this story, partly because it seems to rely so much on facts and a sense of realism. He is to be admired for sticking mostly to Graysmith's facts rather than wildly sensationalizing them... but that means that the movie has long stretches of quibbling over puzzles and inconsequential clues.<br /><br />Realistic, yes. Fascinating... no. Honestly, the most intriguing parts of the movie are the parts that DON'T involve Graysmith -- the radio conversations, the murders, and Toschi's efforts to solve the case. It's made all the more intriguing because Fincher has Zodiac voiced by three different actors, spreading doubt through your mind about whether there is just one person or more than one.<br /><br />But whenever the story swings back to Graysmith, any tension seems to just quietly leak out of the film. And since the movie's events take place over several years, the tension comes in very small bursts, spread very far apart, which only end up leading to an anticlimax of epic proportions.<br /><br />Part of that is because Graysmith is just not a very interesting character -- for the first two-thirds of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal does little except look doe-eyed and stare intently at papers. He seems like a cipher for the audience's participation. Marc Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. both do excellent jobs with their roles, although Downey is reduced to doing little except stomping around and drinking.<br /><br />The normally brilliant Fincher seems to be on autopilot for much of &#34;Zodiac,&#34; which has some glorious actors but a lead character who sucks the energy out of the film. Factually interesting, but kind of a drag to sit through.re the parts that DON'T involve Graysmith -- the radio conversations, the murders, and Toschi's efforts to solve the case.

B001GQ2BNQ|1.0|is dificult to use, you have to practice a lot. I think  the tube is short. If you move your head out of place, you get water in the snorkel.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I had this from the library but couldn't finish in the allotted time so bought it for my Kindle. I was never a good history student but this book is easy to digest, making sense and piecing together many things going on during the same time period. The United States could use a master politician of Lincoln's caliber today. The great manipulator excelled at getting the differing factions to work as a team.  The passing of the emancipation  paved the way to a more equitable distribution of rights, a project still being molded today. Lincoln was the quintessential  practitioner of &#34;keep your friends close and your enemies closer.&#34;
B0018RFLN0|5.0|lots of action. tom cruise has played his roll so good. the movie really takes you to the different places without any bridges
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Much better than the movie. Really gets down to the people and how war really is. Although the movie is good, it does not show the filth, hunger and trauma our Marines suffered in battle. The book does.

B007C4ZJ3K|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen recently, without a doubt. People who rated this low no nothing of good movies.<br /><br />I think this is a rare movie I would watch once every few months since it's a refreshing break from all the repeats out there. (Die Hard 1-6, Fast & Furious 1-6, Land Before Time 1-900). Although the story isn't completely original, the talent in the movie and overall delivery is fantastic! I'm definitely recommending this (I saw it on Netflix).

I'm only reviewing this set because I would write the same for all including the seventh season which i plan to buy.I hope the eighth season lives up to the rest
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Every time I try to tap the second cut scene it goes back to the home screen! I feel that I wasted 2.99 just to play three levels because it won't let me carry on with the other levels! Please fix this in an update or something!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|If you take a lot of pictures this is perfefect for you. Easy to manage photos with folders and has an option to automatically upload pics as you take them. If you need space on yout phone just upload all your pics then delete them from your device.5 gigs of space is more than enough for most people so get this app.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I love TWD, but this season has been sloooooooooow.  Every episode can be summarized as: &#34;Rick is buckling under the strain and the Governor is a jerk&#34;.  How many episodes do they need to get it across?
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|So much pressure. What kind of Bowie do you want? The pop/rock singer-songwriter of the early 70s, or the frantic expressionist artist of the late-70s. Either way he's screwed out of everyone's full approval. There's no way he can fully revisit his Berlin-era experimentation because he doesn't have the line up of George Murray, Dennis Davis, and Carlos Alomar to bring round a sweet black beat against his, Eno, and Visconti's bleak strategies. (Not to mention having to Belew and Fripp -- lighting in a bottle.) BUT some tracks are a very close stab, after three decades of distance from the style of the late-70s, to tracks from Scary Monsters and Lodger. \\"How Does The Grass Grow?\\" is \\"Scream Like A Baby, Pt. II\\" in much the same way that \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" was another stab at \\"Heroes.\\" It's the one I've been listening to the most. The beginning title track could logically sit next to either \\"Repetition,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" or \\"It's No Game (Part 1).\\" \\"Love is Lost\\" has the minimalism of Low with drums, bass, and keyboards and plods along as icily. \\"Heat\\" is truly the great ominous track of the album, being an obvious look to Scott Walker but with Bowie's more jaunty cut-up narrative -- perfect slice of a world that exists between two monoliths.<br /><br /> If the album suffers from one thing it's Bowie's post-90s sheen of slick production and clean mixes. But then again Let's Dance was pretty slick in that way, and he is a pop star, and he did once say that show biz is a whorehouse and he'd rather be the best. Still, it could have gone with one less overdub or resonant wash on each track. The other thing is that 14 tracks is a lot. There are two Bowie albums vying for your attention here: a more intense, frantic, world-weary continuation of Scary Monster's and Lodger's bloody dread (\\"The Next Day,\\" \\"Love Is Lost,\\" \\"How Does The Grass Grow?,\\" \\"If You Can See Me,\\" and \\"Heat\\") and a more tuneful Hunky Stardust, with tracks like \\"Dancing Out in Space,\\" \\"I'd Rather Be High,\\" and \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" bringing up the London Town Beat. It does succeed in being a rock album out of pure robust heft: It hits you the same way Scary Monsters hits you out of the gate, vocals, riffs and all. It is a rock-rock album and so eschews attempts to be artful, in much the same way Scary Monsters returned to the mainstream after three albums of art. It also has more of a cohesive narrative and song cycle than Heathen and Reality, so it is indeed a step forward for that. And he hasn't commented on guns, violence, militarism, and anxiety in a pop sense since Scary Monsters. That should be the focal point for The Next Day: It's quite slick and pleasing to ear, but the narratives are really depressing.

B005HED11Y|4.0|They did a good job remastering this series. Image quality is good on my hd televisions. As for the series, it was, it is and it will be a classic series. Big fan who enjoys watching the series from time to time. I don't like seeing any series or movie too often no matter how good it is.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|One of the movies you have to watch to believe, so typical of it's time, but good special effects, only downer is seeing OJ Simpson
B0085TJUGI|5.0|I originally bought this audio cd for my aunt who has a poor prognosis of terminal cancer; I briefly listened to it prior to giving it to her.  Anita narrates it herself and has such a calming and soothing voice.  Just by listening to the beginning prompted me to buy my own copy which I downloaded on my kindle.  I love her story and it is so well written.  She gives proof that miracles do happen and demonstrates the healing power within that we all have if we could learn to tap into it.  I hope and pray it will strike a cord for my aunt.  Healing does not mean curing and my intention was that in someway she will gain something from this book.
B0045HCJGC|4.0|Such a fun movie to watch, the future looks pretty bland until the Wesley shows up and Sylvester has to save the day.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I don't really think I understood what was supposed to happen in this game.  All I did was walk around for a while.  The controls for walking on the kindle fire made it hard to navigate the character so I got bored and deleted the game from my device.  I was glad I got it as the FAOTD.
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Like all Doctor Who seasons this one is truely fun to watch. Matt Smith does a great job continuing the legacy of the doctor.
B004SBX112|3.0|When I get stuck on a level, I am stuck. Wish there was a way to figure out the triggers.
B008CRC506|5.0|Love the songs, love the story, and I love the characters! If you want great broadway drama with no pitchy singing, I highly recommend SMASH!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am a medical doctor with 50 years of clinical and research medicine.  This book by Davis is a must read since it is a wealth of important information that can help reduce the explosion in diseases caused by excessive carbohydrate intake (carbopathy), with a special emphasis on the physiologic treacheries of &#34;modern&#34; wheat.  Now, if only my fellow colleagues can upgrade their medical practice and not take the usual 20 years to recognize a landmark work.<br />Stephen B. Strum, MD, FACP
B008476HBM|5.0|Good layout for a freebie. Nothing extraneous.<br />It doesn't contain any historical notes or explanations, but, hey, it's a freebie, so I'm not complaining. ))
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series and can't wait until I get season 3.  The writing is superb and the acting unbelievable!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game, something I can do and watch TV at the same time!  And it fits my personality really well.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What happened to Gale.  Did he get married and move on with his life? It was a good book and I enjoyed it.
1603427244|5.0|I loved this book just as much as I did when I picked it out. Loads of project possibilities.  Good Experience!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|An excellent, thought provoking story of a boy who listens to his heart & follows his dream. Full if lessons learned no matter the path taken.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It will bulk up the 3DS quite a bit, so I recommend for gamers with larger hands. Needs a battery or its own, but one comes included.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|WHYYYYYYY?<br /><br />NOW I'M A BRONY<br /><br />HELP ME<br /><br />PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE<br /><br />I CAN'T GET THIS OUT OF MY HEAD<br /><br />PINKY PIE WON'T LEAVE MY BRAIN
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Lots of cheap scares and very little story progression. Almost like the producers are starting to milk it too much.  I hope the series didn't peak with PA3. THAT was some scary-ness.<br /><br />There were some tense moments here. The last 5 minutes are the most frightening.
B006QF5CU6|5.0|Nobody beats James Caan as the bad guy buddy! Plus this is Arnold! And Vanessa Williams is very easy on the eyes. With loads of humor and an easily surmised plot, I enjoyed the non-stop action.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|Second book in the series. This one is just as good and exciting as the first. Can't wait to finish the last book in the series.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Season 6 is terrific! I am enjoying the whole Stargate run again! I watched before and enjoed it and now I am enjoying it again! Watching season 7 next!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is visually appealing and a lot of fun. Be warned though that it is very addictive. If you are a fan of Bejeweled I believe you will love this game and best of all it is free! I recommend this game for any match 3 fan. Very stable application, I have had no issues with it at all. Fun for young and old alike!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Great acting. Tommy Lee was great<br />Goodman was good too.<br />Great plot slow at spots<br />But it delivered overall.<br />Worth watching for sure.<br />Amazon prime is Great ..Love these free movies
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I only discovered Doctor Who a couple of years ago, but immediately became a fan.  Already I have watched the entire modern series 3 times through.  I am on my fourth time, and find it hard to wait between episodes.  You will not be disappointed and will find yourself glued to the screen for every episode.
0316212377|5.0|I was hooked from the first page. Can't stop using. This guy just keeps supplying us with the good stuff.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I have enjoyed playing it. The graphics an  the music are beautiful. It's enjoyable.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|I have not picked up a new Eric Burdon album in a long time. I tried to stick with him over the years but there was a real spotty period in the 80's and 90's and really never thought I would see a really strong album from him again. But after seeing all of the amazing reviews for his latest release Til Your River Runs Dry I just had to give this album a try. I was blown away from the first cut it was obvious that Eric Burdon was back and better than ever. Eric is in great voice and has an amazing band of musicians on this release. But what really stands out the most is songwriting on this disc. Very deep and thought provoking. At 71 it seems Eric is a man who really has something to say. His songwriting has not been this strong since the Eric Burdon and the New Animals records in the late 60's. I was so impressed with this album I am going to back track and get the last two albums that were recorded with the same musicians and producer as this one and see what I missed. I agree with one other reviewer this is one of the best albums of his lengthy career.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|The writer is full of himself and the book preaches too much.  Additionally, I'm well into the book and have yet to touch on the supposed subject of the book.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|A good friend from college is now a well known clinical psychologist specializing in addiction. Not long ago, we were talking about movies, especially those with a psychological theme. I asked him about Silver Linings Playbook, because I liked the movie, even though it was sort of edgy, with humor and romance. I wondered about the reality of the portrayal of mania, as Bradley swings from charming to dangerous in seconds. my friend says they were right on the money, and he discusses this film in his Psych classes.<br /><br />By the way, the guys are real, the football stuff is right on the money, the guy dialogue is REAL, and Bradley Cooper is amazing. Robert DiNiro is the frosting on the cake. The back story of DiNiro's character with his own problems leaves us wanting more, and is interesting enough to deserve it's own film.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the modern take on the galpal who is herself troubled, but she brings humor and affection to the role, as well as a genuine feeling of someone walking on the edge. She is stunning! I was amazed that she was also the star of [[ASIN:B00498YZH8 Winter's Bone]], one of my favorite films, as well as [[ASIN:B008602KQI The Hunger  Games]]! She is truly an astonishing talent who knows how to choose challenging roles that use her talents to their fullest.You would never find me watching dance, but the dance number is extraordinary to say the least. This was a movie that I saw without enthusiasm, but halfway through I was in love with Jennifer Lawrence...again!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|i like everything about  Doctor Who, to me there is nothing bad about any of these shows they are all great
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This amazing and uplifting film tells the story of Rodriguez, a legendary 70's rock singer from Detroit who attained cult status in Australia and New Zealand, while remaining a complete unknown in the United States. This is the stuff of legends, and the film makers provide a wonderful unraveling of the mystery and his story through interviews and great archival footage. I was very impressed with the filmography as well as the story. It is a vibrant, uplifting, redemptive tale of a man who is such a legend that he stands far above the rest of the rock music world. See it and believe, see it and cheer, but see it you must!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This game is nice but the app crashes. My son and I can only play 4 levels of the entire game, and for $2.99, that doesnt seem fair at all. Right after you complete level 4, you are supposed to see a video, then continue onto level 5. That does not happen though, the screen goes black, and a few seconds later, it takes me back to the home screen. I want a refund of my $2.99, which is a lot of money for such a simple and broken app.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|I found this book engrossing. I loved it from beginning to end and it seemed as though the writer was writing from a degree of personal experience. It was real for me.
0375869026|5.0|Loved this book. My daughter & I began reading it together, but she soon took over the book & finished it in under 2 days. Awesome story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the story and how it sucked me in right away. The writing wasn't the best but I was into the story and that was plenty for my boyfriend and I.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow this book is very kinky. But after reading it is a great conversation starter with any women because every women read and loves this book
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I don't think it's an urban version of Downton Abbey as others have said. There is not so much emphasis on maintaing social status, and on U.D., the downstairs staff isn't always in a panic as to whether they're following exact protocol. I just think the story line on U.D. is so much more interesting and more connected to what's going on in the outside world. I'm disappointed the series wasn't continued.
1610390938|5.0|This is one of the few books that kept me up at night thinking about the possibilities of its findings, concepts, and methods.<br /><br />At first, I thought of this book as behavioral economics of the poor, and how the findings may be used to help them.  As the book touched on universal human concepts (e.g. belief systems, procrastination, stress, dynamics of a family, transparency, usability), it was surprisingly relatable and applicable even in thinking about my life in America, lives of people around me, and global issues such as policies for environmental sustainability.<br /><br />Almost every bold statement the authors make is supported with at least one careful study, and oftentimes multiple studies repeated in different areas.  Thus, their concepts, many of which are around small impactful changes, left me feeling optimistic about global development.  Having worked in the consumer web industry, I can attest that small improvements in usability can generate large behavioral changes.  Some of their concepts could benefit from more studies, but I hope this is just the beginning, inspiring much more innovative research, randomized controlled trials, and thinking.<br /><br />The book is packed with facts, and well organized into chapters: Food, Health, Education, Family Planning & Dynamics, Insurance, Credit, Savings, Entrepreneurship, and Institutions.  I would recommend this book if you are interested in any of these topics.
B000GH3CVQ|3.0|the first CD of Glen Hansard I bought was Rhythm and Repose I played it over and over so I bought this one.  there are a few song that I like but on a whole it is just okay
0062014536|5.0|Oh wow, this week I listened to the last book in Lauren Oliver's Delirium series and when it was over I was surprisingly ok with the way things were wrapped up. This book was one of the most talked about books online and on twitter. I know I was one of those eagerly chomping at the bit, or book in this case, to get my hands on it. I loved the first book when I listened to it two years ago. I love distopian novels and the very idea of one where love is a disease, How they cured the delirium caused by love was intriguing. How do I write more about what I love about this book, or this series, without giving away spoilers? I don't think I can, so if you don't want to know anything or haven't read any of the books in the series then stop here and read no further.<br /><br />Requiem picks up right at the end of where Pandemonium left off with Alex not being dead, but alive, and he is hurting because he thinks Lena has moved on with Julian. There was one scene in the book that almost broke my heart because I am team Alex and that is when Lena is able to finally get Alex alone and they have a horrible fight. Words are spoken and hearts, including mine, were bruised if not broken. The roller coaster ride of emotions were at an all time high. I think this scene and the fact that Lena and Hannah were both narrating is what really brings the other side of the delirium issue home and as a reader I can connect with \\"the zombies\\" as well.<br /><br />In the first book we see Lena fall in love and then lose that love in such a tragic way. But we see her pick up the pieces and try to get on their is hope in the second book. In the second book she has to protect herself because she is filled with grief and guilt. There is hope, but then Alex comes back and her mom is alive and we think everything will be ok, but it's not because there is hurt and anger then people change and move on. That is what I like about Lauren Oliver's writing, it is real and they don't call right into each others arms because it is always the people you love the most that you hurt the most. For Hannah, Lena's best friend we find out that through her own jealousness she was the one that gave Lena and Alex's location away and has always felt guilty about that. She has now had the procedure and is cured. I think I can sympathize with that side as well, because while people should have the right to choose love, I can see how not feeling, not caring, would seem like the answer too. Hannah's procedure doesn't work exactly like it's supposed to because when you love and betray that love, these feelings become a part of your soul and are not easily wiped away. Even in our own society where terrorists can cause the death of thousands I can see the appeal of building barriers and trying to find cures against that kind of passion. Faith and love can make people do crazy things.<br /><br />That is what I loved about this book, that Lauren Oliver explored both sides of the issue in a beautiful and poetic way. I felt that while the ending seem lacking to some, I felt it was full of hope. I felt like both sides, the diseased and the cured, were not wrong. The issue is about choice and cutting yourself off and living life to the fullest. And as the book says, knock down those walls and those barriers even if it is just one person at a time. Everyone has the right to love or not to love.<br /><br />The audiobook is narrated by Sarah Drew and she voiced all three books in the series. Sarah is an actress and has been on shows like Grey's Anatomy. I think she does a fantastic job as the narrator. She really made the book come alive for me. Her narration of the Alex and Lena scene really gave that dramatic impact that just pushed into heart breaking for me. I could really see those two characters in the woods yelling at each other and the tears streaming down Lena's face because Ms. Drew sounded like she was crying as she voiced a sobbing Lena. I highly recommend not only reading Requiem, butlistening to it as well because their is nothing that really brings a book alive like a narrator who loves the story they are voice acting as much as the obsessed fans, like me.<br /><br />I give Requiem the audiobook five laser pistols because it really is a supernova.listening to it as well because their is nothing that really brings a book alive like a narrator who loves the story they are voice acting as much as the obsessed fans, like me.<br /><br />I give Requiem the audiobook five laser pistols because it really is a supernova.

B004QZ9PLU|4.0|She absolutely loves anything Nicholas Sparks and this didn't disappoint.  It will probably be made into a movie before long
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|It did show what transpired during that era.  However there could have been more of a story to it.  Some pretty good acting
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Brings world events to a very personal level.<br />Highlights that personal events -happy and sad are universal regardless of ones social status
1843106698|3.0|Just didn't give me the info I needed. I wanted more information about aspergers and this book just wasn't what I thought it was.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|the idea behind the story interested me, having two sons it is not always easy to &#34;read&#34; them.  i have recommended this book to several friends
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching Downton, my husband and I couldn't talk about anything else lol. We talked about the characters as if they were our freinds. I know that's sad but my point is this series is so well done, you will always be wanting more ABBEY! It is the new Pride and Prejudice !
B005OCFGTO|5.0|my sons girlfriend really wanted this and she was so excited when she opened it at christmas.....she loves harry potter so this was a perfect gift
B0060D11OU|3.0|Heres the thing, I liked this movie  as a child and I still love all the songs but the underlined story of big bad banks and the whole feminine, movement is pretty apparent. And what is mary poppins? Is she a witch? is she magical? And Who really cares about fat old birds over saving up your money? I guess not everyone is as synical as I am but it just goes to show once you have become an adult you have a different outlook on things. So I say if you want your kids to have some entertainment this is better than most. but also understand they might be going through a boot camp<br />of liberalism without knowing it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I am a great fan of the Castle series.  The fourth season has great shows as have all the prior series.  If anything, they just keep getting better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|For all Pride and Prejudice lovers this is the new generation! This series has so many stories with in the story you stay on edge through each episode. Not a lot of action but you do get emotionally attatched to the characters.. Even the ones you hate!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|All my equipment fit perfectly; one camera, 7 lenses, light meter and accessories.  Very well patted and lots of straps for support. Also great for the price. I recommend this as a starter backpack.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie keeps you on edge the whole time! A+ cast. Actors did a great job just being real people in an insane situation. At first I thought that the acting could be a little better and then I realized that theses are actors protraying everyday people, newlyweds, annalists, etc.. So DUH! They did a great job! A definite must see!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I missed one episode on tv and was so glad I could watch it here to get caught up before the next one was on
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I love all the old batman movies and I love Christian Bale but Come on! I can't even watch the movie becuase of his character's voice. I mean why does he have to talk like he has a frog in his throught and what director would allow him to do that? Thumbs down, i seriously couldn't even watch it.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Much more interesting than I originally expected.  Under advertised, my husband really enjoyed it.  Suspense, era a, little action, and some comedy.
B00181MHQU|5.0|I am a sucker for musicals and this one with the cinamatography is my favorite. I watched first when I was 12 and fell in love with the movie score. when I have watched it as an adult and parent my heart acccepted it in a whole new way. The story is not just Romeo and Juliet-ish, it is a deep rich story of a broken system and the lives of just hurting scared people with their reactions to society. I love it but then it breaks my heart at the same time.. A++ for this movie. I Love you Tony and Maria !!!!!!!! LOL
044661758X|4.0|As in previous Connelly (Bosch) novels, the first half sets the stage but is not all that compelling. However, Bosch comes alive in the second half and the reader can't wait to turn a page, push a button or touch a screen to get on with the drama. In Concrete Blonde, Connelly leaves the reader hanging on the cliff until almost the last page. I was stumped as to \\"who done it\\" until almost the very end. Bosch shows more of his soft side through his love connection with Sylvia than in past writings. If you like courtroom drama, this book is for you. In The Concrete Blonde, Connelly again comes through as one of the best, if not the best, talented mystery writers of our time.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This movie is full of action, love tease and a crazy friendship.. Super funny, I recommend this movie to all over the age or 13!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie really took me by surprise. It was well-written, hilarious, even suspenseful. It certainly deserves to be celebrated with all of Pixar's past classics like Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Monsters Inc.
0670026603|5.0|STORY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Pamela Dorman Books January 1, 2013 Hardcover ISBN: 978-0-670-02660-9<br /><br />They had nothing in common until love gave them everything to lose.  Louisa Clark is an ordinary girl living an exceedingly ordinary life - steady boyfriend, close family who has never been farther afield than their tiny village.  She takes a badly needed job working for ex-Master of the Universe, Will Traynor, who is wheelchair bound after an accident.  Will has always lived a huge life, big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel, and now he's pretty sure he cannot live the way he is.<br /><br />Will is acerbic, moody, bossy - but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected.  When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.<br /><br />A love story for this generation, Me Before You, brings to life two people who  couldn't have less in common - a heartbreakingly romantic novel that asks, What do you do when making the person you love happy also means breaking your own heart?<br /><br />My Review:<br /><br />Louisa Clark loses her waitress job and her family is desperate for money.  Her father was also laid off from his job and her sister, Treena has returned to university so she isn't contributing any income to the family at all.  Plus her Mom is at home taking care of her grandfather.<br /><br />Lou visits the local job seeking agency and takes on a couple of low paying mundane jobs that only last a few days at a time.  Just as she has exhausted the list the agency has for her, a new job comes through that pays more than the minimum wage.  Someone is needed to care for a quadriplegic man on a daily basis but Louisa doesn't want to take on a job where she has to clean up bodily fluids and help someone to the toilet.  The agency checks and finds out that none of that will be required of her as they have a male nurse who comes two or three times per day to perform those dreaded tasks.  All Louisa has to do is keep Will Traynor company, never leave him alone for longer than 15 minutes at a time, and do some light housekeeping and makes Will his meals.  She takes the job.<br /><br />The first day she meets, Wil,l she can't stand the man.  He is rude, arrogant, offensive, and belligerent.  No matter what Lou does it doesn't seem to make Will happy.  He makes fun of her clothing, her shoes, what she says and even what she doesn't say.  Will finds something to complain about or to get his \\"poor me\\" message out there into the world.<br /><br />As time passes, things begin to change and Louisa begins to understand what it's like for, Will to be trapped in the wheelchair 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  She thinks about never being able to scratch her own nose again, to never being able to pick up a pen and write down a quick phone number, or to just get up and take a quick stroll around the garden.<br /><br />Will is very unhappy and doesn't want to live but Louisa decides before her six-month contract is up that she is going to change his mind and prove to him that life really is still worth living for.  However, she didn't expect that they'd fall in love which would ultimately ruin her longstanding seven-year relationship with her boyfriend, Patrick.<br /><br />Louisa begins to search the internet for activities that quads can do.  She's willing to even take him overseas on a trip if she has too just to prove to Will that he CAN still do the a lot of the things he used to, just in a different way.<br /><br />However, when Louisa finds out exactly why her contract to care for Will is only six-months, she completely cracks under the pressure and is totally, totally devastated.  She immediately tenures her resignation and returns home.  Camilla Traynor, Will's mother, comes to Louisa's home and begs her to reconsider and to come back because she's the only person they've ever had that hasbeen able to change Will.  He has actually been happy and pleasant and quite lovely to be around.

B009K86D86|1.0|The movie has some interesting points and facts, however it is hard not to get distracted by how hard they are trying to make the food industry look bad. It is so bad it makes me question the reliability of their facts.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Disney has made one of the best movies of last year in this. As a gamer and an animation fan, this movie hits the spot on various levels.<br />My only peeves has to do with the packaging. Once again, they package the discs in a case that fits disc on top of disc, instead of each disc having their own holder. So, if i want to get at the DVD, i have to take out the bluray disc that on top of it, etc. That's really poor and almost all new releases are coming like that (this, Frankenweenie, Avengers as far as i can remember). I may stop buying Blurays if this keeps up.
B00112GVFO|5.0|This movie did Clive's book justice. Steve Zahn adds great comedy relief. The movie got me reading the other NUMA books.
B002MFV2IK|5.0|It is a farce which is extremely well acted, filmed, and edited.  A classic comedy with the message that in spite of a fantasy we all have about living forever, we wouldn't want etermal life.
0393342212|5.0|The book offers great examples of common sibling problems and fights and then offers practical solutions on how to handle them without making things worse.

B007BVMVDU|4.0|I was really delighted at the closeness these films had to the book version. The stars are just great. I found the characters to be very<br />believable.  Although I knew it was coming watching my favorite act die was a little upsetting to the ones watching with me.<br />I look forward to watching season 2.

0525951652|5.0|Follett is my favorite story telleer.  I have read all his books and always look forward to his next.  Wonderful.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I watched this movie with my family and we all LOVED it!  It's a movie version of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.  I remember that event very well, having lived through that period.  Critics have complained that Ben Afflect demonized the Iranian people in this movie.  I disagree.  I thought he did a pretty accurate picture of the people in Tehran at that time.  The Iranian people's anger at the U.S. for allowing their former King, the Shah of Iran, to be in our country for medical reason came through the nightly news exactly as shown.  (Of course, the Iranian people had their reason for being angry with the Shah, but that's another story.)<br /><br />Ben Afflect did a wonderful job directing this movie.  The script moved and the casting was great, but keep in mind that this is a movie.  The concept of creating a fake movie to be carried out by the CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Afflect), was real.  All the other stuff (i.e. procuring the passports at the last minute, the airport chase, etc, etc) never happened.  But it made for a good thriller and kept us at the edge of our seats!  This DVD also has a special feature with the REAL 1979 hostages alongside the actors recalling their experiences.  It was fun to see them side-by-side.<br /><br />This covert operation was classified until much later when the information was released to the public and was picked up Joshua Bearman from the WIRED magazine in 2007.  We now know that we owe our gratitude for the safe return of the American hostages to Tony Mendez and to the courageous people who worked in the Canadian Embassy in Iran.  This movie does not take away from that fact.<br /><br />I read in the news that the CURRENT Iranian government is considering suing Argo for making them look bad.  If they want to sue anyone for making them look bad, then they need to sue themselves.  Most of the Iranian people are intelligent, kind, and hard working.  They are not all religious fanatics.  (I know this for a fact.)  This movie just showed the event and the mood of that period, nothing more.ust showed the event and the mood of that period, nothing more.

B006LSZECO|4.0|liked the book.....very well written.....contrived.  in depth characters and plot.  while perhaps necessary, i hated the ending. will there be a sequel?
B001UTW7QU|5.0|was expecting a low-rent X-Files knockoff and was pleasantly surprised that it's a very WELL DONE X-Files knockoff. Highly enjoyable.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This seasons full of surprises and unlimited laughs. Can't wait for more episodes to populate. This is one of my favorite shows.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|What can i say if you liked the movie you will like this CD.  It is exactly the same and I thought the music was great
B001UTW7QU|2.0|I couldn't make it through the first season to see if it got any better, I only lasted the first 3 episodes.<br /><br />I love a good story with plots that include mysterious (and maybe make believe) plots but the story must be cohesive and, to a point, believable.  Interrogations being shown on closed circuit televisions in visitor waiting areas of government buildings.  Said visitors being able to walk into government interrogation rooms and question suspects without anybody seeing them go in or trying to stop them.  There was example after example of &#34;that could never happen&#34; and those examples had nothing to do with secret experiments.

0307887448|5.0|Imagine a world where you could be anyone, do any thing and visit all of your favorite childhood memories. Now delve into wade watts world, insert the coin and Ready Player One.<br /> This book is about a 17-year-old boy named Wade Watts living in the year 2044. The earth is suffering from an energy crisis, polluted atmosphere and global poverty. To escape this ugly reality many have fled to their virtual heaven called oasis. One-day news spreads that the creator of oasis James Halliday has died. With no heir to his infinite wealth he decides to put it up to grabs in an all out hunt. Any one who can find three keys and three gates will gain access to his easter egg that grants the user complete control of oasis and all of Halliday's wealth. So the quest for the egg begins.<br /> The theme of this geeky book is don't be ashamed to nerd out. This can be seen as wade begins to discover that all of the challenges he faces are based off of Halliday's favorite things, all things 80s. With wades similar obsession he is able to figure out Halliday's riddles and becomes a famous gunter (egg hunter).<br /> Ernest Cline does a wonderful job of making exciting unique characters. Wade may seen at first glance as a typical cliché nerd loser at life awesome online but he changes this up by making him a loser in both worlds. Wade has to earn his respect online and eventually as the story progresses becomes more witty and risky both online and offline. Aech wade's partner in crime and secretly his only true friend at the beginning of the book is also a unique character. He acts as the popular kid in oasis and hangs out with wade a low level avatar because he sees that in reality wade is one of the most skilled gunter due to his knowledge of Halliday. His true identity is always a topic of debate between the two and his actual persona is a huge plot twist. Art3mis the subject of wades affection is a powerful gun slinging character. She is a nervous wreck at first but then lightens up to wade. Her ideas for what to do with the prize money make her one of the most generous character in the book<br /> The plot is riveting and full of twists. Along with the extensive imagery that puts you into this world it really is a page-turner. \\"Entering the distracted globe was more than a little disorienting. The inside of the giant sphere was completely hollow, and its curved interior surface served as the clubs bar and lounge area \\"<br /> The one weak point of the book is the low usage of figurative language. Its presence is next to invisible on the book. However it is not a factor that is really needed in this book. To make up for this tons and tons of imagery was used to really paint this expansive world with different planets. As well as the good dialogue used through out the book<br />  Its strong characters, plot, and theme really make ready player one a great read. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading. You do not need to get all the references in order to like the book. Just get ready to meet your inner geek.
B005PM3YII|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I found myself putting the kids to bed earlier so that I could read what happened next. Interesting characters, unexpected plots and a great ending that tied up loose ends very well. I am officially a Brandon Sanderson fan!
0307346617|3.0|Zombies! The main point of World War z that can often attract many in this zombie loving society. This leads many to essentially judging this book by its cover and unintentional loving the book before they are able to actually able to understand its true purpose. This is not to say that world war z is a bad book but this highly overrated book rides on the idea that a zombie apocalypse is sure to happen as if zombies and not our own mistakes would be the thing to drive humankind near extinction.<br />  World War z follow a strange plot train that follows the events of the zombie apocalypse from the first few cases to full out war and finally the victory of mankind. It does this by the author creating a false reporter who goes around the world speaking to the survivors of the war. The first case starts out in china with doctor Kwang Jing-shu who is making a house call in a small village. At first he thinks of the villagers as\\"\\" then he sees first hand why they were panicking from seeing the little boy acting ravenous. After untying him dr. shu saw the power this boy had and how he didn't even flinch once his arm fell. The book has many such stories that can be riveting and bring a quick jolt of excitement twist and turns. Unfortunately this gets you to fall deeply in a new character's story keeping you on your toes until you reach an abrupt end to the story and are left with a significantly less interesting story. The book ping pongs through interesting and uninteresting stories. Due to this the book can become a troublesome ordeal for readers who enjoy character focused books.<br />The language used throughout the book is somewhat basic but can occasionally become fancy. This however can be understandable because of the limitations that the author faced. In order to maintain its realistic views most of the characters talked as everyday people with little jargon or strong figurative language. Todd Wainio an ex-solder from the war \\"They wanted to show the people that they were still in charge, get them to calm the hell down\\" such language is common through the book<br />The theme of this book appears to be the unrelenting force for the human desire to survive. The book stays true to this theme through by depicting story's of hiding underground killing each other for food and finally cannibalism<br />Overall the over hyped up World War z ended up being nothing more or nothing less than decent.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|My 5 stars is indicative of my feelings towards this movie rather than the actual Blu-Ray itself.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time and, to these admittedly untrained eyes, the Blu-ray version looks better than the DVD that came out a few years ago.  The deleted scenes still look like garbage.<br /><br />I definitely like the cover of the Blu-ray more than the DVD and VHS versions!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't fall asleep watching it, so it had to be good! I fall asleep to most movies.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Just use the FaceBook app on kindle. Full Facebook is painfully slow and freezes often. Not a fan. At all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was really good book I loved how the story was told. I'm really bad at reading books and not finishing but now I'm on to the next
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was so amazing.  It is definitely one of my favorite Nicky Sparks books.  I was completely captivated by the relationships between the characters.  And who doesn't love a book with a loyal dog in it?  MUST READ.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A lot if repetition on intimacy and sex scenes but I found this book very interesting and could not put it down- the whole series was enlightening!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hated the writing of this book.  It was exactly like Twilight, but awful writing.  She needs an original thought!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not a happy teenage love story with much violence.  Still a gripping tale I could not put down till the end.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I hated the writing of this book.  It was exactly like Twilight, but awful writing.  She needs an original thought!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I think this is one of the best games that I've ever played as so,it's so addicting, I recommend this game everybody
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of Nicky Sparks best books to date. I can't sing it's praises enough!  It's the Guardian meets the Lucky One! Mystery, love, and a shocking twist at the end.  Couldn't stop crying for the latter portion of the book.  Translated to a great movie too!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Kept you guessing all the way through. Could really feel the emotions from her character. Couldn't put it down! Buy this book.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Gorgeous costumes, way too much debauchery for my taste. It may have occurred but it didn't have<br />to be captured in detail on the screen. What really hit home is the intolerance each position the different<br />religions/churches took involving torture, and various forms of putting someone to death.<br />That's not of God, but definitely of men. Ann Boleyn didn't pay attention to what she was fighting for<br />because it was also used against her. Somewhat educational.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This a good action game. And is allso a kind of hard game. Bu this realy fun for how much it is.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I saw the first season on HBO then we moved and got cable again but did not pick up HBO do to the expense. Saw this on amazon and jumped on it Great series if you don,t mind R rated movies. Can not wait to get season three
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It's interesting to hear Taya's side of all these deployment stories. This man was a true American hero and he will  be missed.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I'm a writer, and so this is perfect for me because I can write down my ideas in a notebook that is unlimited on pages. You can also password protect it, which I love.<br />But a word of advice: pencil and paper is always best because electronics can crash at any time
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it the best game I've ever played I like it how you get caught up in the action.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and entertaining especially when you're bored<br />It lets you ride the horses, train them, earn money from working, and the gems that you have to buy with real money are not hard to earn
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is interesting. Even though it really is NOTHING in proximity to the PC version-with the exception of trying to find the 8 pages-It seriously is equally as scary!! Putting it in a setting Day OR Night. But the best part about this game is that it's portable. :D
1616550414|5.0|It is awesome! It is full of info and colorful pictures along with the blue prints of the characters!! I recommend this book for any Legend of Zelda fan!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I really enjoyed Skyfall.  Daniel Craig is awesome.  It had all the elements of a good Bond movie.  My face part was when he brought out the retro Bond car.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery charge monitor is perfect. It tells you how much battery power remains and how long you can use it for various applications. How long you can read, play games, access the Internet, or play videos. It is simple to use and easy to download and understand. Plus, it was free when I downloaded it. Good Ap and a good deal.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I understand why Argo won the Academy Award for best picture.  Even though I knew how it ended, I was still on the edge of my seat.  I cannot wait to see it again.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love having access to the older seasons of Dr Who. I love Donna as a companion. I love David Tennant as the Dr.<br />What could be better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|For someone who skeptically looked at my wife and said, \\"really?\\" when she suggested we start watching this show, I'm now eating my words.  I find the plots really interesting, the setting very well done, and the characters fully developed.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, blows the whistle on what the super wealthy really do behind the scenes, perhaps revealing more about how the world works than any documentary.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Started watching this because my granddaughter said she liked it...Now I can't get enough.  I do wished they'd explain the characters a little more
B00079HZUM|5.0|I don't know why this did not receive more attention. Found Crudup, Danes and Everett to be at their best. The entire cast was perfect. Certainly they were all Oscar worthy.  The screenplay is witty and believable.  If you don't know about Samuel Pepys you should look him up.  To know the whole thing is based on actual events makes it that much more compelling.  And I have never seen an Othello death scene on stage nearly as exciting as this.  Look up the real story of Margaret Hughes.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Seriously...you actually might think this stuff COULD happen!!!  Don't want to do anything else but watch more episodes!  Addicted :)
B007SGM084|5.0|oh my is all i have to say... although i have to write 6 more words... this book is great!
B007FH9GT2|3.0|I enjoyed this, but the swedish version, out just a few years ago, covered the book well and didn't need re-making.  the writers changed the story a bit, but we didn't get much new here.  I'd rent the swedish version and put up with the subtitles instead of renting this.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Enjoyed this book greatly. A testament to what our troops realy have to ender while doing our dirty work around the world.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Just rent the original with Arnold.  The storyline behind this movie is just terrible.  The acting is fine.  I had trouble paying attention by the end of the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great writing and acting, I just love this series...can wait for season 3, Kudos to Amazon for carrying this on Prime.
B0086700CM|3.0|my 5 year old likes this.  but he doesn't learn anything and I'm taking it away from him.  Rather boring to me.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|An alternate history of August 2008, where an imaginary Lehman Bros decides to save itself rather than bank on a bailout.  Pretty dramatic, considering that the climactic event is the sale of some overpriced bonds.  Paul Bettany is great as a wildly cynical trader.<br />The one false note that struck me is the gimmick of staring in horror at a computer screen which is never actually shown to us (like a monster in a Spielberg movie).
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|I took this away from my kid because he became addicted to it but it taught him nothing.  Shame on me.
B005T87QCI|2.0|I honestly really like this game, but there are some things that I don`t like. I would like to unlock Atom and Zeus and all the others without paying a dollar.
1476729719|1.0|I wish Jodi Piccult would use her international platform and her immense skill as a storyteller to do something more useful. 19 Minutes is a total waste of her time and yours.  It's a pathetic story with pathetic characters who say and do pathetic things.  Spoiler alert.  The plot is about a nerdy teenaged-boy who goes on a Colombine-style massacre at his high school. And why?  Because he's been subjected to relentless, socially acceptable acts of violence ever since his very first trip on a school bus at the age of five, and he finally wants it to end.  The story is not believable because it's so over-the-top.  Even more,  Piccult never makes us care about any of the characters.  They're just too miserable to like.  Piccult's depiction of American home and school life is depressing and soulless.  It would be way too bad if people from other countries read this book and are mistakenly persuaded to believe its an accurate representation of our culture.  I didn't enjoy this book in any way and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1451608659|5.0|Great book. Kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />5***** would definitely recommend to anyone who loves a great book
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|Satisfying on many levels.  Cinematography was excellant.  Can't believe all of the natural beauty around the world.  We need to slow down and experience it.
B005LJJESY|1.0|Don't waste your money on a disappearing movie - I was not able to watch this movie through Amazon Instant Video service.<br />If you purchase the video from their streaming service and you think that you can watch it indefinitely, you should think again.  But the fact is that the studio can stop any streaming movie from Amazon and Amazon cannot do anything about it.<br /><br />Since Amazon does not permit me to post the link,<br />do a search on techdirt and amazon instant video to find out the reason.<br /><br />Unless Amazon changes their way of video streaming, I will stop purchasing of digital videos from them.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Was an entertaining movie with all of the Old Action Heros aboard. Only one missing was Segal. Even a bit of tongue and cheek in between blowing up stuff.  Total guys film.

0761163808|5.0|This book is incredible.  It's a great book for 'hard to buy for' boys...even big ones!  It's not only got the amazing lenticular photo's, but info on each animal.  Well worth it.

B008J05EL8|1.0|I should have stuck with the docs to go app I have on all my other devices. Dataviz May have minor issues but they don't double charge like this.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is a long awaited CD from a master songwriter, guitar player, and performer.  Some of the cuts are reminiscent of Justin as we know him, but many of them are very different from what we have heard in the past.  The songs seem to show a more personal side than previous songs.  The lyrics are  quite moving, and the orchestration is wonderful.  I am a huge Moody Blues and Justin Hayward fan, and this CD did not disappoint me at all.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a very mellow and relaxing game. My two yr old even got the hang of it now she begs to play this when waiting in the car for Mom or when we are at appointments  and such.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series captured my attention from the very first episode.  The story line is sentimental, but also representative of real life challenges faced by the characters.  The acting is superb, as well.
B00138KJY0|5.0|Hey I don't have to judge the man to like his tunes. He is in my opinion a musical Icon and he pioneered a new wave of great music! This is a great album
B006HL9G10|4.0|I like the ability to set my own 'preset' tones and times.  Rich tones continue to hum.  Very relaxing for meditation.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I have done some half descent pieces of art but this app majestically of things so much easier. I am thrilled to have gotten it. You don't have to be a pro to explore your creative side! This app can help people who are trying to see if they really have an eye for drawing and artistic expression.<br />Give it a shot its worth it.
0786962984|5.0|Bought to play with my children since this game introduced me to D&D a long time ago. They have loved it and it has provided some great family game time without too much stress or learning curve.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this on my Kendall.  It is very easy to see and I like the hint feature.  I play it a lot.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|If you want to get something nice and cheap this is the best option to buy! the watch looks really decent!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is very addicting and I like the graphics and the goals.  I would recommend to anyone. Very fun game.  It is very easy to play and very user friendly.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I couldn't get through this movie. My husband and I turned it off after 41 minutes of &#34;dysfunction for dysfunction's sake.&#34; My husband and I are both physicians and enjoy a good thriller like everyone else, but this was just too over the top. I was just thankful that my 87 year old father was out for the evening and not watching it with us...I think he made the right choice.
B009VMN3RA|2.0|If 10% of this book is true these people are nut cases,  The parents AND the writer.  It is almost creepy.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I spent a few days with this game earlier this year, and enjoyed the heck out of it. Good to see it on Amazon's FAOTD. The simple premise(s) are easy to learn (I played on my Kindle Fire), and the music is wonderful. It's a great game to play with headphones.<br /><br />All modes (orbit, anti-matter, etc.) are played with the same control, and your objectives, layout, and 'enemies' are lightly different. And there's free-play mode as well, but I don't recall if that's available from the start of the game, or if you have to complete most of the levels first.<br /><br />One neat feature is having the ability to speed up or slow down your orbits/movements. This is useful when things are very very tight (slow down!), or when they're very very drawn out (long, slow-speed orbits).<br /><br />The levels get HARD ... and by 'hard', I mean that you just need a LOT more patience than I have. There are some Youtube videos of upper level boards being accomplished, and they can take up to 30 minutes to complete. If I had spent half that time, only to get nailed by a red or green bloboid and have to start over, I'd probably throw my tablet at the nearest wall!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The shield is a hard hitting savage cop show.<br />no matter how good Vic Mackey tries to appear he will always be a dirty .
B001PJ5UIM|5.0|It is interesting to listen to this with the benefit of the Steely Dan and Donald Fagen library of music in mind.  It is, indeed, a logical part of an evolution and continuum for a gifted artist and gifted collaborators. I enjoyed it when it first was released, and with time have come to appreciate it even more.  Listening to this and to Sunken Condos in close proximity helps cement the artistic path of Mr. Fagen.  A small classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a good ending. It only took me 3 days to read it. I was sad that it was over but I can't wait to see what the movies will be like.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Great documentary but did not have a strong ending. The beginning and middle are fantastic. It made me care about this studio and gave some insight to some classic albums. I see what was trying to be done in the end by bringing back all of these artist but it didn't have a big punch that a doc needs for a ending.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This movie was good. I was happy that the app that went with it was free. It helped to see the movie differently.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie was just delightful. Reminded me of classic Disney. Tons of video game references and the voice acting was terrific.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I am not that big of a Star Trek fan but this movie if awesome. I can not wait to see Into Darkness when it comes out in May.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Honestly one of my favorite story lines of all time. Movies, TV shows, books, you name it this series is the best!
B00513HXE2|5.0|This was a really good book. I was interested to learn about events before the first movie. This book is just one of many in my collection.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I finished it in like 5 days, consider this is one of the several books that I actually finished from cover to cover, while English as my second language, so this really speaks to itself.<br /><br />Considering buying book II.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie was a great way to start off the series. Guy Pierce has a good idea of how Holmes should act and do.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Whether you will like the premise of this novel is difficult to say but there is no question that the author knows<br /> the ins and outs of criminal law and how to write a compelling story.
0765324857|5.0|I am a huge fan of Bioshock and when I found out that there was a book, I had to have it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Well directed account of an historical escape that was widely reported later in news account.  The scene shots and performances held attention throughout.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a really good sequel. It only took me 3 days to read this book. Then I started the last one.
B009IK5UJ4|5.0|sometimes it actually hurts to listen to something this beautiful.<br />my life would be less complete without this album.<br />words can't describe the feeling that happens when i put on headphones and just listen.<br />just listen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really good book. It took me a while to read this book cause I had school and work but once I got to the summer, I finished it immediately and bought the second and third one.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|This LEGO item is the perfect centerpiece for the casual setting for the Bride & Groom shower we are planning. It's cute and yet inexpensive. It is perfect for the son we raised on LEGO's!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This was a really good cd. I can not wait to see what Linkin Park has in store for us in the next year or two.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Sorry when you ask for hints, the hints give you one then same thing again really no follow thru on the hints.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The movie was good but I like the book better. I did have a little problem with my first copy being defective but Amazon set it straight for me so I have no complaints.
B0063GORYU|2.0|Sorry, not a fan,  I wish I could work with it, but I just can't seem to get the interest!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie was great. It was weird to see how the Aliens actually got started. I can't wait for the next movie.
B004PKO5AM|4.0|This is to be viewd and enjoyed  by those who know Carlos Kleiber works with classical music. I am one of them.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|This app is handy when you want to remember something. I use this app occassionally when I am in a hurry and need to write something for later.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Combining music (Maestro Stokovsky' grandiose performance) with animated Mickey Mouse and other characters depicted, is realy an work of genius !
1611134226|5.0|Wow!  One surprise after another for Agent Pendegast and his fans.  I hated to see this one end, but it left me eagerly hoping for a next Pendegast adventure .
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Some of the scenes were a bit quirky, but all in all it was a good movie that I enjoy watching multiple times. This is not for anyone seeking Oscar performances. But if you want to see a fun, light movie... this could be for you.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|This book is a good continuation of the previous story line.  Gabaldon's writing ability is amazing...her lively descriptions of flora, fauna and life unfolding around her is always fun to read!
B0035XQW74|5.0|This movie is great! Butler is the best bad guy I've seen in many years. Watching the movie you just get a sense for Butler's pain over the death of his family and can almost understand the frustration in the criminal justice system. I love this movie!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Had this game on my phone for awhile loved it bu, enjoy it more on my kindle larger print good for all ages.
B008XG1X18|3.0|My wife got this product and got it so she could follow certain items within the program. I don't use it at all.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This is very good, well made and functional case, but my personal preference is the slimmer and lighter Amazon case.
034580404X|5.0|We purchased this for my oldest daughter. She doesn't read much, but after reading the first in the series she actually read the whole collection within about 3 weeks.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I like puzzle games that let you take your time and this one fits the bill. The artwork is lovely too. Levels get a little more challenging as you progress. there's also a timed challenge if grooving on the pretty pics isn't what you like best.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a great movie! My family loves the movies about Dr. Suess and will watch them over and over again. This movie depicts a very loveable character with lots of character. Great Movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is so much better than the movie. I just want to read all of the books now. I fell in love with this book
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Here's the deal, yes it is sexy and it did really grab me at first, then I just got bored with the whole thing and wanted to get to the end.  So I moved to the end to see that he became her boyfriend.<br /><br />Sorry guys, I just could not stay interested in reading all that sex stuff.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show on TV. Here are more words to fill this review. Here are a couple more because that wasn't enough.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Item was shipped very soon.<br />Good quality! The color is very beautiful~<br />Like it very much!<br />Will buy it again~
B0095P29EG|3.0|Story line is fairly standard just playing off a different set of legendary figures. Graphics for the big screen may have been why the movie was made, but nothing special on TV screen
1451695195|5.0|This book is very well written and based on the scientific training and experience of a neurosurgeon.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the possibility of an afterlife.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I didn't want to put this down.  Loved the twisted ending.  I have a 14 year old son (thankfully he is nothing like Jacob) but it was really interesting reading this story since I can almost put myself in the narrator's shoes.
0307592731|5.0|This is a powerful story about human frailty, folly, fitness, and redemption.  Reminded me of the novel Cold Mountain.  The heroine is on a quest for salvation through the mountains of the Pacific Crest Trail.  She is unprepared for the challenge.  She starts out by making life threatening errors.  She is alone in the wilderness.  But she pushes on.  Along the way, she tells us about her less than ideal life.  Of tragedy and folly.  Of personnel weaknesses and mistakes.  Tragic childhood.  Loss of family.  Cheryl Strayed makes many questionable decisions in her young life.  Certainly one of the most Quixotic decisions is to hike over a thousand miles through the high wilderness of the Pacific coastal mountain chains.  This is an exciting story, a heroic story and a philosophical masterpiece.  You will not be left unmoved by this book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Lots of Alzheimer's Disease runs in my family.  I thought of my grandfather on every page and my heart aches for what he has gone through.  Genova is a great story teller and really gets inside the mind of an Alzheimer's patient.  Moving, compelling...great read!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The story has all the elements that make one involved in all of the characters, the ups and downs of one's choices, and thankfully happiness in the end.<br />I, personally would have liked to have seen a richer sense of spiritual awakening in the adult as he told his story, so I found it as a weight that kept the tone of the movie down.<br />I would watch it again and would recommend it to others.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|How have I not heard of this artist sooner? She is amazing, her voice is beautiful, the lyrics are touching and intimate, and I haven't stopped hitting replay. Looking forward to her next album already (just like when I first heard Adele - which is funny since Emeli's first name is Adele). Hope there will be a US tour announced soon!
031603438X|5.0|This is a great autobiography of Keith Richards. Amazing from start to finish, detailed ( sometimes too much so) but a great read.<br />You get it right away, he is rock n roll , he could not have been anything else.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This is the best mobile browser that I have been able to find! I've tried just about all of them including Opera, Chrome & Firefox & always have come back to Dolphin. I use the Beta version and it works excellently!
0345529057|5.0|amazing series, both in print and TV..the books are a bit hard to follow and require your full concentration, but what incredible writing..if you are a 'reader' these are for you
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This was a God send for me as I was a Windows phone user for years. So, when I changed to Android I was worried about all of my documents from my other phone until I was told about this app. This app lets you use your documents from Windows. The bad thing is that the normal price is $14.99 but I got it on a special promotion and only had to pay $3.99...SCORE!!!  BUY IT NOW!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. Never disapoints. Have been a fan since day one. Will be with the show until the bitter end.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|I used this browser for months until I was talked into trying Dolphin. WOW! What I had been missing was astonishing! DO NOT USE OPERA OR THE OTHERS! You only need Dolphin.
B00AJLHUYO|1.0|My girl brought the movie home from the red box or somethin and i don't even like scarry s*** so i was like whatever cause i gotta be a man an all you know. I dont even understand what the hell was going on and that dude with no mouth freaked me the hell out and i got diarrhea for three days bro. Now I think my girl may break up with me but i told her the Mcrib gave the some junk and so it may be cool now.    If you don't like scarry dead kids then don't watch this cause you are going to see them all the time and they are just hiding everywhere and rubbing blood all over s*** and turnin s*** on that aint sposed to be on and you aint gonna beleve tha end! dude that s*** is wack! dont watch this movie because it is messed up and it may change you for life and not in a good way.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I gave up on television over a decade ago.  In the sea of utter rubbish that pervades the airwaves, this program is so refreshing:  a shining oasis in the sludge.  Beautiful character development, acting, cinematography, setting, and attention to detail.  Maggie Smith delights at every appearance!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Scary, sexy, interesting. Keeps you guessing and wanting more. I recommend it to anyone who likes horror or a very unique story.
B00371XIP8|5.0|These series are soooo good!  They have blended humor, murder, mobs, gangsters, Catholic faith, and everything in between into a movie with a whole lot of talent!  This movie  totally keeps your attention.  You're emotions go from laughing out loud to suddenly serious, then sad, then laughing then curious then on and on and on.  You do have to begin with the first one to follow along in the second and the second gives you insight to the first.  It's a must see!!  Even if you are squemish of blood it probably won't bother you cause you'll be laughing anyway.
B001MTENOC|5.0|Life altering!!!! If you are interested in the spirit world or where the soul goes to live..then this one is for you!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done it again!  He is a true artist.  I never wanted this book to end, and fortunately, more are coming.  I became immersed in this world and truly cared about the characters.  I thought he got the balance just right between appealing to women without being overly-sentimental, and appealing to men without being only about battle scenes.  This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I'm an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader.  I wanted to try and savor it and read slowly, because I knew the next book wasn't available yet, but I couldn't put the book down.  I thought the book ended at a good point, not really a frustrating cliff-hanger.  I love everything Brandon Sanderson has written.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Will you ever fly again after watching this? Himm. Doubtful, but you'll have fun watching this. Denzel rocks as always.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I  began reading every day at age 4. My grandmother taught me phonetically and ran her finger under every word when she read to me from the time I was about 18 months old. This is my BEST read in at least l5 years.  I could not put it down and have 8 friends immersed in Shantaram now.  I just got my kindle two months ago and am considering an upgrade.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I sure do love this game, especially having teammates!  This game is a wonderful part of my day!! Thanks Again!!!!
B005OK721G|2.0|First off, I want to congratulate Hollywood for having the balls to breach outside their comfortable norm of casting only \\"white men\\" in action films. The simple fact that Zoe Saldana is a Black Latina was refreshing for me(because i am too)but i would have been able to find it just as relatable if i were just a woman or african american. However when Hollywood dumps people of color of any sex,they often get the leftover scripts and no matter how good the actor is THEY ALWAYS ACT ONE DIMENSIONAL with these types of scripts.<br /><br />Hollywood hasnt learned that you cant just make a character with no weaknesses. Catalaya even as a child watching her parents die, had no character flaws. While she was motivated by revenge, i would have liked to see emotion that an actual little girl had to witnessing her parents in pools of blood. And Colombians dont play that! They wouldn't have even left any survivors. This isnt the US where everyone gets a fair trial. You may hate the truth,but crime is more lenient in Colombia.<br /><br />The love interest altogether could have been completely written out! Wasnt sure why sexuality even mattered to the plot if only to further the stereotype that black women are only there for sex. But that's another conversation.<br /><br />The Spanish used was minimal and campy,for Colombians they spoke alot of freaking English. Most people born or living in Colombia dont speak that much english because they dont have to,it's Colombia.<br /><br />I love Zoe Saldana. I love that she has become a marketable actress. But she is too thin to come off as convincing as an action star. Avatar was different, as she was playing a 7 foot blue alien. In real life,the guns she used were often bigger than her. And with no known martial arts training she was able to overpower men with a few punches,never showcasing even that she just looked for weaknesses(Like Temperance Breenan from Bones).Im all about Girl Power, but give reasonable explanations for how an 100 lb girl can overpower 200 lb trained killers.<br /><br />I give this a 2 but I felt it was very generous. It is entertaining,but the angling of the camera made me assume so much of the action sequences took too many takes.<br /><br />I hate to say it,but no one does Girl Power in films as well as the East.0 lb girl can overpower 200 lb trained killers.<br /><br />I give this a 2 but I felt it was very generous.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|Having amazon prime lets me see the program in order. I really enjoy seeing fringe but even more so on my time and in order
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like John Grisham's work and this did not disappoint me.  It kept my interest and I couldn't put it down.
