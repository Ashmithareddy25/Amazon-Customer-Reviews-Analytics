068987474X|2.0|If I had followed the advice in this book I would have given up on my husband I wouldn't be happily married with four children. Nicely written but I find it to be a narrow-minded, somewhat chauvenistic view. Many of my closest friends got their man by NOT GIVING UP! Sometimes a good man doesn't know what he's missing until the woman in his life walks away but it doesn't mean she has to walk away without knowing exactly what it is that she is doing! I guarantee you turn around and walk away and the man, whoever he is, will most likely follow.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|This album is classic Alan Parsons. Turn down the lights, turn up the stereo, and forget everything else. \\"Return To Tunguska\\" reflects the classic AP style, reminiscent of \\"I Robot\\" (from the \\"Project\\" days), and \\"Apollo\\" (more recently). \\"More Lost Without You\\" is classic rock, AP style. Give this song a listen through headphones, very layered, and some interesting sound effects.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Alan Parsons' music, and it is very exciting to have another classic. \\"A Valid Path\\" gets five stars.
B00005JNH0|4.0|This movie was a unique look at a band twenty years later.  Many Metallica fans, and former Metallica fans, complain that since (insert album name here, but generally Load, Black or Justice) Metallica has gone downhill, or that they just plain suck.  Many fans simply have been unable to adapt to the change of their musical style as time passed.  Would Metallica still be as good today as they were in 1984 if they cranked out the same material they did on Kill 'em All? <br /> <br />Some Kind of Monster displays the diffulties of a band whose members aren't eighteen years old and angry anymore.  They may simply be forty and angry now, but the issues and motivations that fuel their music have changed.  It becomes obvious that despite what many will say, that Metallica still cares about the music they put out, and that the band isn't solely about the next paycheck.  Perhaps this film was an excess, a delusion of inflated self importance, but no more so than similar or more fanciful films put out by everyone from the Beatles to Led Zeppelin.  In many ways this one is more daring.  It takes some serious guts to be willing to put your dysfunction on display, especially when you're a world recognized band like Metallica is.    James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich tend to dominate the film, but much of that comes from the fact that Kirk Hammett simply doesn't share the same Alpha Male persona they do (and likely how he's been able to put up with them for so long). <br /> <br />While a lot of this film is engaging, some parts seem drawn out.  I think it would have heavily benefitted from a little more editing (about twenty minutes worth I think).  There is a lot of material here that simply feels excessive and unneeded.  However, certain scenes, notably the confrontation of drummer Lars Ulrich and former guitarist turned Megadeth frontman Dave Mustain are worth the viewing.   <br /> <br />If you're a musician, or a fan of Metallica, this will be worth your time assuming you're not too cynical.
0812548094|3.0|I have read fantasy with descriptive acts of torture before but I don't think this descriptive.  As much as I wanted to enjoy the book and pay attention to it I couldn't get past the torture parts  <br /> <br />These included(but were not limited too) <br /> <br />Torture  <br />Gang Rapes  <br />Beheadings  <br />Skinning people alive but not before the people had their tongues ripped out usually with bare hands or a dull knife  <br /> <br />I normally wouldn't mind but most of the time this stuff is carried out with a sort of glee that I would expect from someone who was into bondage or S&M <br /> <br />Another problem I had aside from the torture was that as with most pieces of epic fantasy I could skip whole pages and the plot had not advanced at all.  This is not an isolated incident a lot of fantasy authors have this problem.   <br /> <br />Overall-When the plot finally rolled around it was a good plot it managed to suck me in and keep my attention.  I am not saying that the book was bad.  I will probably read other books in this series but not before I have a nice stiff drink to keep me loose.   <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|'From a Basement on the Hill' is sometimes brilliant, sometimes spectacular, often beautiful. But, many of the songs are sad, and his anger and depression are heavily evident. Most of his past music is infectious and this is no different, but that overwhelming sadness never leaves. Considering Elliott's history I am still recommending this cd for those of us who appreciate his talent and wish we could have done something to help him.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I really wanted to see this film in all its glory, very famous & unfortunate time in history when Pearl Harbour was attacked by the Japanese navy which subsiquently bought the U.S fully into WW.II. This Film had so much potential but in my humble opinion failed to deliver, effects were outstanding location and visuals really good, the rest i found really hard to bare, tacky lines in the film which made me cringe and some scenes made this film more like a goverment recruitment film, the love story was tacky, not very believable thus predictable. I think Kelly's Heroes or Tora,Tora,Tora, Battle of the bulge would be better viewing and they were made a while back and stand up better.
B000002J09|3.0|This album is very highly regarded by the Zepp-heads as one of thier best.  I feel thier senior release is quite sophmoric.  Except for the highly air-played 'Stairway' song, this album really doesn't break any musical ground.  The obvious pursed lip playing of Page and the shrill and whiney Plant contributions are already old after three albums.  However the thundering rhythm section of Bonham and Jones is eerily reminscent of Tyszkiewicz and Getz from Pocket Xplosion's first album 'noise'.  The recordings are well done and they captured all the annoying nuances of Robert Plant's ego on this album.  You can almost hear the not so signifigant bulge in his pants.  A must have for anyone who needs an expensive coaster and an extra jewel case for an R.E.M cd.
068987474X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and it did give me some insights into some of the men I've dated. I just got engaged a week after I finished it, so thankfully I won't get a chance to put the things I learned to much use. All in all I recommend it for all single women out there.
B00069L0XG|5.0|they will be releasing RE2 by itself as well with different cover art of the girl alice holding two swords or knifes whichever. should be great i know im getting my copy
B000002J1U|4.0|This is album is sublime.  Other than Immigrant Song, it features absolutely no hits whatsoever, so if you heard Heartbreaker or Rock & Roll on the radio, this isn't what you're after.  Try #4/Zoso or #2.  They have all the hits.   <br /> <br />About the album though: it's wonderful, like I said before, but besides Immigrant Song, it doesn't have anything close to resembling a single.  For instance, Tangerine is considered by everyone (myself included) to be a classic, but if I put the cd on and go straight to this track, I can't even sit through the first two minutes.  It only works if you heard Gallows Pole before it, and OOTT before that, etc. <br /> <br />Still, you gotta love it.  This album is very much worthy of your time and money.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I love this movie. It is one of those special movies that if you catch it on TV you have to watch it to completion. It is one of the best movies of all time. I think that all of the reviews for this movie missed the mark. The shawshank redemption is not about andy, it is a movie about red. How can you be redemed for somthing that you did not do. Andy was innocent, red was not. the story was told through red's eyes. He was the one who's soul was redemed. It was a movie about rehabilitation. It was not about a corrupt prision system, although the one in the movie was screwed up, it was not a movie about how the human spirit could overcome, although this movie did that. It was a movie about how red had come to the relaization of what his actions had on his life and the life of others. For that reason this is a great movie. Every one should own this or have TBS so they can watch it whenever they want.
0385659806|4.0|This book was a wonderful surprise. I was not sure of what to expect and was delighted.<br />The story is presented in a very interesting narrative.  The fun and simple flow of the book made it addictive to read!
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah has done what seemed impossible. She brought music that some would describe as serene into the mainstream.  Her style is traditional and her voice is solid. Kudos to her manager and producer for having the courage to push such a powerful (yet deceptively low key) talent into the upper ranks of modern musicians.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Not as good as their previous Significant Other. The best cuts are Full Nelson, \\"Rollin', and Boiler that makes the Cd worth buying. Still compared to the other groups out there, Limp at its worse is better than most bands at their best
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Thanks to the ingenius idea of pre-selling each of their last two albums before even beginning to record, Marillion were able to afford the production of Dave Meeghan, who clearly has perfect empathy with the band and greatly assists them in bringing forth their best material (as a good producer should).  This has lifted the level of Marillion's music, which had become uneven in the late 90s, during which time they were self-producing their albums.  On 2001's Anoraknophobia (fantastic, btw!) and now on 2004's Marbles, there are no clunkers, no goofy songs that should've been b-sides, and no tracks that show promise but don't quite work.  Instead, every song is a winner. <br />     I own the 2-CD version, but I have sequenced the single disc version on my iPod and think it makes for a great album.  As other reviewers have stated, songs like the UK Top 10 \\"You're Gone\\" and \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" will be immediately appealing to just about anyone, while the epic tracks that bookend the album are more rewarding on repeated listens - the desperate, building intensity of \\"The Invisible Man\\" will haunt you, while the beautiful and spaced-out \\"Neverland\\" is one of the all-time great Marillion numbers.  \\"Drilling Holes\\" is a strange and wonderful song with a great rock groove and a psychedelic baroque-pop break, \\"Angelina\\" is a slow and quietly sexy song, and \\"Marbles\\" I-IV are all cool little bridging songs that are actually quite catchy and tell a story, milking the obvious link between actual marbles and going insane by losing one's marbles.  \\"Fantastic Places,\\" while a pretty good song, would be one that I would have left off for the rockin' out \\"The Damage,\\" but that's a small quibble.  If you want ALL of the great Marbles material, get the doulbe-disc version! <br />     If 1/2-stars could be awarded, I would probably have gievn this album a 4.5, btw.  It's not perfect, but it is excellent, and I would recommend it to most anyone.  Also, if you ever have the changeto see them live, you will be amazed.  They leave it all out there on the stage - their hearts, their sweat, every note of their glorious music.  Marillion is back!  Long live Marillion!
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you really want to open your eyes, make sure you also watch FahrenHYPE 911 too, hear what the exploited vet from Michaels film has to say about his unauthorized use of his image and situation, hear what the police have to say about Moore and how he twists words.. Those who blindly follow Moore need to be prayed for.
B0000214F0|1.0|No contest, this is the worst film I have ever seen, an abomination with absolutely no redeeming features. With horrendous editing, an inept, awkward and inane script by the very overrated Gore Vidal, and amateurish performances by all, this one is only for laughs, and would have been a terrific entry for a porno Mystery Science Theater episode.<br />It has little relevance to the history of the time, which I was hoping to see, and is a nightmare of gaudy plastic and plaster sets, and when clothed, garish costuming.<br /><br />It's astounding that actors like John Gielgud would sully their careers with a trashy project like this; Peter O'Toole looks like a decomposing corpse as Tiberius Caesar, as he frolics in a pool with his naked \\"fishies\\", and Malcolm McDowell is perhaps the worst of all. His Caligula is played like an evil drag queen (this is one of those films where nasty and nelly are equated) and since he is on screen for a large portion of the film, it gets really tiresome.<br />As for eroticism, it is lifeless and pathetic...titillating perhaps for the Bob Guccione (who produced this rotting garbage) types of the world.<br />Since my only option is to give it 1 star, it goes to the fleeting moments when excerpts of Prokofiev's \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and Khatchaturian's \\"Spartacus\\" are played in an otherwise unmemorable soundtrack.<br />Imagine a really bad low budget porno flick, in which people with no taste or talent have thrown millions of dollars at to make it into a Big Epic Production. That is \\"Caligula\\".
B000002WPI|5.0|I've had this record for 11 years and I love it more every time I hear it.
0340881542|5.0|After Cherub: the recruit came out i thought it looked good and i went and bought it. Little did i know that i would have finished it within six hours, as it was the best book i've ever read, until its sequel came out Cherub: class A. Cherub: class A is about a cocaine dealer named Kieth Moore who receives cocaine from South America, and then sells it throughout England, using tennagers as the delivery boys. James Adams, who is a CHERUB agent (children used as spies by British Intelligence) is sent to Luton where Kieth Moore lives along with his friends Kerry Chang, Kyle Blueman and Nicole Eddison. He makes friends with Junior Moore, Kieth's son, and Kerry makes friends with Dinesh, an Indian boy whose dad works with Kieth. Lauren, James' sister comes to Luton for a few days on her birthday and in the process helps James and Kerry infiltrate a factory where all the cocaine was being developed. This led to many arrests, and Kieth went to Miami with his son, who invited James to come along. There a South American group called Lambayeke attacked Kieth, Junior and James, and Junior and Keith were both arrested with gun wounds, james was taken to the Miami home of John Jones, an MI5 agent.<br />The ideas of Robert Muchamore are fabulous, and if you have read the Recruit, read this, if you haven't read the recruit read them both!
0517223546|5.0|Yes its almost 2000 pages, but at least 1500 is good material. If you want indepth detail of the book look at the top 5 reviews.  But I a simple american girl who never really enjoyed history.  I simply bought this bok from a store book shelf because of its size, and I enjoyed it. It was full of rich characters and scenery.
0385335482|5.0|I have never been in debt, but after reading Confessions of a Shopaholic by Sophie Kinsella, I feel like I've gone through it all. The main character Rebecca (a.k.a. Becky) Bloomwood lives in England. She is a thirty-year old financial journalist who is in debt. After disregarding warnings from the bank Becky goes shopping to cheer herself up. Becky is a bit of a ditz.<br /><br />The style of this book will make you never want to put it down. The narrator's voice is rambunctious and hilarious. Her use of words are different with a British twist. \\"What do you need twenty quid for?\\" says Luke Brandon. Becky responds,  \\"I...my aunt, She's in the hospital and I wanted to get her a present.\\" The real reason Becky needs twenty dollars is she wants to buy a scarf for herself, but she doesn't have enough money for it.<br /><br />Becky's hilarious charm and huge shopping sprees are the reasons why I loved this book. She tells other people how to manage their money, while she herself is actually broke. Becky goes shopping before, after, and during work. She buys expensive clothes, shoes, scarves, and make-up. After reading a self-help book on how to save money, Becky decides she needs to cut down her spending. She brings her own coffee to work and makes her own sandwiches for lunch instead of going to her favorite little cafes. When Becky finds this too challenging she decides to get another job for the weekends, and what better place than her favorite store, but on her first day Becky starts trouble and gets herself fired! Becky's ways of getting herself out of trouble will make you laugh-out-loud.<br /><br />Becky is not the only hilarious character in this book. Luke, the owner of Brandon Communications, is stern and is very serious about his work. There is also Suze, Becky's flat mate, and best friend. Suze tries to help Becky out when she is in debt. They buy a kit to make frames and sell them for some extra money. After messing up on every frame, Becky gives up but Suzeactually makes a career out of it. Another character is Tarquin, Suze's cousin. Tarquin is a millionaire and has a crush on Becky. Becky goes on a date with him but he is not her type.<br /><br />Later when Becky writes an article about her parent's neighbors being cheated from their bank, she is asked on a TV show to talk about financial business. The show wants to hire her full time to give advice to viewers. She tells them how to manage and save their money. This is very ironic.<br /><br /> I would have to give this book an A+. Confessions of a Shopaholic is the best book I have ever read! Read this book to find out what other crazy things Becky does in her relationships, work, and her financial problems. Also look for Shopaholic Takes Manhattan and Shopaholic Ties the Knot, the sequels to Confessions of a Shopaholic.
0440238609|5.0|I would have loved these books as a child.  I think I would have appreciated them by 8 or 9, but all I ever did was read.  A lot has been made of the fact that the author is an athiest.  In my opinion, the series isn't any more \\"anti-god\\" than the Harry Potter series - it's just far less subtle about it.  It's refreshing that the central character is a girl because so much fiction for young people centers around male characters (historically).  I would recommend these books to any parents who aren't afraid to let their children think for themselves.  Let them read the bible, some C.S. Lewis and some Focus on the Family crap and then let them read this series and decide for themselves what they believe.
B0000844IT|5.0|This is by far the best movie ever made.  If you're reading this you already know that!!!  YEAH BABY!! <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|You should watch this film with your eyes open. Mr. Moore has a political bias and clear dislike for the war in Iraq and the Bush Administration; Couple that with fact that there are 56 documented untruths and I think you would be hard pressed to call this a documentary. However, Mr. Moore does show us a few things. <br /> <br />One we live in a great country that protects his right to promote his political agenda. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 please watch the counterpoint, Fahrenhype 9/11 to see both views. <br /> <br />Two, war is always horrible in the toll it takes on soldiers and civilians, and should never be entered into lightly. However, after one Gulf War, many resolutions, and a final call to disarm over a 12 year period, one can hardly say the president made a rush decision; whether you agree with the policy or not. <br /> <br />Last, the military is a great way to learn a trade, see the world, and pay for college; that is why Mrs. Lipscomb still promotes it. I should add that West Point and The Naval Academy are some of the hardest colleges to get into and are not attended by only those in the lowest socioeconomic bracket. Many people from all walks of life are drawn to the excitement, the challenge, and the desire to serve thier country. Each and every one of those who enlist know full well that it is potentailly dangerous. That is why you get a rifle in boot and not a tutu. <br /> <br />Honestly, in these highly charged times you owe it to yourself to listen to both sides and make an informed choice. So if you watch Fahrenheit 9/11 take the time to watch Fahrenhype 9/11.
B000001F7R|4.0|I have bought the album just yesterday. I bought it for three songs which I have heard regularly and loved. They are 'Hello America', 'Satallite' and 'Rocks off'.  <br /> <br />These are about the best hard rockers the band has ever done. Hard riff based songs with Steve Clark dominating the proceedings. The vocals are edgier. There is no compromise to make the songs more melodious by making them rythemic (eg the rockers on Hysteria).  <br /> <br />This album will remind you of strong riff based bands. If you like UFO, Deep Purple with Blackmore go for this one its the best rocker by the band. <br /> <br />Am giving it 4 stars as am yet have a clear oppinion on the rest of the songs on the album.
1591840562|5.0|This book is really a 'must read' for anyone looking to strengthen their marketing skills.
0131177052|5.0|The average book on Agile software development describes a fairyland of greenfield projects, with wall-to-wall tests that run after every few edits, and clean & simple source code. <br /> <br />The average software project, in our industry, was written under some aspect of code-and-fix, and without automated unit tests. And we can't just throw this code away; it represents a significant effort debugging and maintaining. It contains many latent requirements decisions. Just as Agile processes are incremental, Agile adoption must be incremental too. No more throwing away code just because it looked at us funny. <br /> <br />Mike begins his book with a very diplomatic definition of \\"Legacy\\". I'l skip ahead to the undiplomatic version: Legacy code is code without unit tests.  <br /> <br />Before cleaning that code up, and before adding new features and removing bugs, such code must be de-legacified. It needs unit tests. <br /> <br />To add unit tests, you must change the code. To change the code, you need unit tests to show how safe your change was. <br /> <br />The core of the book is a cookbook of recipes to conduct various careful attacks. Each presents a particular problem, and a relatively safe way to migrate the code towards tests. <br /> <br />Code undergoing this migration will begin to experience the benefits of unit tests, and these benefits will incrementally make new tests easier to write. These efforts will make aspects of a legacy codebase easy to change. <br /> <br />It's an unfortunate commentary on the state of our programming industry how much we need this book. <br />
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This is the movie that started it all.  It's an exquisite masterpiece topped only by the second and third movies of the trilogy.  Sam Raimi redefined horror forever with this flick, and Bruce Campbell is so the man!
B00005JMXX|3.0|With all the hype to this movie you expect this film to be one of the biggest ever made it is only in one way the special effects. The global warming effects are some of the best special effect scenes ever filmed e.g New York City completely flooding but the script is badly written the script is only saved by its actors Dennis Quaid (frequency) and Jake Gyllenhall (Donnie Darko) it is also saved by the action sequences which are throughout the whole film from the first few minutes of the film to the last, but the story is cheesy. <br />Now my reviews are not really well reviewed most of the time with most ppl saying this does not help them so if you need more help these website may help you... <br />[...]    this is the biggest movie site on the web <br /> <br />don't expect to much from this movie <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Be afriad, be very very afriad. Come November 2nd my vote will count. I'm 21 years old and like most of my demographic I've seen this movie and I'm sure as hell not voting Republican.  <br /> <br />I did a lot of growing up during the Clinton years, I can look back and without question say those were good times(minus the Lewinsky blather on tv). Toward the end I had a job, was paying my own way through college etc. etc. In the past four years I lost my job, had to drop out of school. I'm still not making enough to go back ot school, tuition rose and teachers got cut. I think my point is I haven't seen a single positive deed or result of this presidency.  <br /> <br />Fahrenhiet 9/11 hits hard emotionally. If you didn't cry(or at least get welled up with tears) or choke on a knot in your throat, you're a cold-hearted bastard. At the same time there's some wry humorous moments laced within the serious push of the film. Because it's real(and no, not 'reality tv' real) it's happening.  <br /> <br />And hey Moore hired a gag of lawyers and non-partisan fact checkers for every sentence of his narrative. EVERY fact in this movie is true, yes his opinions are there too. If you can't disseminate between FACT and OPINION within the confines of a 2 hour documentary... He's got a reader that goes along with the movie, not to mention his website has a rundown explanation, description and backing articles to his claims. The facts are the truth, the same way 'Bowling For Columbine' was.  <br /> <br />If you see any \\"glaring lies\\" in this movie, let me know. Check out the facts for yourself.  <br /> <br />Micheal Moore has always been a master of persuasive arguement. Fahrenhiet 9/11 pushed his talent to a whole new level. The United States and maybe even the world is better for it.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|So much has been said by all the others who have contributed to this review I would just like to add that all things considered I think that maybe Howard Shore has created the finest movie score of all time, and that takes some doing!
B0000067L2|5.0|The tone that Clapton used here, very 'woop-woop' with the treble turned down, (ironically, the exact opposite of the trebly-toned Albert King, although much of Clapton's work here uses King's riffs), became the currency of the day among every rock lead guitarist under 25. In fact, it is my -least- favorite Clapton tone, as it washes out all of the high-end string noises that lend to expression,(it's 'easy' on mistakes, which explains why every amateur had this tone within days of the original release.) Nonetheless,  the songwriting and playing harkens back to a time when everything wasn't done with sales numbers in mind,  poetry and improvisation making it to the top 40.

B000002SE0|5.0|If a serious opera fan were to aim at understanding what Turandot was all about, then he should turn to this studio recording showcasing the gargantuan voices of the late Italian tenor and the Wagnerian legend Birgit Nilsson in the leading roles.  Undeniable powerhouses such as these would never disappoint when it comes to rendering a scene from this beautiful Puccinian swan song of an opera.  From Maestro Corelli's first note (Padre! Mio Padre!) to his last, every moment where his voice is captured will amaze, stun, and even evoke feelings of awe for such a magical voice.  As Herbert von Karajan said, \\"his was a voice of thunder and lightning, of fire and blood\\", so we would agree when we listen to the vocal dynamics executed by this amazing tenor.  Surprisingly, he also has the ability to sympathize with the role, something quite uncommon with the singing of so many overrated tenors today.  His was a Calaf of stubborness, of passion.  No other Calaf before him or after could ever give such an excellent insight into the character as Corelli did, and for this reason it is a MUST that you make this album a part of your collection.  Pavrotti wouldn't even come close to the interpretive high notes that Corelli could bellow out and EXPRESS well too.  And what of Birgit Nilsson?  She was an excellent Turandot vocally, with all the tricks needed to make Turandot appear icy.  Although she doesn't have Maria Callas' ability to color every word and phrase with a whirlwind of emotions, her vocal fache and her timbre were exactly what this role needed.  Stunning high notes, great vocal acrobatics, and really, she is so much better than Joan Sutherland who turns Turandot into a phaser trill coloratura feat.  Renata Scotto may not be a Caballe Liu, but she is heartfelt and touching as well.  And, at this  price, who wouldn't buy such an amazing record?  Might I add that the live versions with Corelli and Nilsson at La Scala are also stunning and even more amazing?  If you want exciting and bloody long high notes, go to the live ones.
0312995423|1.0|Do not read this book. <br /> <br />If you read this book, and you know anything about crypto (or computers in general) it will irritate you to no end.  If you read this book and you know nothing about crypto (or anything at all about computers) then you will be tempted to use the \\"knowledge\\" gained at social functions and your computer savvy friends will laugh at you. <br /> <br />Dan Brown is a hack.  Someone recommended this book to me because \\"it's about computers and it's so real!\\"  I can't think of a suitable punishment to inflict on this person. <br /> <br />Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />The characters are unbelievable (\\"brilliant\\" cryptographers can do simple anagrams.  \\"Brilliant\\" people don't ignore obvious signs of treachery,) the technology is wrong, every last bit of it -- it was the literary equivalent of \\"movie OS\\" and if I were to go into it in detail this review would run several pages.  An example:  \\"terminals\\" do not have local storage.  Workstations do, but Dan Brown repeatedly used the term \\"terminal\\" to describe the stations in Node 3.  If they were terminals, then Susan could have done all the snooping she needed to do from anywhere that had a network connection to node 3.  Hell, even if they WERE workstations she could have done it from anywhere.  She could have done it from Strathmores office and not had to fight her way past the doors that wouldn't open.  I'm not going to go into the doors that wouldn't open.  Dan Brown's imaginary world is filled with stupid engineers.  Another example:  there is a difference between a file that contains data and an executable file.  And while you *can* cause a buffer overflow by feeding a specially crafted data file into a vulnerable program it's HIGHLY unlikely that the NSA would have that sort of vulnerability in its MOST SUPER SECURE COMPUTER EVER.  But Dan Brown didn't even try to explain it like that.  He simply confused a data file with an executable.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the central point of his book. <br /> <br />Something else that pissed me off:  he spent a chapter explaining how the most brilliant people in the world didn't know that the NSA existed.  Hey Dan:  the \\"No Such Agency\\" jokes were NEVER funny.  Everyone knows about the NSA, and trying to say that people who live in or near DC don't know about the NSA is equivalent to saying your readers are dumb.  I don't like being called dumb. <br /> <br />I can't stress this enough:  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.  Sadly, Dan Brown seems to have somehow become a best selling author, and best selling authors get movies made of their books.  This frightens me. <br /> <br />Every last bit of this book was predictable.  Predictable, on it's own, isn't so bad really.  If an author can make the bits between plot points interesting, you don't mind so much that you could see the plot points from way off.  However, when the author is lazy and doesn't care about getting his supporting facts straight -- well, that just pisses me off.  This is what Dan Brown does.  He's a lazy, good for nothing hack whose idea of \\"research\\" is, apparently, to watch bad movies.  (He even says so in the book.  There's a line that goes something like \\"Like a cheap movie, the lights went out when she heard the scream....\\"  Yeah.  I'm serious.  DON'T READ THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />You know when you're watching a B horror flick and there's a killer chasing a girl, and the girl runs upstairs instead of running to a neighbors house?  Dan Brown writes like that.  I found myself trying to will the characters to STOP BEING STUPID! <br /> <br />DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. <br /> <br />Don't say I didn't warn you.
B0000024K1|5.0|This simply a classic of Public Enemy.  The best album they have made.  This CD has hit after hit.  I have always loved P.E.  Chuck D. has the illest flow in the political aspect.  He has let the world know of the crooked system of the world.  This is the most poetic of their music.  This album is a MUST HAVE!!
B000002MNL|5.0|This is the album that has come to define Morrissey in a lot of ways. It is extremely well pollished and it is very pleasant to listen to - it also has many fine examples of Morrissey's lyrical genius and wit.<br /><br />I am maybe one of the few who like 'You are the Quarry' every bit as much as this one - although there is not one song so poignant as 'the more you ignore me' on any Morrissey album.
6305841861|5.0|This movie is basically a rehash of Evil Dead 1 with more frights and more humor.  It's bloodier than 1 (somehow) but not as funny as Army of Darkness.  A lot of people feel it's the best in the trilogy, but I think that title belongs to Army of Darkness because it's just such a sweet movie!  I've loved this movie for years, and you all should too!!!
B000002LOE|5.0|Adhering to the still-true adage that the very best records perfectly capture a time and feeling, and can still recreate that place and moment upon each listening, \\"Out Of Time\\" succeeds as another of those REM records that returns you to the best of an era. The idea of music sounding \\"dated\\" is ridiculous to me. Music is the soundtrack to your life, and should never be so generic as to simply to fit in to any decade, year or trend. \\"Out of Time\\" stands as the testament to the public in general of what the fans had known since before \\"Chronic Town\\"; that REM was, and is, America's best band.
B0000024IE|5.0|Another addition to your Public Enemy collection is this album.  Like \\"It Takes a Nation......\\", this album makes a statement that is easily missed if you are listening and not HEARING the music.  The beats are unforgettable.  Sirens, whistles, and bells makes the music of Public Enemy different that the rest.  Chuck D. has not lost it.  Flavor Flav is still the joker that gets the listeners and crowds hyped.  This album is another one that is a must have.
B00001OH7P|5.0|There is nothing to compare with Ziggy in popular music. This is truly David Bowie's masterpiece and one that he will never duplicate (no matter how many albums he releases). Bowie was a genius in how he embraced this character - it was the character afterall who made Bowie famous (not Bowie himself - who had already initiated a solo career by that time). David was maybe more able summon all of his talents when working through this medium - a truly sublime example of how to overcome ego.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|I laughed myself silly for 90 minutes in this movie, which is by far the most absurd thing I've ever seen.  There's no plot, there's little direction, and there's little actual story taking place.  Despite those things, this movie was one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen in a while.  I think it's great because it's a comedy out of the sheer lunacy of every character in the movie, not because of ridiculous gags that American cinema has overused to death lately. <br /> <br />I recommend this movie for everyone,  especially if you're drunk.  Really really really drunk.  When I buy this movie, I'm going to get drunk and laugh for hours!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've loved Green Day from Day 1.  Dookie is and always will be my favorite, but this album is a close second.  These guys still have it!  Right album, right place, right time.
B000268QB2|2.0|I love Coldplay (and lots of British pop) with a passion - and followed friends' advice to check out this album.  However, I was disappointed with it.  Not one song really stuck out or spoke to me, and the lead singer's voice doesn't hold a candle to the warm, clear, rousing quality of Chris Martin's voice.  The album has some nice melodies and moments, but *yawn* I think I'll eventually give this CD away to someone else.
B0002BO0AS|4.0|With Inflames, Killswitch, Shadows Fall, The Haunted, Lamb Of God, and Cradle Of filth all releasing new stuff this year it was gonna be tough to make your amrk, but this album slays most of the Competition. Black Hearts Now Reign, Zombie Autopilot, BLood Lust of the Human Condition , Endless, and Predetermined sky are the best tracks but all are grea examples of some of the best metal and hardcore mixing this side of STORMTROOPERS OF DEATH.
B0002KVUL6|5.0|I'm not going to bore you with many details about this, but I think it was an awesome idea to make this package.  After re-issuing the DVDs of the original movies that \\"inspired\\" Van Helsing, it's nice to see them packaged together so the influence is easily available to the true fan.  Great package and a great idea!
9871106181|3.0|Perez-Reverte is an extremely well known writer, and I must admit this is the first of his books I pick up....rather dissapointing. <br /> <br />The story deals with a mystery, based on an ancient book,  which is developed in the world of antique booksellers and bibliophiles. The plot is very interesting and well conceived, but in my opinion, the characters lack depth.   <br /> <br />For a mystery, the book does not grasp and involve you, it's simply too easy to put it down and do something else instead. <br /> <br />Not worth the time to get through the almost 500 pages.....
B000002UA2|5.0|I really love this album.  The feel is closer to Dark Side than any other album I can think of, but Obscured still has its own unique place.  The songs have a dreamy quality, mixing the utter relaxation of Dark Side with some of the innocence of Atom Heart Mother.  Burning Bridges/Mudmen is one of the best of Floyd's songs, but the whole album is good...  Floyd was starting to grow out of the indulgent meandering of their earlier albums, which keeps the album relatively tight, despite the short time spent recording it.  Obscured and Dark Side really capture Floyd at the stage where they're developing more focus in their songs but before they became dominated by Waters and his dark music and lyrics.
B00005JNEI|3.0|First of all, everyone should already know about everything in this movie.  In a sense this movie should never of been made.  However, the only way that any of us would of know of this already is if we read foreign media, something like foreign affairs, or checked out any left leaning website.  \\"Moderate\\" news organizations would probably never make many of these facts or different points of view because most of these news organizations would rather bush be in power.  They have the potential to make millions more a year if the entire industry is deregulated.  I thought that Fahrenheit did not go far enough.  I thought the emphasis on just the war and fear mongering ignored bush's relentless neo liberal/conservative  world views.  The movie did not touch much on the administrations arrogance, unending policy mistakes (it preferred to make fun of bush's problems with the english language)  ignoring nuclear weapons, Bush's connection with the BCCI, one of the original and most corrupt financers of terrorism the world has ever known (which John kerry coincidentally was instrumental in eliminating), Bush's tax cuts at the expense of national security, bush and friends 21 different reasons for going to war, (as outlined in the recent foreign policy).  I thought the film should of been more angry.   And yet people still support bush....and bash Fahrenheit 911, saying its all lies, but have NO examples.  Do you people think that pre emptive war on countries with no ties to anything aggresive against our country is sustainable? Do you people actually think even our country can survive worldwide animosity?  Before the Iraq war the french actually liked us, many countries actually liked us.  You poll the populace and the number one reason for their new found dislike or hatred is Bush.  The reasons for Al kaidas problems with us do not hinge on the idiotic rhetoric of bush's administration, that they hate our freedom. They hate us meddling in their affairs and more appropriately bin Laden hated/hates secular governments like Saddam's.  That said, everyone go see this movie.  If you don't want to buy it, find somebody that owns it and watch it and then you may actually have a relevant opinion.  But do not stop there.  This movie only touches the surface of the worst president our country has ever known.
B0000025T6|5.0|\\"I guess there's just a meanness in this world\\": The last line of the opening (and title) track of Bruce Springsteen's phenomenal Nebraska is a direct quote from Charlie Starkweather, one of the United States' first recognized mass murderers who in the 1950's left a trail of blood across the Midwest with his girlfriend, Carol Ann Fugate (the case was the inspiration for Terence Malick's film Badlands as well as Sprinsgsteen's song).  It is chilling in its plain-spoken, matter-of-fact, even flippant \\"confession\\" of murder: \\"at least for a little while / me and her, we had us some fun.\\"  Yet it is also a song of tremendous beauty (as allied with the sublime).  The plaintive wailings of the harmonica that open the song weave in and out amongst the simple poetry of the song's verses while underneath it all lies the sedate and soporific acoustic guitar that anchors the song musically.  The song could be a lullaby.  <br /> <br /> Charlie Starkweather is, in fact, the perfect associate of the entire album, for \\"stark\\" it is indeed - the harmonica and the guitar, together with Springsteen's voice, are the only instruments to be found; and Starkweather has become in the cultural mythos an underground anti-hero - a modern-day Romantic figure of rebellion (much as another Charlie became after the summer of 1969).  Much of Sprinsgteen's 1982 solo acoustic album is about precisely the \\"meanness\\" that the narrator of \\"Nebraska\\" claims for the world.  It is American Gothic, peopled with criminals and sinners of all stripes, and its ten tracks plumb the depths of despair, desperation, and dejection.  Though the locales of the songs are not limited to the expanse west of the Mississippi, the vast plains, badlands, barrens, and wasteland that are to be found there are present in every word and chord, even if only as a spiritual metaphor.  Each song is a miniature portrait of pain. <br /> <br /> \\"Nebraska\\" is followed by the powerful \\"Atlantic City\\" - the only track from the album tomake the cut for Springsteen's 1995 Greatest Hits.  The song is reminiscent of Born to Run's \\"Meeting Across the River\\" (1975), telling a \\"story\\" of a well-meaning but down-on-his luck loser, debt-ridden and unemployed, who, against a backdrop of Mob warfare, is planning a last-ditch effort to escape to a better life with his woman.  There is an overwhelming sense of failure - past, present, and future - in every line, a sense compounded by the refrain, which begins, \\"Everything dies, baby - that's a fact.\\"  But the first dim note of hope - a sad and desperate possibility - is also struck here, as the line continues, \\"But maybe everything that dies someday comes back.\\"  That \\"maybe\\" is as good as it gets here. <br />  <br /> \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" is a relatively low-key respite from the violent - both literally and figuratively - fears and desires of the first two songs; but the tone is overwhelmingly maudlin.  But it also marks a return to the lullaby-like cadence and instrumentation of the first track.  The narrator of this song seems to have crossed over from the world of 1978's Darkness on the Edge of Town - an album that prefigures the more vengeful darkness of Nebraska.  The bittersweet sentimentality of the song - a wistful reflection on the disparity between the security of realized dreams on the one hand and the need for those dreams in an otherwise luckless life on the other.  The song also introduces the nostalgic reminiscing that is to be found later on the album in songs such as \\"Used Cars.\\"  But there is a darker side even to the titular symbol of the \\"American dream\\": one remembers that in the Hank Williams song of the same name (apparently an inspiration for what some understand to be Springsteen's re-working thereof), the \\"mansion on the hill\\" is a \\"loveless\\" retreat rather than the representative of fulfillment; and the awe felt by the narrator calls to mind that of the townspeople in Robinson's poem \\"Richard Cory,\\" which ends with the disclosure of the privileged title figure's suicide. <br /> <br /> \\"Johnny 99\\" swings the pendulum back, both musically and emotionally, and the protagonist complements the narrator-protagonist of \\"Nebraska\\" well.  The narrator-protagonist of \\"Nebraska\\" is essentially a thrill-killer; the protagonist of \\"Johnny 99\\" kills out of desperation.  And where the Starkweather-figure of the title track is nonplussed by the prospect of his death (\\"Sheriff, when the man pulls that switch, sir / And snaps my poor head back / You make sure my pretty baby / Is sitting right there on my lap\\"), Ralph (a.k.a. \\"Johnny (99)\\") actively seeks it: \\"Your Honor, I do believe I'd be better off dead ... Let them shave off my hair and put me on that execution line.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Highway Patrolman,\\" covered by Johnny Cash, and the inspiration for Sean Penn's directorial debut, The Indian Runner, offers a new perspective through a narrative voice that is not, while first-person, that of the criminal/sinner.  The song dramatizes the consequences and complications that are at the center of all the previous songs, but from the perspective of an injured party: the police sergeant brother of a \\"no good\\" rabble-rouser.  It is one of the most poignant and sentimental songs on the album (only \\"Used Cars\\" and \\"My Father's House\\" come as close), illustrating the competing claims of community/state and family.  The narrator is no less pained than any of the narrators on this album - but his pain is the result of assumed responsibility - for the actions of his brother as well as his own - rather than the refusal thereof, as is so often the case.  \\"Me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' - / Nothin' feels better than blood on blood.\\" <br /> <br />The pulsing rhythm of the guitar that underlies \\"State Trooper\\" has the sound of a heartbeat, slowly accelerating as the song progresses to match the increasing anxiety of the larcenous narrator - another desperate man who claims that his crime(s) are inevitable.  Murder, whichlooms on the horizon here, is the natural result of outside interference - not a choice.  The refrain, a mantra that has the power of a prayer,\\" is a plea: \\"Mr. State Trooper, please don't stop me, please don't stop me, please don't stop me.  The vocals grow in their raw urgency of emotion to culminate in a chillingly primal bark, followed by a series of equally animalistic howls that trail away as the song fades.  It is a defining moment. <br /> <br /> \\"Used Cars\\" could be sung by the narrator of \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" and/or that of the later track \\"My Father's House.\\"  The perspective is that of a child who determines to achieve more than his parents did - a familiar theme not only in literature but in American culture.  The narrator contrasts himself with his father, implicitly accusing him of cowardice and weakness when he says, \\"I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry / And tell them all [\\"the neighbors\\"] to kiss our asses good-bye.\\"  He has the same urgent desire for freedom - which comes from security - that has ostensibly been responsible for the downfall of the central figures in many of the other songs on the album.  Tellingly, the narrator imagines this freedom/security as coming not from hard work - his father \\"sweats the same job from mornin' to morn\\" without any such payoff - but from luck - \\"now mister, the day the lottery I win / I ain't never gonna ride in no used car again.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Open All Night\\" is something of an anomaly on the album - often singled out by critics as a faux pas.  It is the only genuinely \\"up-beat\\" song, musically, on the album (\\"Johnny 99\\" aside, which is ambiguously \\"up-beat\\" at best), and the lyrics seem to complement this mood.  But Springsteen has throughout his career often set dark and brooding lyrics against ironically bright music (\\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" is the most (in)famous example, though songs such as \\"Hungry Heart\\" - on first listen, a happy-go-lucky paen to wanderlust and its possibilities and promises, that is actually a song of selfish shirking of responsibility and the abandoning of family (the narrator himself declares that he \\"took a wrong turn and ... just kept going\\") should have prepared his audience for such songs.)  Lyrically, the song is linked to \\"State Trooper.\\"  The lines \\"in the wee wee hours, your mind gets hazy / Radio relay towers (won't you) lead me to my baby\\" appear in both songs; the narrator of \\"Open All Night\\" echoes his (textual - if we consider the album as a whole to represent a text) predecessor when he declares that \\"this [New Jersey] turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone\\"; and both songs end with virtually identical \\"prayers\\": \\"Hey somebody out there / Listen to my last prayer / Hi ho silver-o / Deliver me from nowhere\\" (\\"State Trooper\\") and \\"Hey Mr. Deejay, woncha hear my last prayer / Hey ho rock `n' roll, deliver me from nowhere\\" (\\"Open All Night\\").  There are crucial, if relatively minor, differences between the incidentals of the respective environments as well as the apparent emotional landscapes: where the narrator of \\"State Trooper\\" hears only \\"talk show stations\\" on his radio, filled with \\"just talk talk talk talk, / `Til you lose your patience,\\" the radio of the narrator of \\"Open All Night\\" is \\"jammed up with gospel stations.\\"  There is a possibility of salvation present here that is not to be found in \\"State Trooper.\\"  Ultimately, however, it is unclear exactly what relation this song may have to the others: is it representative of a realized alternative? does it merely offer a glimpse of the other side? is it symbolic of innocence before the inevitable Fall?  It may be any of these things or all of these things - but in any case, the song is unequivocally not the \\"accident\\" that it is often taken to be. <br /> <br /> \\"My Father's House\\" is often associated with other Springsteen songs such as Darkness on the Edge of Town's \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" (1978) and The River's \\"Independence Day\\" (1980).  It is a meditation on the past and its relation to the present, on the ancient shame between fathers and sons, on paternal love and loss, and on the part of us that will always remain our parents' child, a little boy lost and alone in the dark (\\"Last night I dreamed that I was a child,\\" sings the narrator in the opening line).  The echoing overtones in the vocals match perfectly the dream-description and incantatory quality of the lines.  The house of the title, like that of \\"Mansion on the Hill,\\" is symbolic of security - but where the security represented by the latter is ambiguous, that of the former is belied completely.  The last line's of Richard Wilbur's poem \\"The Pardon\\" - \\"I dreamt the past was never passed redeeming. / But whether this was false or honest dreaming / I beg death's pardon now.  And mourn the dead\\" - echo in the final verses. <br /> <br /> The album's final track, \\"Reason to Believe,\\" is one of the most cynical on the album, from the ironic jauntiness of the music and the lilting vocals, to the almost smug - though ultimately more tenderly bemused - observations of the narrator: a man stands in wonder and confusion as he \\"[stands] o'er a dead dog\\" ... \\"like if her stood there long enough / That dog'd get up and run\\"; a woman \\"one day\\" abandoned by her lover \\"waits at the end of that dirt road / For young Johnny to come back\\"; an old man dies alone as a baby is baptized; a groom is left waiting at the altar and \\"stands alone ... wonderin' where can his baby be.\\"  Each vignette is simple and common-place - everyday occurrences with little or no significance for those not directly involved; yet each represents an existential(ist) confrontation with the finitude(s) of human existence; each scene is an Absurdist drama writ small.  Whatever hope there may be in this life - whether real or delusion - is of the same variety as the hope found in \\"Atlantic City.\\"  What is important is not whether or not \\"belief\\" is warranted - only that it is there. <br />  <br/> Nebraska is not, from certain perspectives, representative of Springsteen's body of work - it lacks the pseudo-operatic grandeur of Born to Run, the free-wheeling rock `n' roll adrenaline rush of much of 1980's The River, or the bombast of 1984's Born in the U.S.A. - but from another perspective it is more representative than these others.   Springsteen has always been a folk artist at heart (he was touted and hailed as Bob Dylan's heir upon the release of his 1973 debut Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.  On Nebraska the lyrics - and Springsteen has been a consummate lyricist from the beginning - take center-stage, and it is not so easy to miss the narrative quality of most of his songs.  Nebraska is one of the greatest albums ever recorded in any genre.  It is haunting and heart-breaking - Springsteen's vocals here are among the most emotionally devastating and heart-felt of any heard.  It is an amazingly complex album, thematically, despite or perhaps even because of its simple, plain-spoken poetry.  The oppositions, conflicts, and paradoxes it brings to life are spiritual and philosophical as well as socio-political and economic (the latter are merely the incidental accompaniments of the former).  It is easy to see from this one album why Walker Percy declared that Bruce Springsteen was his favorite American poet.  While he has since forayed into similar territory (1995's The Ghost of Tom Joad), he has never done it so well as here - and arguably few people have accomplished what he did on this album.  Nebraska is not only Springsteen;s masterpiece - it is a masterpiece of American music. <br />
0440237688|2.0|This is a book I really *wanted* to like. It's generally well-written, it's a widely-banned book, and deals with really incredible themes (is a society flawed if people are happy in it, the relationship of memory and emotion, &c.). In fact, the beginning and middle of the book are incredible--as is the very ending--Lowry brilliantly shows us a utopia/dystopia (the readers have to decide which they think it really is) and its effects. However, getting from the brilliant middle to the brilliant last page is a chore--after setting up a psychologically compelling picture of two people's struggles with the world they live in, the book turns into what I can only describe as a low-key adventure novel. It's almost as if Lowry decided that continuing to write with the attention given the first three-quarters of the book would make it too long for the format, so a few shortcuts (having certain characters act in decidedly odd ways, essentially eliminating all dialogue) had to be taken--and it's a real pity, because the book had the potential to be a 4- or 5-star novel.
B0001906O0|2.0|Out of the 4 cd's i managed to make 1 complete mixed cd that is worth listening. The first 2 cd's i didn't really care for. The next 2 have got some real gems on them and i mean real GEMS!<BR>  The one thing that really put me off about this set is a lot of the songs are recorded with one of those 25 dollar used beat boxes. Real drums are so much better!<BR>  Guess I was expecting more!
B00007AJF9|1.0|When this movie hit the theatres, I had just begun to find an interest in Elizabeth, and had not read much about her yet.  Found the movie confusing, and thought it was just my ignorance that I could not follow the events.    <br /> <br />However, I rented the video recently after having read many biographies on her, and could not believe how wrong the chain of events in this movie were!  It appears they just grabbed character names from her biographies that sounded good, and created the rest, or just twisted events completely out of order (unneccarily in my opinion) ...How is it that one scene after Mary of Guise is dead, Norfolk is convicted of treason for plotting with her daughter, Mary Queen of Scots????    I think I will have to check out the sequel to this, just to see how they plan to handle Mary Queen of Scot's actual treason with Norfolk (considering he has already been executed for this)???  Will be amusing to see what they come up with for the next movie.  Also was very disapointed in the portrayal of Dudley, also grossly inaccurate, perhaps he will marry Queen of Scots in the sequal since he is such a devoted catholic.....
B000002VMH|5.0|One of those rare albums where every song is a precious gem, a miracle unto itself. The entire album flows with great moments of pathos and discotheque. With this debut album, Annie Lennox truly achieved diva status.
B00005JLEX|5.0|It's not often that we in Australia get releases before both the U.S & U.K, but lucky for us on this occasion, both box sets have been released today, October 20, 2004, over a month prior to U.S release.  <br /> <br />I'm glad to say that they're everything we've been promised and then some more. the Oz versions are identical to the forthcoming U.S versions with the exception of the covers, which are typically disappointing versions of the U.S ones. (2 Amaray cases in a shoddy slipcase). Apart from that, all the contents are identical. <br /> <br />I won't bother reviewing the episodes as we all are familiar with their brilliance but it's good to finally have unedited versions with no commercial breaks. And the HD remasters are fantastic - not quite as good as the Twin Peaks remasters a few years ago but incredibly impressive. <br /> <br />The bonus extras really do set the benchmark for tv on dvd releases - they're thoroughly, ah, thorough. Most episodes are representing with bonus material - deleted scenes, bloopers, ect. <br /> <br />Can't be bothered writing any more. I'm back to the box......enjoy!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|If you want to review all the great musical and dance numbers without sitting thru the whole movie then this is the solution.
B00064ADR0|5.0|Johnny's excellent follow up to \\"Johnny Winter\\". Less blues oriented than his first release and more for those fans that want \\"Rock\\" music. The Live CD is fantastic and showcases an evolving band that includes Edgar (Johnny rarely appeared live as anything more than a trio after 1975). The sound quality on this rare performance is excellent. A must have for JDW fans and anyone who wants an intro to this gifted performer.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Do not get influenced by the &quot;not so bright&quot; engineering in the Scenes from NY DVD. This piece of work is really to the level of the DT members. AWESOME! not a single complaint unless U want to go way to specific as Rigo did! Its not a drum clinic DVD!<BR>Anyway, very good recomendation for any metal listener.<BR>Keep it Prog
B00005JNEI|4.0|I'm rendered speechless the gravitas afforded the \\"President\\". Who in their right, sane mind can support a man who so clearly lacks ANY intellectual heft? A man, who AT BEST, should be lording over office monkeys in an industrial park in some podunk town. One has to remind oneself that it is NOT the \\"President\\" who is meant to be the beneficiary of the \\"support\\" seen lauded upon him at canned public events. No, it is ideology proffered by a Kool-Aid sipping segment of the population who haven't the ability to see the \\"bigger picture\\". Conservatives, small-minded people that they are, join forces on things that really have no business being broached in the public square. I'm talking social issues primarily. It is their bread-and-butter. Pandering with nonsense like gay marriage, god-in-the-classroom idiocy, they've successfully installed blinders on their followers, all the while feasting on the public trough, raping the environment, etc. Despite all of this in PLAIN VIEW, conservative loyalism hardly wavers. The mind reels. I'd recommend to those who hate Moore and his film to watch \\"Triumph Of The Will\\", but they would simply fail to make the connection between then and now. I'm not a \\"believer\\", in the religious sense, but if the current administration retains power (or refuses to cede it), I would say that prayers would truly need to be said for the frightening direction this nation would be steered toward.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|When \\"Van Helsing\\" came out in theaters I was pretty harsh. I don't know what I expected certainly something different than this campy popcorn movie. That was probably part of the problem. \\"Van Helsing\\", like \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\", packages camp, classic horror, satire and action all into one seamless package. Is it the worst film of the world? Well, yes if you were expecting enlightenment or something deep and meaningful. But if you were expecting adventure, humor and a startling mix of traditional special effects and CGI to support some truly looney and over-the-top performances, you'll have a blast with \\"Van Helsing\\".<br /><br />Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man with no memory. Working for the Vatican to rub out evil throughout the world, he faces his most difficult task--facing Dracula who has been supporting Dr. Frankenstein's research into creating life for his own nefarious reasons. Van Helsing also has to save the souls of the family that has been fighting Dracula for centuries. Anna the latest in a long line of vampire killers is in danger and Van Helsing is directed to help her. Playing Q to Van Helsing's James Bond is Carl a Friar who comes up with all the wonderful toys Van Helsing must use to dispatch evil.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers' monster hit movie was completely misinterpreted by most critics and, yes, by lots of moviegoers. It's not a perfect movie but it's perfectly entertaining. There's always going to be mindless fun movies created for the 12 year old in all of us. Sommers' movie is an attempt to recreate that feeling (which he, no doubt, had as a kid as well) for adult movie audiences as well as kids.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD varies a bit. While the colors are vivid throughout most of the movie, the beginning of the film looks particularly soft with a lack of sharp detail. It does improve, however, as the movie progresses. My guess is that it's due both to the transfer and the large amount of detail in the images as well as the compression. Some of the sequences are startling clear and are among the best I've seen on DVD. The sound has tremendous presence. Sommers and Ducsay his producer/editor provide a delightfully informative audio commentary as do three of the main actors from the film Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp.<br /><br />The big difference between the two region one editons as simple--1 extra disc. Both editions have outtakes, \\"You Are in the Movie\\" (which tries to create the impression that you're part of the production crew on the set), \\"360 Degree Tour of Dracula's Castle\\", \\"The Legend of Van Helsing\\" (which discusses the character as portrayed through films), the first level of the \\"Van Helsing\\" Xbox game (which can be played on your DVD player) and the \\"Bringing the Monsters to Life\\" featurette.<br /><br />The extra disc has a number of features not included on the disc disc set. An interactive map, \\"Darkness Falls: Dracula's Lair is Transformed\\" which looks at the production end, a short documentary \\"Van Helsing: The Story, The Life and The Legend\\". Most importantly for old horror movie fans is the inclusion of three classic Universal horror movies Todd Browning's \\"Dracula\\"(1931), James Whale's \\"Frankenstein\\" (1931) and George Waggner's \\"The Wolf Man\\" (1940). \\"Dracula\\" is essentially the same as the first disc in the \\"Legacy\\" series with commentary, trailers and a short documentary. \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"The Wolf Man\\" arrive bare bones with just the feature films.<br /><br />The big question will be whether or not the deluxe edition will be worth it? Only if you don't have the three Universal classics included. The featurettes and extras on disc three aren't all that impressive overall considering the price. If you don't have the three classic films and only want those (vs. ponying up for the \\"Legacy\\" boxed sets), then this would be the way to go. It's a pity that this editon doesn't have a \\"Director's Cut\\" (if one exists) along with Hugh Jackmanand Kate Beckinsale's commentary on the film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a great movie to watch on Halloween (and there's only one minor bad word that I recall hearing and it's pretty minor)with kids 6 and older. It's a way to revisit the classics you grew up enjoying without having your kids get bored watching old black and white movies that with pacing from another era.ith Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale's commentary on the film.  <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a great movie to watch on Halloween (and there's only one minor bad word that I recall hearing and it's pretty minor)with kids 6 and older.

0440237688|5.0|I am a 8th grade student. I read this book in the 7th grade. <br />This book is basicly about Jonas, a 13 year old teen who is in this 'community'. This community isnt like your every day community. There are birthmothers, who have birth, and there child is taken away and at 1 year old, placed in a new family. Spouses are not chosen, but forced. Pills are given at the age of 13 to stop people from 'liking' one another. All children have the same birthday as each other. <br />Lowry did a VERY good job writing this book

B0002KVUKM|1.0|I think Stephen Sommers needs to go back to all the film writing books he no doubt studied whilst at film school. I'm talking of books by the likes of Robert McKee, Lew Hunter and William Goldman. In particular he should re-read McKee's STORY. I say this because 'Van Helsing' is almost devoid of story. It is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years. When will this type of film-maker learn that CGI effects do not make a movie. I seem to remember Goldman in one of his books recalling a line by the legendary director George Roy Hill, something along the lines of \\"...get the screenplay right, get the casting right, and you can phone in the direction.\\" The screenplay for Van Helsing sucks big time and is barely worthy of the name. The casting is God-awful. Hugh Jackman's accent changes for each sequence. Kate Beckinsale is very pretty but if she's an actress, I'm Frank Sinatra. Worse than that however, much, much worse, is the casting of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. Can someone explain how this no-talent ham gets parts in big budget pictures? The man is devoid of anything approaching screen presence and charisma. His performance was akin to that of an enthusiastic member of a village amateur dramatic society. Didn't Sommers see how bad Roxburgh was in LXG?? Didn't Sommers realise the casting of Roxburgh as Moriarty in LXG seriously undermined the film? Sommers caught us all off guard with 'The Mummy', which had the right mix of human characters and special effects, a  bit like the original Star Wars films. Now, with Van Helsing, he has gone down the same route, much quicker too, as George 'Greedy' Lucas has with the Star Wars prequels i.e. no discernable story of note, terrible actors and plenty of super special effects. It's a sad old day in the moving pictures industry when crud like this is produced to such a fanfare.
B0000508U6|5.0|Ah, the 90's. Rap, \\"alternative music\\", lame bands not relying on their musical talent but on their image, their millions of dollars, and themselves being well advertised. But...a breath of fresh air for music debuts by the name of Coldplay with this near-perfect compilation, Parachutes. They have mixed together slow rock and pop, and created a genre that is finally listenable. It startas out strongly with a  catchy 2:00 ballad called Don't Panic, goes through the area of paranoia and emotion through Shiver, Sparks, and Spies, sort of goes throu and finally ends with slow, easy ballads, Parachutes, Everything's Not Lost and We Never Change, but not without its fortification of something different, Trouble, and High Speed, the former, a loud and slow ballad of raw emotion and metaphors, the latter, a futuristic ballad that doesn't make that much sense, but is nonetheless entertaining.      All in all...    DON'T PANIC-9.5/10. As I said, one of the lyrically best songs of Coldplay, ever. It's also really catchy. Chris Martin's voice still shines. \\"Yes, everybody here has somebody to lean on\\"    SHIVER-8.2/10. Why does everyone think this song is boring? It's not! It has very simple lyrics and great guitar. It's very easy to get into and is a very unique Coldplay song. The most catchy  Coldplay song, ever. It's also really emotion-saturated...lyrically.    SPIES-9/10 Haunting. Melodic. Simply a masterpiece. It gives you the feeling of raw paranoia and darkness.    SPARKS-9/10 One of the best Coldplay songs. Very bluesy and has a great beat with great lyrics, bass, and guitar. A key track. I want to learn to play this on guitar.    YELLOW-8.9/10 A great song, and I think this would make a better finale than Everything's Not Lost.    TROUBLE-8.5/10 Great lyrics, piano, guitar, and vocals. I like the video. Very creative. This really reminds me of Spies. \\"Oh, no...what's this?...Spiderwebs, and I'm caught in the middle...\\"    PARACHUTES-8.9/10 A haunting ballad that really paints a picture in your mind. Too bad it's 40 seconds long. It's aforementionedly a unique idea, and I give em' credit for it, but I was dying to hear more. The guitar actually kinda has a \\"hazy\\" sound...check it out.    HIGH SPEED-8.4/10 It sounds very futuristic, and is a really unique song on this record. A good one. Some weird lyrics though. \\"Can anybody fly this thing...Before my head explodes?\\"      WE NEVER CHANGE-8.4/10 I finally listened to this Sparks-like track. I really like it! Anyone can relate to the lyrics so well.  But I'm not saying the lyrics are great, because, well...they're not.      EVERYTHING'S NOT LOST-9/10 A good finale, and a great song. Very poetic lyrics. I also like the part 2 of this song, Life is for Living. The guitar, vocals and orchestra are great. Another song you can relate to. It's funny...the hidden track is overlooked so much, and it is simply BEAUTIFUL. It ends such a perfect album with the lines that floored me; But life is for living, we all know..And I don't want to live it alone.    AVERAGE-8.5  *****    If you like Coldplay, you already own this album. If you are just getting into Coldplay, this is a great way to start. Whatever, even if you DON'T LIKE Coldplay, still get this and do yourself some good. It's simply great. Coldplay has created their own genre, as I said, and hey, I like it!      \\"Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones-Turn into something beautiful\\"-Yellow
B000001F84|5.0|I listen to a very wide variety of music. I became a Rush fan when I was 14 and have all of their albums up to Moving Pictures. 2112 was the second album I owned by them and it is at the top of my all time favorites list. Their musicianship is superb, as well as the lyrical and intelligence factor that encompasses their music. Led Zeppelin cannot be compared because it is not in the same category of music. I love Zeppelin though. They too are at the top of my list but comparing the two is dumb. I do believe that Rush beats them out in originality. Zeppelin was basically a glorified cover band. I mean all they did was sing old blues songs with a \\"metalized\\" arrangement.  <br />     The rock and roll industry is full of strange ideals and Rush happens to be one group who supports a strange ideal. I was disappointed to find that someone as intellectually gifted as Neil Peart, and the rest of the band, can believe in something as illogical as Objectivism. I think they were sucked in at a young impressionable age when LSD seemed fun to them but never broke out of the mind set. Regardless, I do not think that they have properly, objectively, and with an unbiased attitude explored all possible avenues of truth before concluding that Objectivism was the way to go. ALL of Rush's music is based on the concept of Objectivism. Yes. Many songs between Fly By Night and Moving Pictures and beyond. That doesn't change the fact that they play good music but it does distract me sometimes when I listen to there lyrics that allude to atheistic beliefs. I do not like being a target for Rush's double meaning lyrics no matter how creative and original they are. It seems that they use their music as a hidden pulpit to spread their self-catered religion. I am not a religious superstitious person. I am not seeking to make myself feel better by knocking something down. I just believe in honestly no matter where is comes from. Myself or someone else. If you want to say something just say it and don't beat around the bush. Listeners need to know where the music's origin is coming from. One last comment. Rush is not the only band who's lyrics allude to Objectivism. <br />
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind begins with the theory that memory is a tangible thing. The brain is the equivalent of a large filing cabinet, and the removal of painful memories is as simple as isolating the files associated with the person or event and taking them out. Described as a form of brain damage, the procedure is quick and efficient, as troubled patients are promised a future free of those troubling episodes that haunt us all. <br />But that only establishes the world of the film. The plot involves the question of what happens when two former lovers both choose to erase each other from their memories and then meet again without any knowledge of their previous relationship. The film goes on to explore questions about true love and how much a person's identity depends on his/her memory.  <br /> <br />The two lovers in the film as played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, and neither have been better. Carrey is reserved and introverted, a reminder of other Charlie Kaufman-created leads in Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. He is witty, educated, but painfully inept in social settings. As opposites attract, his love interest is all the things he is not. She is spontaneous and lively, but lacks much mystery and depth.  <br /> <br />The film begins in the middle, before they meet again \\"for the first time\\". We see their previous relationship in flashbacks, most of the film taking place in Carrey's mind as he goes through his memory erasing procedure. While in the middle of the process, conflict arises in his mind. A heartbreaking realization ensues, as he must give up the tender moments of their affair (along with the painful ones). The horror of the procedure is exposed; it is the equivalent of the death of a loved one.  <br /> <br />While watching them build their relationship a second time, many viewers will be torn. Some will say it is the power of true love, thrusting them back together as if they are destined for each other. Others will believe theyare making the same mistake again and will not want them to suffer through another courtship that ended as badly as the first.  <br /> <br />At the heart of the film is a relationship between two people presented with all the cruel truths of reality. While we do see the wonderful moments shared by two people in love, we also see how painful love can be when those involve really know what how to hurt their partner. The film offers ambiguous answers to the matters of the heart, but succeeds in presenting a story and world that should stimulate imaginations and spark debate. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000DBJDM|2.0|The origanal was great I couldn't wait to get it on DVD and than it came out I gave my original away I bought the Dvd the directors cut. <br />Well this brilliant director took the monolisa and cut her up through a bunch of modern crap threw it on top of it and made a real mess.I loved the original where you could watch Pink Floyd play and it was in order,before the Idiot director decided to cover all of the live playing with moon shots,sun spots and volcanoes erupting.The Directors cut is crap the Origanal was brilliant and I wish that I had my original VHS back.
B0000VD04M|4.0|Let's close this subject right at the start.  Wood in no way deserves the reputation as the worst filmmaker ever.  The mere fact this movies live on some 40 and 50 years after they were made attest to this fact.<br /><br />You need browse the horror aisles in your local video store and grab just about ANY movie from the 70's or 80's and you can find worse movies than Plan 9 or Bride of the Monster.<br /><br />I've read several interviews with people who knew Wood, including Sc-Fi collector Bob Burns and they all say that JOhnny Depp absolutely nailed down Wood to a T in his frentic performance of the ever optimistic director.<br /><br />These are NOT \\"B\\" movies...these are \\"Z\\" movies and what Wood was able to do on such a limit is really amazing.  And despite his resources, Wood always directed as if he were John Ford or Michael Curtiz.<br /><br />While Depp was fantastic, the best performance of the film goes to Martin Landau with his haunting performance of horror legend Bela Lugosi.  Not only did he capture Lugosi's look but also the voice and mannerisms as well.<br /><br />Lugosi, long past his prime, addicted to drugs, estranged from his son and long forgotten in Hollywood...nonetheless, Bela always gave EVERY performance his 110% best effort.  Landau really captures this, particularly in the scene where he is in the water wrestling with a rubber octopus.  Absolutely histerical!<br /><br />Thank God Tim Burton knew that Wood, while hardly a genius, was a man with unique ideas and skills and brought his story to the screen.  Wonderful film!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Rather, The Passion is a cinematic experience that serves an almost singular purpose: to show the scourging and death of Jesus Christ in such horrifically graphic detail (with Gibson's own hand pounding the nails in the cross) that even non-believers may feel a twinge of sorrow and culpability in witnessing the final moments of the Son of God, played by Jim Caviezel in a performance that's not so much acting as a willful act of submission, so intense that some will weep not only for Christ, but for Caviezel's unparalleled test of endurance.\\" <br />This is quite possibly the dumbest thing I have read on amazon.com thus far. I totally disagree with the whole thing. <br />
B00005ATQF|5.0|You could say that 'Full Metal Jacket' is a movie which in fact consists of two movies that can be seen seperate, though we can see some of the characters back in part II. <br /> <br />Part I is about boot-camp where new marines are taught to be killing machines by a magnificent Lee Ermey. There are so many insults and so much degrading that there aren't really any personalities. There are just soldiers with their own quirks but we never get to know anything about them. <br /> <br />Part II is your typical war movie with of course a Kubrick twist. Visual signs are everywhere. The main character, Private Joker, starts out in the bootcamp but in Vietnam is a reporter wearing a peace-sign, while on his helmet we can read \\"Born to Kill\\". There are many signs like this, which makes the movie really interesting to look at.  <br /> <br />The movie is an anti-war movie and shows the contempt soldiers have in war for the enemy. There is a scene of someone randomly shotting people from a helicopter, a mass grave and more. <br /> <br />Better than Platoon, almost as good as Apocalypse Now.
6305428042|5.0|What a wonderful story! Makes a person wonder, \\"Could this really happen?\\" LOL The characters are wonderful, played to the full effect of the movie! Bette Midler is hillarious with her little pursed lips, her hair, all of it! Just a wonderful movie to watch and to keep watching throughout the years, every All Hallow's Eve!
0767817478|1.0|In 1998, long time Godzilla fans feared the worst when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich unleashed their monster \\"epic\\", but one thing was missing....GODZILLA! Where is Godzilla in this movie? I sure don't see him, do you? I thought this was going to be a Godzilla film, not another Jurassic Park sequel. Oh, don't get me wrong...Tristar and Devlin/Emmerich aren't the only ones to blame for this truly AWFUL film, but the owners of Godzilla in Japan, Toho! They were the ones who approved the terrible new design of Godzilla, and ultimately had to make up for it by bringing back the TRUE and REAL Godzilla in Japan only a year later. As for this film(if you can even call it that), avoid it and just be glad that it FAILED and Devlin/Emmerich will never again lay a finger on the true king of the monsters - GODZILLA! (a few short years later, the Devlin/Emmerich team broke up, and the planned sequel never happened. Let's all rejoice! I hope Devlin and Emmerich are proud of themselves...)
B000002OX7|5.0|WOW!!!!! When i first heard this i fell in love with it.  This made the Who and is a GREAT GREAT album.  The only downside about the new remasterd one is they added tracks.  I have the original CD on how it was originaly on record with no added songs.  But anyway go out and buy this cd and have your self a ball!!!!!!
B000089CJI|5.0|A friend played this cd for me in his car, and I bought it right away. What a wonderful album! It's a nice album to just listen to, as background music, or to actually listen to. The lyrics are meaningful and profound. The sound is synth/new wave, and it works well with the lyrics. In some ways the sound resembles New Order, Pet Shop Boys or Depeche Mode. Favorites include \\"This Place Is A Prison\\", \\"Sleeping In\\", \\"Such Great Heights\\", \\"Natural Anthem\\" and \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\". A great album from start to finish!
B0002SROT0|5.0|I've listened to this maybe 20 times since I got it Tuesday.  I enjoy it every bit as much as \\"XO\\".  It has a different feeling than anything he's previously recorded.  The melodies don't stick as easily, but I've always found that music I have to work at is more rewarding in the long run.  And since, sadly, this is the last of his work, I guess this one is going to have to last awhile...
B00005K3OT|5.0|I first saw this movie about three years ago with my two best friends, it captured everything we wanted to see. I think that even though the story is simple, it is made into a movie very thoughtfully. When I watched it again I noticed small details that were overlooked the first time, details that brought life to the movie. I love how the passionate woman brings life to this little french town, it grows from a deeply religious and traditional gray town to one that is bright and alive but does not compromise its previous beliefs. This movie also awakened a great passion for real European hot chocolate, not the mix stuff! Oh, and for me, anything French is great, I love the language and the culture (although the people are not always nice).

Second of all this isnt a Zepplin album there dumbass its Metallica. Metallica - The Black Album, ya know it simply amazes me just how stupid some ignorant people are. If you wanna comment on Zepplin do a review on one of their albums. Just maybe you will get lucky and somebody will read it but I highly doubt that seeing as how god awful they are and how nobody gives a shi* about Zepplin...Grow up nancy <br /> <br />Anyway on to TOPIC AT HAND, this is a great album. If your a Metallica fan and dont own this cd then u need to get it for the collection. Awesome album from and awesome band
B000006TRV|5.0|I have this on album, have the live release on cd as well as the release of \\"The Wall in Berlin\\".  This is a must have, period.  As with most Pink Floyd recordings, important to listen to this from start to finish.  See the movie release, also.  Worth it.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|He must have cost a bundle...plus, he bursts through a car roof, which costs good money, only to quip the line \\"No loitering\\" to thugs.  That not-clever chip they put in his body must have cost a fortune alone. <br /> <br />I actually love these movies.  Me and my dad used to rent them when I was little and I'd watch in amazement, then go back to my mom's house and repress my feelings.  My 10 year old mind loved the plot, and the acting (thought my 10 year old mind) was superb.  My favorite part in all of the movies is when Robocop fought the giant robot in the first one(?), and totally beat his ass...and the image that stuck with me out of the whole series was the part in the third where the thug falls into a barrel of toxic waste and comes out looking melted and buttery...yeesh.

0671015206|4.0|The author says it best.  To paraphrase:  we see fit folks out runnning after work each evening and notice that these folks don't look like they need to run but it is precisely because they keep on running that they are fit.  Discipline is the key to much of life. <br /> <br />Is some of the data repetitive?  Sure, but I didn't see that as a big negative.  Are some of the stories similar?  Sure... that is the point.   <br /> <br />This book made me think about folks I know who are or were very much like those in the book:  driven, focussed, methodical and disciplined.  They too have done very well for themselves and, contrary to some other reviewer's opinions, they seem very happy and grounded.  Their true wealth is not in their bankbook, though that *is* evidence of their wealth.  No, their true wealth is in knowing who they are and what matters most. <br /> <br />It certainly made me reevaluate my life.
B000005HLV|4.0|Many people regard this album as the most influential album for black metal...ever. Many fans nearly worship this album, and praise every aspect of it. And for the most part - they're right.  <br /> <br />This was the first BM album I heard, and it simply blew me away. The precise guitar work of Euronymous (and I've heard that there's a 2nd guitarist on this album, but I've been unable to verify it) is perfect for black metal. His riffing really makes the atmosphere of the album. His rare solos aren't jaw-dropping, or even really good - but they fit the sound and mood of the album.  <br /> <br />Hellhammer's drums were also excellent. While they were buried a bit in the mix, and it's not his best performance, they're still excellent. Very nice background to the guitars.  <br /> <br />Varg's bass playing is also very good - the bass is VERY highly distorted, but that adds an interesting background noise, and allows the bass to be heard independently. He mixes his sound so he supports the rest of the band but also stays audible alone. Very good.  <br /> <br />And now, Atilla's vocals. The most debated topic of the album. Personally, I love them. The deep, demonic growls (I can't really describe them any other way) are near-perfect for the album, and vary a lot depending on the need. He excels on Funeral Fog....damn, I love that song. Granted, the vox needed some getting used to, but now that I have - they're amazing.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that while all the instruments are played well, there's no standout performance. Every one of them has done better performances, especially Hellhammer. It's Mayhem's best album to date, but not BM's best album, and it's not flawless.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Terrific DVD - I hope the christian radical-right will quit their petty attacks agains this movie and honor the freedom of speech they say they support.   The fact that they attack it so quickly and so strongly should tell you that it is hitting a nerve of truth.  If they don't like it they can simply turn on FOX 'news' for radical-right views on a daily basis.  I also recommend a few books to explore how the traditional media has failed the US citizenry - \\"Rich Media, Poor Democracy: Communication Politics in Dubious Times\\" and \\"Our Unfree Press: 100 Years of Radical Media Criticism\\" and \\"The Corporation : The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power.\\"

Most people were furious with the film's ending: a professional contract killer is defeated by a lowly cab driver.  However, the beauty of the film is in Vincent's stoical death.  He dies without any complaint or pain.  One must look at Vincent's actions earlier in the film to understand the ending.  Vincent(Cruise) is a true existentialist.  He does not recognize the sanctity of human life because he does not subscribe to the presence of natural law.  To him, life and the world are nothing more than a compilation of atoms and cells.  Absurdly, Vincent sees his job, killing people, as no different than Foxx's job of driving a taxi.  In the existential world, people struggle for their lives to have some higher meaning or foundation.  The reality that Vincent has found is that he is not an individual but part of this huge empty world.  Vincent's death on the train shows paradoxically that nothing means anything.  A proficient assassin can be defeated at his own trade by a cab driver.  The genius of this film is in its unexspected bleakness.  This is truly a quintessential classic.  Enjoy.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Yeah, that's right i think that this movie has the potential to be the best movie that I have seen all year, and I see a lot of moives. This movie has terrific, but offensive humor, a story that you proboly won't find in any other R rated puppet movie, and hysterical and eye opening visuals. Yes, matt and trey tried to make the movie funny by showing the puppet strings, but I just think that it adds to the humor part of the movie. This movie is great, it has great music that i am sure Matt and Trey wrote and sang, and great lines in it, like there are three kinds of people.....(not appropriote). I would like that this movie should have recived an NC-17 rating, but then again i am glad it didn't becuase then I would not have been able to see it, due to me being only 15. All the people say it is not for people my age, but I went with my dad and we where just fine. I think this film has nothing to do with what age you are, it is how mature you are. If your going to go out and have sex with puppets and shot people because you saw this in the movie, you proboly shouldnt see it. It is rauncy and rude and they say the F word more than 100 times, but you get that at school, so why not pay 5 bucks and get a laugh along with it. In conclusion I love this film, I f you liked SOuth Park you will love it too, it is a movie to be enjoyed by everyone, just go into it knowing that it is all just for humor and not to be taken seriously. I seriously doubt Kim Jong sings songs about how he is lonley, and other stuff like that. It all is for fun.
B000002LRX|5.0|What can be said about FNM that wasn't covered plenty in several magazines, tributes, websites. This is one of those bands that defy time and space. They really can't be compared to anything before them as their mixture of different sounds are unique. And even after them. I don't really think there's gonna be another band that would sound so great like this one, in the future. <br /> <br />Mike Patton is a demented genius, one of a kind. Almost everything he does is over the top and ingenious. He's today's Frank Zappa. Instead of playing guitar as good as Zappa he plays with his voice (listen to Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Tomahawk and the EP with Dillinger Escape Plan) in a way I've never heard any singer do it. <br /> <br />Billy Gould is the foundation of FNM's music. One thing you'll always notice in FNM's songs is the bass. He's no virtuoso but he plays with with energy and creativity. <br /> <br />All other members deserve special attention as well. Everyone of them is part of a puzzle which is called Faith No More. <br />Angel Dust is rock, funk, black music, heavy metal, black metal, grunge, progressive rock, rap, pop music (not the pseudo-pop on mTV) and many more. This should deserve way more than 5 stars!!!!! RIP Faith No More and if you'll ever reagroup someday, I'll be there.

B000096FUD|5.0|to enable him to complete his movie and i don't even like the story of Don Quixote that much! But what very little of the Gilliam's Don Quixote we are able to see of the  movie is enough to left one hungry for more (which makes La Mancha worth buying all by itself, really, as even a taste is better than none)... It IS a shame that the movie can not be completed not because it is heatbreaking (which it is) but because proves Gilliam he IS a real visionary and his movie is a real masterpiece and it is everybody's loss that the movie is not completed... <br /> <br />Lost in LA mancha is known for showing the sad and ugly side of movie business but actually it also still manages to show the magic and glamour of it in the dedication and spirit the crew show through out. The project is clearly Gillam's baby, and the way he visions and plans every aspect of it is breathtaking... His chuckle at the \\"high\\" points of the production process (which actually was stresful thorough-out) is suprisingly up-lifting and shows an unyielding fighting spirit that throughly enjoys and savours what he is doing no matter what. And the fact that, even at such horrible conditions and such short time the crew and actors were able to work their magic immediately says a lot about their proffessionalism and talent... <br /> <br />Sure La Mancha documents the story of a failure, but it does actually leave the viewer with the feeling that this was not the end but the beginning and somehow, someday Gilliam's Don Quixote will make a legendary come-back... Given he actually managed to bought his script yet, maybe even sooner than later! <br /> <br />But no matter what the faith of Don Quiote is, one thing is certain: La mancha is a must-see for anyone who would call themselves a fan of movies as it is the most sincere, insightful and \\"real\\" look into the making of a movie...
B00006RINF|5.0|This was my first purchase of Lacuna Coil, I heard Heaven's A Lie on Headbanger's Ball then went out and bought it. I didn't like the male vocals at first, and frankly I'm still not big on them but they grow on you. I have to admit though, I don't completely understand how they're considered heavy metal, there's maybe one or two songs on here that are \\"heavy\\" but I really like this cd. Cristina's voice is gorgeous and mixes with the instruments very well. She weaves in and out of verses and choruses seamlessly. The guy's vocals are also good, the song that really shows how well the two vocal stylings go together is Humane. This song gives you a really good thought of what this cd will sound like. The lyrics on this release are interesting also, Entwined peaked my interest the most.<br /><br />As stunning as this work of art is, there are some parts that could be more perfected, songs like Aeon could have been more intricate, but that's just my humble opinion. Other than that, I have no complaints, I thought it was really cool that they decided to put a song on here in their native tongue also.<br /><br />A few of the best songs on here are Swamped, Tight Rope, Entwined, and Angel's Punishment. I really can't recommend this cd enough, each song has a little something special on it. Not many bands can pull off a follow-up as good as this. That should give you a hint of how good they are.
B000001FGG|4.0|'Wheels of Fire' is Cream's sequel to their break-out masterpiece, 'Disraeli Gears'.  It is a two-disc set recorded over a years time between July of 1967 and June of 1968, and released in August of 1968, just several months before The Beatles released 'The White Album', the first double album composed entirely of newly composed studio tracks.  'Wheels of Fire' is less impressive as it consists of a studio album, and a mediocre live disc featuring only one new song, two retreads, and the legendary 'Crossroads', which was released as a single in February of 1969 and rose to number 28 on the national charts.  But 'WoF' is desirable primarily because it contains about a quarter of all the studio tracks Cream ever recorded. <br /> <br />The studio tracks on 'WoF' are, in my estimation, on a par with 'Disraeli Gears'.  'White Room' is the elite song on the disc, arguably Cream's finest recording, in the same class as 'Sunshine of Your Love' from 'Disraeli Gears'.  While much is made of Felix Pappalardi's violas mixing with the axes, my ears are all tuned to Eric Clapton's wah-pedal guitar burning through each and every break in Jack Bruce's vocals.  The song was paired as a single with 'Those Were the Days' in January of 1969 and rose to number six nationally.  The second best song on the disc doesn't emerge until the final track.  'Deserted Cities of the Heart' is reminiscient of 'World of Pain' from 'Disraeli Gears', albeit with a sped-up tempo.  Sandwiched between are some good songs, and a couple low points.  On the upside we have the familiar Booker T. Jones number, 'Born Under a Bad Sign', and two songs that would eventually be covered by the band on their swan song album, 'Goodbye Cream' as live tracks, 'Politician' and Chester Burnett's 'Sitting On Top of the World'.  Less remarkable are the more laid-back Jack Bruce numbers 'Passing the Time', and 'As You Said', and Ginger Baker's comedy relief offering, 'Pressed Rat and Warthog' (which had been released as theb-side to 'Anyone For Tennis' in May 1968).  Baker does pen one winning track, 'Those Were the Days', supplementing an appealing melody with marimba and tubular bells, and Swiss hand bells. <br /> <br />The live disc is a bit of a disappointment.  As with the studio disc, it opens with the best track, the quintessential recording of Robert Johnson's 'Crossroads'.  It's the only track featuring Eric Clapton on vocals, but it's Slowhand's churning guitar that propels the song into rock and roll heaven.  Willie Dixon's 'Spoonful', at nearly seventeen minutes, lacks the melodic structure to maintain interest over that much time, as most blues numbers would.  Maybe you \\"had to be there\\" to truly appreciate it.  'Traintime' is a harmonica-based, Jack Bruce blues number, not bad but not exceptional either, and 'Toad' is a Ginger Baker composition that sets the drummer's considerable talents front stage and center, but at over sixteen minutes is overdone as well.  The two extended tracks, 'Spoonful' and 'Toad', first appeared on 'Fresh Cream', the band's debut album.  You just get the feeling that if you had access to all the tapes from Cream's Fillmore East concerts, you could have put together a much more entertaining set.  After all, the band was suppose to REALLY shine in concert... <br /> <br />'Wheels of Fire' is a must-have for dyed-in-the-wool fans of Cream, and especially fans of Jack Bruce who provides nearly all the vocals here, and pens five of the nine Cream tracks offered (4 of the 13 tracks are covers).  Eric Clapton pens nothing, and only wails his guitar on about half the tracks.  Drummer Baker has more of a presence, penning 4 tracks and offering a wide assortment of percussion instruments including glockenspiel (a small xylophone), timpani, and the high hat (foot pedal cymbals).  So for fans of Clapton, this is a hit-or-miss deal. <br /> <br />The packaging of these recordings is nothing to write home about.  Most multiple CD collections offer a booklet of some sort, but this collection has a paucity of artwork and song information, and no photography or lyrics.  After all these years, isn't there a story to tell?  So what you hear is what you get.  You could certainly do worse, but Polydor could have done us much better (can you spell, \\"bonus tracks\\"?).
B00005JMU2|5.0|This movie was a class act!  Unfortunately it received so much bad press due to the former movie \\"Chasing Liberty.\\"  This movie only compared to the other only in the area of plot, otherwise no comparison! First Daughter offered a great relationship between a daughter and her parents and the movie reminded me of the movies of yesteryear when we had beautiful starlets, great music and fun plotlines.  It would be great to see more of these types of movies.
1400032717|5.0|<br />Beneath its unwieldy title, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too.  <br /> <br />Christopher is a fifteen-year-old, mildly autistic boy who lives with his father in Swindon, a small town about a hundred miles outside London. His mother has passed away several years ago of cancer, so it's just Christopher and his father. During the days, Christopher attends a \\"special needs\\" school, where lessons include not only the three R's, but also tips on dealing with strangers and decoding facial expressions (Christopher can recognize happy and sad faces, but more complicated faces give him trouble). For a project, Christopher's teacher tells him to write a book about himself. Adding his own individual touches along the way (a math prodigy, the boy numbers his chapters not 1, 2, 3, but as prime numbers in ascending order), and peppering the text with illustrative tables and drawings, Christopher embarks on a detective story about Mrs. Shears's dog, stabbed to death in her yard with a garden fork.  <br /> <br />Christopher's purpose in writing his book is to emulate his hero, Sherlock Holmes (whose logical mind he greatly admires), and solve the case. But his investigations unearth more about the relationships between his family and his neighbors than about the identity of the dog's killer. Unable to decode sarcasm, jokes, or figures of speech (he calls them all \\"lies,\\" since they aren't the truth), Christopher faithfully notes down his conversations and observations; though the reader, able to read between the lines, will guess the truth fairly quickly, Christopher's inability to understand social cues makes his struggle for answers all the more affecting.  <br /> <br />Constantly bewildered by the (to him) incomprehensible behavior of those around him, Christopher resembles nothing so much as a human plunked down on a distant planet, trying desperately to figure out how to interpret the language and behavior of an alien species. And, in a way, many of Christopher's conclusions and actions make logical sense; but because he lacks a normal person's ability to make intuitive connections or understand the unspoken, Christopher has to rely on the imperfect set of rules he's learned about human behavior. Which is not to say Christopher can't also be infuriating, with his startling rigidity and resistance to change; he's prone to loss of bladder control and groaning fits when confused or scared by his surroundings - which is rather often. Nevertheless, he's deeply sympathetic and intensely believable, even if (like me) you've never met an autistic person before.  <br /> <br />Other characters, such as Christopher's father and bereaved dog-owner Mrs. Shears, are realistically flawed and very convincing. They're not saints, by any means; Christopher's father tries hard to be patient, but can't control his frustration and anger, and all too often takes it out on his unresisting son. Mrs. Shears, for her part, is icily distant to Christopher. At first we assume that it's because of his insensitive poking into the death of her pet, but as the story progresses, we learn that her hostility stems from other, understandable (though not very noble) reasons. Obviously, Christopher's not responsible for his condition, and obviously he wouldn't have chosen to be as he is; but even though he can't help it, the boy is a heavy burden to those who must care for him, and frequent flare-ups of resentment and bitterness keep the story well away from saccharine TV-movie territory.  <br /> <br />Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love. This is a wonderful book; you'll be glad to own it. Another recent, quirky Amazon quick-pick I enjoyed and highly recommend is The Losers Club by Richard Perez.  <br /> <br />
B00024I2Z4|5.0|First of all, I was, and am, very glad about Disney's including a MANDARIN LANGUAGE AUDIO TRACK on their Special Edition DVD. --Unfortunately, this is true for the Special Edition ONLY; the newer blu-ray has 6(!) foreign language tracks, including Dutch, Flemish and Catalan, but NO Mandarin or Cantonese!!! (Disney, what are you thinking?!)  Next: I have to emphatically disagree with reviewer Bill Mydo below. -You will excuse me if I spend some little time defending this film against his critique; Mulan happens to be my favorite Disney animated movie, second only perhaps to Beauty and the Beast. Perhaps my being Chinese-American may have something to do with it, as does the fact that I strongly identify with the character's self-doubts. Still, I am fairly particular as to what I consider &#34;good art&#34;; and it boggles and confounds me that anyone would fail to see the difference between this movie and, for example, Hunchback or Hercules.  Yes, Disney's Mulan is very much a western/ American movie, made for western and American- not Asian- audiences. No, they &#34;didn't get it right&#34;; or, not exactly. But I never expected them to, and I give them a good deal of credit for trying. They came quite a bit closer that I ever thought that they would. Nor do I find this movie overly feminist (no more than Snow White or Cinderella are &#34;chauvinist&#34;). Mulan may be a strong female character, but she is not Aladdin's Princess Jasmine. Mulan is not defined by rebellion, nor by what she rejects. Instead she upholds her sense of honor as she struggles to find out who she is and where she fits in. Moreover, in a genre known for its blatant ad nauseum boy-meets-girl love themes, I truly appreciated the downplayed understatedness of the &#34;interest&#34; between Mulan and Captain Shang.  As to the &#34;commercial&#34; aspect of the film; yes, it had its tie-ins and its merchandising. What Disney movie doesn't? But the real issue is the worth of the film itself, and onthis I take exception to the review below. I believe there is more in it than Mr. Mydo gives credit for.  The film does have its awkward moments. The scene with the match-maker and Mulan's first entrance into the army camp are both extremely painful to watch- I do not enjoy watching anyone be utterly humiliated- not even a cartoon character (and I do not believe that someone as bright as Mulan would fumble so badly over simply coming up with a new name). I also find it somewhat irksome that one minor character, Mushu the dragon, continually steals attention away from the movie's proper focus. And there are a number of jokes and visual gags that closely border on PG. I found this in somewhat poor taste in a kid's movie.  But these faults are counterbalanced, and more than compensated for, by the scenes that really work. The opening &#34;brush painting&#34; of the Great Wall; Mulan's song (Reflections) and the ensuing scene of loving encouragement from her father; the scene where she decides to leave home; her heart-to-heart talk with Mushu at the abandoned camp in the mountains; the Imperial Palace where she is honored by the Emperor before all China... the sheer artistry of these scenes is breathtaking.  When the Special Edition DVD is released, I intend to be first in line!

B00003CXWV|5.0|\\"Blow\\" is the kind of movie about drugs I can respect in one sense: it neither glorifies it nor condemns it, does not for one second pull a DARE moment on us, and yet allows us to see the essentially destructive nature of the indisputable scumbag George Jung's lifestyle.<br /><br />Johnny Depp did a great job portraying Jung, and I'm sure if Jung had somehow slipped out of his cell and played himself the movie would have gone nowhere--keep in mind while watching Jung go from being a twenty year old with money on the brain to middle aged wreck, to the ultimate b**ch, that this is JOHNNY DEPP, not George Jung.  I'm sure it was quite a bit less glamorous and charming in actuality.<br /><br />Jung was moving weight.  Serious weight.  Weight enough to get him screwed over by his equally strung out friends and land in jail till 2014.  He had his good times, but they were all predicated on fear and paranoia: you can practically sense the impending doom from every wonderfully hedonistic moment in this film.<br /><br />Ray Liotta, as Jung's father is touching.  His subtlety and seemingly endless empathy for Jung's skewed plight in life strikes a moving contrast to his mother, who after awhile simply wants nothing to do with Jung.  He sticks (in a sense) with Depp's Jung right till the very end.  The last few scenes are chilling and disturbing:Jung is betrayed by his friends in a cinematic moment few will forget.<br /><br />My only problem with this movie is that it generates actually sympathy for George Jung as a man (the last picture of him flashed as Depp is hallucinating that his daughter is speaking with him is grotesque and shows the very real nature of the toll the use and decades of hustling took on him) and one wonders if this is appropriate at all.  I tend to doubt that Jung cared that much about his daughter.  If he did, maybe he wouldn't have wasted the best years of his life slinging coke.  Plus, no major drugdealer would ever behave like this.  During the course of the movie he is screwed over a billion times by just about everyone and seems pretty friendly about it afterwards.  If Jung in fact conducted his \\"business\\" this way,<br /><br />he was either really looped out on his own product or simply a stupid kid who was in the right time at the right place to sell tons of cocaine and had no basic idea of what he was doing.<br /><br />This movie is a work of art, though, for all the moral ambiguity involved.  Penelope Cruz is a delight to watch as his really nutty temporary wife.  However it may be judged ethically, this is better than \\"Traffic\\" or \\"Requiem For a Dream\\".the course of the movie he is screwed over a billion times by just about everyone and seems pretty friendly about it afterwards.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|The whole movie is like a wild roller-coaster ride from one action scene to the next. The special effects were excellent -- a lot of morphing though and showing of vampire teeth. <br />This is not a film to ask questions, but instead just sit there enjoy the screaming from the characters (and there's a lot of it -- I had to turn my theatre system down as the screaming apparently never stopped), and have some fun for a little more than 2 hours. <br />And you'll see everybody: Dracula and his vampire brides, the Frankenstein monster, wolfman, etc. -- and as mentioned before, a lot of morphing. My teenagers love the movie. You must also forget the original stories of Frankenstein and Dracula, etc. -- although these characters are in the movie -- this film is not about the underlying work of literature, but it's just what it is: a wild roller-coaster ride with lots of action and special effects, just for the fun of it to pass a rainy afternoon.

B00005JN4F|2.0|This movie is American copy of the French comedy Taxi, originally shown in 1998. The US version has just changed actors and brands of the car, of course. It is funny, though sometimes I had a feeling that the humor is forced to be American funny at any costs. With barely original ideas, it is good for those who like cheap comedies. If you are a movie geek, get a French version of Taxi. It offers you different perspective on racing movies, it is funny, but most of all, IT IS ORIGINAL. (www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DD2ZY)

This has got to be some of her best work yet.  This cd gave me more then what I expected, and each and every last track had a different style and sound.  The most fav. tracks on the cd is \\"Be With You,\\" \\"Yes,\\" and \\"Signs.\\"  This cd is flawless and whoever is a fan of females with really strong vocals need to OWN this cd.  The only thing about this cd is that it's a bit mainstream, but you can't beat the production that came out of this.  Thumbs Up.

Some of the sets, effects, set pieces etc are pretty darn cool.  Jude Law gives my favorite performance in a Speilberg film as a Gigolo Dancing Fred Astaire Android... crazy character yet is made not only believable but also able to embody the film's central drama of adventure & fun with the film's melancholic premise of humans & AI.<br /><br />The Teddy character is also particularly likeable and helps give the films ambiguous & changing nature a fun anchor. It all amounts up to good stuff, u go on a interesting yet melancholic sci-fi fairy tale journey. Is an interesting colloboration between a weird Kubrick concept film of a fairytale about myth allegory & Speilberg sci-fi tone & kinetic energy to Kubrick's associated style, that he was doing the film as a tribute to.<br />.

B00005JL78|5.0|A perpetrator-less  murder of an innocent for revenge gets committed by a 'flawless' preventative murder crime system in order to bring itself down.  This film is part of the rewarding trifecta of Speilberg's  most specialist period of contemporary future sci-fi type Genre films, & as such is perhaps one of his more cinematically derived creative films in kinetic style & tone. Tom Cruise is a fitting Genre protagonist in this film, somewhere between action hero and character actor, resulting in a good Genre fit to the film, & with Collin Farrell providing the right kind of depth as his character's initial main antagonist.  This film has similarities to the Matrix trilogy, as well as it's sharing same time period of release, one being to an extent, it's elaborate story of characters taking place without their recognition of the explicit telling in the general circumstance driving the story.  Speilberg has alot of heart in his films but there is less heavy handedness here to the style, with a fair amount of Genre moral ambivalence in the film's premise as it's plot unwinds.  Speilberg's flair for set-pieces & aesthetics in these 'type' of sci-fi Genre films, always seem to work really well, & this film is no exception. While not as good a film as the tantalizingly close to total Genre awesomeness of War of the Worlds, Minority Report is a better fully realized story.  Any film one likes to keep, usually best to have special edition, and this one is worthwhile for it's extras to that too.ly realized story.<br /><br />Any film one likes to keep, usually best to have special edition, and this one is worthwhile for it's extras to that too.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Bram Stoker must be rolling over in his grave with this latest interpretation of his great novel.  Yes, this movie has energy and great special effects and that is it.  The story line is silly.  The acting is insufferable except for Dracula, and only because there's a campy quality to it.  Van Helsing's character is a lousy shot with his gatlinger like cross bow - some hunter he.  If you like heaving breasts, dark sets, special effects galore, a lousy script, insipid acting, then go see this movie, otherwise, save your money and time and rent something else.  The recent USA made-for-TV movie, Frankenstein, was a much better production in all aspects than this horror(ible) flick.
0156027321|3.0|This book addressed interesting ideas but gave them a relatively shallow treatment.  Maybe it would have been better as a longish short story?  The animal story is certainly more attractive than the one about cannibalism, and, perhaps, a life with religion is more attractive in many ways than one without.  But, come on people don't start to believe in god simply because the story is pretty.  Am I missing something huge here?  Was there something else in this book to convince the reader of the existence of god?
B00004YZFR|5.0|\\"Gimme Shelter\\", the Rolling Stones documentary, follows the Greatest ROck and Roll Band in the World on their 1969 US Tour,and at the tours finale, a free concert festival at Altamont Speedway. It also shows them at Muscle Shoals studio in Alabama laying down tracks for their next album Sticky Fingers.  It captures great performances of Jumpin Jack Flash, Satisfaction, Street Fighting Man, Honky Tonk Women and others, while you also get to hear early versions of Brown Sugar, You Gotta Move, and Wild Horses.  The documentary also focuses on the efforts that were being made to create the free concert which was supposed to take place at a different park in San Fran, I think it was the Golden Gate Park or something.  Things take a bad turn when the free concert gets started.  The Flying Burrito Brothers play a tune and the Hells Angels, who were hired as security decided to enforce the crowd by smashing pool sticks on their heads and just basically stomping the fans on the ground.  The Jefferson Airplane takes the stage next and are greeted with the same chaos from the crowd of over 300,000, and Marty Balin of the Airplane actually jumps in the crowd and gets punched in the face.  I think  Santana actually performed there too, but his concert footage is not included here. The day turns to night and then the Stones come out in all their stoned and wasted glory.  They get things started with Sympathy For the Devil here, and a motorcycle engine starts to catch fire and explodes causing the band to stop for several minutes, then they get back in the groove and perform an excellent version of the song.  Under My Thumb comes next and its definetly got an erie sound to it.  As they perform it, a fan named Meredith Hunter aims a gun, and as he does so he is stabbed twice in the back by one of the Hells Angels.  They go on to stab him once more in the ear and proceed to kick and stomp him to death while the Stones play on.  At the end of the concert the Stones jump in a chopperand get the hell out of Altamont.  The film shows a couple of replays of the murder with Mick Jagger watching and commenting.  The film ends with shots of the fans leaving the show early the next morning with a rocking rendition of Gimme Shelter played live at one point during the Stones tour i guess.  This is definitely a great documentary to watch and its packed full of extras like some footage of two or three songs performed on the tour.  The album \\"Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out\\" is the perfect companion peice to \\"Gimme Shelter\\".  Its a live album record on November 26th and 27th at Madison Square Garden while on that 1969 tour. Get both the cd and the dvd for a classic Stones experience.
B00000272N|5.0|Alice in Chains is one of my very favorite bands, and they are very talented as a matter of fact (take that godsmack!), and this album shows it.  <br /> <br />Facelift was release in 1990, and was AIC's first full length album, and its very good. <br />Higlights : Sea of Sorrow, Bleed The Freak, Man In the Box <br /> <br />But this album, its a very worthy add on to your collection.
1401301010|3.0|I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and have been forever.  I am also a bit of a biography junkie--I especially love reading about artists from the \\"punk rock era.\\"  Even though this was well written (by a ghost writter), it lacked something.  All the talk of sex and drugs masked some intimacy that Anthony seemed unwilling to give to us.  That's fine, but he came off pretty shallow because of it.  I find it hard to believe that he is that shallow, but sadly with the exception of the last chapter he really didn't show much depth as a human being.  He really didn't show his true demons--pain, fear of abandoment, and disappointment over having to obviously grow up way to fast.  Perhaps with his found again sobriety he will do more soul seaching and write another book that will reflect his soul better than this book was able to do.
B000002B2X|5.0|I lve this EP, although its not the longest (only contains 4 songs) its very very good. Brother is one of my favorite alice in chains songs. <br />Very good vocal harmonies makes this amazing. Cantrell and Staley really both shine. <br /> <br />Buy it, its very good
630218021X|4.0|I first saw this movie back in the early 70s, when I was still a young, dumb, nieve hippy chick listening only to rock n roll. A roommate of mine was into Classical music, and took me to see this. It brought the music to life, gave me an insight into the torment of the composer and what motivated him to write his music. I then and there dropped out of the hippy scene and enrolled in college to major in Classical music.  I actually haven't seen the movie since, and am purchasing the video to refresh my memory.  Still, it remains one of my all-time favorites.  I can't proclaim to be all and know all about the nuances of movies, directors, etc.  But I do know what inspired me, educated and entertained, and opened my eyes to a whole other world out there.  I recommend the movie, obviously.
B00007LTIA|5.0|(continued from above)...the power,majesty,and glory we Yesfans had all suspected was present in the recording,but not quite heard since this controversial album's release,nearly 31 years ago now.Since I acquired this item solely for the possibility that something like this had happened,that someone had finally gotten it right,I cannot tell you quite how happy I am with this reissue,for mere words cannot convey.I have shared my Yes enthusiasm with members of my family and friends(some have called 'shared'-'infected'!!!)since way back when,and for us,as I see has been true for many of you,this 'album'(my archaic terminology itself gives my own personal antiquity away...)has been a source of much consternation and ambivalence.Until now.                                                                   Having seen this band live 6 times over the last 4 & 1/2 years,during an improbable resurgence(somehow it has become,at long last,almost hip again to love them...personally,I kind of miss the days when they were nearly universally despised by the rock [un]\\"intelligentsia\\",and they were,kind of...'our little secret'...but few bands have worked harder on the road in the last decade,if any,and at last they may have reaped some small reward for this labor),& having been a rabid fan since 1973(only semi-rabid from '71 to '73!!),the year this item was released,I feel at least somewhat qualified to remark upon their,and it's sound.                                                                 One thing I have noticed,first of all,is that whenever this band decides to play from this album,in performance-magic ensues.They're so wonderful live anyway,it's particularly special when there's Topographic to be played!I've seen it.I've heard it.You Yesfans know it's true!                                                                  So what does that have to do with this product review?Ah-ha!....I've been waiting for this question!-Try listening to this remaster as though Yes were performing it right in front of your face.I can see them playing it,whenever I listen.That is the highest compliment that I think can be paid to an endeavour such as this.Every vocal track,every instrumental line, can now be heard clearly.And clearly,the band composed this album with the intent of playing these monumental compositions for a live audience.However,not until now has the full impact of this material been available to the listener,unless the band itself is playing it.                                                                   So,I've often found myself wondering about this,the most universally loathed of all Yes' main sequence classic 70's releases.Until I saw them play again from it live(I DID see them play the entire album in what has now become a legendary Madison Square Garden show in 1974,but it was so long ago,I barely knew what I was looking at,or hearing,and barely remember it!),at which time it almost seemed as if they too,were rediscovering the material.Since then,and this release,I now find myself wondering-is this the greatest album of all time?!...Now it is...!...Now it is!!!...
B000002LK1|5.0|If you weren't an avid fan of Depeche Mode before listening to \\"Violater\\", you'll be hooked afterward. This particular album is what made me a fan and encouraged me to buy six more albums thereafter. All nine songs on this album are powerful and emotionally moving.
1559409002|4.0|i was pretty into candace hiligoss in this movie.  hot babe!  the organ score in this movie really rules.  seeing candace organ \\"sync\\"-ing throughout the movie is a corny yet pleasureable sight.  the organ score gives you two simultaneous feelings, first one of the sacred,the church, and the other of the carnival, somewhat bawdy and profane.  it was a very brilliant twist to have the lead charactor as an organist, because this duality carries the vibe of the whole movie.  it's really hilarious in the scene where she's jamming at the church to practice the hymns, and then she gets overtaken by the spirits or whatever and starts getting into some dark twisted carnival organ.  the spirits \\"take over\\" her fingers and she starts jamming evil organ in the church. <br /> <br />even though this movie seemed to tense out my girlfriend, i can't say i found it scary.  it's full of atmosphere, due mainly to candace's weird and kinda bad acting, the great organ music, and the wonderful setting of the amusement park pavillion on the lakeside. <br />the atmosphere is what'll attach you to it.
B00028HBKC|5.0|After dabbling in his direction of 'Bravehart' and the pathetic 'The Patriot', Mel Gibson now deserves to be placed on the same level as some of the greatest directors in film history such as Ford, Wilder, Kubrick, etc.    Gibson's direction of 'The Passion' demonstrates all of the sensitivities of a great director.  The choice of scenes, the camera work, and not to mention the brilliant acting of every single actor in this film is captured with grace.  Seeing the film, one can truly feel every ounce of pain Jesus of Nazareth must have suffered in his torment.  The scenes depicting his torment all seem to be animated versions of Bosch's religious paintings showing ugly distorted grimaces.  Caviezel's performance is singularly outstanding.    This film is an outstanding tour-de-force that is unprecedented in the history of film making; especially in light  of preceding films dealing with the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth.   Even if one is a non-believer, it's a film worth watching simply for its artistic quality.  I strongly recommend it.
B000075BFK|4.0|This is one of my favourite pac albums. Though it has a few downfalls the remixes , though they cant stop pacs creative meaningful accapella verses. The best tracks on this album are the completed songs that were produced by johnny j the other beats are a joke on the artists legacy. Songs like Thug Mansion- <br />Nas accoustic. Most of the other unofficial Pac mixes lack a good beat but have extremely cool verses.  <br /> <br />Get this album coz its off tha hook <br />
B00005AUBA|1.0|This album neither rocks nor has any action.  It's largely nothing but a collection of aimless, 5-10 minute meditations on a single theme (with the exception two tracks, one of which is essentially nothing more than an abbreviated version of the track that precedes it, and the other of which is a blast of white noise).<br /><br />Furthermore, only several of the tracks on this disc even have VOCALS.  How any group can get away with something like vocal-less music in this day and age is beyond me.  Do people actually ENJOY garbage like this?<br /><br />I've been told the \\"frontman\\" for Mogwai (kind of ironic that a band that rarely even sings can be said to have a frontman) has said in the past that the prime inspiration for Rock Action came from being awestricken by Radiohead's Kid A album.  It figures that only such pretentious, intentionally alienating dreck could begat an album as self-conciously pretentious and aimless as Rock Action.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.
B0002SROT0|3.0|I am a huge elliott smith fan but I felt compelled to review my true feelings. This record is disappointing. By far the least memorable in his discography. I have listened to this record trying to connect with it the way I do with the other records. It seems apparent to me that for elliott fans, he could just record himself crying into an F-Hole (thats the acoustic part of the acoustic guitar for those more prone to taking offense) and the fans would buy it. Not to accuse elliott of ever committing such a crime (RIP). But his fans are perhaps allowing the very sad and untimely death of this brilliant musician to clowd their judgement of this record. I'm just being honest. If you're a fan, buy it for that reason. But don't anticipate his best work. There are definitely some good songs on here. I counted 3 where I thought \\"THAT'S an Elliott Smith song...\\". It seems apparent to me that the drug abuse was finally taking a toll on the very talent that supplied his ability to communicate about it. A sad record... but not a great record.
0671027387|3.0|After reading Angels & Demons and Digital Fortress, I was ready for an exciting and over-the-top thriller about covert government operations and code-breakers.  While Deception Point was an interesting read -- I learned a lot and went on a whirlwind ride with Rachel Sexton and company -- it was missing something that the other Brown books have.<br /><br />That something was the code.  The mystery.  That final zinger that usually wows me in the end.<br /><br />Similar to the other Brown books I've read, Deception Point contained engrossing characters, lots of interesting and unknown-to-me facts, and unbelievable coincidences -- almost James Bond-style.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any thriller lover, but beware if you've read other Brown books:  I don't think this was his best.
0441172717|4.0|The Dune books are a famous achievement in the science fiction literature world, and I think that the recognition is well-deserved. Herbert has found the perfect bridge between the two main camps of sci-fi fandom. For the purists, there is a well-detailed culture, realistic scientific advances, and a glimpse of a far future on a distant planet. For the pulp fan, there are giant sand worms that can swallow a spaceship whole, frequent action scenes, and heroes and villains to watch. <br />   Dune takes place mostly on the desert planet Arrakis, which is important because the giant sand-worms of the desert produce a valuable spice, that is worth a fortune. Arrakis has been under the control of an one of the \\"great Houses,\\" ruled by Baron Harkonnen. But it is about to come under the control of the heroic House Atreides, ruled by Duke Leto Atreides.  <br />   The two houses comprise one side of the interstellar triangle of power that is formed by the Great Houses, the Emperor, and the Guild. House Harkonnen and House Atreides are feuding families, and both sides know that Baron Harkonnen will commit treachery during the transition. The treachery leaves House Atreides in ruins, and Duke Leto's son, Paul, who is the hero of the book, flees into the desert while the planet reverts back to Harkonnen rule. Over the following years, Paul grows in power as he assumes the role of religious leader of the desert people, the Fremen, who are coveted by the powers that be for their superior fighting abilities. Paul is a uniquely powerful individual, blessed with mental superpowers that are both difficult and unnecessary to relate. <br />   The end of the book features a conflict between the Fremen, led by Paul, and the Harkonnens and their intergalactic allies. Needless to say, the villains are vanquished, leaving a fresh hope for the Fremen, whose secret dream is to convert the planet from a land of sand into a more temperate world that will allow them to enjoy life. <br />   Herbert has painted an epic world, fully detailed, which incorporates the elements of many different mythos. Mysticism and technology coexist without overpowering the human conflicts and politics. Codes of conduct are reminiscent of knights from the Middle Ages, giving the interactions a flavor that bears the excitement of tales of that time. Herbert does a good job of balancing action and character development; he shows us a neverending story, and tells us just a piece of the ongoing tale. Dune is the first of five books written by the original author; his son has written three prequels, and there are probably countless spinoffs, as is the case with the Weiss/Hickman Dragonlance chronicles, and Star Wars. <br />   I also liked Dune because of the ecological message; the Fremen sacrifice their immediate comforts for the chance to be environmentally responsible in a good way, and it's interesting that this is an integral plot point.  <br />   Dune asks for effort from its readers; the first fifteen pages were so much gibberish to me as I tried to begin to assimilate the names and terms that were specific to the world of the book. A criticism would be that there was too much of that kind of thing; but I guess that that's the flip side of the coin if you want to present a richly textured world. <br />
B00020QXU4|5.0|So there's only one difference... So?  It's still a good CD, and Indie Rock & Roll is an awesome song.  Of course, if you have the US version, don't buy it unless you're a completist (like me)
B00004XQ8H|5.0|From the day it was released all those years ago, this remains one of the most beautiful (Strauss) recordings ever made. It's been available in different versions (I have the earlier release that includes the Wesendonck Lieder with Flagstaf), but it's worth it to get this one for the opera arias. I'm not a big fan of these operas, but it's unlikely you'll ever hear them sung with more beauty or understanding. You may have another favorite recording of the Songs, but you owe it to yourself to listen to what Della Casa does here. And not to slight Bohm either; he obviously knew this music inside out, and is miles ahead of most of his competition.
B00005JMJG|2.0|I might be jaded but I couldn't understand why Jim Carrey's character was upset that Kate Winslet left him.  From the moment they met she was nothing but a total jerk to him. <br />Maybe its because I know far too many people with that \\"I hate my self but need to be the center of attention\\" attitude that Ms. Winslet played perfectly or the sappy its better to have loved and lost theme but I thought this movie was shallow and pointless.
B000001ED1|5.0|I recently acquired Relish and have played it in my car, at work on my pc, and home. The instruments used are striking and initially detract, later they add meaning to this sacred trip. It's Joan Osborne's talent that makes this venture worthwhile: her interpretations, unmatched and unique vocals, and her willingness to attempt newness at the possible expense of acceptability. Her transformance ranks far beyond the background music and accompanying production. She is central and she delivers! Take some time with this work - use your senses and imagination - and there's more than music in Relish, guaranteed.
038572179X|4.0|Like so many books that I've read recently, I had a difficult time getting into this one. I found the first 100 pages or so to be quite unnecessarily drawn out. I struggled to get through many of the long descriptions and almost gave up until the incident in the library. That, for me, is when the story picked up and began to flow.  I enjoyed the rest of the book immensely. Robbie's experiences in France and Briony's experiences as a nurse were written in such a way that I could see myself there with them. The ending was beautifully written.  Four out of five stars from me, only because of the first 100 pages.
B000055ZB8|5.0|I first saw this film in late October 2003 on TCM and was, quite frankly, astounded.  I have a commercial version of this film on VHS (approx. 68 minutes).  I watched this remastered version for TWENTY MINUTES before I saw a single scene from my edition.  I even discovered scenes that are misplaced in my VHS copy.  If you are a fan of the silent, impressionistic film genre or a fan of vintage horror or vampire films, this piece is a MUST HAVE for your collection.  The subtitles and the music have been greatly enhanced.  BUY IT!  This is not mere pieces of film spliced callously  together.  This truly is Nosferatu as it was originally intended to be seen!
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Unlike past work, the reviews of this CD are all over the map. Bottom line, while not the best, it's well worth having in your Mark Knopfler collection. There are more ballads here than on previous work, so the rockers among us keep the Dire Straits - On The Night CD close by. The writing is top-notch as usual, and there are some catchy melodies (or perhaps too sugary, like the title track), but there is also the relentless, pounding Song For Sonny Liston, and the infectious Postcards From Paraguay. And there's just enough of the Fender Strat sound (for example Boom Like That) to hope that if he hasn't the room for those soaring solos on this album, then maybe on the next album, or in concert? My current favorite is Everybody Pays, but like all Knopfler albums, you will find your choice of favorite changes quite a few times as you listen.    Update after 10 months: As predicted, my favorites have changed. For example, how could I have missed the opening track, 5:15 AM? This is an astonishingly well written and constructed song. At any rate, the point of the update is ... staying power. When I pull a Mark Knopfler CD, this one is still almost always first. So as other reviewers suggest, give this one some time.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's been ten years since Green Day came out of no where with \\"Dookie\\" (which if you don't have you have to have it) Green Day has inspired new bands that are coming out now. American Idiot is very different than any other green day albums. With the clash of five songs into one, which then lead up to pretty longs songs like \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" that is a nine minute song. I haven't heard a nine-minute punk song and I don't really like long songs but it's incredible. Non-stop punk! When you listen to this cd it's kind of like watching a movie, to watch part 2, you have to watch part 1 first to understand it. You have to hear this album through track 1 to 13 to get this. Thats what I completley love about this album. Way diffferent than any other Green Day record. I didn't really think much of this album when they released \\"American Idiot\\" as a single until I saw Green Day perform on \\"Letterman\\". The song that is Green Days second single (or at least heard it on the radio) \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" is such an amazing song that you just have to buy this cd. Even if you think Green Day hasn't made a great album since \\"Insomiac or Dookie\\", you will definitley change your mind after listening to this record.
0451191153|5.0|The fountainhead was Ayn Rands first real success, and it was a nationwide best seller. If you are unfamiliar with Rand or her philosophy, objectivism, then buy this book immediatly! Even if you do not agree with her, it is a truly engrossing and heart felt story.  <br /> <br />The novel is mainly about the life of two different men, both architects coming from the same school. One is intent on realizing his dreams without compromising his designs, while the other is only concerned with climbing the social ladder at any cost, including his friends, family, and dignity. In the beginning, the difference between the two characters are not as shockingly different, until they move through life. Before you eyes you see two people, anyone could relate with, move down different paths. <br /> <br />All in all, although the book follows Rand's views about a free market society and rugged individualism, any reader will appriciate the story and learn that even during extreme hardships, the one thing no one can every steal from you is you integrity as person, unless you give it too them.
1400031087|1.0|I really like the story and was pulling for James Frey and all the other characters in the book, however, the way it is written is so bad. I thinkg the writer indulged a bit.  I dont think a lot of key points in the book are truthful. He repeats so many sentences dozens of times, as if he was trying to make a 430 page book with a 200 page story. I never write book reviews, but I felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I understand he was trying to emphasize how he (his character felt), but honestly enough with the fury fury fury fury want want want need need need. I never write book reviews, but I Felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I never write book reviews, but I felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one. I never write book reviews, but I Felt so strongly about how I Felt about this book to give one.<br /><br />You get the point, its freaking annoying!
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut is, I'm told, a pacifist. While there are elements of pacifism that make terrific sense to me, I'm not sure I completely join him in this particular conviction. In Slaughterhouse Five, however, he makes a brilliant case for his position. <br /> <br />Slaughterhouse Five is about war. And tragedy. And laughter. And aliens. It's not really a true story, but it's set in a true piece of history... the infamous firebombing of Dresden in the final months of World War II. Vonnegut draws on his own, true experiences as a soldier in Dresden to inform the fiction. <br /> <br />While Vonnegut is famous for his sense of humor, that wasn't what was most impressive to me about this particular work. I appreciated this book because it has a conscience. While many authors are content to woo or shock or report, Vonnegut feels a deep sense of responsibility to his audience to not only tell the story... but to wrestle with the questions of time and mortality with his readers.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Jennifer Lopez's debut CD, \\"On the 6\\" is a nice mixture of R&B and Spanish music.  This CD would be great for an R&B lover who wants something slightly different than the average R&B album.  J. Lo puts her listener in many moods throughout the album.  She makes you feel good, she makes you feel sorrowful, she makes you smile, she makes you cry.<br /><br /> \\"If You Had My Love\\" was the first single from \\"On the 6\\".  This song received lots of airtime on the radio and was a success.  When she first came out with the single, many people were impressed by her acting and dancing, and now they were ready for her singing.  Although many argue that she isn't much of a singer, lots of people think she is a great singer.  Jennifer pays homage to her Latin roots and adds some songs sung totally in Spanish to her CD.  \\"No Me Ames\\" is one of them.  This is a duet she did with her current husband, Marc Anthony.  The song is beautiful.  It's a ballad and Jennifer shows her vocal range on this song.  This song was also released but wasn't as big a success as her first single, probably because many didn't understand the lyrics.  This CD has its share of up-tempo songs like \\"Let's Get Loud\\" (written by Gloria Estefan), \\"Feelin' So Good\\", and \\"Waiting for Tonight\\".  Jennifer also has her share of love songs on the CD which include \\"Talk About Us\\", \\"Should've Never\\" and of course, \\"No Me Ames\\".<br /><br /> Jennifer did a great job of delivering her first CD.  I really don't think this CD is for everyone, but it sure is nice.  4 Stars<br /><br />Mikeish's Top 5<br /><br />1. No Me Ames<br /><br />2. Shoul've Never<br /><br />3. Talk About Us<br /><br />4.

B0000WN0ZK|3.0|I am glad this is out on DVD.  Unfortunately, I don't think it has aged all that well.  Daring for its time, but a bit dated now.  In a surprise, there seemed to be a dust trail briefly in the movie, which I didn't expect.  Most will know the story, so I will comment on the commentary.  The commentary is more in the form of a lecture than a conversation or an insight. And perhaps that is fitting since it is done by a professor.  The commentary brings out some very interesting things about the movie.  Almost no one actually has a name in the movie.  There is actually very little music in the movie, and there are periods of long silence and while it seems to move slowly then, it is appropriate for the scene.  Some scenes unfold slowly, and the blow up photos are not from the perspective of the photographer, but of the movie maker.  The David Hemmnings character is actually quite cruel to the women in the film.  The scenes of drug use were daring for the mid sixties, but quaint now.  This is a very good film, but true classics do not age, and I feel this movie has.  For fans of good films, this is a DVD to get.  I would like to give this DVD more than three stars but feel I cannot.
B00005MP58|5.0|This has to be one of the best movies ever made.  It is the flawless version of a beloved classic.  Readers who love the book will love this movie because it remains faithful to not only the plot of but the mood of the story.  Also, the acting is excellant.  There is really no weak character. <br />Many people are turned off by how long it is, but it is not so bad.  Whenever I watch it, it seems that only a couple of hours have passed.  The time will fly by, it is that good. <br />Colin FIrth is the best part of the film.  He's never looked better in any movie and he is really a great actor.
B000053VAZ|5.0|The scene with Benny, June and Sam in the diner makes it worth buying this movie!   The roll-and-fork scene and plate juggling, shows that Depp is SO much more than a handsomely pretty face.
B000060MMI|4.0|This has become one of my favourite albums to listen to.  Seriously, if you haven't heard Flogging Molly, then you have really missed out.  I also got to see these guys in concert and it was pretty impressive.  They put on a really entertaining show.   <br />THey are not the best punk band ever but they are fun.  Everything is more fun with Flogging Molly. <br />Slainte!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Do your research! Do not confuse Moore's attempt to make money with an attempt to unearth the truth. This \\"documentary\\" does not live up to its title. Rather than being based on fact this victional spun film only supports the hatred that many Americans hold onto so tightly they'd lie about anything to get you to join in their hatred. I urge you- I challenge you to investigate for yourself the false guise of Michael Moore's so called \\"documentary.\\"  <br />
1400032717|5.0|You will enter into a different way of perceiving the world when you read this novel.  It gradually dawns on you that your narrator is significantly different from you, and the ways in which those differences manifest themselves multiply as you read, and culminate in a human and compelling resolution.  I can only think of a few books that have a comparable impact as the narrator takes you into, not just his worldview, but his cognitive limits/gifts: think of Lolita, perhaps, or even closer, Time's Arrow by Amis.<br /><br />You will be amazed at how much you start to care about this very odd fellow.
B000006TRV|4.0|I just read a review that blew my mind.  MODEST MOUSE IS NOTHING LIKE PINK FLOYD, save a few irrelevant comparisons such as nasal and cacophonous vocals and lyrics (a comparison I still think is invalid).  I'll admit that I have a severe hang-up with the level of megalomania that Waters infused into this recording but I generally believe \\"The Wall\\" is indeed a great album.  I give the rest of the band due credit for making a skeleton of great music that withstands the extreme burden of Water's ego which alone is far more than any rock enthusiast or band should stand for.  Gilmour, Wright, and Mason did an excellent job, and the fact that the backing music is great (and that ALL of Water's music in his solo work [lyrics not considered] is garbage) truly shows that Gilmour was the mastermind behind Floyd's sound more than Waters ever was or ever could be; The Wall proved for me that Waters was an extremely limited musician, which the rest of the band in interviews later confirmed.<br /><br />Whatever your opinion of this album may be, I think it's absolutely inadequate and disrespectful to compare the music of Modest Mouse to The Wall.  It's like comparing McDonalds to some $100 plate Las Vegas steak house.  I'm not saying this to place Pink Floyd on an untouchable pedestle;  \\"The Wall\\" in my opinion is definetely not their most robust work and is more of an icon than a representation of this band's sound (though their sound could vary greatly). Modest Mouse is nearly atonal, mildly arranged drivel; anyone who's managed to convince themselves of it's brilliance needs to take a step back and remember that making something sound unconventional means nothing if the final product sounds like crap.  I'm sure there are some people who think The Wall sounds like crap, but I would hope they would at least admit that it's very, very different on several fundamental levels.<br /><br />In essence, Modest Mouse will not have the lasting power Pink Floyd has.  The only band that might have such longevity in contemporary times is the often referred to Radiohead, and I still believe the two (PF and Radio) are very different bands at their core.  Indie poppy crap is the retro of tomorrow and that's about all the appeal it will have.  Pink Floyd is the kind of band that will be taken seriously for many, many years to come.ongevity in contemporary times is the often referred to Radiohead, and I still believe the two (PF and Radio) are very different bands at their core.

6305537321|3.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's <br />by: Philip Novak <br />Modern audiences might be more familiar with the hit song of ten years ago than the plot of this movie.  It's a love story, which does not become obvious until halfway through the movie.  The story moves slowly and the acting displays little emotion.  It may have been a good \\"chick flick\\" in its day, but easily loses to modern competition.   <br />Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, who is a cute, little toy for rich old men.  Holly makes a living doing this; however, doesn't prey on them as a gold digger.  Instead she is amused by the men and her relationship with them.  Paul Varjack is the male portion of this attempt at a love tale played by George Peppard.  He can be seen on re-runs of Banacek or The A-Team.  Younger viewers may not know him at all and especially not the striking boyish creature of his early days.  Paul is an author that has a wealthy decorator; however, he is really a sex-toy who is given a fancy apartment with all expenses paid. <br />The description of Paul's true employment is so subtle it could almost be missed and the portrayal of Holly as a party girl is quite benign, as well.  Modern movies are blatant with the description of sexual subjects leaving no doubts in the viewers mind about what situations they are witnessing.  Older films lack that feature.  In today's Hollywood sex is the big seller and the hush-hush whisperings of yesteryear are preserved in movies like this.  It makes this movie mostly \\"G rated,\\" except for a few cocktails and cigarettes which, with current translation means nothing.  The whole family could watch Breakfast at Tiffany's, but it's probably not a good idea.  Kids would be asleep in a half hour or bouncing off the walls from boredom. <br /> The colorful backdrop of Breakfast at Tiffany's is set in a surreal New York where the opening scene has Ms. Golightly on a sidewalk void of human life, staring into the window of Tiffany's jewelry store.  It shows pretty, clean streets and storefronts, but most of the story takes place in Paul and Holly's apartment building.  They have an odd Japanese neighbor that's lives above them and complains about their noisy parties.  It's clear that the film was made in a less politically correct day (1961) in which the Japanese were cast as bucktooth people with a perpetual squint behind dark circular glasses.  His small role of being awakened by the parties is a poor attempt at a comic relief and could make the modern politically correct viewer uncomfortable.  <br />The main characters meet one night when Holly escapes a drunken man in her apartment by going out the fire escape and into Paul's bedroom window.  They exchange pleasantries and after a drink and a smoke Holly hops into bed with Paul.  \\"Only as friends,\\" she says, and has to ask if they are friends.  To which Paul replies, \\"Yes, we are friends.\\"  That's an obvious reply since she's already in bed with him.  It's a strange set up for a love story to have two promiscuous people find each other in a promiscuous manner.  There's nothing in it to indicate that Holly and Paul are meant to be together.  The story suffers from a lack of crescendo from this point to the end scene. In other love stories there's usually a tragic twist during the climax of the story that precludes them from being together; a force that is out of their control.   The closest example of that is the rich South American that Holly is going to marry.  Crisis strikes and Holly is left in tears.  Her fianc can't cope and splits.  This leaves Paul with the pieces.  <br />This nears the end of the film and the approach to any decent acting.  They are in pursuit of Holly's fleeing rich guy when Paul spouts a few lines that are motivational yet still lacking serious emotion.  Holly cries, but for what reason is unclear.  Her weeping may have been concern about her lost cat rather than her desire for Paul.  When the closing kiss comes around, it doesn't feel like she really cares that she arrived in his arms.  She's happier to have found the cat. <br /> This is a love story that lacks love.  I'm a new age guy and will let a tear be released from the clutches of machismo, but this film did nothing in that department.  Holly is a cute character that anyone would love, but is never taken seriously.  This is reinforced by Paul's indifference toward the woman and a lack of chemistry between the actors.    It was fun to see the dress, phrases, and customs of an older time which gives a nice break from today's movies.  This is a good movie to see once for the vintage effect but as for the story, maybe Capote's novel tells it better. <br />
B000002JEV|5.0|This is one of the great live releases of any band in rock history. As often as I have heard Stairway to Heaven, this slightly rawer version is stunning and makes it a whole new listening experience - actually better than the classic studio version I think. Page smokes throughout the 2 discs. The only flaw is having 3 versions of Communication Breakdown on disk 1.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I have listened to De-Loused probably over a hundred times and every time it ceases to take me into an ulterior world of amazement and frenzy.  The guitar work is absolutely amazing and the pace of the music is unparalleled.  It goes from slow and melodical to upbeat, overbearing, and crazy.  The drum beats remind me of Led Zeppelin.  The symbolic meaning of the CD is absolutely incredible with it about a man in a comma after trying to kill himself, waking up, and still deciding to kill himself.  The dreamlike effects are incredible and a lot of the lyrics I have to look up the words to find a deeper, intellectual meaning in them.  Who else has that?  Nobody except The Mars Volta.  Except for possibly the Wall, no album is greater than this one.
B0002V7ODI|4.0|I watched this movie again and maybe I'm wrong but I didn't notice any difference in the feature itself compared to the feature in the 2 disc \\"special edition\\". I thought it was supposed to have \\"never before seen extended,unrated version of the film\\". If it's unrated why does the blue screen come on prior to the movie that says PG-13???<br /><br />True the directors cut is loaded w/ more extras due, however I did notice that the \\"from the den\\" thing was gone from this set(see the special ed.). I compared the two in the store and that's the only thing I noticed was missing. I did like the slim DVD cases included in this set. It's also supposed to be \\"remastered in high def\\" and I'll say it does look great on DVD.<br /><br />I wish they would've released a 3 disc director's cut on Superbit instead, maybe that's coming?
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Though I did not become a fan of the Alien Saga until the Sequel Aliens. The first Alien movie did not do it for me and was just to plain and boring. But in the Sequel aliens with the MArines and all the shooting, not to mention the aliens were a little more scary looking and more aggressive, not to mention there were about 1,000,000 of them compared to the one little alien in the first movie. Aliens 3 was okay not as good as Aliens 2 but it was not a bad flick, but again there was only one alien and no guns to combat it with. Aliens Ressurrection was darn good with the guns and the way how they explain Ripley's return when she died in th third film, lots of shooting and lots of aliens, but was not as good as Aliens 2 although it did come close to being as good as aliens 2. Overall Aliens Quadrilogy is a must get although I find the first alien film relatively boring, it still is a must get particulary just to complete the collection, but other than that the remaining three are excellent jaw dropping thrillers worth watching over and over again.
B000003TA4|5.0|I live in Canada...i don't get TRL or any of that crap so thank you for assuming that all Nirvana fans are braindead teenyboppers who like only \\"popular\\" stuff. I love music of all genres [yes even country and some rap]...from Kate Bush to Outkast and you know what? i have Nirvana to thank for that because their music opened my mind. I realized that there are better things out there than what the mass media shoves down our throats. I realized that i can like many different genres of music and not be devoted to only one. I love Nirvana because I chose to like them, not because some VJ on some network told me to.  i think for myself and you are a total idiot for sterotyping all Nivana fans. [for the record, i also love Metallica, Eric Clapton and the Beatles]. But what if i like, oh say...Avril Lavigne. Does that mean that i am only allowed to like TRL type stuff? does that mean that i hate all the classics from Led Zeppelin to Skynyrd? NO. if there is one thing i hope you learn it is that assuming such things based soly on vauge observations does not work. perhaps next time you'll think twice before being so close-minded.  <br /> <br />I gave this album 5 stars because it today is still a timeless peice of music. When you listen to a lot of music from the 80's it was so full of materialism and greed, this stuff was a breath of fresh air in a time when we most needed it. A kick in the ass, if you will. It may have been talked about too much, it might get overplayed....and people here post negative reviews about that, but have you ever stopped and listened to the album without thinking of all the hype? if you do that, you'll see it for what it really is: a good, solid album. My favorite track is Something in The Way, you cannot honestly listen to that without feeling something...it's so emotional. Sure the Nevermind sound paved the way for utter crap, but to blame the band for that is rediculous. Nirvana couldn't control what people would think and do with their music...they just put it out there. it is not their fault that crappy bands became influenced by them and to blame them for that and give this album a 1-star review based soly upon that fact is the most rediculous thing ever. Go give good charloote a bad review, don't blame Nirvana for it. So yeah...Listen to the music, not the hype.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore reinvents the pamphlet which is a genre that has widely been practised for centuries, but generally in writ (books or the press), and eventually on the radio. Michael Moore develops the genre by using the cinema as the medium carrying the pamphlet. He is able to use all possibilities offered by this medium : images, sounds, and even some special effects, but particularly elliptical editing that builds some striking and even shocking clashes between shots. This is very dynamic and effective to impress the public and to tune them to the discourse. Then he applies this mature technique to his subject to prove that George W. Bush is problematic as the President of the US for three reasons : his personality which seems to be shifting from one extreme to another and his obsession about Saddam Hussein ; the motivations and objectives of his team that seems to be aiming at only one target which is to strengthen the control of society by the state and its various agencies, and finally the dubious and non-transparent relations with the Saudis and the Ben Ladens, including his personal or family business relations with these. The objective of the documentary is to cast some doubt in the minds of the viewers about the facts and mottos that are ceaselessly repeated if not hammered in all media by all the members of this team of politicians. Finally the pamphlet insists on the very particular relations between the members of this team, first of all the President and the Vice President, with some private corporations that are making a tremendous amount of profit out of the Irak war. This is systematically contrasted with the very emotional interviews of some GIs and some parents of victims, both Iraki and American. All that makes a very strong pamphlet that will outlive the events it has been made for, the US presidential election in 2004, because of the great use of the cinema technology and techniques. A must if you want to build for yourself a personal opinion provided you cross this pamphlet with other sources of information.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUvided you cross this pamphlet with other sources of information. <br /> <br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU <br />
1558216847|4.0|This is the second book im reading about the WWII period (although this book doesnt take place specifically during WWII) and its truly amazing what people can do.  Sure, people think that he might be making things up because a. how does he remember all these things specifically? and b. how can a person really go that long without water?  Well, answering question a, if you go through something so life changing, its not going to just escape your memory.  Yeah, I agree that maybe he might be exaggerating the number of days he went without water in the Gobi, but a majority of this story really does have to be true.  As for the spotting of the Yeti, we just might never know....

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird <br />Harper Lee <br /> Scout remembered her father saying, \\"You never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.\\"  At the end of the novel she says, \\"Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.\\" To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic novel about growing up and the loss of childhood innocence.  One of the major themes of the novel revolves around the meaning of courage.  Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is growing up in the 1930's in a small Alabama town.  Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney.  Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors. A fire, a rabid dog and stories of Boo Radley fill the otherwise slow days of Scout, Jem and their friend, Dill.   The children are focused mostly on Boo and trying to catch a glimpse of him. Atticus is annoyed with their fascination with Boo, but finds himself in the middle of a rape trial which will challenge the soul of the town.  Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example. This is a powerful story of growing up.  It is easy to be drawn into the book as it explores the message of true courage and standing up for what you believe. I recommend this book to all. <br />BIBLIO: October 11, 1998, Warner Books; Reissue edition, Middle-High School, $ 6.99 <br />REVIEWER: Katie Gordon <br />FORMAT: Novel <br />ISBN: 0446310786 <br />
B0002MB7R6|4.0|The idea of this movie is called for.  The effects of twisters in Los Angeles, CA, and tidal wave then freeze in New York, NY are worth the views.  However the plot left me flat.  Wish it would have showed more cities than it did.  It did add a political, (if you will) statement of US citizens making tracks for the Mexican Border for normal warmth.
B000024D4R|5.0|Coming off of the warm spirits of 1975's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", Pink Floyd comes back with their strangest and darkest record in the classic Floyd era. \\"Animals\\" is a bit of a shock, due to the shift in mood and tone. The album cover and titles suggest that Roger Waters created an album that is very bleak and bitter, as that of the world view. David Gilmour's guitar playing dominates the rhythm of the album, with Richard Wright's keyboard setting the mood of the album.<br /><br />All the songs on \\"Animals\\" are long epic pieces of music. None of the songs have any hooks or melody, although it seems pretty accessible. The record moves along slowly, never drifting, and ultimately rewards you in the end. The guitar playing has a real blues-rock feel to it, as well as creating chillingly captivating soundscapes as well. \\"Dogs\\" carries the most weight out of the album's five songs, both lyrically and rhythmically. \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" and \\"Sheep\\" work well to keep the album's momentum flowing.<br /><br />This album is best suited for cult followers, not leaving much for causal listeners to find accessible, nor the radio. But \\"Animals\\" is one of Pink Floyd's best achievements, progressively speaking.
B000051YEG|5.0|According to Beck, this album is \\"one of the greatest marriages of rock band and orchestra...It's very cool and its dynamic is genius - there's this band that's completely rocking on this almost acid tangent, but they're buried in the mix with him (Gainsbourg) whispering on top, and he's the loudest thing on it.\\" The song \\"Paper Tiger\\" on Beck's Sea Change 2002 album is a fairly nice tribute to Melody Nelson. <br /> <br />A perfectly realized concept album, a sonically inventive poem of perversion, Melody Nelson was hailed by few critics of its time, failing to become a hit, even in France. Today we can better appreciate its magnitude, with disciples like Air, Beck and David Holmes successfully slipping the Serge sound into the musical mainstream.
B000002OX7|5.0|The first thing that caught my attention of The Who's \\"Who's Next\\" was the cover art. John and Keith were talking about Stanley Kubrick's film \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", and how the huge concrete blocks (in Sunderland, UK) resembled the alien monoliths in Kubrick's film. It was Pete's idea to urinate on the \\"monolith\\" (which were actually film cans filled with water). Pete remarked that it was knock against Kubrick for refusing to direct the movie \\"Tommy\\". The cover is definitely a classic and among the best of the 70s.<br /><br />Aside from \\"Live at Leeds,\\" \\"Who's Next\\" never sounded louder or more rocking than they do here, balanced by the ballads on the record, \\"The Song Is Over\\" and scathing \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". That is what makes \\"Who's Next\\" so great. There are high moments and low moments. It is filled with emotion, anger, sorrow, humor, regret and passion. Roger Daltrey has never sung better, John Entwistle whales unbelievable bass lines, all backed by Townshend's utterly captivating lyrics. The album feature's some of their best songs ever recorded, \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" \\"Bargain,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".<br /><br />\\"Who's Next\\" is what The Who is all about, not the rock opera's. It doesn't get much more classic than this.

Greg sounds harsh and mean, but when men play these games they play how come we do not get the picture they are the one's being harsh and mean?? Sometimes the obvious is not the obvious when we are in it. Because if that was the case then this book would not be a number seller. <br /> <br />Moreover, this book is soo good that I am going to write to the author's and thank them for such a wonderful book.  The bottom line is he and Liz puts things in \\"BLACK & WHITE\\" THE WRITING IS WRITTEN ON THE WALL with this book.  All the hidden secrets that men use as a power move is put out in the open.  Even the Christian or religious men still play these same games, and my self esteem has gone from 90% to 110%.  Because of GOD making the gift of writing possible, this man and women was able to shed a HUGE LIGHT on the situations.

B00005AFMT|5.0|In 1981, band leader Robert Fripp decided to assemble a new version of King Crimson. Fripp put together an album that progressive rockers and new wavers would equally enjoy. Needless to say, this album is way different from the \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" days, which one should expect. All the elements that made new wave rockers in the early 80s successful, were evident in full form on \\"Discipline\\". The pairing of Adrian Belew's futuristic guitar mixed with Fripp's textured rhythms work magically, creating groundbreaking sounds unlike anything you've ever heard.<br /><br />The quartet included bass wizard Tony Levin who's been around since the early 60s, ex-Yes drummer Bill Bruford, guitarist and vocalist \\"Adrian Belew\\", who also played with David Bowie, Frank Zappa and the Talking Heads; and of course Robert Fripp on guitar. Belew's vocals fit the mood and music perfectly, reminiscent of David Byrne (Talking Heads) at his most paranoid times. Some highlights include the crazy bass driven \\"Elephant Talk,\\" \\"Frame by Frame,\\" the heavy rocker \\"Indiscipline,\\" the atmospheric \\"The Sheltering Sky,\\" and of course the title track \\"Discipline\\".<br /><br />\\"Discipline\\" proves to be a truly unique gem in the world of progressive rock. It is considered to be their best album since \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" among many fans. I would have to say \\"Discipline\\" is their best.
B0002XDOBC|5.0|Released in 1967, \\"Disraeli Gears\\" was musically more advanced than Cream's debut \\"Fresh Cream\\" released a year earlier and in keeping with the times, very 60's psychedelic. The album was full of excellent songs and included the hits \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"Sunshine Of Your Love\\", \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\" as well as other superb cuts such as \\"Swlabr\\", \\"Outside Woman Blues\\", \\"Dance The Night Away\\", and \\"Take It Back\\". This deluxe edition of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" is a notch above the original cd release in that it includes both the stereo and mono versions of the cd (originally only available on Mobil Fidelity Sound Labs Ultra Disc II (a gold disc which is now a collector's piece). But you also get Out-takes such as \\"Lawdy Mama\\" (\\"Strange Brew\\" with different lyrics), \\"Blue Condition\\" (an alternate version never before available, with Eric Clapton doing the vocals) and demo versions of \\"We;re Going Wrong\\", \\"Hey Now Princess\\" (Clapton's guitar licks are amazing on this track), \\"Swlabr\\" (Jack Bruce's bass guitar really stands out on this track), \\"Weird Of Hermiston\\" and \\"The Clearout\\" (an instrumental jam). For those who never bought \\"Cream's BBC Sessions\\" cd, you'll get a sampling of how good the band sounded \\"live\\", raw and powerful is the best way to describe the band in concert. You get \\"Strange Brew\\", \\"Tales Of Brave Ulysses\\", \\"We're Going Wrong\\", \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", \\"Outside Women Blues\\", \\"Take It Back\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"Swlabr\\" and \\"Steppin' Out\\". The enclosed booklet is informative and also includes lots of photos of the band members. Casual Cream fans may want to stick with the less expensive single disc version of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" but for serious collectior's (like myself) this 2-cd \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is a must have. Highly Recommended!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Even though I enjoyed the Mummy (2 more than 1), I expected more than I got from this flick. The stars are capable and engaging.  <br />The dialog is a little over campy at times for a \\"serious\\" vampire movie, but on the whole moves along briskly if you ignore the fact that it is hopelessly modern for the 1887 setting. Likewise, the techno gadgetry is an engaging tip of the hat to the Bond flicks, but \\"nitro\\" glycerine had been invented long before this date, and we have a \\"gas powered crossbow (what's the string for?) with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of bolts without recharging. <br />It's obvious that the writer/director and producer love adventure movies, and the hero's hat to Indiana Jones. Jackson is a likeable and dashing action hero. The CGI is mostly very good, and most of the photography is excellent. BUT, some of the CGI is hopelessly over-the-top, especially the carriage chase and Dracula's castle, and chasms that dwarf the grand canyon. The most discouraging part of this movie are the holes in the plots that really disappoint. The hero doesn't remember his origins, but then his boss tells him that he will probably find his memory in Transylvania. (He doesn't.) There is a gratuitous Dr. Hyde, in the vein of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. There is the un-explained situation of how Van Helsing had originally killed Dracula (and I guess turned him into the un-dead), linked with that Dracula can only be killed by a werewolf (similar to Underworld). Why does Dracula want to take over the world through his offspring at all, when he's all hollow inside--no love, no joy, no remorse? Why does he tolerate his brides -- admittedly babes, but with dumb lines and terrible accents? Why does Dracula have a big Halloween costume party with a lot of other vampires at his \\"summer palace\\" in Budapest? Why, one wonders, do the brides of Dracula have breasts but no nipples--in any case, the vampire brood feed on blood? Why do their vampire progeny come out of \\"pods\\" (sort of like in the Alien)? What actually kills Anna at the end of the movie? Does she merely die because her family's mission is completed, and if so, how does this square with the fact that she and Dracula are in fact related? One suspects that Van Helsing 2 will clear all this up in the same way that Mummy 2 cleared up the holes in the plot of the Mummy--not at all.  <br />On the other hand, Frankenstein's monster is a truly great character in this movie, who deserved more screen time than the campy brides with their terrible accents. So the bottom line, this is fun to watch, but put your brain on hold. If you want to see something somewhat more satisfying plot-wise in the same vein, see League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. If you want to see a seriously well-made vampire movie, see Underworld. <br />The director/writer has real talent, BUT he should focus first on telling a good and consistent story.
0060516402|5.0|Collins and Porras' basic observation in this book, where they compare the practices of visionary to those of a matched set of good, though not great, companies,  is that average companies are driven by the power of \\"or:\\" You can have either short term profits OR long term growth, either stability OR progress. Visionary companies, on the contrary, embrace the power of \\"and:\\" You can preserve the core AND stimulate progress. <br /> <br />That said, the authors go on to describe how great companies build structures that embrace these often contradictory goals. The great companies Collins and Porras study, contrary to popular belief, are not profit focused at their core. Instead, they are `value' focused. These values are a sort of nucleus, around which leaders in visionary companies grow the company.  <br /> <br />And that is not the only difference between visionary companies and the more average comparison companies. The visionary companies surveyed consistently produced leaders steeped in the company's ideology. These home grown leaders are the result of deliberate corporate design, an orientation to corporate structure that the authors call \\"clock building instead of time telling.\\" In short, among the final products of visionary companies are competent leaders that carry on the core. And once developed, these leaders are then encouraged to experiment boldly, keeping only what works (i.e. what is effective and in alignment with the core). <br /> <br />A very entertaining book, it is among the best, easiest to follow guide to strategy imaginable. I also like the fact that it addresses not only macro level concerns, but also provides guidelines to help folks like me, stuck in middle management positions, apply these concepts. It is well written, the case studies compelling, and I like being able to follow the authors' research methods in the appendices. It is this thorough research which raises the book several notches above the now-classic \\"In Search of Excellence.\\"<br />
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Wiseman very capably directed this film, based on a good script with some intriguing twists on the legends of vampires and werewolves. First of all, this is a great DVD from a picture and surround sound viewpoint, allowing you to enjoy the great special effects, stunts, and delightfully gloom sets. Seeing the Widescreen really made it more impressive than a first viewing on satellite TV. Some of the stunts (and costumes) will remind you of the Matrix. <br />The plot moves quickly and tells a old story with some really enjoyable and intriguing twists on vampires and werewolves. The story is suspensful, as you work to figure out who is good and bad, but the twists are also logical which makes them all the more fun. There is some mild gore and a good bit of nicely stylized violence, but the violence never overwhelms the action and the acting nor does it seem overdone or gratuitous. Overall, I thought this was a good blend of action, horror and suspense. My wife and I have shown it several times to friends, and we enjoy it more and see more details each time we see it. We really hope that a sequel does appear, because this movie was a lot of fun. If you love well-done action or horror movies, but want a thoughtful plot and good acting, you should enjoy this combination of good actors and direction, with crisp editing to keep the story rolling and you on the edge of your seats.
0071373586|5.0|Wow. I never thought that a twenty year old book in marketing, a field which ages rapidly, could maintain its relevance. After all, if we were nearly drowning in sea of information in the 80's, we are in riding a tidal wave in the midst of a hurricane, hanging on for dear life now. But this book is probably even more relevant now than it was then. <br /> <br />The basic tenant of this short, easy to read but brilliant book is straight forward enough: to be noticed in an over-communicated society, a brand must firmly hold a place (position) in a consumer's mind. Sure, that is relatively easy if you are #1 in a field. After all, Kleenex becomes generic for tissue, Kotex for tampons. But, if you cannot be there first, look for a `hole,' a niche not exploited by the market leader. As in strategy, it is easier to hit superior forces where they're not instead of head on. Think of Dell. Instead of fighting HP and Compaq for shelf space in Best Buys and Circuit City, it went whole-hog into direct sales. Now, it holds that niche pretty firmly. <br /> <br />However, the authors warn against a positioned brand diluting a clear `value position' by meaningless line extensions. That has been the demise of many brands, and the authors point out several. <br /> <br />Lastly, I like the fact that the authors also turn the ideas on themselves a little, and insert a chapter on positioning yourself. Sound career advice. Keep your brand positioned: strong, pure, and undiluted. This will definitely help you (and me!) manage our careers. <br />
B00008H2LB|4.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting that much from Linkin Park over the years, from the little I previously glimpsed/heard on TV and the radio. On the surface, they seemed like any other nu-metal act : All crunch with no lasting taste.<br /><br />But after seeing the ingenius video from their ReAnimation remix album, I was intrigued. I started to listen to them closer and heard bits of things I liked. And then during the summer of 2004, \\"Breaking The Habit\\" was released as a single, and I was blown away by how good it looked and sounded. The band seemed to be taking a chance with their sound and presentation. So, I purchased Hybrid Theory. A good, solid effort. A couple of months later, I shelled out for Meteora, and was taken even further into a complex musical world...<br /><br />Although there are a few filler songs on the album, on the whole, it's damn good. And this is coming from someone who doesn't like very much modern rock, preferring 70's and 80's classic rock.<br /><br />If you couldn't tell already, I think \\"Breaking The Habit\\" is a modern classic, and the lyrics are pretty edgy for a single, dealing with suicide and depression. The lyrics leave it up to the listener to decide how the song resolves everything. The song bubbles with a repeating, eerie keyboard and piano sound, while a real orchestra builds and builds to the climax.<br /><br />\\"Easier To Run\\" is another classic, and once again is outside the realm of a \\"typical\\" LP song, with strong keyboards combined with a melodic vocal delivery and sustained guitars, which results in a very power ballad feel.<br /><br />It seems like many people don't care for \\"Nobody's Listening\\", but I feel that this is one of the best tracks on the album, specifically *because* of the unique sampling of a Japanese flute. Very interesting track, and yet another experiment -- that pays off -- on LP's behalf.<br /><br />The other tracks are all pretty good, but I think I covered my personal highlights. ( I also dig \\"Session\\", another good LP instrumental ala \\"Cure For The Itch\\" on Hybrid Theory. )<br /><br />Meteora's cover artwork is pretty good ( and makes more sense once you watch the making-of documentary on your CD-ROM ), but I feel it's a bit anticlimactic compared to the interior artwork, and especially the quality of the music and the thought that went behind the whole project. ( By the way, I was admittedly surprised and impressed with how deep each of the band members are, both musically, artistically, and lyrically. This is definetly a group of guys who can only go higher. )<br /><br />Among the best albums of 2003.

B00008PW3O|3.0|A lot of ardent reviewers are hailing this as \\"a return to form\\" or even \\"one of their best\\" but that's simply not true unless you are referring to the post-1987 Fleetwood Mac. I'm a Fleetwood Mac fan from waaaayyyy back in the very early 1970s and consider Lindsey Buckingham, along with Mike Nesmith, an outstanding musician. I would also agree that much of Stevie Nicks' solo output in the 1980s was often superb, so I've established my credentials as \\"a hardcore fan\\" - hell, I bought Mick's early solo album \\"The Visitor\\" and STILL play it occasionally. But this album, after constant playing since its release, appears to suffer from being what people \\"think\\" Fleetwood Mac should sound like. Some of the tracks are undeniably good...but not excellent and, while one could usually pick up a Fleetwood Mac album pre-1987 and be guaranteed that almost all of it would be good, this has a number of tracks where Nicks especially seems to be \\"phoning it in\\" and where Buckingham's contribution is far less passionate and vivid than other work. It's been, dare I say it in light of earlier Dashut/Buckingham work, over-engineered and over-produced. It sounds, for all the world, as though it's been put together by a committee of music historians rather than musicians. It sounds CLICHED. As if someone has put together every Fleetwood Mac riff and hook from earlier material and assembled a paint by numbers Fleetwood Mac album. Prior to its release, I replayed constantly over several months all of the Fleetwood Mac team and solo material I own (not a lot of post-1987 stuff in there) and this album AS A WHOLE just doesn't stand up to comparison with that material. There ARE several good tracks, but it doesn't hang together as a good album overall and I suspect that the rapturous reception is very much due to the fact the there has been a lot of poor music released as 'Fleetwood Mac\\" since 1987. I hope that the forthcoming solo release by Buckingham doesn't have the same problems.
B00000DLVA|5.0|This album kicks so much [explicit content] it should not be legal... and yet it is. Awsome, period.
0449227421|5.0|Another good read from the master. <br /> <br />Ken Follett weaves in alot of twists and turns with good action and a really great plot.  You love to love the protagonists and love to hate the villains.   <br /> <br />What I liked about this book, and with most of Follett's books is that there's never an absolute good and bad. Everyone has their motivations for doing what they do and it makes everyone more beleivable.  I like that his characters are fallible just like real people and try to do the best they can. <br /> <br />Scandals, mergers, genetic engineering, action...great book. couldn't turn the pages fast enough.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|It's a shame how quickly this album was cast off into the \\"old timers cashing-in\\" bin. Of course, it isn't like the stuff they released so many years ago because like us, they have GROWN and changed. It is reflected in their current sound and lyrics, but more importantly so is their undeniable chemistry. <br />Behind Fleetwood and McVie's always dependable back like, Nicks and Buckigham take advantage of the spotlight that now only the two of them share. It is clear they had solo projects in mind and conformed a bit for this album, but who cares and why is that such a horrible thing to do? They added to eachother's material and harmonized just like they used to, and in many people's opinions, that is what makes them shine...when theyr'e performing together. <br />Stevie's lyrical content is as always, enigmatic and powerful. Her obvious refrences to Lindsey in many tracks such as \\"Thrown Down\\" always spark curiosity and warrent another listen. Anyone who knows what she has been through will appreciate and admire her more \\"worn\\" voice...it is what makes her even more incredible. Illume is a highlight for me, because of the tribal sound and lyrical content about 9/11. <br />As usual, Buckingham adds his \\"not the mainstream\\" sound on tracks like \\"Murrow\\" and \\"come\\", but again is what makes the album more than a \\"run through the motions\\" for them, and illustates the time put into it. (see \\"Desinty Rules\\" doc to see how much time and effort they REALLY did put into this album) <br /> <br />Look deeper into the dynamics and sparking chemistry that the band still has, and take this album for what it is: a miracle that shines if it is given the chance.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I feel like an idiot, but is THIS going to be considered the \\"Platinum Edition\\" for this movie? I realize they're only doing the 10 top grossing, but that 4 more were added. I just ordered this today, I can't wait to watch it with my daughter. I LOVED this movie growing up, and Dumbo, Pinocchio, Cinderella, Snow White, Babmbi, ie- the TRUE CLASSICS! Lets also not forget this is the LAST movie Walt himself worked on. The end of the era where movies were made only with the thought of the movie, and not all the merchandise you can get kids to beg for.   <br />I don't think there's much more they could add to this. I can't wait to try to find Beauty and the Beast: PE and get Snow White: PE when finances allow. :)

0783225733|5.0|Ron Howard's flag-waving, spirit-boosting APOLLO 13 is a very well done and convincing movie.  Relying on the intensity of the real life dangers, Howard eschews overwhelming special effects or inappropriate sidebars.<br /><br />It's interesting to remember that in 1970, we had just come off of landing a man on the moon, so what could possibly overshadow that?  Indeed, in 1970, space travel was so mundane or 'unexciting' that when the astronauts gave a live broadcast from their capsule, the networks did not even run it; they said it wasn't dramatic enough.  However, when the crew and program became jeopardized, television couldn't get enough of it.  A prime example of the desensitized, ratings-craved television world.<br /><br />The performances are excellent throughout:  Tom Hanks gives his usual stalwart performance as Jim Lovell--the thing about Hanks is he makes his characters believable and displays a wide range of emotions, sometimes with just the look on his face:  Bill Paxton calms down a bit to play Haise, the more \\"cowboy\\" astronaut; and Kevin Bacon is good as the last minute addition to the crew when Gary Sinise is ousted because he was exposed to measles by one of the backup crew.  Sinise's disappointment is captured in his understated performance.  Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director, a man who keeps his cool and faith in the catastrophic conditions.  Kathleen Quinlan does well as Marilyn Lovell, Hanks' on screen wife, who bravely tries to get her family through the crisis.<br /><br />An intelligent script, special effects and Howard's assured direction combine to give us a heart pounding realistic view of the endangered space program.

B00005JMXX|5.0|Okay, nitpickers.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a slam-bang, special effects laden what if movie.  And on those merits, it's a darned effective movie.  When you rented or bought this movie, what exactly were you looking for?  If you want realistic, true to life stuff, go to the Discovery or Weather Channel.  This is fiction, people, and I for one didn't buy it to see any extraordinary acting or plotline.  I wanted to see the effects...hail as big as grapefruits; tornadoes ravaging Los Angeles; New York flooding and freezing.  That's why I bought this movie and was not the least bit disappointed.  Dennis Quaid, Sela Ward, Dash Mihok, Kenneth Welsh, Jake Glyenhaal, Emmy Rossum...they all did fine, because they knew the audience would root for them no matter how ridiculous their dialogue was.<br /><br />So sit back, eat some popcorn and just marvel at these state of the art effects in the best disaster movie in years!
B00005QIPH|4.0|Artists proclaimed as \\"the saviors (or future) or rock 'n roll\\" are usually not ones who create something entirely new or original (those things are called \\"fads\\" and die out quickly), but rather, they breathe new life into older sounds.  Examples: Bruce Springsteen took 50s and 60s pop, threw in the lyrical phrasings of Bob Dylan, and blew it up to epic proportions.  The Ramones played the same music in a style -- and with an attitude -- called punk.  Nirvana, finally, was the logical outcome of 70s punk and 80s alternative.<br /><br />The Strokes, who have surely been anointed by at least one priestly publication, are no exception.  By almost any measure, they do not bring anything new to the table of popular music.  Their sound is a combination of both ends of the punk spectrum -- proto-punk and new wave -- but is a bit too polished and not political enough to be punk itself.  Vocally, singer Julian Casablancas alternates between the monotonous drone of Lou Reed and the wailing of Iggy Pop.  Musically, the band sweetens the pot with the colorful musical flourishes of bands like Television, Magazine, The Feelies, and The Cars, with shaky, nervous rhythms, and staccato riffs galore.<br /><br />By demonstrating the vitality of rock 'n roll's past to younger listeners, The Strokes help ensure that it will have a future.  Since they are not actually that future themselves, they might correctly be called \\"the present of rock 'n roll.\\"  Hence, they are not a revolutionary force, but a revitalizing one, and every bit as important for it.  Until the next rock revolution, which I predict will occur around 2007, The Strokes help to hold us over with their debut CD, \\"Is This It.\\"<br /><br />(Why 2007? Well, 1977 - the annus mirabilis of punk - happened about 15 years after the first releases by The Beatles, The Stones, and Bob Dylan.  1992 - the miraculous year of grunge - happened 15 years after punk.  So do the math, and hold your horses for a few more years.)<br /><br />The Strokes' conflation of musical styles results in a sound that is equally edgy - thanks to the Feelies-esque rhythms - and accessible - thanks to the guitar hooks copped from The Cars' keyboards.  As for the lyrics, they are certainly not profound, but they are not amateur poetry either. In fact, they are neither amateurish nor poetic, but just really cool.  They tell the tales of the (mis)adventures of twenty-something New Yorkers in a pretty matter-of-fact manner.  Sure, they often sound celebratory, but coming from 5 guys who seem to know nothing but good times in the Big Apple, they even manage to sound a bit world weary at times.<br /><br />Since the CD's 36 minutes go by pretty quickly, it is arguable that the overall effect of \\"Is This It\\" is more important than the individual songs which, after one has listened to the CD, tend to blur together in the mind. But that is not to say that there are not some great songs here, as the overall effect would be nothing without them.  The Modern Age (featuring a dead-on Lou Reed impression), Barely Legal, Alone Together, Last Nite, and Trying Your Luck all sound like classics of the eras they borrow from.  Still, they will sound completely fresh to those who have never heard that music before, and will make those who have feel like they did when they first heard it.  The bottom line is that every song sounds like something any aspiring young band would be thrilled to come up with.  (Oh, and did I mention the very best song on the disc, Hard To Explain, on which everything that is great about this band comes together sublimely?)<br /><br />Now, there are those whose response to The Strokes will be largely influenced by the media hype surrounding the band.  Some will be hypnotized into loving it, others will just as mindlessly dismiss them as they do anything so enthusiastically endorsed by the press - mainstream and otherwise.  Both groups do themselves a major disservice.  This music can stand or fall on its own merits.  Still, it is unfortunate that music lovers can be so easily (and readily) influenced by the press. But media hype and really good (or really bad) music are not mutually exclusive.  So free you mind from the idea that they are, don't expect the second coming of rock 'n roll's Christ, and give \\"Is This It\\" a fair listen.  You will be rewarded handsomely.s can be so easily (and readily) influenced by the press. But media hype and really good (or really bad) music are not mutually exclusive.

B00003CXCT|5.0|Star Wars represented a landmark in motion picture history.  It was the beginning of the summer blockbuster, a film that catered to teens and younger.  It was the first film to have significant marketing tie-ins.  Modern Hollywood owes much to Star Wars, for better or for worse.  But the most extraordinary part about the original film is how well it stands up today.  It is the classic good vs. evil story about a boy and his friends overcoming enormous odds to rescue the girl and save the universe from destruction. <br /> <br />For my money, Star Wars (now subtitled \\"A New Hope\\") is the best of the three.  I can still remember how thrilling it was from when I first saw it.  The DVD version has the 1997 special edition \\"enhancement\\" - computer generated effects and characters.  The enhancements are well worth-while - they do not change the story and anyone who opines for the \\"good old days\\" ought to look back at the original effects in the Death Star Battle, which definitely benefits from the new effects. <br /> <br />The middle film, The Empire Strikes Back, is probably the best-made of the three.  The dialogue is better, the story is well-developed, and the effects are of contemporary quality (pretty amazing for a film released in 1980).  Return of the Jedi, the 3rd film, suffers mainly from the performances - the Leia/Han love affair is ponderous (as bad as Anakin/Padme in Ep. II) and Harrison Ford's portrayal gives you the sense that he would rather be making Indiana Jones movies instead.  However, it satisfactorily wraps up the series, and the Ewoks really aren't that bad! <br /> <br />This DVD set has a few new surprises, a couple of which are welcome from a continuity perspective (inserting Hayden Christiansen and Ian McDiarmid as Anakin and Palpatine in RotJ and TESB, respectively).  Unfortunately, the Emporer's new dialogue is at an Episode II level of lameness, but it's only a minute-long scene, so I can live with it.  As for the sound and picture, it's great to finally have these films on DVD!  They are very clear and crisp. <br /> <br />The extras are very good, although there are some curious omissions.  The two extras I would want to have most - cut scenes and a feature on the comparison between the original and the special edition would have been very welcome.  In fairness, we see parts of the cut scenes (Biggs, Camie, and Fixer making fun of Luke, for example) in the making-of feature and the still photos.  Likewise, the feature has some aspects on the difference between the old and new versions of the films, but nothing like what appeared on the Special Edition VHS set.  However, even the most dedicated Star Wars fan will learn a lot of new stuff watching the features, and the commentaries by Lucas, Burtt, et al. are generally entertaining and informative.

Si analizamos las canciones hay varias que son imprescindibles como \\"El cuarto de Tula\\", \\"Candela\\", \\"Dos Gardenias\\", \\"Veinte Aos\\", \\"Chan Chan\\" y paramos de contar. El resto son absolutamente descartables. En cuanto a los arreglos, hay algunos que son meritorios gracias a la genialidad de Juan de Marcos (ex-Sierra Maestra) y la participacin de cantantes y msicos de renombre. Pero no son todos los que debieron estar. Se dice mucho que BVSC fue un busqueda de las leyendas de la musica cubana para demostrar al mundo que seguia vigente. Bien, pero debieron buscar a los que si eran leyendas vigentes. Compay Segundo es historia milenaria de la musica; Pio Leyva hartamente conocido; Ruben Gonzales igual, Barbarito Torres, joven pero un musico excepcional. El resto hay que dudar. Puntillita Licea es uno ms. Quien pudo estar facilmente en su lugar fue el inmortal \\"Laito\\" Sureda, musicalmente cien veces mejor que Puntillita (RIP)Laito murio el 2001, tras grabar un disco lamentablemente desconcoido pero con unos boleros terribles. Vamos, Ibrahim Ferrer ser bueno pero mejores son dos tipos que siguen vigentes y haciendo bailar al mundo: Reynaldo Creagh y Reynaldo Hierrezuelo ambos en la Vieja Trova Santiaguera, proyecto musical valido y mas sincero que BVSC. Omara Portuondo, buena voz pero sin compararse con la impresionate Graciela Grillo (voz de la orquesta de Machito, al estilo de Olga Guillot y La Lupe), aun vigente a los 80 aos. Estos si son leyendas de la musica cubana. Y que diablos hace tocando esa guitarra horrible Ry Cooder? Debio quedarse solo como productor. <br />BVSC es un negocio, muy bueno, si no veamos como cada vocalista saco su propio disco y ninguno de ellos alcanza las 4 estrellas, regulares e incluso algunos son mediocres. Ya pues los viejitos hicieron plata y pueden descansar en paz, dejennos con los viejos temas y las leyendas cubanas de verdad.
B00005JMH2|4.0|Richard Gere stars as John Clark, a weary, happily married but bored man who notices a beautiful woman in the window of a dance studio, and before he knows it, he's taking ballroom dance lessons.  John overcomes his initial awkwardness on the dance floor and soon finds great pleasure in dancing as well as the new friendships he makes there.<br /><br />This lightweight bit of escapism is a treat for fans of Richard Gere, who never looked better.  His everyman character is unremarkable in every way, which makes the dramatic dance numbers even more enjoyable.  Susan Sarandon is the wife who is too busy to notice the spark is long-gone.  The beautiful Lopez gives a low-key performance (the script disappoints in the romance department), dancing up a storm.<br /><br />\\"Shall We Dance?\\" is a simple story of ordinary people who find joy on the dance floor.  It's very pleasant and immediately forgettable, but would be of special interest to fans of ballroom dancing.<br /><br />Kona
B00005JNEI|5.0|First to make things clear, I am a registered Democrat.  I voted for Al Gore in the last Presidential election.  I am a member of the Metropolitan Community Church.  I am gay, and have been in a strong monogamous relationship for well over a decade.  I was working in the World Trade Center, North Tower, on the morning of 9/11/01.  I served with the USMC in Iraq, and I am now a disabled veteran due to the war. <br /> <br />But as a survivor of 9/11 and being a proud veteran (and a proud gay liberal), I was sickened by this movie.  I have done my homework, and find very little of this film to be truthful.  As a democrat I am embarassed by Michael Moore, a fellow \\"liberal\\".  I am sickened by my political party, the Democratic Party, for pandering to this man.  Especially during our political convention in Boston (I was a delegate, and saw him first hand). <br />I am also sick of the pandering of John Kerry (no relation to me, as far as I know), to Michael Moore. <br /> <br />Hitler and Stalin could not have come up with a better propoganda film.  It has more lies than any propoganda films from NAZI Germany and Soviet Russia.  I just took my time to check the facts.  I was really wanting to see this film when I heard about it and I saw it the first day it was in the theatre.  I was a fan of Michael Moore until I saw this film with my own two eyes. <br /> <br />I believe that if one is going to complain about its government, that one has to vote.  If you are of voting age, and you do not vote, you have no right to complain about our government. <br /> <br />I am still a Democrat, I have proudly served my country, I was disabled in the war that began with the collapse of the World Trade Center where I could have died (I got out about 90 seconds before the tower collapsed).  I voted for Clinton and for Gore. I am an active \\"first generation\\" Christian (I was raised a conservative Jew and I am now very active in my local Metropolitan Community Church, which is gay friendlyand gay pastored).  But this film and the behavior and pandoring of my party's candidate for propogandists such as Michael Moore and this film... I am sorry that I have no choice to vote for a man that may be for an amendment to prevent my husband and I from being recognized as a married couple (since we are both male), and who is too conservative to me.  But between the two candidates, at least I know where President Bush stands.  I never thought I would EVER vote for a Republican, but this film and John Kerry's rhetoric has shown me that I can not trust my own party during this election.  But, I can not vote for a candidate that panders to such a liar as Michael Moore, during this election.  At least I know where President Bush stands. <br /> <br />Michael R. Kerry (Democrat, Disabled Iraqi War Vet, Married Gay Male, WTC Survivor, proud Jewish Christian, and very sad of how those I have trusted so much politically have betrayed me).

B00012QM8G|5.0|Oskar Schindler was a maverick Sudeten German industrialist, who put his life and livelihood on the line to save 6,000 Jews from the Nazi death machine.<br /><br />This is his story, but not his story alone. It is also the story of the 6 million Jews who perished in Hitler's holocaust, and the 6 000 who where saved by Oscar Schindler.<br />The movie is masterfully portrayed, and was indeed true to the book by Thomas Keneally.<br />It is three harrowing hours about the unspeakable horrors visited upon the Jewish men, women and children who Hitler and his Nazi Party had decided had to die.<br />The images that take place in the movie will stay in your mind forever.<br /><br />The antagonist to the compassion of Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is the sadistic monster, the SS Commandant Amon Goeth. Schindler and Goeth are both members of the Nazi Party in high standing, who mixes in the same circles, and both make splash at the debauched Nazi parties held at Goethe's villa. But their reaction to the merciless slaughter is diametrically opposed. It brings out the man of compassion in Schindler, and the psychopathic demon in Goeth.<br />During the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, we see even the difference in their mistresses. After Schindler and his mistress Ingrid have gone for a morning ride, they observe from a hilltop the horrors the SS are visiting among the Jewish population of the Warsaw ghetto. And Ingrid visibly upset says \\" Oscar, let's get out of here\\"<br /><br />Goeth on the other hand is taking pot-shots at the Jews on the streets below with his hunting rifle. His mistress Majola, simply sighs and says `Amon, you are such a dammn child.' irritated that she has been woken by the gunshots, and that she is not receiving Goeth's attention, but completely cold to the slaughter going on around her.<br /><br />But two scenes stood out most in my mind.<br /><br />That of as beautiful Jewish girl child, of about four  years of age, in a bright red jacket, which is the only colour plate in the black and white movie. Schindler observes this angelic child making her way through the crowds of Jews who are being herded out the ghetto by the Nazis. We see the little girl hiding under a bed, terrified, and that is the last time we see her, before we see later in the movie, her mangled little body, being wheeled to the crematorium on a trolley, identified by her red jacket.<br /><br />The story of the little girl in red made me think of another child. A beautiful and vivacious child, who was murdered 60 years later by Arafatian terrorists at Adura in Judea, as she hid terrified under her parent's bed-Danielle Shefi.<br /><br />G-D bless the lovely souls of the angels - the little girl in red who died at Auschwitz, and of Danielle Shefi, who died at Adura. .  G-D bless the souls of all Jewish children murdered by the enemies of the Jews and of Israel.<br /><br />The other scene that brought tears to my eyes, was at the end of the movie where the Schindlerjuden march in the direction of Israel singing a hauntingly beautiful rendition of Yerushalayem Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold), before we see the Schindlerjuden and their children and grandchildren, in real life, placing stones on the grave of Oscar Schindler at the Christian cemetery in Jerusalem.<br /><br />This movie must be shown to all high school students, so that they can be equipped to answer so many questions that are thrown at us today: Why did the Jews not rise up? , Why did the Nazis do what they did? Why did the people of Europe allow it to happen? Why do we need the State of Israel?<br /><br />We are living through a time when the same hatreds are rising again. Hatred of Israel is the new form of anti-Semitism that has shown it's hideous face again. I look at the scene, near the beginning of the movie, where the Jews are being herded into the ghettoes , and a young Polish girl of about 11, is shouting `You bad Jews, you bad Jews'.<br />And I think of all the anti-Israel demonstrations taking place today, where the same voices of hate, and bloodlust are being raised.d.

B000002UQJ|4.0|It's true that this 1993 album came at what could be considered McCartney's commercial nadir:  I remember reading somewhere that '97's Flaming Pie sold more than his previous three or four albums combined (take this stat with a grain of salt). Plus, much has been made out of Paul's \\"rejuvination\\" after the Beatles Anthology project.  All of this may be true, but OTG is miles above many of Paul's other albums in terms of melody, inspiration and pure listenability.  The centerpiece is \\"Hope of Deliverance,\\" one my all-time favorite Macca tunes.  Most of the songs qualify, at worst, as pleasantly catchy.  As with any album, there are other assorted peaks (\\"Mistress & Maid\\" and \\"Peace in the Neighborhood\\"), valleys (mainly lyrical:  the words to \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" and \\"Golden Earth Girl\\"), and all points in between.  In retrospect, this album represents Paul at his most relaxed and domesticated, focusing mainly on ecological issues and the benefits of love and family.  It's worthy to note that two of the best songs on \\"Flaming Pie\\" (the acoustic \\"Great Day\\" and \\"Calico Skies\\") were actually recorded during the OTG period but deemed to \\"solo\\"-ish for a band-based album.  They both exude peace and optimism and would have fit in perfectly!
B00005JMXX|3.0|I recently saw this film for the first time on DVD and really enjoyed it. I even considered buying a copy of the movie, but have decided against it at this time for a couple of reasons: <br />1. Judging by the extras being offered (which weren't many), I can't help but think there will be a `special edition' somewhere down the line. After reading what is going to be included on the European DVD release, I definitely believe they will do another edition somewhere down the line. From what I read, the two-disc European edition will include A LOT of behind-the-scenes documentaries and featurettes detailing the movie's production and special effects as well as a storyboard gallery and a concept art gallery. Apparently this release will also include over 10 deleted scenes as opposed to the two on the current U.S. release. There is also a feature on the scoring of the movie with composer Harald Kloser. There will a section of the science and politics of some of the themes presented in the movie. There is also a section with artistic impressions of how a number of cities around the world would look if they were caught up in the climate changes presented in the movie. THESE ARE THE KIND OF EXTRAS I WOULD WANT IF I WAS GOING TO BUY THIS MOVIE ON DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />2. Throughout the commentaries, Roland Emmerich and many people involved with this film talked about shots they wanted that didn't make it into the film because effects shots were not able to be completed on time. If this movie makes the kind of money I think it will on DVD, I hope Fox will offer Emmerich some money to finish some of those shots and create a `director's cut' of this movie. Hey, Emmerich did so with STARGATE and INDEPENDENCE DAY which I thought made them better movies, why can't he do it with this one? <br />I think I will hold off buying this movie until a `special edition' comes out. I will only buy it when it does. <br />  <br />
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Three versions of the movie, all on separate discs. That's right, three. Three commentary tracks, biographies, documentaries, everything, everything, everything. George Romero's assault on consumerism (with killer zombie slayings) is chock full of all the extras you could ever want. The European version is leaner, more urgent, with entire scenes cut out and new ones filled in. The extended edition is gorier, but drags a little more. The theatrical version is the theatrical version, which is awesome. The price tag's high for the Ultimate Edition if you're not a fan of the movie, but if you are, this is a must-have.

068987474X|1.0|As a human behavior expert and therapist I believe this book \\"He's just not that into you\\" is damning to men, disempowering to women and destructive to relationships.  <br />  <br />The premise of the book is that whatever is wrong in your relationship with your boyfriend, the cause is he is simply not that interested in you and you need to move on. The authors claim that if he's not calling you, keeping his word, committing to you, having regular sex with you, then he doesn't love you. This book \\"He's just not that into you\\" is taking people down the wrong path. Women are being fooled into thinking that they no longer need suffer to understand their boyfriend's weird behavior or make the relationship work, all they need do is dump him and find another guy. The danger is that this book now makes women helpless, powerless and dependent, It claims that if the man doesn't act exactly the way she wants and when she wants, he doesn't love her. The book undermines equality of the sexes and regresses us to a time when women were at the mercy of men, waiting for men to rescue, dominate and make decisions for them. <br />  <br />The book is damning to men because it expects men to be prince-charming and perfect by claiming he will move mountains and do anything for you if he truly wants you. The authors are reducing relationships to unrealistic black and white terms; to fairy-tales where the woman is number one 24/7, creating false expectations that no man can live up to. Clearly the authors do not understand the complexities of human emotions and relationships. They fail to take into account the various problems and hard work required by both sexes to make a relationship work. They fail to realize the greatest issue and challenge that faces almost all men -the fear of commitment. Simply loving a woman does not help a man to overcome the fear of commitment, when it is the love and intimacy that spurs the fear of commitment.And dumping him won't solve the problem of the malefear of commitment. When a man loves a woman, he still wrestles the demon of fear of commitment and intimacy, and he can only conquer it with her help. <br />  <br />--Patrick Wanis is an international speaker, certified therapist, Neuro-Linguistic Programming practitioner and hypnotist with degrees in communication and human behavior.

B00005JNEI|2.0|The reason why I feel that this movie should receive only 2 stars is because all of the groundbreaking facts exposing the Carlyle group and connections to the Bush family that Moore uses were in a documentary made by Alex Jones a year earlier called 9/11 road to tyranny.  Moore is a tool, right wing and left wing is horizontal thought.  Think vertical, think of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and the truth of what the government, and its fourth branch, the media, is telling you.  We are deciding between to candidates for President that are both skull and bones members, and from very wealthy families.  If you think that Fahrenheit 9/11 woke you up, you are still asleep my friend.  Moore is raking in millions for this movie, Alex Jones isn't, he put his movie out for free on the internet because he wanted people to know what's going on.  Go to [...] or [...] to see the truth.  Watch 9/11 in Plane Sight, it will change everything...
1401301010|5.0|AK's autobiography is uncensored, completely honest and without-a-doubt the best autobiography I have ever read. Of course it is co-authored, but all rock books are and AK's book still captures the heart and soul of his life while keeping you interested at every point. More than just a historical account of AK's life and RHCP, Scar Tissue is a glimpse at AK's own feelings and emotions about the rollercoaster that is his life.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This DVD  is brilliant; its a pity that the special edition had to be packaged separately at almost double the price and released a day later. <br />Great action, great actors, ... sensual to the max, and a totally brilliant piece. <br />The twist in this film is probably ( it seems ) a little too subtle for some, but its good enough for me ... adds a different aura to the Van Helsing mythos, and a good possibility of a sequel
B00008PW3Q|5.0|First, I must respond to the negative reviews that have little to say except that FM are \\"has-beens\\" and/or moaning & raving about the absent Christine McVie.  This CD stands on par with what should be expected of veteran performers.  Alas, most other groups with the incredible reputation of FM limit their releases to repackaged hits with maybe one new song; their creativity has apparently been tapped out.  \\"Say You Will\\" is FM UNLEASHED. Lindsey and Stevie's songwriting and performances are incredibly energetic & vital.  These songs are superb.  And for those who miss Christine McVie's contributions, please listen to her new solo release and you will quickly realize who needed whom.  Don't get me wrong, she is a music legend.  But nothing on her CD indicates an artist in their prime.  \\"Say You Will\\", however, shows a band in their PRIME, utilizing and building upon all of their talents & knowledge, challenging themselves to make great music.  If there were doubters, \\"Say You Will\\" proves that musicians can still create magical, amazing, and brilliant music in their 50s.  (Brian Wilson isn't the only one.)  This CD shows musicians who still care about & desire to make great music, not tow the line and ride some wave of nostalgia.  This is also a great example of why I seldom listen to radio, that inexplicably never, never play new music by artists over 40 (unless you are Sheryl Crow). In my book, these should have been top 10 hits: What's the World Coming To, Say You Will, Peacekeeper, Steal Your Heart Away, Bleed to Love Her, & Thrown Down. <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|*Lookout Spoilers Ahead* I love disaster movies, Twister, Deep Impact, Armageddon, all got just average reviews, but to the real people, the \\"customers\\", most of us liked them all. The Day After Tomorow falls into that category. The problem with this movie is that I wanted more. There were just too many loopholes, too many unanswered questions, and some logic issues that I didn't quite understand.     My issues with the movie are simple, they left you with too many unanswered questions and logic that left me bewildered? Fisrt of all, what year is this movie taking place? Present? 2009? 2030? Please tell me mister director?     Issue #1, What happened to the thousands of people who traveled from the library to find shelter? And speakin of shelter? Where did they think they would go in an ice age blizzard anyway? They didn't show much panic considering that 95% of the population of New York perished in the tidal wave. Aside from panic, we didn't see much remorse, tears, or sadness for the horrible events from anybody, they just seemed \\"to not mesh with the emotion that the audience was feeling with all the death that just occured. And don't the survivors have families? Aren't they concerned for their well being too? No mention of concern for that.    Issue #2: Perhaps a little more \\"heart\\" for everything would have made us care for the characters more. Although The story of Dennis Quaid searching for his son is touching to a point, it really had nothing to do with the large scale mayhem in the movie. Even more crazy, is the improbable fact that he actually found him within a short period of time. And this is during a developing ice age?  Once again, they need to keep you up to speed with the time gone by and where we're at during the film. But nonetheless, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out it would have taken weeks to find him in the aftermath of the storm.     Issue #3: The incredible sequence when the -150 degree drop at the library was so far fetched! Since when can you out run mother nature within inches? They turned it into a track and field race to see if they could beat the cold air to the library lobby?  And how are these people surviving with no water and food? With the -150 degree temperature outside, water, food, would be totally useless frozen up in ice. How did they survive? How can the penecillin they picked up on the ship be useful if it's frozen like a popcicle? I just needed more information for everybody's survival? And those mystery wolves? Did they make a fire to keep warm during the blizzard and end up chasing the characters after it was ok to go outside?     Issue #4: What exactly happened to the President of the United States and his boys? They made \\"one short\\" issue of it during the movie. Where is the President? \\"They didn't make it\\" the white house staff responds. Ok, so???--- they didn't make it? But why? Snow? Ice? Flood? Shot down my Iraqi soldiers? I just was left hanging! Maybe they will have a directors cut and explain everything.    With all the loopholes in logic,  I still enjoyed the movie, I just wish the creators would have explained things better and fixed some of the logic in the movie.     I guarantee though,  you're not going to be disappointed with the special effects, even the critics can't bash this to the ground, because the computer imagery is eerily realistic and will scare you out of your wits. Although after watching 9/11, I really was left with a chill seeing New York hit with a giant tidal wave and knowing the people who perished. Overall the acting is fine, Dennis Quaid is your typical \\"caring father\\" character. But a little more emotion and sadness by everyone would have had a bigger impact on movie goers. If you leave your expectations a bit low, you should really enjoy this \\"no brainer\\" movie.
0833524658|5.0|I remember purchasing this book many years ago when it had first come out and it was a ritual at our house to read before bedtime for my 2 girls & myself. I picked up the book that I had just purchased that day & began reading, one daughter on either side. They were about 5 yrs. & 2 yrs. at the time. I actually would get to a part & tear up. They noticed after a while that my voice was beginning to waver & my oldest looked at me. I contined on, although it was difficult. Even my husband who was sitting across the room kept looking at me. My younger daughter finally leaned way forward to see what was wrong & by then I was having to stop frequently to regain composure. We eventually got through it, but that memory will NEVER leave my mind. Nor my daughter's. For the next several days, that was one of the books they would bring to me to read. I think they were curious to see if I could read it yet, without falling apart!! I stumble across that book even now & it still does that to me. It is a VERY touching book!! I HIGHLY recommend it!!
B00006J3WH|2.0|I like Buffy. A lot. Joss Whedon is a wonderful, talented writer, and the musical gives him a chance to show off his skills. It's far from original--Whedon is cribbing from Sondheim and Bernstein and just about every other name in contemporary musical theatre. But that's not really a bad thing. This isn't Broadway. It's commercial television. By TV standards, it's quite good. And, given the time, budget, etc. Whedon might actually put out a real piece of musical brilliance someday--he's certainly off to a good start.  <br /> <br />HOWEVER, this CD is just bad. It's painful to listen to. It was nice having the actors sing their own parts during the actual episode. But, let's be honest: Anthony Stewart Head can sing reasonably well. Amber Benson has a surprisingly beautiful voice, and her song is by far my favorite. As for the rest of the cast--mondo points for effort--but they're nowhere near CD quality.  <br /> <br />Sarah Michelle Gellar just sounds untrained. Alyson Hannigan is, as usual, oh-so-cute in the episode, but she can't sing--not even a little. Even her few lines on the CD are headache inducing. The rest of the cast do their best. James Marsters does a good enough job but falls horribly flat on some lines (in all fairness, I think it has more to do with problems in Whedon's score that Marster's voice, but the result is bad regardless). As for Nicholas Brendan and Emma Caufield, they're fun, they're quirky, they're just not that good.  <br /> <br />Watch the episode again and again. Enjoy the extras on the DVD. Memorize the songs and sing them in the shower every morning. Just put the CD back on the shelf where it belongs.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|Interesting reviews. This and Hendrix's Band of Gypsys have been two of my if-I-was-alone-on-an-island favorites since the '70s. It sure ain't pop music, though. Love Santana, but he can frustrate fans by floating between esoteric (ILLUMINATIONS!) and pop (Supernatural.) At the end of the day, though, I consider this to be John's album. I think a good mix between pop and pyro (with John) can be found on Santana's \\"Welcome\\" album.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford), convicted of killing his wife Helen, on his way to be executed in Southern Illinois, has a lucky bus accident and escapes to a hospital. Enter Sam Gerard (Jones), who literally steals the show with his flip one-liners throughout the film: My my my...what a mess; We got a gopher; Richard, do you wanna get shot?!; S.o.b. our boy came home, etc. Gerard hounds Kimble ruthlessly all the way back home to Chicago. The scenes that stand out are the start of the chase, the tunnel standoff, the encounter at the hotel. Richard finds a one-armed man killed Helen and breaks into his apartment to find more dirt and encounters him on the el-train en route to confront the mastermind of the murder, his best friend Dr. Charles Nichols. A clever man, Richard eludes Sam and his lawmen by hiding out in child molester apt. and posing as an Hispanic janitor doing medical work. Clearly the best action movie of the 1990s, as excellent acting portrayals by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.
B0001I561E|4.0|I missed the movie when it was first released but purchased it in DVD format so my niece and I could watch it together.    We both thoroughly enjoyed it, another classic from Disney.  Robin Williams is tremendously talented and lending his voice to this character was a perfect match.
0800177363|5.0|\\"What's this?\\" Leonard says as he turns the radio dial.<br />\\"Rock music\\" Dr.Sayer tells him.<br /><br />Makes you wander if we appreciate the things we assume are suppose to (be, come out, or just happen) b/c that's the way it happens for everyone else. So if you don't really acknowledge that you appreciated what you had and unexpectedly lose that or those things, do you have the right to be angry at anyone or something for taking it away from you?<br /><br />This movie in a way; if you look at it at a different perspective than you would a normal movie makes you see that we take advantage of too many things and we could never in a million years make up all the (things) we have been too busy to say or have had the mind-set (that's the way it's suppose to be)
B0002SROT0|4.0|This album was hard to find because it has been sold out everywhere even though it was just released two days ago.  I have been listening to Elliott Smith since the beginning of this year and I love all of his albums.   <br />1. Either/Or <br />2. XO <br />3. Figure 8 <br />4. Elliott Smith <br />5. Roman Candle <br />I've only listened to From a Basement on the Hill for the third time as of now and it has a lot of eerie lyrics (considering this his posthumouos album) like \\"I couldn't prepare for death more than I already have\\" or something.  Suprising amount of good songs on the first half of the disc and overall, it invokes the same kind of haunting mood that only Either/Or really seems to get me in. There are more instruments instead of pre XO acoustic stuff.
B00011CZRE|5.0|I didn't watch Se7en until sometime last year. After watching it, I was amazed by it. I've never seen anything like it. A very disturbing thriller. I didn't have any clue as to how the movie would end. The whole time I was watching it, I didn't even leave my chair. My heart was just pounding. It just freaked me out. Not a lotta movie would do that. Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow give great performances. And the 'John Doe' killer... I won't say who plays him for some of those who haven't seen this movie, but, like his other movies, he gives one helluva great performance. Overall, this is definately a classic. And it's not for the squeamish.
B000062YAZ|4.0|This album is the pinical of thrash metal and would exceed Metallica's Master of Puppets if only it were more listener friendly, but hell we don't want that!!!  This album is faster, heavier, and nastier than anything Master of Puppets has to offer except vocally and lyrically, and that includes any metal album.  It's a shame to see people here giving this album poor reviews because they think slipnot is better, that their insturmentals are just \\"noise\\", and heaven forbid their lyrics are about satan and nazism.  Slipnot is complete s#!t!!!  It takes what 9 people to make the band sound half way decent.  Pretty sad when you figure Slayer has only 4 people in it.  Their instrumentals are amazing as well.  If they are as easy as people say they are how come there aren't more bands like them?  I mean if I could play that well I'd wanna show them up and prove that it is easy, but other metal bands aren't because they can't.  The only band I know of that comes close to Slayer is Kreator.  Also all the songs aren't the same speed as people would want you to think there are tempo changes my friend in the first song you can count several!!!  Anyways, Reign in Blood is an excellent album one of the best ever created.  I would like to also recommend Show No Mercy, South of Heaven, and Seasons in the Abyss.  The only negative about the band is Tom Araya isn't the best metal singer out there, but he fits Slayer perfectly!!!!
6305252572|5.0|This film is one of Eddie's funniest movies, Nolte was good also, they both carried the film all the way, what really took the cake was the alley fight scene, and another memorable scene was red neck bar scene. I'd say this is Eddie's second best, the first being Beverly Hills Cop.
6304196938|5.0|Some suspense movies you see just once, and once you know how it ends, never see it again.  Not so with \\"North by Northwest\\".  I have seen it countless times and know the whole script/lines (almost) by heart, yet I am sure I will see it again and again in the future.  This is the mark of a truly GREAT film. The action starts almost immediately as the bad guys page a Mr. Kaplan in the bar of the Plaza Hotel. Coincidentally, Cary Grant gets up from his table at the same time to make a phone call to his mother. He is escorted out by the bad guys who mistakenly think he is Mr. Kaplan, and the fun begins.  The action is non-stop until the end of the film, with the now famous scene atop Mt. Rushmore.  The scene where the crop duster ... oops, I don't want to give it away!    But even if I did, I'm sure you'd want to see this film over and over, just like me.  The cast is outstanding: Eva Marie Saint, Leo G. Carroll (perfectly droll in this role), Martin Landau in an early appearance, and of course, the menacing, but ever so sophisticated, bad guy, James Mason.  The two English accents in this film give it a special panache and international intrigueness (is that a word?), that just adds to the fun.  The script by Ernest Lehman and the sensationally suspenseful music by Bernard Hermann just add to the the edge of your seat suspense.    And last but not least, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, has definitely not directed a better film.  Cary Grant standing by the side of the road in his gray suit in the middle of the prairie is one of the great shots in film history.    If you haven't seen this one yet, you owe it to yourself to do so ASAP!!!
B00005QCVT|5.0|This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but most people won't like. In fact, there's not a lot to like, because the movie is about four likable people falling deep into desperation and despair. The dream mentioned in the title is the American Dream of making it, of having it all, of acheiving your goals. But these people, Harry and his mother Sara, Marion, and Tyrone, all try to acheive their goals in the most dangerous ways. Watching these four change into shadows of themselves is depressing. All said and done though, this is still one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I am not going to even bother getting in depth about the movie or offer an intense commentary about whether it is good or bad, there are enough varying opinions here to more than adequately cover that.  I purchased this DVD in Germany where it was released on the 17th of September, so this is a review of the DVD itself.   <br />The packaging of the DVD is quite nice, but nothing special.  The discs' menus are animated and very easy to navigate. There are several featurettes, \\"In the Heat of Battle\\"- an action scene analysis, \\"From Ruins to Reality\\" - a history behind the production design, \\"Troy, An Odyssey of Effects\\" - Special Effects featurette, \\"Gallery of the Gods\\" - A 3-D animated guide to Greek gods and myths, as well as a photo gallery and several trailers.   My personal favorite is the \\"Gallery of the Gods,\\" a animated guide of the major gods in Greek myth. Each God is given about a 4-5 min introduction and history which is very professionally done.   Most of the featurettes are interesting but they are simply to few, considering the producers were given an whole special features DVD to play with.  This is really too bad, because the special features that are on this DVD are actually quite well done, I suppose its quality over quantity (I would have prefered both). The Dolby 5.1 sound is very good, as would be expected, and the picture quality (in widescreen) is very sharp and vibrant.  No complaints there.  <br /> All in all, 4 stars for quality specials, but not 5 for lack of them.  My recommendation is, if you liked this movie the DVD is worth buying, but if you have not seen it yet, rent it first before spending twenty + dollars on it.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This movie is one of those \\"life altering\\" movies. No matter how old you get, you will always remember it and the affect it had on you. The dry humor and sarcasism between Quinn and Hooper are worth the price of admission alone. The deer in the headlights look by Chief Brody when he finally sees the shark while \\"chumming\\" is my favorite part! Up to this point he does not realize that he is on a waterborn Deathstar. The terror gets passed to another generation..
B00000JCB2|1.0|So bad,it's hardly worth talking about...spend your money on some talent (THE BEATLES,PINK FLOYD,LED ZEPP are a few bands that come to mind).
B00005221M|4.0|I usually don't go for war films.  I find them formulaic and often watched them with detached uninterest, rolling my eyes at the emotional moments.  I saw this movie against my better judgment, but really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Set during the French and Indian War, it tells the story of the fall of Fort William Henry.  Caught in the middle are General Munro's two daughters who joined their father at the fort.  They have traveled with Hawkeye, the white adopted son of Chingachgook, a Mohican.  As Hawkeye and Cora Munro begin to fall in love, they also find themselves in great danger because of the war.<br /><br />After a slow start, I think it was the romance that was able to draw me into the movie.  I was able to connect with those two characters and so actually cared about the outcome.  The acting is compelling, making it easy to care about all the characters, even the obligatory third side of the love triangle.  The ending is heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.  Cinematography is stunning.  I need to visit some of those spots.  And the historical setting is surprisingly realistic as well.  I liked seeing the colonist's perspective and how they were treated by the British.  I always enjoy seeing real events woven seamlessly into a fictitious story, and this movie puts the truth of the fall of Fort William Henry to very good use.<br /><br />While this movie hasn't changed my opinion of the genre overall, I am very glad I saw it and would be willing to see it again because of the compelling characters and beautiful scenery.
B000003C2U|5.0|Death is in my opinion the best deathmetal band in my opinion and i love chuck's blackmetal-ish type vocals with an amazing brutal sound and the most beautifull guitar solos to ever be created.

B00005JNEI|3.0|this documentary is of course biased to the left...but what if even 1% of its true? Of course, something of this scope and magnitude would be too difficult to contemplate,  pyschologically, by most personalities in America...most people need that assurance, that certainty of safety, that last bastion of being in control of something, which in their case is unmanageable...FEAR...but one needs only to study the Nixon years of the White House, particularly his second term, for a sobering reminder of the rampant and criminal abuse of power the executive branch of our government is capable of...covertly, without our knowledge...378 federal officials either found guilty or indicted  including the resignation of the commander-in-chief...our's is now a pre-emptive strategy aka \\"the Wolfowitz doctrine\\"...he says it himself...\\"i'm a war president\\"...\\"i've got war on my mind\\"...and all this from a former cheeleader who had a few strings pulled to avoid vietnam...and that's not to mention the rest of the \\"chickenhawks\\"...and finally this... <br /> <br />\\"Naturally the common people don't want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL THEM THEY ARE BEING ATTACKED, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

068987474X|3.0|I snagged a copy of the book after one week of hounding bookstores and calling daily to see if a new shipment had arrived. <br /> <br />Yes, the cold harsh truth hits women all across North America in the face like a cold washcloth in the early morning.  <br /> <br />Why does he treat us poorly? Cause he is just not into us. Why does he not call us? Cause he is just not into us. <br /> <br />True but all women chasing or dating or involved with men who are constantly ringing up their excuses tabs are not dumb either. <br /> <br />Women aren't stupid. I have on many occasion wound up in situations in the past with men that have in more ways than one made it quite clear that they were not into me in the way I cared for them. Yet I stuck out situations for the same reason these mens were not into me: loneliness, thinking I didn't deserve better or thinking this is the best I can get. <br /> <br />Rather than realizing that the best might be still out there. <br /> <br />Therefore, in this regard the book minimizes the role women play in perpetuating the behaviour of the type of men protrayed in the book. The women who love these guys and the guys who hang loosely with these women are opposite sides of the same coin. Both are staying together because they have issues with self esteem, self confidence and until they internally work things through ..the pattern repeats itself. <br /> <br />Imagine if every single women in North American no longer tolerated the disrespectful, wishy washy excuses of the type of men illustrated in this self help book? <br /> <br />We would have a mini-revolution of sorts. Sadly, the bulk of men in this book can easily attach themselves to other women willing to put up with their shinanigans and the legacy continues. <br /> <br />Women need to take some responsibility for avoiding getting mixed up with these men in the first place and getting out at the first sign that things are not reciprocal. <br /> <br />Lastly, it troubles me to hear themale author insists that it wasn't until he met his wife and realized she was *the one* that Greg decided to step up to the plate and play by new rules, rather than switching jersies mid-way in the game or bailing out altogether. <br /> <br />Can meeting the man or woman of your dreams make an adult do a complete 360 degree turn and turn a new leaf? <br /> <br />Change comes from within not from external forces. The impetus of change is not an external force. At least not permanent change in humans.  <br /> <br />That includes making a change for the better in seeking out and finding mutually respectful relationships with both genders.  <br /> <br />For example, men and women have heard for years that a high fat diet and smoking can kill you. Yet until most folks have a brush with a life threatening illness or health scare, no permanent lifestyle change occurs. <br /> <br />When the Just Not Into Guys decide that the novelty of living life in the excuses lane is no longer cutting it and making them happy I think they decide to cut ties and let go of their kite strings to soar in a new direction. <br /> <br />Would Greg have fallen for his wife if he had met her twelve years ago? Sounds to me like he did some maturing along the way and reevaluated his priorities including what it was he needed in his personal and emotional life.  <br /> <br />Same can be said for the women who love the Just Not Into Guys.  <br /> <br />When the women sitting in stale mate positions with men who don't appreciate them finally *get it* and an ephiphany comes over them \\"I'm wasting too much time and energy being into this guy who could care less if I was gone tomorrow\\", they too come up with new, healthier strategies that is a win win situation for them in the future. <br /> <br />Greg and Liz suggestions have merit but in some ways the book perpetuates an archaic mythology that the Prince is out there wating to meet his Princess and everyone will live happily ever after. <br /> <br />Greg found happiness because he finally wrote himself a happy ending that included being open to  loving himself and in turn falling in love with his now wife. <br /> <br />Liz in on the path. <br /> <br />It's not just finding *the one* as the book suggests for both sexes. It's being one with yourself first and being ready to experience oneness with all it's ups and downs when *the one* comes along! <br /> <br />
0790749815|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock has thrown sarcasm, comedy, irony, romance, suspense, and an ingenious series of unfortunate events into a can, shook it up, and successfully came out with something that isn't fertilizer.  Alfred Hitchcock's \\"North by Northwest\\" is one of the most clever movies I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.  Made in 1959, North by Northwest has yet to become out-dated.  It's full of action from start to finish, rivaling any modern movie. <br /> North by Northwest was truly ahead of its time.  Taking place in New York, Chicago, and South Dakota 1959, the movie is about Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) whom is mistaken for a government agent who falls between investigations of U.S. intelligence traders.  A series of unfortunate events causes Thornhill to be set up for murder.  Now on the run from spies, counterspies, and the police, Thornhill falls for the very lustful Eve Candle (played by Eva Marie Saint) who is very questionable as to what intentions she has in store for Thornhill.  The movie is full of elaborate schemes, twists, and surprises. <br /> Roger Thornhill is the depiction of what every adolescent boy wants to grow up to be: confident, cocky, fearless, and un-shaken, with witty sarcastic one-liners that are even recognized by his own mother.  Cary Grant plays the hero of the film perfectly.  Eva Marie Saint's character plays the very flirtatious spy very well and looks even better.  The acting is very impressive in this film.  They all find subtleties to bring out the character's personality.  All the characters are unique and bring an individual presence to the movie.   <br /> Adding to the actor's performances, the cinematography is also quite an advantage to make this movie great.  Most movie-goers are familiar with Alfred Hitchcock's style in camera angles, music, and the new features he brings to bring the full effect to life.  Comically, Hitchcock even put himself in the movie in the beginning shots of New York.  The musicis fantastic and elevates the suspense for specific scenes.  Although most action scenes include the ol' blue screen, they don't seem all that cheesy and do not take away from the effect the scene is to bring.     <br /> The movie has all the ingredients for a great action comedy.  The plot seems to come together so seamlessly that it appears almost ridiculous.  Ultimately the movie is quite brilliant to keep the audience on their feet and always second guessing.  A great script, great director, and wonderful acting have made this movie a must see.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys an action comedy.   <br />

B0002VL0KQ|4.0|For sure Celine has always been a sappy Artist but we grew to love her that way (175 million albums sold, hint-hint). So why should this album be different ? Well it is different, not from the \\"Old\\" 1990's celine but from the \\"I drove all Night\\" 2000's celine. As a fan I was getting tired of the cheap pop she had been doing and the a MIRACLE happened. This Album. 13 tracks all perfect and in there place. I still can't beleive how beautifull Miracle is ! The song itself is superbe. The only reason i am giving this album 4 stars is because of \\"If I Could\\", what a horrible song, it's just whines without end. The song is bad and Celine makes it worse by trying to give it life. <br />After listening to this track once , you skip it every time. <br />But...BUT ,,, Beautiful Boy is beautifull and \\"In Some Small Way\\" is my favorite song. Buy it because It will become a \\"Essential recording\\" <br />
006054094X|3.0|Menzies should be credited for proving and bringing to the mainstream public evidence that the Chinese during the early 1400s were the best sailors of the day and traveled to faraway places like Africa,India,Austrialia,and America before Columbus set sail toward America, and Portugal or Spain began the Age of Exploration. He proved his case with amazing evidence like Chinese junks discovered in California and highlighting the frizzle feathered fowl chicken that is native to Asia but strangly enough found in South America.The Chinese DNA evidence left me less convinced because of the simple fact that the people of early America were in fact Asians who crossed the Bering Strait, so the DNA does not come as a shock, it is like comparing DNA of people from England with the early American colonist of New York. Menzies approach is also not original. Twenty years before Menzies wrote his book an African-American scholar,Ivan Van Sertima wrote a book called They Came Before Columbus:The African Presence in America....he presented the same format as Menzies,linguistic,cartographic,artistic,botantical,and recorded evidence from conquistadors....I could be wrong but it seems like Menzies might have read the book, but fails to put the book in his bibliography which gives the impression that Menzies ideas are radical. I must say Menzies briefly mentions Van Sertimas name on his 1421 website.Another BIG mistake Menzies makes is falling into the same trap as the ethnocentrist that are Pro- Columbus,he seems to believe the Chinese were original in reaching America before Columbus.Strong evidence supports the arrival of the Vikings,Egyptian/Phoenicians,and West Africans to America before both Columbus and the Chinese...Menzies mentions none of this.Menzies also gives the laymen reader the wrong interpretation of the Piri Reis map, Chinese could not have mapped the Piri Reis map during the 1400s because Antartica on the Piri Reis map was shown when it was not covered with ice.The only time Antartica was not covered with ice was 4000 B.C, the Chinese were far removed from advanced ocean navigation until around 1400 A.D....the source of this map is Alexandria Egypt(probably mapped by Egyptians) though found in Turkey, the lay person reading for intertainment does not know this, nor is he told that the southern tip of Africa was routed before both Bartolomeu Dias and the Chinese,the first group to round the Cape were the Egyptians and Phoenicians led by the Pharoah Necho.The book is good and I support it in that it does shed light on Chinese accomplishments that predate the European age of Exploration, but if the reader wants to be more informed on the subject read Alexander von Wuthenau Unexpected Faces in Early America(rare book)Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings by Charles Hapgood(best source on Piri Reis map) and They Came Before Columbus by Ivan Van Sertima(basically 1421 before 1421)

B0002KVUKM|4.0|Alot of people have compared this film too the two Brenden Fraiser \\"Mummy\\" films. There are lot of similarities: They were all released to theatres in May, they all are re-workings of classic 30's-40's horror films and they are very entertaining. <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman trades in his Wolverine costume to portray the  mythical monster slayer, sponsered by a secret sect in the Vatican. This movie has some great special effects and action sequences; the DVD picture and sound are great (which makes up for the lousy picture and sound when I saw this film at my local theatre). <br /> <br />The DVD extras are'nt that interesting (they rarely are) but the film is worth buying.
B000001ELD|5.0|I LOVE this CD!! I love how diff'rent the songs are, I didn't wanna hear another \\"Deuce\\" or another \\"God of Thunder\\" 'cause if that would've been the case then WHY make a solo album?? I have nothing negative to say about this CD. The tracks are:     #1: \\"Radioactive\\" The intro is AWESOME, cool lyrics, Joe Perry of Aerosmith play's lead & it ROCKS! 5 stars.     #2: \\"Burnin' Up with Fever\\" Good song feauring the Disco Queen herself Donna Summer. 3 stars.     #3: \\"See You Tonite\\" Classic song, I play this one seems like everyday :) Gene's vocals and the music are PERFECT!! 5 stars.     #4: \\"Tunnel of Love\\" This song is good NOT great but it's still cool, I do like the Guitar solo. 3 stars.     #5: \\"True Confessions\\" Another great song, I love the lyrics & the Church Choir sounding towards the end. 5 stars.     #6: \\"Livin' in Sin\\" My least favorite song on Gene Simmons, it doesn't do anything for me. 2 stars.     #7: \\"Always Near You/Nowhere to Hide\\" Now this is MY favorite song from this CD. I love everything about this one, the lyrics, the music & Gene's voice at the end is just AWESOME!! 5 stars.     #8: \\"Man of 1,000 Faces\\" Great song and it's Gene's tribute to his hero Lon Chaney. This is another song I never get tired of. 4 stars.     #9: \\"Mr. Make Believe\\" Great song with powerful lyrics. Gene shines on this one. 5 stars.     10: \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" Remake of the same song from \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" but much better. I really like this version better than the original, it's faster and much more FUN! 5 stars.     11: \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" Good way to end this great CD. I like it, 3 stars.     I recommend getting Gene Simmons NOW!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|<br />MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD! <br /> <br />I am a 16-year old Star Warrior, and still living under the empire that is my parents, so I was amazed when my dad came home with the trilogy on DVD in hand (although, now that I think about it, that seems kinda' stupid, since Dad is a bigger sci-fi fanatic than I am). I immediately slipped in \\"IV - A New Hope\\", and now that I have seen the DVD's, and watched the Bonus Features, I'm ready to pass judgment. <br /> <br />First of all, I have to give George a lot of credit. Despite what almost everyone else says about the \\"new and improved\\" Star Wars: Special Editions, and the fact that George did not give us the option of watching the original films, I have to say that I enjoy the Special Editions MORE than the original films. Yes, maybe the infamous \\"Greedo Shoots First\\" scene was poorly edited, and yes, the Jabba the Hutt in \\"A New Hope\\" did look like crap. But the fact is, if you have already watched \\"Empire of Dreams\\", then you know that George Lucas did not feel as if his films were finished back in 1983, because technology had not caught up to his vision at the time. And now that it has, George should be allowed to make the changes he wants until he feels that the films have caught up to his original vision. After all, they are his movies. And now that I am done ranting, on to the reviews of the movies themselves. <br /> <br />In the years since 1997 and 2004, George has made even more changes to his movies, not only to bring his vision closer, but also to go with continuity from the soon-to-be Prequel Trilogy. Here is my review of the changes made. <br /> <br />--------- <br /> <br />EPISODE IV - A New Hope <br /> <br />Change 1: STILL THERE, BUT IMPROVED <br /> <br />As you all know, when the Special Editions came out, the most infamous change that was made was that in the confrontation between Greedo and Han Solo in the cantina, Greedo shot first, missed, and THEN got fried. As I said above, the scene WAS poorly edited, and it appears that George has listened to the thousands of screaming fans out there, and changed it. The scene has now been changed so that it looks like Greedo and Han both shot at nearly the same time, and Han's entire body now moves to avoid Greedo's blast, so that it no longer looks like Greedo was an incredibly horrible shot. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: B- <br /> <br />Change 2: HOW JABBA GOT HIS LOOK BACK <br /> <br />Another infamous addition to the Special Editions was that a new scene was added in which Jabba and Han are talking about Han's debt at Docking Bay 94. Let's face it. In the original Special Editions, Jabba looked like a piece of crap. George has also noticed this, apparently, and changed Jabba's look so that he looks more like his model in \\"Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\". This is a great change, as Jabba now looks a lot better, and his actions with Han look much smoother. But the scene is still a little boring, as most of the information from the Greedo scene is repeated. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: C <br /> <br />Change 3: FANTASY OVERHAUL <br /> <br />In the scene with Obi-Wan sneaking behind the power station, and shutting off the tractor beam, if you look very closely, you will see that the English print on the station has been changed to the writing of the Star Wars Universe, Aurabesh. This is a great change, as it brings more fantasy to the movie. The only <br />reason that I don't give this a perfect rating is because some <br />people may have a hard time reading it. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A <br /> <br />Other changes include longer hallways, and (strangely enough) \\"creative decisions\\" that make the sound fluctuate at times (which ain't good). <br /> <br />--------- <br /> <br />EPISODE V - The Empire Strikes Back <br /> <br />Change 1: PALPATINE'S GOT A BRAND NEW LOOK <br /> <br />In the scene where Vader is communicating through hologram with Emperor Palpatine, the actor who played Palpatine has been changed to Ian McDiarmid, the actor who plays him in ROTJ and the prequels. The dialog has also been slightly changed so that it appears that Vader never figured out that Luke was his son. I like the new actor, but I'm not a big fan of the dialog. It just doesn't seem right that Vader uses Luke's last name before this scene, and never figures out that they are related. Apparently though, this will be explained in Episode III, so I'll just have to wait and see how George explains it. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING (FOR NOW): B <br /> <br />Change 2: THE PREQUEL VOICE CHANGE <br /> <br />The voice actor for Boba Fett in this movie has been replaced by Temuera Morrison, the actor who played Jango Fett and the Clone Troopers in \\"Episode II: Attack of the Clones\\". This is another good change, as it makes sense that an unaltered clone of Jango should sound exactly like him in adulthood. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A+ <br /> <br />Change 3: NO MORE WUSSY! <br /> <br />The most infamous change in ESB was that when Luke fell down the huge catwalk room after Vader revealed the shocking truth, a scream was added. This was really bad, as it didn't make Luke's fall seem like suicide at all. Fortunately, this has been removed, and the scene is as it should be once more. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A+ <br /> <br />Other changes include bloopers that have been corrected. <br /> <br />--------- <br /> <br />EPISODE VI - Return of the Jedi <br /> <br />Change 1: SIGNS OF THE PAST <br /> <br />When Luke takes off Vader's mask at the end of the movie, the man under the mask has been changed slightly. His eye color has been changed, and his eyebrows are now gone. This makes sense, as someone who fell into a volcano wouldn't have eyebrows anyway. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A <br /> <br />Change 2: \\"WESA IN THE MOVIE!\\" <br /> <br />When the Special Editions came out, the ending celebration and music was replaced by a first shot of several planets celebrating the fall of Palpatine, including Coruscant, Tatooine, and Cloud City. The music was also changed from the Ewok theme, \\"Yub-Nub\\", to another song composed by John Williams with no words. Now, in this new DVD edition, a new planet has been added to the celebration: Naboo. And, if you listen closely, you can hear a certain Gungan yelling, \\"Wesa free!\\" Ring any bells? I like this change, as it shows what happened to Naboo after the prequels. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A <br /> <br />Change 3: SPIRITS ANEW <br /> <br />The most noticeable change in the movie is at the very end, during the celebration, where it is seen that Sebastin Shaw, the man who played Anakin Skywalker's spirit, was replaced digitally by Hayden Christensen, the man who played Anakin in Episode II and III. George explains that the reason that he changed this is that when a ghost appears, he or she appears as his or her true self, and that is Hayden, after all. All in all, good change, George. <br /> <br />OVERALL RATING: A+ <br /> <br />--------- <br /> <br />In spite of all these changes, it's still Star Wars, and it always will be, no matter what else is done to it in the future. So all of you fans out there who have been griping to no end about George's changes, try to consider things from his point of view. Maybe you'll change your mind. And maybe you won't. I'm not here to make you change your opinion. <br />
B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a story that must be told again and again, from generation to generation.  In 1931, Australia, three aboriginal girls were taken away from their mothers, in order to be raised under the Christian educational system.  The most touching part of the story is, the three girls ran away from the institute, to walk back to their home, barefoot.  And the home was 1,500 miles away. <br /> <br />You may find the story is incredible, but what is told is true (you will see that before the end credit rolls).  Because of the government's law that attempted to 'save' the aboriganl children, the three girls, Molly, Gracie, and Daisy were captured by force while playing in their village, to be sent to the special institute where the new educational rules were set for the aboriginal children.   <br /> <br />But Molly was not a girl to give up, so she and the two girls set out one of the hardest travels in the movie history -- to go back to their home, going 1,500 miles, barefoot.  The only guidance they could have was the rabbit proof fence (they made to prevent the imported rabbits from spreading westward), which would lead them to the destination.  <br /> <br />But the governental officer in charge A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) soon starts to move.  An able tracker Moodoo follows thier route, reading the footprints on the ground.   <br /> <br />Can the three girls go back to their home?  The film tells us the simple, but moving story with a skilled storytell's voice, without making it too dramatic nor too lean.  Actually, it is suspeceful when it wants to, but when it does, it does not lose its authenticity at all. <br /> <br />TWO GREAT POINTS about the film are its soundtrack music by Peter Gabriel, and the photography by Christopher Doyle.  The film together with their contributions unfolds like an epic against the marvelous backdrop of the nature in Australia.  And though three girls (all non-pro actors) are all convincing, it is Kenneth Branagh who really amazes us.His character is a very believable one, a kind of person doing very atrocious things out of what he believes is pure good-will.  Branagh is very good when he does this sort of tricky job, as is seen in his portrayal of Nati officer in equally impressive 'The Conspirasy.'   <br /> <br />DIRECTOR PHILIP NOYCE (himself from Australia) is probably known for his two Jack Ryan films, one so-so shocker 'Bone Collector' or several awful thrillers like 'Sliver' and 'The Saint.'  Forget about his past records.  He is a good director if given a right material, and now he shows it again.
B000000H3W|4.0|Sepultura's Arise is known as one of the last great thrash albums of our time.  This is true, but I don't feel this album is their best like so many say.  I prefer Beneath the Remains, Chaos A.D. and even Roots (Because of the odd tribal drums).  Those albums I can listen to from start to finish.  Here on Arise I always find myself skipping a few tracks.  It's still a great record though.  The standouts would have to include Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, Subtraction and Under Siege [Regnum Irae] and the bonus track Orgasmatron which is an excellent cover of the Motorhead song.  It's kind of funny that Max was drunk when they recorded Orgasmatron.  Since I don't listen to the record as much as the others, I can't really tell that much of a difference between the Scott Burns mix of desperate cry and the original.  Overall if you are looking for some good thrash with pounding drums,  shredding guitars and a strong attitude then yes, this is a great place to start, as is any Sepultura record (with max).
0440180295|5.0|Buy this book, better still, buy the 25th anniversary edition. I re-read it ever few years, and still get impressed by it's relevance. Everyone should own a copy of this book. <br />Anti-war books don't get any better, but, to quote from the introduction, \\"What sort of book is it?\\", \\"It's an anti-war book\\", \\"You may as well write an anti-glacier book\\".
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I nearly slapped a measly two stars on \\"Love, Actually\\" because of sheer disappointment over the charming, sexy Hugh Grant receiving only a handful of scenes in which to shine.  After putting my hormones in check, however, I changed the rating to four stars because the movie is at turns an effusive celebration of, and introspective meditation on, life and love.  And, with human beings committing increasing violence against each other, against wildlife and the environment, we need as much of a love infusion as possible.<br /><br />If any of you out there are expecting Grant to channel Cary Grant in delivering many brilliant and adorably clumsy lines, think again.  He is not the cad of the \\"Bridget Jones\\" films; nor is he the shy lad of \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\\"  But luckily for Hugh Grant's fans, in \\"Love, Actually\\" he has lots of fun portraying a hip British prime minister with the penchant to dance to The Pointer Sisters' \\"Jump.\\"  While his flirtatious behavior with staffer Natalie is politically incorrect, their inevitable romance is consensual and a joy to watch unfold.  (And whoever decided to script Natalie as a plus-size woman, single mother and a desirable mate should be commended.)<br /><br />More than a few of the vignettes in \\"Love, Actually\\" had poetic overtones in the manner of the Pablo Neruda-inspired \\"Il Postino\\" -- the major theme being The Unobtainable.  No matter how many times I watch the \\"Love, Actually\\" DVD, I am deeply moved by the story involving the British novelist (the normally stoic Colin Firth investing this role with unusual vulnerability).  After catching his partner in the act, the writer spends in solitude what is supposed to be a romantic vacation for two in the countryside.  Just as frustrating as trying to complete his book are his futile attempts to avoid falling for his attractive Portuguese housekeeper.  The scenes depicting the pair's efforts to communicate in either language are treated with humor, sensitivity and realism.  What happens after his manuscript is swept away is worth the price of the DVD alone!<br /><br />In another interlocking story, a philosophical schoolboy with more profound statements about unrequited love than any \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip has surprising lessons for his bereaved stepfather (who is portrayed gracefully by Liam Neeson).<br /><br />Then there is finely nuanced acting in the person of the great Emma Thompson.  She is memorable as a devoted wife and mother (and sister of Hugh Grant's prime minister) just trying to hold it together for her children while her spouse (as slyly embodied by Alan Rickman) fools around at the job.  A clever plot twist leads to the unforgettable discovery of the infidelity, and it takes a tremendous actor such as Thompson to mine the depths of emotional complexity required to make the viewer sympathize with her pain.  That moment in \\"Love, Actually\\" reminded me of Diane Lane's disquieting scene in \\"Unfaithful\\" on the commuter train.  Why does it take infidelity -- whether a husband's or a wife's -- to provide an exceptional actor the opportunity to display such spontaneous psychological fragmentation?<br /><br />On the lighter side, director Curtis' well-choreographed montage of love stories is set to an exquisite soundtrack.  In keeping with the film's holiday theme, the ebullient rendition of \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" is more than fitting.  The adolescent singer who performs the song belts out the lines with such bell-like clarity, she personifies joy in its purest meaning and would make Mariah Carey proud.<br /><br />My only gripe about \\"Love, Actually\\" is that it fails to explore love's impact on older adults and on gay and bisexual men and women. I am not risking giving away one of the storylines in commenting that it would have been more riveting if it had been allowed to take a homoerotic rather than an obsessive direction.<br /><br />If you are the romantic type and enjoy dry British wit, consider the \\"Love, Actually\\" DVD (the widescreen edition) as a gift for yourself at any time of year.  The DVD also would make a nice stocking stuffer at Christmastime but only for an adult because the movie contains nudity and mature themes.ve, Actually\\" DVD (the widescreen edition) as a gift for yourself at any time of year.

6304077939|5.0|Jean-Claude Lauzon was, no doubt, a troubled genius. I have seen Leolo many times and also the documentary about its director titled Lauzon Lauzon. <br />Leolo is a work of art. Lauzon attacked this project like a composer attacks a symphony. Its said that he played tapes of the musical scores for the producer, while standing over his shoulder and demanding that he read the script immediately. <br /> <br />Lauzon used music like a knife to make his points in some scenes. We hear the sacred tones of classical hymn while we see the gritty sometimes profane reality that Leolo lives in. There is Catholic symbolism and guilt oozing out of this film. The voice who speaks to us off an on throughout the film is excellent; through the voice of the archivist, of Leolo's <br />papers and deepest thoughts, we are allowed access to his psyche. The voice is also in English on the DVD.  <br /> <br />Maxime Collin is an incredible young actor. He plays Leo who refuses to be a french Canadian boy from the poorest part of Montreal and instead he is Leolo a white shirted Italian boy who lives for romance and beauty (oh yes and the Italian Countryside is beautiful). Our main charter repeats over and over, \\"I think therefore I am not\\". There is a lot here that Leolo would \\"not\\" want to be. Crazy for starters as his family home is a bit of an asylum.  <br /> <br />If you're squeamish, steer away, there are gritty scenes here. Yes a cat gets defiled (among other things), but for the prudish reviewer who claimed he smashed his tape at this point, I really doubt that the cat was hurt. Kinda of like the horses didn't really die in Brave Heart, my friend! Look beyond the cat to the social statement that is being made about the boy who is involved. Remember his mother worries that he is smoking, but has no idea what she ought to be worrying <br />about. I won't say anymore, spoilers annoy me almost as much as Philistines who watch art film and then get all self-righteous about the gritty bits.(Hint, rent Disney instead, my friend) <br /> <br />This is an art film there is no other way to describe it. It is a comedy but it's a dark art comedy so don't buy it for a laugh out loud evening, there are some really heavy and troubling elements here that will leave you thinking afterwards.  <br /> <br />The movie is beautifully filmed and well worth purchasing. I note that the DVD is only available through Amazon.ca, at the US site they are only selling the VHS. Buy the DVD, invite over a good friend, open some wine and enjoy the film and the long conversation that will follow it.
B0002K73EO|5.0|Having listened to Nick Cave through various incarnations - from the smacked out noise monger of the late 70's and ealry '80's to the pretty f**ked up zeolot of the 90's and then the old romantic guilt ridden....well... <br />This double release is some of the most engaging of the entire Cave catalogue.  For the first time in ages a Nick Cave release I can use not only for my own entertainment and education but one I can use to win over new fans (the last time this was possible was with the 'free live CD' accompanying the greatest hits package). <br />This is an album every home should have.

0316168815|5.0|From the moment I started reading this book, I could not put it down.  I actually read the book all day, and then stayed up until 4am so that I could finish it.  It was an extremely moving book, and I made my sisters, mother, and friends read it, and they all enjoyed it.<br />I suppose that how much you enjoy this book might depend on your views of life after death, and heaven, and that sort of thing.  My guess is that if you have a pretty open view to what things might be like, then you will enjoy the Lovely Bones.<br />From the cover of this book I knew it would be a sad one.  Less than twenty pages into the book I was already crying.  From the jacket of the Lovely Bones you know the main character, fourteen-year-old Suzie Salmon had been murdered and is already in heaven.  This is how the book is written, from Suzie's view in heaven.<br />The book takes you through Suzie's journey as she comes to terms with what has happened to her, and to how her family is coping with her death.<br />I found that this book was written extremely well, and I felt that I were with the charaters; it really seems like it is coming from the point of a fourteen year old.<br />Overall, it is really difficult to express why this book moved me.  I just think that this is a book that can give you hope and comfort, and that you should pick it up and try it yourself.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect when I saw Team America. For some reason, I thought it would be a serious `kids style' action movie with a few funny grown up lines thrown in for the adults.  Well, you can imagine my surprise at seeing a parody of a parody. With puppets... Parodying puppets, actors, and serious real life events! And I LOVED it! Seriously, there wasn't anyone in the theater who wasn't laughing themselves silly with the gross, irreverent, and at times shocking humor and wacky and outrageously wicked events.<br /><br />This film is NOT  for the kiddies. I repeat. NOT for the kiddies. Or for those who are overly sensitive. There were a few scenes that embarrassed even me (such as the lisping dictator character), and the scene where one of the puppets shared a past traumatic event that happened in the backstage of Cats. Eww....The odd thing was...Even though these characters were mere puppets...I ended up caring about them. I wanted the farm boy puppet to get together with the Lucy Liu look-alike, and I cared whether they lived and died towards the end.<br /><br />This was a shockingly wicked film, with some amazing puppeteering that I quite honestly didn't expect to like! 5 stars! I laughed throughout the film.
B00006ADFL|5.0|Pauline Rieper (New Zealand native Melanie Lynskey, \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\")has a dull and unhappy life at home with her family. And since none of the other girls at school understand her, she has no friends. The Hulme family moves in town from England, and their daughter Juliet (Winslet, who won the part over 175 other girls) clicks instantly with Pauline, especially since the girls share a love of literature and fantasy. In their creative minds, they begin to write about a ficticious world they want to be in; these parts of the film are shown with life-size versions of the clay model characters they make. Juliet and Pauline are inseperable, mainly because Juliet's wealthy parents always seem to be trying to ditch her, and Pauline is humiliated by her father and suffocated by her mother. But the girls parents, particularly Pauline's mother, begin to notice bizarre behavior from them, and decide that they need to see less of each other.  What else are two disturbed girls to do but conspire to kill the person that wants to keep them apart?<br /><br />Not only is this a true story, it came out in 1994, while Jackson (\\"Lord of the Rings\\" fame) was filming this, that Juliet Hulme was actually mystery novel writer Anne Perry. Pauline Rieper was tracked down in 1997 in a run down cottage, apparently living under the name Hilary Nathan, and has since become a devout Catholic who spends her time helping handicapped children. Aparrently, they were eventually released from prison under the condition that they never see each other again. Jackson has an uncredited cameo, playing a bum that gets kissed by Winslet's character outside a theatre. All of the journal voice-overs are direct from real diary entries made by Pauline Rieper. Also, almost all locations used for filming were the genuine locations where the events occurred. The tea shop where Honorah Parker ate her last meal was knocked down a few days after the shoot ended. According to Jackson, when they got to the location of the murder on the dirt path, it was eerily quiet; the birds stopped singing, and it didn't seem right. So they moved along a couple of hundred yards. Fascinating movie; no DVD extras, but there is another 10 minutes or so of footage not seen in the original cut.rder on the dirt path, it was eerily quiet; the birds stopped singing, and it didn't seem right.

B00005V3Z4|2.0|There are probably hundreds of web pages out there trying to explain this movie, not to mention the FAQ, the official web site that tries so very hard to build an air of mystery, the legions of fans who love it, but can't quite explain what it's about. <br /> <br />Obviously, this movie is difficult to understand. <br /> <br />My own opinion is that the director didn't have a resolution to his story and didn't think he needed one. This is not good. There might perhaps be some stories where the end is well left to the viewer to puzzle out, but there has to be something intrinsic to the story to make such an end desirable. In other words, the story should provide material worth thinking about -- some reward to the audience for their time and effort. In my opinion, that happens when the puzzle is interesting, provocative or profound, as dictated by the content of the movie. It is much less interesting to ponder the question \\"what was the director trying to say?\\" Who cares. If he cared about the audience, he'd have told us. <br /> <br />It is hard to talk about this movie without presenting some spoilers. I don't want to do that, so I'll leave it to you to judge for yourself whether the puzzle posed by this movie is worth killing any neurons. I know there are people out there who like to exercise their mind for no good reason, but even a game of chess or a crossword puzzle has some resolution. The best you'll get from this movie is \\"I think I kinda sorta know what the director had in mind.\\" <br /> <br />The acting is good. Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) and Mary McDonnel (his mother) are convincing in their roles. Drew Barrymore (the English teacher) doesn't seem to serve a purpose, but I guess she deserved a role, being executive producer. She does, quite arbitrarily, put down a couple of words on her blackboard that just happen to be essential for the plot to proceed. Patrick Swayze is frighteningly realistic as an infomercial host. Noah Wylie is the physics teacher who spouts a bunch of nonsense about wormholes, trying to give the viewer some sort of semi-scientific justification for suspending credulity. Viewed another way, EVERYONE in the movie had a part in the story, if you can wrap your mind around the plot. But it is such a contrived plot that when you figure it out, it sort of feels like you've been conned. One gets the feeling director Richard Kelly knew this, when he had Jake Gyllenhaal say \\"Deus ex machina\\" at an inopportune moment -- a cheap plot device that became extinct with the Ancient Greeks -- of having a god descend by means of ropes and pulleys from above stage, to explain away a confused plot that was beyond the director's powers of remedy. The gods work in mysterious ways, everyone knows that. What? You dare question a God? <br /> <br />The movie is certainly very atmospheric, dark and gloomy in the best traditions. The editing is unconventional; but not weird enough to make you lose interest. You won't be bored -- you'll be too busy figuring out what's going on. But when it's over, you might be left with the feeling that Kelly was indulging his whims at your expense.
B000002O4S|3.0|Like all the other fans who reviewed this soundtrack, I too found it to be somewhat disappointing.  Personally, I wish it had included \\"Mister Sandman.\\"   I can't understand why ANY song that was used the movie would be excluded from the soundtrack, especially if it's one of the more likable ones.  I don't care for song #2 \\"Time Bomb Town\\" or song #7, \\"The Wallflower\\" (Dance with me Henry), but all the rest are fine. <br /> <br />On the other hand, it is great to hear songs like \\"The Power of Love\\" and \\"Back in Time\\" in full length...those songs totally ROCK!!!!  I love \\"Earth Angel\\" as well, but was disappointed to hear that the version on the soundtrack does not include the sound of guitar strings (which we heard Marty playing thoughout the whole song in the movie). \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" is another favorite of mine and I found it satisfying to hear it in full length on the album, though it did not include Marty's improvised hard rock guitar solo (one of the highlights of the movie, yes, but if it was included in the soundtrack, it would hinder our chances of hearing the whole song).
0792151720|3.0|Let me start out by saying that this movie (written, produced and directed by James Cameron [\\"The Terminator\\", \\"T2\\", \\"True Lies\\", etc.]) didn't deserve the 11 Oscars it won in 1997. There were a lot of things that happened in this ship's short \\"life\\" which were omitted from the 2 and a half hour film. I won't say what, but that'll be enough explanation as to why I didn't give the movie 5 stars. The love story was very weak and could've been improved (which is why I'm writing a novel about it, with a more complex and involving story, combining everything-yes, every single detail about the ship into the novel). Leonardo DiCaprio, fresh off his role as Romeo in Baz Luhrman's f***ing piece of sh-- adaptation of \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" was just pathetic as Jack. Kate Winslet, fresh off playing Ophelia in Kenneth Branagh's masterful 3 and a half hour restoration of \\"Hamlet\\" (see the 1948 version starring, produced, text-edited [though uncredited] and directed by Sir Laurence Olivier, considered the finest Shakepearean actor of his time, first), was a little better as Rose. Billy Zane, fresh from playing the title role in \\"The Phantom\\", was very good as the \\"villainous\\" Caledon Hockley, Rose's fiance. He, Kathy Bates (as Margaret \\"The Unsinkable Molly\\" Brown, Jonathan Hyde (as J. Bruce Ismay), Victor Garber (as Thomas Andrews) and Bernard Hill (as Captain Edward John [E.J.] Smith) were the only actors who I thought were throughly convincing in this movie. The haunting love theme by Celine Dion, written in memory of her niece, \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is very good and earned the Oscar for Best Song. The only Academy Awards I'd have given this film are: Best Song, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects and Best Supporting Actor (Billy Zane). Other than that, the film wasn't too good at all. NOT for kids. Rated PG for language, violence, including disturbing images of drowning victims and brief sexuality/nudity.

B0001I561E|5.0|ALADDIN is the story of Aladdin.  Homeless and living as a \\"thief,\\" Aladdin is fascinated by a girl he sees one day in the market place.  Little does he know, that girl is Princess Jasmine.  Jasmine is escaping palace life and the numerous suitors who have come for her hand.  By law, she must only marry a prince, but she finds all of the ones who come to call arrogant and pompous.  Aladdin does not know who Jasmine is until he is captured by guards, led to him by the evil Jafar. <br /> <br />Jafar, the Grand Visor, is searching for the magic lamp and knows the idenity of the \\"diamond in the rough,\\" who is Aladdin.  He uses Aladdin to get the lamp, only to have it stolen from him when his plan to kill Aladdin fails. <br /> <br />It is at this point the Genie enters the tale.  What an amazing character and really the drawing point of the whole movie.  Voiced by Robin Williams, the Genie is funny, compassionate and carries the theme of the movie: To Be Yourself.  You either know the rest of the tale from here, or need to buy this movie to see it for yourself. <br /> <br />This DVD set is really good.  The second disc is full of interviews by the creators of the movie, with the storyboards included.  The only thing missing from this set was a follow up interview with Robin Williams.  I would have liked to have known how he liked the response to the Genie.   <br /> <br />This set is worth owning and watching over and over again; whether you have kids or not.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Nakedness, brutal violence and doctrinal heresy. <br />When will people listen to what Gibson himself has said: \\"If anyone is not part of the Mother Church (Roman Catholicism), then they are outside of salvation.\\" <br />Blasphemy! <br />No true Bible-believer can watch/support such ungodliness without severely grieving the blessed Spirit of God. <br />Those on the \\"broad way\\" of Cain's religion will undoubtedly support it wholly.
B00003CXA6|2.0|What a waste of a fine cast.  Tom Berringer,( great in Platoon) Martin Sheen,(great in Apocalypse Now) and Jeff Daniels.  All of them capable actors. This should have been a great film. But it was done in by a terrible script, and sub-par battle re-enactments. The soaring, saccharine music didn't help things either.  Gettysburg is a defining moment in American history.  The men who fought there, Union and Rebel, are heroes.  Their memory has been diminished by this movie.  Take a look at a very famous and common picture from the war.  It shows three Rebels captured at Gettysburg.  It is printed in almost every illustrated history of the war.  The men are lean, mean and almost arrogant in their pose.  Hard men, living on poor rations and forced on long, grueling marches.  Men who worked hard their whole lives and were not afraid of physical labor.  Compare them to the fat, soft looking men portraying the soldiers in this movie.  I don't believe uniforms in 1864  were manufactured in the 4xxxx size most of these \\"actors\\" required.  These men looked fake, they looked like lazy, beer drinking couch potatos, not the battle hardened Army of Northern Virginia.  My God, several looked out of breath running up Little Round Top. I think they needed oxygen masks off camera!!  The language and gore of battle are also kept to a minimum.  I don't pretend to be a combat veteran, but I know battle is a messy, brutal affair. I have been told many stories by WW II vets.  A bunch of fat boys being thrown in the air after a cannon shot does not portray the sheer brutality of war.  What about the screaming, wounded men littering the battlefield? Forgotten heroes. Men are torn apart by artillery.  There is cowardice and heroism in every army, and it was not shown in this film.  Instead we get long speeches, designed to bring a sentimental tear to our eyes, that never comes, punctuated by phony facial hair.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been listening to all Green Day's music since the early 90's.  Their first 2 albums were awesome learning experiences for the band.  In 94 along came the acclaimed album Dookie.  Dookie transformed the band into a mainstream icon.  The band received major success but along with that came criticism.  Punk bands were not supposed to sell albums and Green Day entered an uncharted territory.  Suddenly everyone said Green Day were sellouts.  In 95 Insomniac was released.  This was by far Green Day's heaviest album and probably my favorite. Insomniac debuted at #2 on billboard but did not nearly have the success of Dookie.  In 97 Nimrod was released and was at first not a success at all.  Then the single good riddance was released and became the #2 selling single of all time. This put Green Day back into the spotlight.  Warning was released in 2000 and debuted at #4 on billboard.  The album was slow and not really the sound I expected from Green Day.  <br />     <br />Finally we come to American Idiot.  This is among my 5 favorite albums ever.  This album was Green Day's first #1 debut on billboard selling a phenominal 267,000 copies in its first week.  The album explores all kinds of sounds.  The editor is just completely wrong and obviously not a fan to compare any Green Day influence to the Foo Fighters.  As far as I know Green Day was formed in 1987 as Sweet Children the Foo Fighters began in 95 I think.  Also the comparison of Green Day with Ashley Simpson is a travesty.  What the hell is wrong with this guy.  Firstly Simpson never played Woodstock or Warped Tour and her demeanor is a poser punk/ gothic look.  Green Day has its own originality and ideas they have NO NEED TO COPY any other artist. American Idiot displays punk rock epics such as JESUS OF SUBURBIA and HOMECOMING.  I would like to thank 92.3 K ROCK for playing Jesus OF SUBURBIA in its completion of 9 minutes.  The fast paced first single American Idiot was the perfect opening song.  Boulevard of Broken Dreams has a great combo of excellent lyrics and heavy riffs.  Lets not forget the constant referral to SAINT JIMMY.  The song SAINT JIMMY is pretty fast paced much like AMERICAN IDIOT. Saint Jimmy is also mentioned in the punk rock epic Homecoming. WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS and WHATSHERNAME have fantastic lyrics and can be compared to the legendary single GOOD RIDDANCE (TIME OF YOUR LIFE)  Of the 13 songs I would consider 10 to be excellent and about 6 to be worthy of being released as a single.  This album truly defines the band and the term PUNK ROCK EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001EHS|5.0|\\"Vault - Def Leppard's Greatest Hits\\" is a compilation of most of Def Leppard's hits from 1980-1995.  These songs show how they've conquered the heart of heavy metal since their debut album \\"All Through the Night\\" released in 1980.  The songs featured range from the other five monsterous albums: \\"High And Dry\\" (1981), \\"Pyromania\\" (1983), \\"Hysteria\\" (1987), \\"Adrenalize\\" (1992), and \\"Retroactive\\" (1993).  This album shows partially how they've evolved as musicians through their first fifteen years.  Since their debut, this band that was founded in 1978 sold about 50 million albums worldwide.  Beyond their big hair and great looks, their impact on mainstream radio remains today in many stations.    Their catchy riffs remain a big influence to many rock artists today.  With the help of long-time producer Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange, all of them keep listeners moving to their beats and melodies.  Their hardcore edge with dancy rhythms keep their music unique.  Their songs have played a huge role in 1980's and early 1990's heavy metal history, namely the undeniable \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\".  Regardless if they perform upbeat rock or ballad, the listening impact remains.  Their almost-humorous lyrics and song titles have helped create rock anthems (example is \\"Armageddon It\\" meaning \\"I'm-a-getting it\\").  Through numerous tragic events in their personal lives, they managed to stay on top for a long time.  The newly recorded hit single \\"When Love And Hate Collide\\" continues their stay on top.    Every performance gives these songs the added uniqueness that many enjoy.  Joe Elliot's lead vocals remain party-like or romantic, whichever fits the individual song better.  Steve Clark (1978-1991) and Vivian Campbell (1992-present) lead guitar solos and melodies are never easy to miss.  Rick Allen has been declared one of the greatest drummers in rock history.  Amazing, he still performs phenomenal after losing his left arm in 1984.  All other members also perform their instruments wonderfully: Rick Savage on bass, Pete Willis (1978-1983) on guitar, and Phil Collin (1983-present).    \\"Vault - Def Leppard's Greatest Hits\\" is a must-have for any Def Leppard or rock music fan.  This is sure to please its listeners for a long time.  Most of these featured songs will become classics in the near following years.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This is a very good album from a new rising star band in the alternative world. I saw them as the Curiosa tour in Toronto just before The Cure and they were very impressive. All in all the Curiosa Tour was awesome ! <br /> <br />All songs on this album are very good and somewhat very catchy. This band has reawakened my hunger for alternative music. At first glance, the songs structure and sound might seem repetitive but the more you listen to it the more subtlety you find and the greater the album get. <br /> <br />A very strong recommandation for any alternative music fan !
B00005JNEI|5.0|Y'know, I'm tired of the 'you've-got-to-see-the-other-side' reviews that claim that one is being brainwashed because F9/11 doesn't give the right-wing side of the story. From one who's been paying attention to BOTH sides of the issues for the last 4 years I hate to tell you - Mike actually did that.     Unfortunately for Bush apologists, it didn't skirt delicately around or soften the blows of the effects of Bush's policies nor his history. If you're a right-wing conservative and you still need to be coddled, I'm sure William Safire or Sean Hannity or Bob Novak or Anne Coulter or Rush Limbaugh (among many, many others - 'liberal' press my ass) have many comforting platitudes to explain away what's going on right under our noses.    The notion that Mike only made F9/11 for the money is ludicrous and again a cheap ad hominem attack to try and undermine the film as a whole, rather than take on what it presents. How does this square with his attempts to screen the film for free and the allowance of people to download and distribute it?     Because bottom line: the facts that Mike brings up in the film are irrefutable - it's the conclusions he draws from them that are questionable - though even then he draws some pretty good conclusions. I do not agree with everything he claims, but F9/11 paints an undeniably frank picture of the corrupt man sitting in the White House after a fraudulent election who has gotten the United States as in over its head as he is. Remember, Bush has lied us into a war where we've murdered civilians and sexually abused prisoners, not to mention the physical and psychological toll the war has taken on the troops we sent there. Seeing F9/11 might help you see how my criticism is not partisan slander.    People who've questioned Bush from the beginning remember how we were told we were 'unpatriotic' and were scolded not to criticize the pResident - F9/11 coming out gives us permission to talk about what's happening. And with the numerous attempts to silence the film, that's something it's detractors clearly do not want.
B00005AQGH|5.0|i rarely listen to this album due to the fact that it brings back horrible memories of situations in troublesome 96', but besides that, it fits well along side \\"Me Against the World\\" (my personal fave). Yes Tupac laid the facts down and dissed many of his oppressors, but he was anger-driven and was losin' it literally. I can't say that this is Pac at his best because for one 1) people perceive 2Pac at his best when he's frustrated and dissing and 2) he was pre-occupied with Deathrow records. Pac gave us his truest of feelings not his skill on this record and if you ask me, kinda got in the way of his lyricism. Pac had the skills, and in comparison with Chino XL (who is talented too among the others), Canibus, Big L and BIGGIE, could've stretched the subject further than what he did when with Deathrow. Suge hendered Pac's skills tremendously. Where as Pac became more of a pure gangsta rapper than lyricist/militant rapper. I SERIOUSLY THINK TUPAC COMPROMISED HIS LYRICS WHEN HE RECORDED THEM FROM 94-96. His skills as a mc-style rapper were dominant on Strictly for my NI***Z. I believe we all heard the best of Pac before Deathrow, but we all must say, Pac' was the realist of mainstream rappers. He just had a problem balancing his mainstream power while trying to still appeal to the underground fans...and that was his problem on this LP. But he went out with a bang when he completed this album. Respect this album truly even if you're not a fan of him. Because this album is a true recording of his inner pain and struggle on disc.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Charlie Kaufman's movies are not for the faint of mind. If you enjoy low-brow films riddled with slapstick humor, you'll hate what he creates. <br /> <br />However, if your taste in movies runs toward the intelligent, well-scripted and exceptionally well acted, then Kaufman is just what the doctor ordered. <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is extraordinary, for many reasons:  <br /> <br />1. The acting. Simply put: first-rate, with Jim Carrey delivering his finest performance as the emotionally repressed lover of Kate Winslet, his flamboyant, somewhat nuts girlfriend.  <br /> <br />2. Its sheer originality. All Kaufman films (Being John Malkovich, in particular) are complex and enjoyable on many layers. When they're over, one is just as apt to scratch his or her head in bewilderment and say, \\"Huh?\\" as to say \\"Wow!\\" In other words, Kaufman's movies are not typical Hollywood fare. They're original, creative and require one to pay attention. <br /> <br />3. Its message. Eternal Sunshine is, arguably, about the importance and staying power of love as it overcomes the gritty minutae of every day life. The relationship between Carrey's and Winslet's characters is hard to fathom. And it doesn't always seem to be based on anything of substance. Yet, for whatever reason, they fit together. One has what the other lacks. Two interlocking puzzle pieces, if you will. If you can accept their quirky attraction and relationship, the movie makes more sense. If you can't accept it, the movie probably won't stand up to closer scrutiny. <br /> <br />4. The \\"Wow Factor.\\" I tend to enjoy movies that mesmerize me. If I am captivated by a movie, unable to guess what happens next, I'm hooked. I file it under Must-Own. Eternal Sunshine was one of those movies. When my wife and I saw it at the theater we left thinking, \\"Wow. We've just seen something amazing.\\" So the minute the DVD was released, we were there. We've watched it twice since, in fact. <br /> <br />5. A corollaryto the \\"Wow Factor\\" is what I call a \\"The Repeated Viewing\\" test. If a movie can withstand multiple screenings then it's one that I add to my collection. Eternal Sunshine is one of those movies. It's crafted the way good progressive rock is: with many layers, shadings and inventive surprises. For the same reason I can listen to anything by Yes repeatedly -- and hear something different every time -- I can watch a movie by Charlie Kaufman repeatedly and gain new appreciation for it every time. <br /> <br />If you're in the mood for something different and wonderful, please give Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind a chance.
0385470819|5.0|Despite the basic plot being strikingly similiar to \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\", Grisham's \\"A Time to Kill\\" just simply rocks.  The characters stand out and are just amazing.  Twists and turns at every corner.  Interesting plot developments.  Only fault I find is that the ending, although well written, is very predictable. <br /> <br />Very good book for Grisham, and it's not long winded like his recent work. <br /> <br />- Delaney
0792833260|5.0|During the first 30 minutes of  watching Rain Man I kept thinking wow Tom Cruise really doesnt know how to act. I kept noticing flaws in his acting and to a large extent his dialogue which he obviously has no control over he just goes by the script. The thing about Cruise is that he is not believable, the director wanted us to feel angry and hold nothing but contempt for him but the only thing he achieved was unbeliavability.  Towards the end I forgave his flaws in the beginning of the film and accepted him as the character that he was portraying. <br /> <br />Hoffman is at his best! Now he is absolutely believable, I didnt think for one second that he was puting on an act and thats the way it should be. Thats the way it should have been for Cruise since the beginnning but it wasnt. Hoffman held the weight of the movie on his shoulders and what weight it was! The plot is simple enough and I think that with the wrong casting for Rayman this movie would have been a flop.  <br /> <br />Funny enough as it might seem it is Cruise that holds the film together. While Hoffman holds it on his shoulders Cruise keeps it from toppling over. His character development is impressive and surprising. Towards the end we sympathise with Cruise as much as we do with Hoffman which I didnt think it was possible. <br /> <br />Such a great movie to watch, with one exeption, with the whole family. The exeption being a sex scene where we dont see anything but the sound of a couple making love which is explicit enough to give the movie an R rating which is rediculous. There is a little \\"bad\\" language that is thrown around but nothing severe. Kids toway watch television that is 10 times more explicit so this is nothing out of the ordinary
B000002U9P|4.0|While 1984's \\"Private Dancer\\" was a smash, Tina Turner's follow-up, 1986's \\"Break Every Rule\\" was considered a bit of a disappointment by critics and from a sales point of view, it paled in comparison to its predecessor.  Strangely, the album followed the pattern of the first with mid-tempo ballads (\\"Two People\\" modeled after \\"What's Love\\"), rocerks (\\"What You Get Is What You See\\", \\"Back Where You Started\\"), a David Bowie cover (\\"Girls\\", whereas \\"1984\\" was on 'Private Dancer') and catchy pop (\\"Typical Male\\", \\"Paradise Is Here\\") yet that may ultimately have worked against the album.     <br /> <br />On the whole, it works, as many of the songs have hit potential, and some of them indeed were hits, especially \\"Typical Male\\" which was a Top Five hit.  Overall, I enjoy 'Break Every Rule' more than 'Private Dancer' because I find there is a better  selection of songs.  <br /> <br />\\"Two People\\" is a superior mid-tempo ballad powered by Tina's excellent interpretation.  The use of her lower register is notable here.  (Note:  seek out the 12\\" version as it adds more instrumentation and is even better than the album version).  The title track is also a fine love song, which inexplicably never became a hit.  The same can be said for \\"Paradise Is Here\\" which should have also been a hit.  <br /> <br />Also, this album gives us more of the sassy Tina, particularly on \\"What You Get Is What You See\\", \\"Back Where You Started\\" and \\"Til The Right Man Comes Along\\".   <br /> <br />Tina's cover of \\"Girls\\" is a knockout and will please both Bowie and Turner fans.  Seek this one out.
B00000253N|5.0|My review really isn't necessary here, but I wanted to share my experience with this album. When my college boyfriend broke up with me, I was distraught, and a guy I knew just said to me, \\"Blood on the Tracks. Get it.\\" I did, and it was the most beautiful, intuitive thing I'd ever heard. Years later I would enjoy it simply on its own, and it would strangely apply perfectly to other bittersweet partings I had. \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is the crowning jewel of this album for me, 2nd would be \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\\" <br /> <br />So if you're going through any kind of heartache, over a girl or boy (particularly if one of you is a redhead) this album will make you feel comforted and sad and wistful all at once. Maybe it's just knowing that Bob Dylan went through the same thing, makes you realize how precious and timeless it all is.
B0002MPU1K|4.0|This is not the Peter Cincotti that I love to listen to.  His arrangements are much weaker than his first album, and his delivery of the music comes across like he is bored.  It is an alright effort, but not even close to the quality of music that he is able to produce.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Oscar-winner Julie Andrews (\\"Mary Poppins\\", her first movie) and Shakespearean actor Christopher Plummer (\\"Somewhere In Time\\") team up in one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. I won't go over the plot, as it's classic. The acting in this movie is top-notch, especially from Mrs. Andrews and Mr. Plummer. The songs are also classic (\\"Eidelweiss\\", \\"I Have Confidence In Me\\", the touching \\"Climb Every Mountain\\" and the heart-rendering \\"So Long, Farewell\\", among others penned by the dynamic duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein [\\"The King And I\\", etc.]) This movie won 5 Oscars in 1965, including Best Picture and Best Director. Julie Andrews should have won another Oscar for her unique portrayal of Maria and Christopher Plummer for his excellent portrayal of Captain Von Trapp. No matter how many times I see this classic film, the end almost makes me cry. No matter how many films they keep doing, Julie Andrews will forever be remembered as Mary Poppins and Maria and Christopher Plummer for his role as the Captain. No other actor could've done it better than they did. This is a movie I would definitely recommend for the entire family. Rated G.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Besides the cost, how does the Mulan Special Edition differ from the Mulan (Disney Gold Classic Collection)?
B00005JMXX|5.0|I personally do not own this DVD but plan on buying it.  It is awesome and the special effects are spectacular.  What really hit home is that like Armaggedeon, this actually could happen.....but hopefully not in our, our childrens or grandchildrens lifetimes!  I would recommend this DVD to everyone and anyone, and have shared my daughters copy with at least 10 people already, myself, I have watched it 4 times already!  Great Movie!
B0002IQHY8|5.0|As a long-time fan of Parsons's works, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But considering how his past instrumentals were very electronic in nature, I figured this album would sound fine. <br />\\"Fine\\" is an understatement!  Each song is crystal clean in its production.  Although most electronica suffers from mind numbing repetition, A Valid Path includes sound effects, distorted vocals, and subtle layers that blend, weave, and massage the mind.  Even the longer songs take you on a journey.  The more you listen, the more you hear.  The whole album is a journey that can be started on any song and looped seamlessly from beginning to end. <br />This album is a diversion from his past works, but Alan's genius is evident in every song.  Every track is strong.  It's hard to pick a favorite.  Hopefully this album will attract a new audience.
0812932293|5.0|After reading the business autobiography of Richard Branson (Sir Richard Branson), 'Losing My Virginity', I've decided to tell of how riveted I was to the book. The CEO of Virgin has many things to say and for almost the entire book, I couldn't put it down (other than his extended musings on British Airways). From starting his first magazine called 'Student', then opening up the first Virgin store on Notting Hill, to buying an old castle to make into a recording studio, to losing his virginity to an asmatic girl. He has broken world records in hot-air balloons around the world. He gets the balloons up to an altitude of around 35k feet where the jet stream is and rides across the atlantic ocean reaching speeds of 240mph, or the pacific ocean and the way he recounts these trips is addictive to read and hard to put down. He's also broken ocean records by being the fastest man alive to boat the atlantic ocean averaging 45 knots (I think that's the speed). Branson's reality show on Fox starting November 9th at 7pm should be interesting since the contestants will compete over the CEO position of Virgin. I don't know if the position will be permanent or not. Branson's book is a very, very entertaining read and makes anybody want to go out and start their own business because he makes it sound just the opposite of business. One former airline CEO tells Richard that he needs to get a physical every year and have the doctor stick his finger 'up your bum, then he'll tell you what's what.' The man when on to say, 'just make sure to look back when his finger is up your bum and make sure that both his hands aren't on your shoulders.' Branson goes into detail about many of his relationships and what he thought about other people at the time and feels no shame, the book sounds as if the thoughts went straight from Sir Richard's steno-pad into publication. Richard Branson is now my new entrepreneurial hero. The book also explains the much asked question of why he decided to name hiscompany something so innocent but epicureanly alluding. <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Okay, yes--at times she does not sound that great live. But I personally think she sounds okay. I have heard people call Avril Lavigne a poser and an embarrassment, and some have even had the gall to call her bad at writing lyrics. I think that all of these comments are terrible and untrue. <br /> <br />If you liked Lavigne's first album, chances are you'll like this one (especially if you liked songs like Naked and the ... track before that one). Lavigne had more writing freedoms on this CD, and she was not forced to wrap her lyrics in sugar tones and bubble gum (due to the matrix). Here she truly speaks and her words really get through. <br /> <br />Of all the songs on \\"Under My Skin,\\" the best would be Take Me Away, Together, Don't Tell Me, Nobody's Home, Forgotten, Fall To Pieces, and Slipped Away. How Does It Feel is a good song--especially the bridge--but after that part, it can tend to go on for quite a while. My Happy Ending is okay, but not really the best. Anyway... <br /> <br />For some hard-core music you can shamelessly crank up all the way, you should without a doubt put this album on your list. Lavigne, may you continue to rock on!!
B000001G53|5.0|This is my bookshelf version of Parsifal.  It's one that you listen to by yourself.  It is imbued with spirituality, sacredness, profundity and seriousness.<br /><br />Karajan understands this piece inside and out, and who'd ever think Karajan would be one to understand Parsifal?<br /><br />But he allows his own inner wisdom and his unrevealed devoutness to express itself freely in the creation and reading of this glorious mystery drama, the everest of operas...Parsifal.
B0000048V8|5.0|I love this video. It's one of the few videos that will instantly make me 6 years old again waiting for Santa or the first big snow of the season.  I think it's the subtleness of the story, the music and the animation.  We're not being bludgeoned with images, loud music and that underlying commercial feel that 99.9% of the other Christmas movies have.  It commands your full attention due to the lack of dialogue which is a good thing in this case because the video is not glitzy and overbearing... it's awe inspiring.  You don't feel mentally wiped out afterwards. You can feel the excitement that James feels when his snowman comes to life.  The only problem is my nephew when he was growing up wanted to build a snowman outside in the snow without bundling up like James.  Only after I let him go outside for a minute and hold some snow without gloves was he convinced that this wasn't a wise thing to do.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Simply one of most amazing films ever made. I am a Fellini fan. I think Amarcord is wonderful, 8 1/2 is pleasantly bizarre and the Satyricon is good for a laugh. But La Dolce Vita surpasses Fellini's reputation, and should stand on its own not as a capsule of a time passed, but as an enduring statement about life itself. The film is, simply put, as intelligent and complex as anything out there. Sure there is a lot of wealthy indulgence, and this is shown with equal parts celebratory awe and biting criticism, but look at Marcello's relationship with his father. Look at the blond bombshell wandering the streets of Rome with a kitten on her head. Look at the final party, in which a tired actress allows herself to be feathered before saying, with true fatigue, \\"that was fun, but the party is over.\\" <br />Marcello Mastroianni gives a truly nuanced performance, and his discontentment is evident in his every word. With one look, he can make the audience sympathize with his dispicable impulses.  <br />As effusive as this is, I feel that I cannot do justice to the brilliance of this film. Forget Fellini, forget the indulgence of the jet-set, this film is about beauty and love, passion and loss. A good contender for best film of all time.
0321213351|5.0|This is a recent book in Martin Fowler's series of computing texts. The series begins with his classic Refactoring text. Now Kerievsky takes us into a sequel. Because you can imagine this as a suitable extension of the previous book. Where now the author has us look for patterns during the refactoring process. The style of the book closely follows Fowler's book. And, like that book, the code examples are in Java.<br /><br />But what if you program in C++ or C#? If you are experienced enough, you should be able to apply many of these ideas in your language. The examples are meant to give flesh to general patterns. And the patterns should be able to be implemented in any object oriented language.<br /><br />Actually, if you have already been looking for patterns, or designing to them, then much of this book may be no surprise. Because one virtue of the book is that it binds together a set of commonly encountered refactorings. But even in this case, a few hours reading may be profitable for you, if it just exposes you to a few hitherto unfamiliar patterns.

THE CGIS ARE TOTALLY AWESOME AS ARE THE VERY TALENTED HUGH JACKMAN AS WELL AS KATE BECKENSALE.  THE ACTION AND ADVENTURE ARE LITERALLY NON STOP FROM BEGINNING TO END, AND MOST OF THE ACTING BY A VERY TALENTED CAST IS FINE. PERHAPS THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SCREENPLAY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I'D SAY SIT BACK AND HOLD ON TIGHT CAUSE ONCE THIS RIDE BEGINS IT'S NON STOP! GREAT FUN, GREAT POPCORN FLICK-I LOVED IT. WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT FROM SUCH A FILM-YOU LITERALLY LOSE YOURSELF FOR OVER 2 HOURS IN A GREAT ESCAPADE NOT UNLIKE THE INDIANA JONES TRILOGY. GO FOR IT YOU WILL HAVE A REAL BLAST.

If you haven't already got this album, smack yourself in the face and GO GET IT !!! Peace
B000002OX7|5.0|When the Who released the ground-breaking rock opera Tommy in 1969, the already well-known band was suddenly rocketed to galactic levels of stardom, showered withcritical praise, new fans, and more importantly, lots and lots of money. Suddenly, Pete and the boys were no longer third bannanas behind the Beatles and the Stones. They were their own band, with their own unique style, vision, and fanbase. Tommy gave them a kind of artistic credibility that most other bands could only dream of: They were now free to do whatever they wanted, \\"Anyhow Anywhere Anyway\\" they wanted to do it.  <br />And that's exactly what songwriter/guitarist Pete Townshend set out to do. He began work on a new rock opera called Lifehouse, which would attempt to fully realize the ideas brought fourth by Tommy, as well as top it. But, somewhere in the midst of the writing, recording, touring, promoting, and such, Pete suffered a nervous breakdown, and Lifehouse had to be scrapped. And this was in 1971, two years since the Who had released Tommy. Fans were hungry for a new album. Not wanting to dissapoint the fans (or the bank) the band released Who' Next, a collection of songs recorded during or around the time of the Lifehouse sessions. <br />Thus, Who's Next is a document of and an admission to failure. But if that's true, how come it's so darned great? <br /> <br />It's odd that, even though the songs on Who's Next were intended to be part of a rock opera, this album and Tommy are practically opposites. Tommy was great becauase it collected a bunch of songs that wouldn't be too impressive on their own and used them to build a whole that was so much more than the sum of its parts. On the other hand, every song on Who's Next can stand alone as a singular work of genius. The songs on Tommy combine to form an amazing story. Every song on Who's Next is its own amazing story, be it the epic \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" or the hilarious \\"My Wife.\\" Tommy was a sweeping seventy-five minute, twenty-four song epic. Who's Next is short and sweet at nine songs and fourty-three minutes (note: I should probably mention that this is a review of the original nine-song release, not the expanded issue, which I don't own). But enough with these useless comparissons. Who's Next is its own album, let's review it as such. <br /> <br />Of the nine songs here, five (\\"Baba O'Riley, \\"Bargain,\\" \\"My Wife,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\") are considred to be bona fide Who classics. The other four should be. The album kicks off with the synth-washed anthem, \\"Baba O'Reiley.\\" Name doesn't ring a bell? It's that song you've been hearing on the classic rock radio stations and referring to as \\"Teenage Wasteland.\\" \\"Baba\\" kicks off the album with all the subtlty of a nuke, without sacrificing a certain tuneful catchiness that make the song great, even after repeated listens. It establishes a precedent for the album, a standard of greatness that refuses to be lowered. As the giddy violen-driven outro begins to die down, you become sad. You don't want \\"Baba O'Riley\\" to end. Don't worry though, the blistering \\"Bargain\\" is here to keep you company. <br />Every song on the album envokes some brilliant image or thought. Bassist John Entwistle's \\"My Wife\\" is one of the funniest Who songs ever, as well as a favorite among fans. The post-modern car song \\"Goin' Mobile\\" is incredibly fun, devastatingly catchy, and given a rough edge by Roger Daltry's singing. <br />\\"Won't Get Fooled Again,\\" the classic anthem of rebellion and regret, is easily among the greatest songs ever written. Charactarized by Pete's earth-shattering guitar chordes and Roger's shout of \\"YEARGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\\" halfway through, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is eight minutes of rock bliss. Listen and take notes. <br />But among the rockers, there are equally brilliant ballads. \\"The Song Is Over\\" is haunting, lush, and sweet. Roger's heartfealt singing blends perfectlty with session musician Nicky Hopkins' dreamy piano.<br />\\"Gettin' In Tune\\" is a slightly tougher ballad, laced with some of the greatest lyrical imagery you've ever heard (\\"I'm just bangin' away on my old piano, gettin' in tune to the straight and narrow...\\"). <br />The string laced and heartfelt \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" a longtime fan favorite, is one of Pete's most personnal songs, highlighted by soft and solemn accouastic guitar notes that slowly build into driving, scathing rock, before slowly subsiding again, while Roger Daltry does a brilliant job of translating Pete's guitar playing into English. <br /> <br />Who's Next is a mesterpiece of classic rock, and an example that even failure can be great.
0446691437|4.0|This book was utterly amazing, very easy read, yet every page filled with something to learn from or understand. I recommend reading this if you want to do something with your life rather than your typical 9-5 working for the man. <br /> <br />Unfortuantly the last 3rd of this book was very hard for me to read... its very preachy and religious and while I can translate god/angels/muses into my own meanings. It became hard to read for me and although i didnt dismiss what he was saying. I think that there is no higher being as in god, just your subconscious. Even tho steven hints at it being within you in the last 3rd of the book could have made abit more sence. <br /> <br />I suggest if you dont beleive in god, read the entire book, make your interprations of the last 3rd of the book and then read the first 2 again. The first 2/3's of the book are utterly amazing... and so true. I can't beleive its been under my nose all this time.
B000008LOU|4.0|This was the second Traveling Wilburys album, recorded after the death of Roy Orbison.  The album suffers a little from his absence, but it's still a very good album.  Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne sound like they are having a lot of fun here.  Most of the songs have a lighthearted \\"just for kicks\\" feel to them, and it's cool to hear these guys just \\"cut loose\\" and do something different from their regular \\"serious\\" albums.  Fans of these artists should really get a kick out of this.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|\\"Christine\\" is one of director John Carpenter's finest yet less appreciated films. Carpenter himself sounded his slight disappointment with the film in some interviews which ultimately led it to be labeled as a failure. Well it isn't. The film based on Stephen King's novel, is an intriguing, atmospheric and extremely suspensful story that works both as a macabre chiller and a psychological thriller. The film also contains some of Carpenter's best visuals as his compositions in this film show his unique talent and taste in composing with the Panavision frame as well as featuring one of his most ambient synth scores. With good performances by John Stockwell, Keith Gordon and Harry Dean Stanton, this is a classic supernatural\psychological mystery that is recommended for Carpenter fans and fans of thrillers alike.
B000089CJI|1.0|Wow!  Talk about impressive!  Impressively bad vocals, that is.  While the music isn't going to save the world, and it doesn't reinvent the wheel, it is still fun.  And then the guy starts singing.  If someone sang this badly during a high school performance, they would be booed off the stage by disgruntled family members.  The vocals could not worse.  The girl singer is much better, but her voice doesn't carry enough weight to make the fluffy music mean anything.  Recommendations for the Postal Service - hire a real singer and you might have a career.

0783225857|5.0|This is one of those rare cases where a great book is turned into a great film.  Gregory Peck was outstanding as the lawyer in a small southern town who is trying to defend a young black man who was accused of raping a white woman.  The kids who played his kids did a great job too, especially the girl who played Scout. <br /> <br />The dvd includes a special on the making of the film, which is almost as long as the movie, and almost as interesting.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I have seen the movie in the theatre and purchased the DVD.  I think M. Moore has achieved his goal with this movie.  In it, the viewer is confronted with different opinions and information than the normal drivel we are supplied by many of the \\"news\\" organizations.  After seeing this movie I began investigating what had been presented and discussing it with others, the main point of this documentary.  Many citizens of this country have become extremely complacent, allowing our government and the media to feed us our thoughts and needs.  This movie has rattled our psyche and it has made it use the best tool we have, our brains. <br /> <br />A good follow up to this movie is to go and read the Wolfowitz Doctrine (can be accessed on PBS website).  If you watch the movie again it might put it in a new perspective for you, moreover you might need a pair of Michael Moore's free underwear. <br />
1593974744|5.0|Orson Scott Card said that hearing it is better than reading it.  That is why this version of Enders Game is so good. The narrator's did a great job telling the story with the battle school accent. That was my favorite part, but also their is a audio camio with Orson and a Post Script where he talks about how Enders Game came to be. And also about the movie that wont be comming for a long time.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Simply, this is a security blanket movie for diluted leftists (as opposed to some of you non-diluted leftists who are reading and rating my review :D).  This movie cannot and should not be taken seriously.  I only enjoyed the entertainment value, but there is no substance.  At times it can be boring, but overall it's interesting to watch.. and it could have been worse... there could have been a Michael Moore nude scene!   <br />*shudders*
B0000584V3|3.0|I first heard of Opeth as one of the greatest bands in Progressive Metal. I then bought \\"Blackwater Park\\" and at first I was really mad. What could they be talking about, this is terrible. I gave it a few more listens, and that opinion changed. Everyone who said so many things about the band is right; it is a truly phenominal band. The songs are outstanding all the way through, and I have yet to hear a weak song on any of their discs. The lyrics, even though they are about death, are not just your typical \\"PAIN! DEATH! SUFFEREING! 666!\\" songs like from Slipknot; these are very interesting and insightful. Yet this does not get five stars because of the singing. Notice I said singing and not singer. I personally cannot stand that death metal growl but I know that it is not just a way to cover up a poor voice because there are certain parts on this album (as well as on the entire album \\"Damnation\\") that prove that he has one of the best voices in all of metal. <br />It is unfair that some reviewers gave this album one star because of the vocals, because it is a fact that this deserves three; five for the music, for the amazing talent, and the lyrics, but loses one becasue of the vocals, and another because the lead singer is so [darn] talented, yet doesn't let it show. If you can get over the vocals, definitely buy \\"Blackwater Park.\\" I'm going out on a limb here, but if the vocals were more metal and less death metal growl, this band could be even better than Dream Theater
B0002OXVDW|4.0|These films introduced me to Astaire, Kelly, and the brilliance of MGM musicals, and I am beyond grateful. So, of course, I wanted the DVD's to be as remarkable as the dances and songs that inspired such joy.     Unfortunately, the black and white segments in this transfer are very grainy, and the Technicolor segments -- which were so vibrant on film -- are pale, while the color shifts noticibly. I watched the discs on two different players and two different TVs, and the results were the same.    This is in contrast to the laserdiscs of these films, which though they bled a bit, were far less grainy, far more vibrant, and color-consistent.    These three films are the best chronicle of Hollywood's great musicals (leaving out only the amazing, spectacular, you-have-to-see-them-to-believe-them Nicholas Brothers, who were under contract to rival Paramount) and since DVD will be the format on which they will live forever, I wish they had received better care.

0804106304|4.0|I really enjoyed the traditions and cultural aspects that the author included in the Joy Luck Club. The way the stories were split apart by mothers and daughters made you feel like you know each character more personally. The theme of storytelling and translating in the book was clear throughout, and really pulled the book together as a whole. by the end of the book you get used to the stories jumping around and begin to  enjoy the way its written. I do feel the book would have been a five star book if the authour could have included more of China's history regarding the World War that takes place in the book.

0792153367|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's <br /> Breakfast at Tiffany's is considered by many to be one of the best films of its class.  It is a timeless, romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn (as Holly Golightly) and George Peppard (as Paul Varjak).  The two meet at the beginning of the film and as the movie progresses, begin to understand and grow closer to each other.    The love story theme of Breakfast at Tiffany's is one that is used in other movies of this nature.  There are, however, a few unique traits that set this movie apart from others of its class;  Breakfast at Tiffany's takes the standard love story seen in many of these types of films  and elevates it to a higher level.   <br /> The movie begins in the early morning with Holly Golightly window shopping at Tiffany's Jewelry Store.  Holly dreams of being able to afford jewelry from Tiffany's, but knows that she must marry someone wealthy in order to realize her dream.  Holly explains later in the movie to her friend, Paul, that being at Tiffany's is calming to her.  When she returns to her apartment, the audience is introduced to Holly's personality.  In order to enter her apartment complex, Holly must wake up a tenant in the building.  Holly has lost her key, and as the audience learns, this is not the first time and, she admits, that it will not be the last time.  As the film progresses, there are more and more clues of Holly's forgetful and unorganized life style as well as her total disregard for anyone's feelings but her own.   <br /> When Paul and Holly meet for the first time, we are shown even more of Holly's different behavior.  Paul, a new tenant in her building, asked if he could use her telephone.  Upon entering her apartment, he noticed that it looked as if she had just moved in.  She hadn't, she had been there for nearly a year.  She wasn't exactly sure where her telephone was, and then she remembered that she put it in a suitcase.  According to Holly, the suitcase kept the noise of the phone down.  Along with the phone, there is a cat in Holly's apartment.  She explains to Paul that the cat and she found each other.  They do not belong to each other, and therefore, she did not name the cat.  These incidents begin to introduce the audience to Holly's personality. <br />  During this first conversation between Paul and Holly, Paul mentioned that it was Thursday morning.  Holly was admittedly surprised, she told Paul that she must get ready for an appointment that she has every Thursday.  She was in a frenzy, attempting to get ready in a short time in order to make her appointment.  This is the one and only commitment that Holly actually regularly keeps.  As she franticly tries to get ready, she asks Paul to find her shoes under the bed.  He found one, she found the other in a basket along with other things in it.   <br />Holly's appointment is a visit with a convicted drug smuggler in the Sing Sing prison.  Later, it is revealed to the audience that during her visits at the prison, the inmate gives Holly a \\"weather report.\\"  She then gives this bit of information to the drug smuggler's \\"attorney\\" and is paid for the information from the \\"attorney.\\"  There are many clues that show that the information given to Holly is not a \\"weather report,\\" although Holly's inability to recognize the obvious, further portrays her personality.  Holly thinks that the drug smuggler and his attorney are two very nice men and she is performing a kind act by visiting the drug smuggler.  <br />Holly's would like to meet and marry someone who has a lot of money.  She has been trying to save money, but is unable to do this on her own.  A positive attribute of Holly's is that she wants to support her younger brother who is currently in the army and will be out soon.  She knows that, because he is slow, he will not be able to support himself.  She realizes that she will not be able to become rich on her own and, in order to support her brother, along with her dream life style, needs to marryinto money.   <br /> Paul, on the other hand, is portrayed as a very intelligent and logical thinker.  His kind acts toward Holly show that he is truly interested in beginning a meaningful relationship with her.  He is an aspiring writer and has published a book.  Through the course of the movie, Paul is shown to better his life in many ways.  He breaks free from his mistress who has been financially supporting him and finds a job as a writer.  On many occasions, Paul, who from the beginning of the film has been falling in love with Holly, has ample opportunity to see Holly's true self.  Many people attempted to point out to Paul that Holly can not, and never will be able to, have a normal relationship.  Paul meets Holly's ex-husband who indirectly explains to Paul that Holly is not someone that he should get involved with.  In addition to the warning from the ex-husband, a man named O. J. Berman tells Paul exactly that \\"Holly is a bad investment.\\"   <br /> Avoiding the advice of these people, Paul continues to pursue Holly's affection.  There is something about her that he finds irresistible.  The film does not show exactly what it is, but it is apparent that there is some reason for Paul's persistence.  The way Paul acts when he is with Holly makes it seem as though the two of them are meant to be together.  And Paul will stop at nothing to make Holly realize this.   <br />At the end of the movie, Holly announced to Paul that she was moving to Brazil to be with her wealthy boyfriend and eventually marry him.  Paul was devastated, but still spent the evening with Holly because she wanted him to be with her.  During the evening, Holly was arrested and spent time in jail due to her involvement with the drug dealer and his attorney.  Paul did all that he could to get Holly out of jail.  When she was freed on bond, Holly told him that she was flying to Brazil.  Paul told her that she could not legally leave the country.  She did not care, she was going.  Paul was in the taxi with her, trying to convince her to stay in the country not only because of the upcoming trial, but due to the fact that she had received a telegram from her boyfriend that their relationship was over.  Paul was also trying to convince Holly that they loved each other and that they should be together.  It was not until Holly, in another of her appalling behavioral acts, kicked the cat out of the taxi, that Paul began thinking with his brain, not his heart.  Paul yelled at Holly saying that she was doomed to be what she is, she will never be able to trust anyone and that her fantasies of Tiffany's and Brazil will not change any of it.  Paul exited the cab and threw a ring that he had had engraved at Tiffany's for her.  Holly realized that she had been deceiving herself regarding her feelings for Paul.   <br />Even though Paul was not wealthy, she loved him and he loved her.  He was the one for her, and up to this point, she thought that love had to have money attached to it.  As we see by Holly leaving the cab to look for Paul and the cat that she had earlier said did not belong to her, her outlook on love has changed.  So, the story line completely turns around.  Not that any person paying the slightest attention to the film could not see it coming.  But in the end, the love story came together showing that the apparent vibe people received from Holly had no effect on how Paul felt about her and they both realized that they were meant to be together.  Having this sudden reverse of not only the female character, but also Paul giving up on Holly, makes Breakfast at Tiffany's a more notable movie. <br /> <br />paul s <br />
B00005JMAH|2.0|Let me say one thing, Okay, several things.  But this is the most important.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (POA from here on out)  is my favorite book of the series. <br /> <br />POA the Movie:  I  WAS MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.   <br />The one thing that miraculously remaine din tact was the character of Remus Lupin (my second favorite character after Sirius Black).  I don't know how he came out right.  He is the one character that manages to retain any humanity and emote the slightesr bit.  In fact, he earned ALL TWO STARS I posted.   <br /> <br />Other than that, the film was extremely lacking. <br />Extremely! <br />Crucial plot points are omitted,  I MAJOR PLOT POINTS, I might add.  Important scenes lose their meaning when there is no history to back them up.  Many classic Lupin scenes, The connection of the Marauders to the map, and the appearance of Sirius as \\"the Grm\\" at the Quidditch match are completely missing.  Hence, any meaning behind Harry's Patronus is lost.  As is Lupin's self esteem.  Read the Book to see why he says he leaves.  Then watch the movie.  See how much character development got left out.  The same goes for Sirius, who I loved in the book!  He seems to get the abbreviated version of his role in the book. <br />Bad Points?  Lots, the most deviant ones I have already pointed out.  There are a few others that just can't be overlooked and do not deserve their own paragraphs. <br />1.  I LOVE WEREWOLVES.  I HATE THE DESIGN OF THIS ONE.  I HATE IT.  IT IS COMICAL.  EVEN MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SISTER THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.  FUNNY! In the book, it is a giant, maniacal wolf bent on destruction!  It's scary!  Who approved this thing?     <br />2.  Why does every single established character feel like a prop?  Its like they are all cameos in a movie that never takes time to explore how they feel, or their relationships.  Gone are the complex relationships and squabble sof the book.  They are replaced with random bits of conversation that act as though you're \\"in\\" on everything. <br />3.  What happened to Malfoy's hair?  For a slick, elitist Slytherin, he seems to have almost completely vanished, save for that horrible 'do.  Looks like the suave rival turned in his sexy pomade cut for....wait for it...a bowl cut! ~.~ <br /> <br />My advice?  Read the book.  Again.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie kept me laughing throughout its entirety.  The satire in this movie was equally hilarious.  It shined a humorous light on the idea of weapons of mass destruction, michael moore, terrorists and other government issues.  I would definitely recommend seeing this movie if you enjoy political satire and are not offended by crude jokes.
068987474X|5.0|This book was a hilarious yet riveting way to understand men.  I believe that it is very true in a way.  If a man can not call, pay extra attention to you, or stop his nasty habits, he is just not into you, and now it is easier to understand hearing all these stories.  The author puts it in words plain and simple,  once you read the book, you will understand if he does not put you first, he is just not into you, so why waste your valuable time.  I have passed this books onto friends and it is a vauable tool for the single woman in today's society.
B000001FKY|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over since buying it about a year ago.  I also bought Pyromania at the same time and I enjoy it just as much.  I had no idea what to expect when I bought these two albums, all I knew is that I had heard a lot of good thing about them.  So, what is so great about this album?  first of all lets start with the singer/composer Joe Elliot.  This guy has a voice that just screams Rock.  His voice is unique and it never ceases to amaze me.  I was also impressed when I found out that he composes all of their instrumentals.  Somehow he is able to make all of the instrumentals flow together so smoothly. <br /> <br />Another great thing about this album is the Drummer Rick Allen.  This guy has what it takes to be the icon of all drummers, and he only has one arm.  I have played this album for a couple of my friends who are drummers and they can't figure out how he does it.  Losing an arm would easily end the career of most musicians but not Rick.  It is really hard to fathom how he is able to play so well. <br /> <br />All I have to say is buy this album, sit back and enjoy.  I have listened to hundreds of albums, and this is without question one of the greates albums ever.
B0006213WG|4.0|Their 4th album and best yet. Finally a band that hasnt sofened their image to \\"radio friendly\\" in order to make more money. They have done the opposite.

If you werent a fan of DTLI, this one wont be for you.

B00030590I|5.0|What will strike you with Hero is how beautiful the film looks. Zhang Yimou and Christopher Doyle's collaboration on the visuals virtually make Hero a stunning picture book about ancient China. Add to that a narrative that's reminiscent of Rashomon, and you have a film that's both simple and complicated. Simple, since it is basically a one-act play wherein Nameless (Jet Li) walks up to the King of the Qin, a privilege he got after allegedly dispensing three notorious assassins, to tell his story of the events. Complicated since Nameless' version is different from the King's and it is revealed, layer by layer, that each assassin, including Nameless, have different agendas. Each subplot is profound and examines the theme of what it takes to be a hero and the sacrifices you have to make to be one (a theme also explored in Spiderman 2).      And it may be just me but there's also an underlying propaganda in the end when one must sacrifice his ideals for the good of many.     And just like a later Zhang Yimou period drama, House of Flying Daggers, Hero is at its most basic, a love story framed by the tumultuous period of the Seven Kingdoms.     All in all, Hero is highly recommended.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|After a long wait,Explorers has finally come to DVD.Unfortunately,Paramount decided to make it a relatively barebones release,so anyone expecting all the bells and whistles will be disappointed.The only extras are two additional scenes....there's not even a trailer.And the picture quality isn't the best.The film looks a bit grainy and the colors seem washed out in some parts.The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is pretty good,however but could've used some more bottom end.As for the film itself,those without an open mind and a vivid imagination probably won't like it.The ending of Explorers has often been the subject of much criticism but I've always found it to be highly entertaining.Robert Picardo(who would later go on to star as The Doctor in the Star Trek:Voyager series) is hilarious in all three parts he plays.And the three young actors(Ethan Hawke,the late River Phoenix and Jason\\"Where Is He Now?\\" Presson) all do a fine job of portraying three regular kids who happen to hook up with an alien species.Explorers is lightweight sci-fi but it never tries to be anything else.Hopefully,Paramount will issue a 20th Anniversary special edition sometime next year and get it right once and for all.
B000002J03|5.0|Zep's rip-snortin' second album hits the listener like a ton of sonic bricks. I don't know what means, but metaphors fail in trying to describe this album.  <br /> <br />Kicking off with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" -- perhaps the best album-opening song ever -- the band romps through the blues landscape with all the subtlety of a bull on Red Bull.  <br /> <br />A jammin' \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" leads nicely into \\"The Lemon Song\\", a balls-out hardcore blues tribute that borders on parody (\\"Squeeze my lemon 'till the juice runs down my leg!\\"). <br /> <br />Things back off for a minute for the classic ballad \\"Thank You\\", which melts into \\"Heartbreaker\\", which showcases the band's raw talent for pumping out some of most extraordinary hard blues numbers ever scratched into vinyl. That song springs right into the frenetic \\"Living Loving Maid\\" with its unforgettably misogynistic lyrics: \\"Alimony, alimony payin' your bills/When your conscience hits you knock it back with pills.\\" <br /> <br />The album starts moving towards conclusion with the exotic \\"Ramble On\\" that mixes the poetic (\\"Leaves are falling all around/time I was on my way\\") with the fantastic that hinted at singer Robert Plant's obsession with mythology and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" epic (\\"But Gollum, the evil one/Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her yeah).   <br /> <br />The album wraps up with the best rock drum solo ever (\\"Moby Dick\\") and the electrifying jam \\"Bring It On Home\\", which lulls you in with oozing harmonica, then slams you back with a blues jam that could only come from the greatest band ever... Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|First off, I am amazed by the one-star reviewers on this forum who spend their one or two paragraphs' worth of commentary on Michael Moore's character rather than on his FILM (which is supposed to be the subject of these reviews). One, this is oddly typical of right-wingers to indulge in character assaults when they can't form coherent arguments to back what they support; and two, this is telling in that most of said one-star reviewers probably haven't even bothered to see the film.<br /><br />I have to admit, I am not a huge Michael Moore fan and was initially reluctant to see his most recent movie. I had viewed him as somewhat of a blowhard, albeit a mostly well-intentioned one--a Rush Limbaugh of the left, as is oft his comparison. I was already against the war in Iraq even before the first boots hit the ground there, so I felt that his movie was \\"preaching to the choir\\" when my husband and I went to see it for the first time, and didn't feel Moore's movie would offer anything I didn't already know or think for myself.<br /><br />After having seen it (and afterwards buying the DVD), I am glad to admit that I'd judged this movie--and Moore--quite wrongly. Fahrenheit 9/11 not only takes a compassionate view of the 9/11 victims and families, but also of the soldiers going to fight a war that a lot of us Stateside, and all over the world, didn't want. By taking the focus off of himself--which is thankful, given that he can \\"grandstand\\" a lot by pulling some really cute ice-cream truck prankery that doesn't do a whole lot of good)--he's able to send home a lot of compelling messages about the rife corruption in the Bush administration and how it is tearing not only the Iraqi people, but our own people, apart.<br /><br />Although I didn't previously dispute the wrong reasons for going to war in Iraq that Moore brings up, I was really surprised (and frankly sickened) to learn about how deeply our administration (and the Bush family) is entrenched in the oil biz and the Saudi government--which is arguably equally as oppressive as the Taliban, especially in its treatment of women. The right-wingers' hair-splitting of how Moore \\"twists the facts\\" is lost here; he has clearly done some great research and backs up his claims with interviews and official documents that underscore the coverups and corruption in the Bush administration.<br /><br />Thus, most of what Moore presents in this movie is believable and credible; it blows my mind that many on the right can dispute the perspectives of military officials' interviews, documents, and film strips of the President himself in action--or inaction, is more like it. The most compelling of these perspectives is that of Lila Lipscomb, an admitted conservative Democrat who supports the military fervently, but mourns her son's death in a war that was not necessary.<br /><br />All of this being said, the movie is not without its problems or flaws. I already mentioned the ice-cream truck shenanigans--typical Moore of anyone who's ever caught his cable show--and also his portrayal of the pre-war Iraq being an almost Western-like fairyland in which everyone was happy and complicit under Saddam's totalitarian regime.<br /><br />This latter portrayal is disingenuous; but it underlines the point that replacing one totalitarian regime with another, especially under the false pretense of \\"democracy\\", is wrong--and this is the crux of what I think Michael Moore is trying to say. I really came out of the theatre after watching this movie with a renewed respect for Moore and his filmmaking. He has a big heart and a profound message, and this movie is definitely worth seeing.d the Saudi government--which is arguably equally as oppressive as the Taliban, especially in its treatment of women.

0061020680|5.0|I don't care whether your a garbage man or a CEO (or a really messy CEO who happens to constantly be picking up trash) one of the most difficult problems in life is finding the place were you can feel you belong. Pratchet, in the few of his books I've read (mostly the Night Watch part of Disk world with Carrot and Vimes), has a great knack for illustrating this problem and showing how his characters find ways to overcome it.    In Mort Death is tired of his endless job, ushering the souls of the living into the after life. Not a bad job, it just gets to be boring doing the same thing since the dawn of time. He locates what seems to be a suitable replacement in Mort; a clumsy, self-conscious youth who seems cannot do anything correctly.  Death did not know that when he brought Mort on as his apprentice. Queue wackiness. In the aftermath they both realize that their place in life found them without any help.    Once again, Terry Pratchet has shown why he is counted among the best fantasy writers in the business. His wit and intelligence illuminate every page and I would highly recommend this to any fantasy reader who values mirth as much as content.    In addition, there are two great \\"So you would like to. . .\\" lists that show the exact chronology of the series that I found most helpful.

Many of their singers faded from popularity as quickly as they emerged, leaving a legacy of doubtful importance but a few did rise above the rest. The star which shone the brightest was Kylie.<br /><br />Nobody who was around in Britain in the late eighties will ever forget the chorus line of her first hit - I should be so lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky - it's the kind of song you either love or hate. Many hate it, and I sometimes feel I ought to - but no, I love it. There was always something about Kylie, even then, that set her apart as something special. A lot of other people must have loved it, too, because it went to number one on the UK charts.<br /><br />The album was produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who wrote all the songs except for Locomotion (the Little Eva sixties classic), a cover that helped to convince me that Kylie should be taken seriously. Indeed, Locomotion provided Kylie with her only huge American hit during this period. It peaked at number two in the UK, as did Je ne sais pas porqoui (an English language song despite it's chorus line) and Got to be certain.<br /><br />While many will continue to dismiss Kylie (especially her early albums), she is much better than many of the singers she is sometimes compared to, and has proved it by lasting longer than any of her critics thought possible.<br /><br />Note that this CD is also available via the boxed set - Kylie Minogue x3. It's only three individual CD's wrapped in a cardboard slipcase but it's much cheaper than buying the three separately.
068987474X|5.0|This book was amazing.  A great deal of the information is common sense, however it was wonderful to get a man's perspective on the issues as well as to realize that other people make the same silly mistakes I do.  I feel like a different person after reading it.  I have already had a chance to put some of the ideas to work, and I feel like I really do have the power over wasting time on a guy who doesn't know if he wants to be with me or cutting my losses and moving on to someone better.  Dating values have been lost, and this book will help women demand they return.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This completely fraudulent attempt at a documentary is being dismantled piece-by-piece by those who are unearthing the REAL reasons behind this farce of a movie (boy, that was a crazy sentence...).  Seriously, this is black helicopter kookiness at its worst, with some bald-faced lies and distortions sprinkled on top.  This is a movie for sheeple who don't take the time find out about how the real world functions.  Must be nice for MM to go around to colleges preaching his complete BS for $40,000 a pop.  What a joke...keep buying his drivel at your own peril, nothing else.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This is a great way for Bruce to return to Maiden. This album contains some phenomenal songs (i.e.-Blood Brothers and Ghost of The Navigator).  Anyone who gave up on Maiden once Bruce left needs to pick this album up and give it a thorough listen- you will not be disappointed!
1594200106|5.0|This book captures you. It is not on my \\"desert island\\" list but I had a hard time putting it down. It alternately had my pulse racing,  heart breaking and brain super sluething. Not a bad combination for sitting curled up by the fire with a glass of wine and some Saint-Saens. It is probably not a literary classic but there are some lovely turns of phrase that will make you feel like you've read one.
B0002VKZL6|1.0|For about 20 years now MK has been my favorite song-writer and guitar player. However, since the nothing hillbillies album i have been witnessing his \\"dire straits\\" soul fade away as he introduced the \\"American\\" twist into his music. To demonstrate the change let me use a synonym: Dire Straits conveyed me the deep soul of the foggy rainy Englander whereas, the new music of MK conveys me the shallow soul of a man having great aspirations for being american. <br /> <br />You are not an Americak Mark. Why do you care about Mason-Dixon line, postcard from Paraguay, or New Orleans? More so, what has steel-paddle guitar to do with musich of foggy rainy England soul?  <br /> <br />I wish MK went back to his British roots, do away with his aspirations to America, pick up his Strat with almost no effects, and do something like he did in the \\"Dire Straits - 1978\\" and \\"Communique\\" with just two guitars (hopefully with David Knopfler), a bass(John Illsley), and a drum (Pick Withers).  <br /> <br />I am afraid, anything other than this, is bound to be a second-tier work, just like Shangri-La. <br /> <br />If you happen to read this review Mark, I hope you dont mind me saying all this. It is not meant to hurt you at all. I really think you owe good music to the Dire Straits fans. <br /> <br />Tolga Sobaci
0743454529|4.0|That's what this book showed me.  Imagine that the only reason you exist is for a harvest, a collection vehicle if you will... sort of like I imagine chickens and cows being.  Your only purpose (so you think) is not for yourself but for someone else.  The story was told from views of other characters in the story and was well written, except I still have problems with the Mother in it.  I cried at the end and was 'in' the main characters eyes when she explained how 'invisible' she was in the family... except for her purpose, yet, she had no idea how valuable she really was.  It's about choices and accepting those choices.  The last few chapters had me in tears, yet enlightened me.
0767830555|5.0|What can be said about such a classic? I just wanted to point out one scene in Taxi Driver that I havent heard many people talk about. I believe Travis is watchin Soul Train or something of that sort and there is a slow song playing and everyone is dancing in couples. You then see Travis's face and you can almost see the tears and despair in his face. He sees eveyone on the T.V. with someone, with some form of companionship, whether it be just for TV or real. When they show Travis's face, you can tell he realizes he'll never have that. The lonliness in his face is saddening and I think this one scene really brings home the lonliness and despair Travis feels.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|This is absolutely a five-star film. I'm amazed at how few reviews it's had. Most of the reviews are on the money, but for some reason don't feel this is a \\"Great\\" film. I have a nine year old boy to watch it with, and I'm sure that colors my judgement, but it's up there with my favorites. I'm a Guillermo del Toro junkie. If you like Blade 2, this beats the socks off of it! It's not really in line with his other films, however. Spiderman was a different kind of hero movie, and X-Men doesn't come close to Hellboy for me. Hellboy isn't really a hero movie. Hellboy just HAPPENS to be a hero. He's a average working stiff with serious social handicaps. This would probably compare better to Edward Scissorhands, without the fluff and curlyques.<br /><br />Well, that's a girl's point of view. Hope this helps!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original Star Wars trilogy is among the most watched and beloved film series in movie history.  The films have moved past being mere movies into cultural icons.  What other movies could spark such a heated debate over enhancements and updates as these films have done.  Internet sites have been set up specifically to discuss the changes.  Some of the changes work in the film (the new Jabba is much more realistic looking), while some are completely ridiculous especially the insertion of Hayden Christensen in Return Of The Jedi. One wish would have been for George Lucas to do what his good friend Steven Spielberg did with E.T., release two versions of each film, one in its original release and the other in the updated release.  That being said, the films look outstanding in their DVD presentation.  The films are one of the last handful of classic films to see their release on DVD and they are welcome in any version.  The bonus disk is outstanding and the two and half documentary, Empire Of Dreams is superb unto itself.  The changes to the films are merely superficial, the true heart of the stories remain intact.  It is the struggle of the Rebel forces to overcome the evil Empire that keeps you interested and that remains undiluted.
0156029065|3.0|The book is an interesting \\"playful romp\\" through the Middle Ages. <br />  <br />It is an unconventional but, on balance, engaging palette of historical fiction, whodunit and fantasy. Good stuff. The author has dreamt up a wondrous story. However, from a technical standpoint, the writing does the tale insufficient justice: poor character and scenery development are the main flaws here. The writer does not have anywhere near the literary power of, say, a Marquez or a Rushdie to compel the reader toward the action, the place, and the minds of the characters. <br /> <br />I found an interesting feature which makes the book worth talking about. It is a clever, but unfortunately bungled literary experiment. Here's the deal... <br /> <br />Baudolino is a fanciful story told by a confessed liar, right? OK, this means that the reader is not supposed to be sure which parts of Baudolino's story are true and which he fabricated. If you like, the book we hold in our hands is a work of fiction (Baudolino's tale) contained inside a larger work of fiction (Eco's account of Baudolino's storytelling). That is pretty cool. But there's more to it... <br /> <br />The key to making this literary form work lies with Niketas (spelling?), the Byzantine character who listened to Baudolino's ripping yarns. If you think about it, Niketas is the fictional counterpart of you (or me), the flesh-and-blood reader of the book by Eco. Niketas listens to Baudolino in first person just as we listen to Baudolino in third person. That's also pretty cool. But, therein lies the problem... <br /> <br />We, the readers, ought to come away with the same impression about Baudolino as Niketas does. But, if you remember from the book, Niketas was never totally blown away by Baudolino and his tall tales. He was moderately interested, but largely skeptical, bemused, and ambivalent. Sadly, by analogy, that is the same way most readers are going to feel about the book by Eco. <br /> <br />Eco should have worked harder to make Niketas totally enraptured and engaged by his compatriot Baudolino. Eco seems not to have realized that we, the readers, will ultimately feel the same emotions toward Baudolino as does our embedded counterpart, Niketas. <br /> <br />So, ooops...but a good try! Maybe the next person who attempts this literary technique will correct Eco's fatal flaw and knock us out...
B00005O5CM|5.0|As an unnatural blonde, I loved this movie.  Reese Witherspoon is so endearing in this movie as the brilliant, but clueless Elle Woods.
0131177052|5.0|What Refactoring was to design, Working Effectively with Legacy Code is to (developer) testing.  If you \\"can't write tests\\" because of your design (or lack of) this book will show you how.

B000002HRE|5.0|This is one of the first Metallica albums I ever bought. I told myself that I was going to get all of their recent stuff, because I loved the album so much. So I got the Black Album, Load, Garage Inc., and S&M. But then I realized they had more albums. So I ended up buying all of their cd's. A truly great band. Maturation or not, this is the premier band of the 1980's,1990's. Reguardless of what people say, Metallica is the 7th biggest selling act of the world.
B00005ATQD|1.0|Probably the single biggest theatrical disappointment of my life. This movie is the only film I have ever seen that I just couldn't bear to sit through. The characters were thin, the plot went no where, and the acting could be likened to a 4th grade christmas pagent. The interaction in the film felt like a crappy sequel to Catcher in the Rye, that is to say all the relationships were one dimentional and felt like they were writen by some psychotic hermit.  <br /> <br />What made this movie worse than other movies I hated like Battlefield Earth and The Skulls was the great lengths they seemed to go to try to make it \\"artistic\\". Well, that and films like Dr. Strangelove getting my hopes up.  <br /> <br />If you are the kind of person that likes to try and find deeper meaning in everything so you can feel sophisticated you might like it though.

A reversed curse brings them back from Old Salem to modern New England to continue their evil ways.  But can they handle the twentieth century?<br /><br />Bette Midler is at her very best with hilarious one-liners and facial expressions that will have you laughing uncontrollably!

B00005J6UP|5.0|This is an 80s masterpiece.  It's a comedy adventure about a group of young boys and a few girls who go on an adventure to find the hidden treaure of legendary pirate \\"one eyed willey.\\"  Along the way they encounter many obsticals such as booby traps and the Fratelli family, who are counterfeits and murderers.  Slong the way there is much to be laughed at and some to learn.  If you don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you.
B0002858YS|5.0|I bought this album in august and didn't stop playing it in my car till october.  They have a unique sound, and the none of the songs sound the same.  Very cool songs, e.g. Jenny was a friend of mine, Smile like you mean it, Andy you're a star.<br />They also sound really good live.
B00003CX9Q|2.0|I do like this movie, but I have to only give it an average rating. Unfortunately, Spielberg fell short in some key areas that could have made this movie great, rather than mediocre. However, we all know that Spielberg is no Sam Firstenberg, the ultra-talented director of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Firstenberg would have made E.T. a film for the ages, but unfortanetly he was overlooked so we the movie goer got a mediocre film.  <br />   The biggest problem is the location. ET lands in some California suburb. If he would have landed in the ghetto with Ozone (Shabba-Doo) and Turbo (Boogaloo Shrimp) - the stars of Breakin' 2 and my idols - ET would have loved Earth and wouldn't have gotten sick and wanted to return home to his native planet. Not only would Ozone and Turbo teach ET how to dress and talk really def, but more importantly they would have taught ET how to pop and lock. Dancing would have made ET feel at home here on Earth. Plus, ET would have gotten more involved in the community and wouldn't be a social outkast. Turbo and Ozone included all nationalities into their posse,and I'm sure they would have excepted an alien from outer space as well. But even if after all the excitement of dancing in the streets ET wanted to return home to outer space, I'm sure Turbo and Ozone would have gone with him, which would have been a perfect segway for a great sequel. Turbo and Ozone would have wanted to take their breakdancing intergalactic and spread their culture to the undergrounds of the galaxy. Firstenberg would have exploited this opportunity for a sequel, but Speilberg lacks vision and creativity and therefore ET didn't have a sequel. Firstenberg however is the master of the sequel...after all he did create the greatest sequel of all-time Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.
B000020617|4.0|Everyone should have this album. I like all the songs on this album.
B000286RKW|1.0|I don't get this film. There is no positive message whatsoever. Swearing, killing and stealing don't lead to a great life. I was sad to see Joe Pesce stoop to such a low in his career. He was soooooo great in Home Alone, but then he has this vulgar piece of doo-doo on his resume. The only part I liked was Jimmy \\"Two Time\\" when he says \\"Get the papers, get the papers.\\" I laughed and laughed. I rewinded to that part at least 27 times. But then laughter turned to fear when I thought Joe Pesce's character was going to come through the screen and pop a cap in my noodle for laughing. Overall, the movie was poorly written and badly directed. It wasn't upbeat and postive nor was it colorful and fun like my all-time favorite movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. <br />    I wish these characters would follow the lead of Ozone (Shabba-Doo) and Turbo (Boogaloo Shrimp) in Electric Boogaloo (or Breakin' 1 for that matter). They came from the streets but they didn't have potty mouths. Instead they used their hip street slang to convey their message of hope. Furthermore, they didn't need to use killing and stealing to get out of the ghetto. They used their dancing....popping and locking and breaking. Plus, they welcomed all nationalities into their inner circle of friends, the only thing they asked for was that you were willing to dance. Ozone and Turbo helped the community by saving the kid's community center, they didn't undermine it like these low life mobsters. Maybe in the future Martin Scorsece will take a lead from Sam Firstenberg, the director of Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. Firstenberg knows how to direct, Scorsece should take some lessons and maybe one day he'll actually create a meaningful film that will be remembered for decades to come.
B0001M3MZ2|5.0|Actually, Superman in this series is really Clark Kent,not the  <br />opposite. Superman is a title given to him by the People and the  <br />Daily Planet,The newspaper of Metropolis. Clark Kent was Kal-El <br />and now is a progeny of his step parents, The Kents. Clark Kent <br />had to create an alter ego in able to fit into society which as <br />we all know wouldn't accept an outworlder. I'm speaking in reference to the world of Smallville which is closer to the movies than the comic books.  <br />If your stuck on the comic books then this series won't suffice <br />in my opinion unless you treat it with an open mind. <br />I love this series and I embrace it for what it really is, relating to those who are afraid sometimes to be who they really <br />are in society in fear of persecution. Growing pains are represented here as well which is why I think it is relatable  <br />to the younger viewers. Give this series a try after watching  <br />the Original Superman movie...I think it will prove itself to all <br />viewers with its intelligence.
6305537321|3.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is a great lighthearted movie that any one could enjoy. It's full of romance, humor, and plot twists; all which are essential for any good movie. It begins with Holly Golightly, a beautiful young woman, getting out of a car and walking over to Tiffany's.  There she stares at all the beautiful diamonds  while she drinks her coffee. She feels that the store is safe, that \\"nothing bad could ever happen here.\\" Holly lives in an apartment with a very strict landlord, but doesn't usually abide by his rules. When she gets back to her place, we meet Fred, who's real name is actually Paul. He is a very well kept man who is moving in upstairs. Holly and Fred become good friends, but nothing more, because Fred has a mistress over quite frequently.  <br />   I enjoyed the movie, even though it was extremely predictable. Everyone knows that Ms. Golightly and Fred were going to fall in love, and that everything would be okay in the end. Despite this fact, it was entertaining and sentimental. It is very lively, and full of romance as well. There's something for everyone in this movie. Women love Fred's good looks, the beauty Audrey Hepburn radiates, and the love story between Holly and Fred. Men too love Audrey's beauty, and also the party scenes. There always seems to be some party where rich people are drunk. Kids too will love this movie because there are a lot of comedic scenes with Holly's landlord. He always knocks into something, or is always shouting ridiculous things down the balcony.  <br /> I felt that the director really made his audience feel connected to the characters. He made them seem like we were there with them, and that we were their best friends as well. It was a very feel good movie that left the audience wanting to know more. I would give this movie a high rating, because it was an all around entertaining movie that anyone could enjoy! <br />  <br /> <br />
B00006L9ZT|5.0|Just a technical correction, not a review. These DVDs are region 0 (play in all regions), not region 1 as advertised.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|But ... I was disappointed in the cd.  Most tracks sound like Ray was in one studio then the guest artist recorded from somewhere else at a different time.  There are exceptions ... and these are worth buying the cd for ... BB King, Gladys Knight and Natalie Cole.
0446608955|1.0|Very manipulative book. You can forsee where the author expects you to feel a certain way. That you do react in accordance is not due to the writer's skill but due to human weakness!  <br />Its a shame the author is so popular. It just shows that the populace has no discrimination.
B00005JNEI|4.0|This film is important to me for one reason:  it has helped pave the way for renewed dissent and open criticism of the Bush administration.  9/11 was obviously a significant event in this country, but those who think that Americans have somehow lost their right to speak their minds in this so-called \\"post 9/11 world\\" are wrong.      The film is certainly biased toward Moore's opinions; but it also reflects the opinions of a great many Americans.  Detractors of this film can say what they want, but it's hard to argue with footage of Rumsfeld shaking hands with Saddam.  It's hard to argue with the \\"Commander in Chief\\" sitting on his duff reading a children's book after hearing the country is under attack.  It's hard to argue that people in our government haven't used the fear and anxiety of 9/11 to manipulate the people of this country.      I would have preferred the film to have focused more on the facts and less on opinion and entertainment, but that doesn't put people in the seats.  Moore manages to make some important arguments that have clearly reached a new audience.  That's not easy in a country as apathetic and misinformed as America.

0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is among the funniest books I've ever read.  This story of a sane man in an insane world follows an airman's exploits in Europe during World War II.  Yossarian, the main character, has only one goal:  to stay alive when so many people are trying to kill him.   <br /> <br />The characters of the book, comprised mainly of members of his unit and various higher-ups, are well-developed and lead to a lot of laughs.  Because of the depth and quantity of characters like Milo Minderbender and Major Major, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of who's who but well worth the read.
B00005AQE8|5.0|A classic from an icon.  He was much more than a rapper and he was taken from us way too early.  I try to imagine how the game would be now if he were still with us, a whole lot different and better I'm sure.  This album was a revolution in being the first double disc rap cd and it was on a label that ruled the world at the time.  It has 12 classics, 2 songs I skip, and the rest are good or great.  The production is great, Johnny J (11 songs), Daz Dillinger (5 songs), Doug Rasheed, Mike MOsely & Rick Rock, And Dr. Dre each do 2 songs, DeVante, DJ Quik, Bobcat, DJ Pooh, and QD3 all do 1 song.  Features the Outlawz on a lot of trax (R.I.P. Kadafi) as well as fellow death row inmates and some of the bay area rappers as well as a few others.

B000002UYZ|4.0|I would definitely recommend this set (along with the follow up: \\"1967-1970\\" set) for the casual fan who wants a nice collection of Beatles hits, without having to buy all of the original studio albums.  I never used to like the Beatles.  But, having entered my 30s, I have grown quite fond of their music.  There is no denying the fact that they were musical geniuses and have had a tremendous impact on several generations.  My only complaint is that the record company \\"milked\\" the consumer by spreading 60 minutes of material over 2 CDs and charged over $30 for it.  However, when you take a look at the quality of material here and the impact the Beatles have had on pop music and culture, it almost seems like a fair price.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Since the introduction of high-end DVD releases, the public has been anticipating the release of the original Star Wars trilogy. When it was finally released, I raced to pick it up. Popped it into my DVD player. When it was all over, my reaction was, \\"That's it!?\\" <br /> <br />George Lucas was quoted as claiming that he was holding off on the release of the trilogy on DVD because he wanted to do \\"something special.\\" This was the biggest letdown since we first heard the word \\"midichlorians.\\" (A word apparently having to do with computer-audio interfacing for a swimming pool.) \\"Something special\\" seems to mean \\"when we can get the most money and advertise the most stuff.\\" It most certainly did not mean enhancements to the movies or bonus materials. <br /> <br />\\"From Star Wars to Jedi\\" and \\"Star Wars: Behind the Magic\\" both offered more in-depth and comprehensive insights into the making of the trilogy than these bonus features. <br /> <br />Hard-core fans know that there were deleted scenes from each movie, none were included. There was, however, wonderful commercials for Episode 3 and all the great video games...which kind of blows the collector value of the set. <br /> <br />To top it all off - and I know this is a tiny, insignificant detail except for the hard core fans - Jeremy Bulloch's voice for Boba Fett was replaced by Temuera Morrison...apparently to try to add some kind of continuity to the depressingly tragic prequels George has been pushing off on us. <br /> <br />George set the bar really high, and has been failing to reach it ever since the recording of the famous \\"Yub-Nub\\" song at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" (Removed, thankfully, in the Special Edition release...but replaced with the stupid song-and-dance number in Jabba's palace at the beginning.) <br /> <br />The movies are great, don't get me wrong. It's nice to finally get surround sound for these movies. Still, for the amount of time that the public had to wait, and the price that has to be paid for the trilogy, we kind of expected more. <br /> <br />At least we didn't see a Pepsi(R) logo emblazoned on the side of the Millenium Falcon in this version...and please, George, don't get any ideas.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Not, Dream Theater is terrible....all they do is make a soundscape and John Petrucci does his Malmsteen thing.  Time changes and very fast songs for 13 minutes, WHATS THE DAMN POINT??  Ugh this album is boring.    They should stick to short melodic songs a la Innocence Faded and Solitary Shell, great songs, but they even wreck their own song by thinking they have to put some instrumental that should have nothing to do with the songs at the end.    Anyway, steer clear of this album unless you're already in the Dream Theater cult of 15 minutes of boredom.

But it's not that they're \\"just not that into you\\"!    Some guys don't believe you are interested in them for themselves. Can he offer a comfortable life? Is that why you want him? Does he sense that - but still likes you? Complicated, isn't it?!    Some guys may not share this vision of standard New York dating. Not into alternatives? Fine, but again, it's not because he's \\"just not that into you\\"! - By the way, many non-starter romantic relationships blossom into beautiful friendships.    Some guys haven't seen SATC and cannot smell what you expect of them!      Obviously, if the guy's a no-hoper, not for you, or REALLY not responding, don't waste your time. Maybe he doesn't want to hurt you? Ideally, both should declare their intentions. But few can handle that, esp. so soon. And besides, how many guys are communicative?!    Also, realise women are now independent and responsible for themselves. Both parties must bring something to the relationship. Build yourself and your life up. Love yourself first. Waiting is death.    So?  Men are complicated.  Women are complicated.  Relationships are even more complicated.  Deal with it.    Oh, and maybe he IS \\"just not that into you\\"!  Add that to the book's list of excuses.
B00005JN7O|1.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was complete rubbish. The vapid Paltrow as the leading female and the shallow, obvious but boring plot really made me mourn the lost hour. I think Soul Plane was better than this... <br />The worst part was that it had such great potential. The main draw is the nostalgic backdrops in blue screen, but unfortunately, the bad script made the visuals the only saving grace. The characters could have been better developed. Paltrow's character was completely annoying and distracting to the movie. We get too much silly, selfish newsreporter and very little of the other potentially \\"cool\\" characters (or they would have been cool if the plot actually revealed more about these people): heroic pilot, russian camper, british daredevil, dirty-faced asian, newspaper editor, mad scientist. Unfortunately, the cool characters last less than a flicker during the movie. The stills are a much better way to appreciate the landscape. Ah well, unfortunate...
B00003CXGG|2.0|How much more is Joel Silver going to do these type of movies? They're way overdone now. I've enjoyed the last couple I've watched, they've not been mind-blowing, but I enjoyed Cradle 2 The Grave. There's just no humour in this. Anthony Anderson doesn't play the cuddly, funny guy and team up with whatshisface, like in the other movies, he's more the hard nut guy, which I really didn't like.<br /><br />The only interesting bits of this movie were when Jet Li comes onto the screen. You know there's gonna be trouble when this little guy's around! But when he wasn't on screen, and there was no fancy martial arts going on, the whole film slowed down considerably. These martial arts films are getting old, and there's lots of little short bursts of action, and pointless, non-memorable scenes in-between. Some of the scenes I did enjoy were the x-ray bone breaking shots. They were very well done and added something to the shot, that you wouldn't have normally seen. The music's just as great as any other of Joel Silver's movies: kicking hip hop music, and of course, DMX & Aaliyah both get songs on the soundtrack. As soon as the film starts, you're nodding your head along with the soundtrack, although it can be a little intrusive at times.<br /><br />DMX is practically given top billing in this, but only appears in two scenes, and dies in the second one. What was the point in him being in the film, disappointing all his female fans by dying?! Excuse me?!<br /><br />This was the only movie released featuring Aaliyah during her short life-time, and she had so much potential. Although the hair's slightly too much backcombed! I hadn't heard any of her music when she died, but knew the name vaguely.<br /><br />There was no point in calling this Romeo Must Die, cos it almost implies, that there's gonna be a Romeo & Juliet kinda storyline. Hardly. From somebody who lives & breathes this romance stuff, it goes little beyond some heavy eye contact, and bad dancing from Jet Li's side. I found it difficult to differentiate between the two families, except they wanted to kill each other. That's the only similarity, and Shakespeare is currently spinning in his grave. Jet Li gets called Romeo once if I remember correctly during the movie, but the movie could have been given another name, and people wouldn't have made the links towards Romeo & Juliet so easily.<br /><br />For a movie that features hip hop so much, of course in the extras, you get your typical music videos, many featuring Aaliyah. These extras are: documentary: \\"Making Romeo Must Die\\"; music video: \\"Try Again\\" by Aaliyah; music video: \\"Come Back in One Piece\\" by Aaliyah and \\"DMX\\"; making-of Aaliyah's \\"Try Again\\" video; craft mini-documentaries: \\"Anatomy of a Stunt\\", \\"Diary of a (Legal) Mad Bomber\\", \\"Inside the Visual Effects Process\\" and \\"The Soundstage\\"; action scene mini-documentaries: \\"Stairway Dance\\", \\"Kung Fu Football\\", \\"A Benz, a Bike, a Babe and Some Badass Kung Fu\\", \\"The Hose\\" and \\"Master on Fire\\".<br /><br />I would give this movie a miss to be honest, if you fancied seeing it. I'm differing whether to give it a 2 or a 3 out of five. I've seen better movies that deserved a 3, I'm just not sure. Go watch Cradle 2 The Grave instead, that's much better. And has DMX in it in more than just two measly scenes.side. I found it difficult to differentiate between the two families, except they wanted to kill each other.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is a great family movie--I have three children ages 14, 9, and 6 and this is one movie we could all enjoy.  Buddy is so sweet, charming and loveable. He is kind to everyone, including a pretty awful dad who is on the naughty list. There are many good, wholesome lessons about kindness and of course Christmas. I just hope they will do another movie.

B00005RHGK|2.0|Why rehash the plot when you've probably read the editorial reviews and many user reviews? I'll just tell you what I liked/disliked about \\"Jeepers Creepers,\\" give you a conclusion and let you make up your own mind.  <br /> <br />The Good: The first 30-45 minutes or so of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" are excellent. Unlike many horror film directors, Salva has the restraint to slowly build a truly creepy atmosphere and introduces characters -- siblings Trish and Darry -- who are even more stupid than your average horror protagonists but at least come across as actual human beings and not just cannon fodder. Even when they did something stupid (about every 10 minutes by my count) I found myself rooting for them. Salva's direction is also very stylish, from the initial haunting shot of a car slowly, silently coming toward the camera from a deserted mid-West all the way through the well-choreographed action scenes. And finally, the art direction is very interesting. The style of car the protagonists drive and the desolate country settings add up to a sort of retro-50s, drive-in movie look that I liked.  <br /> <br />The Bad: Wow, does this movie fall apart fast. After spending nearly an hour showing remarkable restraint, introducing characters that we like and building a sense of dread in the audience, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" spills all of its secrets and completely ruins what could've been one of the best horror films I've seen in years. What made the Creeper so frightening in the first part of the movie is that the audience doesn't know what the protagonists are up against. Once Salva reveals his (admittedly good-looking) creature from the black lagoon ripoff, \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" descends into incoherent self-parody and isn't frightening in the least.  <br /> <br />One particularly stupid move was to stick a psychic into the picture about midway in one of the most hamhanded information dumps I've ever seen. Here's a tip for all screenwriters: Never include a psychic in your movie if 1) He/she doesn't actually clarify anything, anyway and 2) the character has no effect whatsoever on the plot. Just plain stupid.  <br /> <br />Overall I'd like to give the movie 3 or more stars, just on direction and atmosphere alone. Salva obviously knows how to frame a shot and the beginning of the picture is excellent. But the script and the second half of the movie is so totally inept that I can't justify more than two stars; watching what could've been a great movie unravel was truly disappointing.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Contrary to the Bond franchise - the Bourne movies seem built on realism, instead of phony, make-believe gadgets and guns. This will probably - if it hasn't already - become Matt Damons' signature role.  And yes ladies and gentlemen, Matt Damon is a better actor than Ben Affleck.  The movie is excellent and quite worthy of your purchase when it comes out on Video/DVD Dec. 7th 2004
B0002234LS|2.0|There are plenty of reviews of \\"Secret Window\\" so I'm not going to rehash the plot. I'll just tell you that the movie is a criminal waste of Johnny Depp and John Turturo's talents.  <br /> <br />Turturo is sufficiently menacing. Depp is believable as the eccentric protagonist. The movie has an interesting premise -- a manacing southerner accuses a reclusive author of stealing his story. The problem is that \\"Secret Window\\" telegraphs it's uninteresting \\"twist\\" ending so early that anyone who's seen the Sixth Sense, Identity, the Others, etc. will see it coming a mile away.  <br /> <br />The ending is totally predictable, unsatisfying and not half as clever as it thinks it is. I'd have given this movie one star if it weren't for Depp and Turturo. As it is, they elevate a movie that could've absolutely sucked to a level of boring forgetability.  <br /> <br />I can imagine enjoying \\"Secret Window\\" on cable on a hungover Sunday afternoon, but it's really not even worth a rental.
B00005JNEI|1.0|The lies and far-fetched subject of his new movie is just a micro-cosm of what this man really feels.  Instead of making a documentary with at least some fact behind it, Mr. Moore has made what is essentially a \\"Hate Bush\\" Movie and filled it with lies.  Look, I'm all for free-speech and every thing, but at least have some respect for the President.  I doubt Moore would be able to spend one day in the White House. And if your going to blast Bush - Back it up with fact.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was not very impressed and didn't expect much and did not go into the cinema. But then I rented the DVD and watched it. WOW. Instead of a stupid, effect overloaded horror movie, this movie feels like as it would happen in your neighborhood and feels so real. And there is neither evil nor monsters. The dark side is inside all of us and will come up based on decisions that we or our friends or parents make/made. <br /> <br />It really makes you wish that your kids will never come into such bad situations. I was very moved and touched by this very well played movie. It helped that I didn't know any of the actors and this made this very authentic and that it could happen around the corner. The directors show things which are normally not being touched by other directors because they are too risky. But they happen unfortunatly and therefore I think it is important to show things so that the society can work on it. <br /> <br />The movie makes you think about the importance of your decisions and makes you realize that not everything is black and white but everything comes with advantages and disadvantages. If a person decides to do A instead of B and it is not all perfect, going for B does not make it necessarily better. It will make it different. Some people are better off in B, some are in a worse situation on B. It shows the complexity of the chaos theory in social science. <br /> <br />If you want the Hollywood ending, watch the theatrical version. But I recommend rather watching the directors cut ending, if you want the \\"real\\" ending which the directors wanted in the first place but New Line Cinema wanted a different ending. For me the theatrical ending doesn't make too much sense. It is Hollywood. But the directos ending is surprising, stunning, and makes you think. Amazing, although not 100% clear. I was thinking about the movie a lot and I did not connect everything until I watched the film with the directors' comments. Then everything makes perfect sense. <br /> <br />I saw the movie now 3 times in three days and feel again and again stunned by the real feeling of the movie. Sure, nobody can time travel, but the time travel is just an instrument for the story to tell the real life situations. This is what separates this movie from others. The real life is in the foreground, effects/timetravel etc, are only instruments. A lot of other movies are just effect overloaded animation shows. But the Butterfly Effect is intelligent and makes you think. Very important movie. <br />
0553212478|5.0|I had to read this in my English class and I always wanted to read it. Mary had quite the imagination! The novel did not disappoint me whatsoever. I found it to be a great read and overall one of those stories that you just can't instantly judge as which character is the antagonist or the protagonist. The novel makes you think deeply about both Victor and the monster he created. It's the splitting image of a gothic novel and indeed just as scary and amazingly thought up as can get. To imagine one man creating his own human is an idea that is mad as well as amazing to think even of.<br /><br />The story starts off where a ship up North finds a man and takes him up on their ship, and the leader listens to the story the man tells in agony and woe. It's of Victor as when he was younger, and happy and fascinated in an idea he conjured, of creating his own human. But only discord happens afterwards, and Victor realizes he must destroy his creation before the whole human race is in danger. But alas, the monster has a negotiation, and Victor must decide if he will uptake it for the sake of his family and the rest of the world's safety.<br /><br />This is a story that will leave you thinking deeply and possibly shedding a tear. It's up to the the reader nonetheless, to wonder if they dare read such a chilling tale.
0679720200|5.0|+++++<br /><br />(This review is for the paperback \\"The Stranger,\\" translated by Matthew Ward, and published by Vintage in 1989.)<br /><br />This particular book has four major sections:<br /><br />(1) Introduction (15 pages).  It is excellent and I highly recommend reading it carefully before reading the novel itself.  It explains, among other things, how the entire novel is related to existentialism.  Even though not explicitly stated, this introduction also tells us about the nihilistic aspects of this novel.<br /><br />Existentialism is a twentieth-century philosophical movement whose emphasis is upon personal decision to be made in a world without reason and without purpose.  It also emphasizes such things as subjectivity, free will, and individuality.<br />This movement has spawned a form of psychotherapy called existential therapy that is concerned with the present and not with the past or future.<br /><br />Nihilism in philosophy is the denial of existence of any basis for knowledge or truth.  It is the general rejection of customary beliefs in morality, religion, and so on.  As well, it stresses the belief that there is no meaning or purpose to existence.<br /><br />(2) Chronology (4 pages).  Traces in table form the author's life (among other things).  The novel is by Albert Camus (1913 to 1960) who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957.  The novel was first published in 1942 in French and titled \\"The Outsider.\\"  Camus died in a car accident.<br /><br />(3) Translator's Note (2 pages).  The novel was translated from the French by poet and critic Matthew Ward.  Ward states that the \\"'simplicity' of the text is merely apparent and everywhere paradoxical.\\"<br /><br />(4) The Actual Novel (115 pages).  This novel is divided into two nearly equal parts of six and five chapters respectively.<br /><br />Part one details the routine, mechanical nature of the main character's everyday life up to the point where he commits a murder.  In part two we see how the main character is jolted out of his routine life since he now has to stand trial.<br /><br />There are only four major characters in this novel:<br /><br />(1) Meursault.  A Frenchman who is the main character or \\"existentialist hero\\" of the novel.  The entire story is told through his eyes.<br /><br />(2) Maman, Meursault's mother.  She is not a living character but her presence is felt throughout the novel.<br /><br />(3) Raymond, Meursault's friend.  He is indirectly the cause of why Meursault ends up in jail, is convicted of murder, and sentenced to death.<br /><br />(4) Marie, Meursault's girlfriend.  Meursault cares for her, but not in the same way that she cares for him.<br /><br />There are eleven minor characters.  They are all crucial to the story.<br /><br />The writing in the novel is simple and laconic but powerful.  The novel begins with the following: \\"Maman died today.  Or maybe yesterday.  I don't know.\\"  It ends with the following: \\"I...only...wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.\\"<br /><br />The themes or topics that run throughout the novel are many.  Some of these are as follows:<br /><br />Death, detachment, indifference, observation, alienation, spiritual exhaustion, apathy, absurdity, callousness, immorality, unemotionalism, and ambiguity.<br /><br />I should warn potential readers of this novel that those unfamiliar with and that do not understand the concepts of existentialism and nihilism may respond with anger towards this novel.  All the one and two star reviews below this review illustrate this.  What this means is that Camus did a good job in writing his novel.<br /><br />What I did was take a word or a phrase from the first five, one and two star reviews below this one.  These words describe existentialism and/or nihilism and express anger.  They are as follows:<br /><br />(1) \\"[B]ook...sucks\\" (this reviewer is angry).<br />(2) \\"[M]onotonous\\" book since it elaborates on the routine nature of Meursault's life.<br />(3) \\"[A]ll Meursault reacts to are the most basic wants...food, sex, warmth, sleep.\\"<br />(4) \\"Meursault was an emotionless, hopeless, and disgusting man.\\"<br />(5) \\"I am...angry that I had to read this crap.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an exceptional book that describes a different type of thinking.  Don't miss this unique story!!<br /><br />+++++borates on the routine nature of Meursault's life.<br />(3) \\"[A]ll Meursault reacts to are the most basic wants...food, sex, warmth, sleep.\\"<br />(4) \\"Meursault was an emotionless, hopeless, and disgusting man.\\"<br />(5) \\"I am...angry that I had to read this crap.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an exceptional book that describes a different type of thinking.

068987474X|1.0|It's hard to see how anyone would benefit from spending their time and money on this thin, large type book written by two soap opera screen writers. Eight of the 11 chapters deal with no-brainers like: Don't date him if he's married, don't date him if he's an alcoholic or drug addict, don't date him if he only calls when he's drunk, etc. Most women won't learn anything new here. But the seriously lonely could suffer some real damage because this book advises you to just wait, and wait, and wait...until \\"He\\" comes along and changes your world. Basically this is another \\"Rules\\" book which advocates that women do nothing and let men do all the heavy lifting, (P 14) because all men really want is to forever chase brass rings. And all men will \\"Move heaven and earth\\" if they're into you. If women are into a guy, they're supposed to do....nothing. I think the professionals recommend a relationship be a two way street. What is needed is an agreement that both parties need to do less than everything and more than nothing.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie was simply the most beautiful love story I have seen in a long time. It was tender and bittersweet at the same time and it made one think about \\"that\\" first love... you know the one that you still think about on that random Tuesday afternoon. \\"The Notebook\\" made the tears slip down my cheeks throughout the entire film, but it also made my heart smile so big and wide... I left the theater with a feeling I can't quite describe... but it was happy and sad all rolled into one... it was a feeling like love.
068987474X|4.0|This book encourages everyone to stop being codependent, trying to manipulate and/or change others in order to get what we think we want from them. I think it's a sign of where society is headed, considering our past. We're finally ready to let go and let people just be themselves. That said, I hope men read this too -- so they realize that if they ARE into someone, they better step up! It definitely debunks Dr. Phil's bullsh**, and instead asserts that when a guy is into you, he wants to marry you even when you're an a**hole! (i'm living proof!) I've always hated how Dr. Phil would go on Oprah and have guys give stupid reasons why they wouldn't marry this or that woman. Puleez. We all know too many married people who WE wouldn't put up with. However, I can't endorse this entirely because of personal experience. My friends & I have, many times, been attracted to someone who wouldn't give us the time of day. Later, we found out they were into us, they just didn't have the guts. And vice versa. So, the truth is -- when you feel something that strong, it's a high probability that it's mutual. When will people just break down & admit that? Maybe in another 20 years?
B0002VKZL6|4.0|This definitely ain't Knopfler's best music. No extended guitar solos or soul-stirring melodies like Bros in Arms here. Having said that, even if anyone new was introduced to Knopfler's work through this album, he'd still notice the perfect blend between his voice and guitar, and the expressive, uniquely perfect guitar notes and timing that makes Knopfler stand apart from most guitarists, except maybe a few like Chet Atkins and Hank Marvin. His vocals on this album are the smoothest I've heard him, and usually without losing the trademark mild gruffness that adds atmosphere to the story-telling. Knopfler's songs were always unpretentious, intelligent and carried you effortlessly into vivid imagery.. and its the same again here. As a DS fan I wish too that I could hear more songs of the kind that Tunnel of Love and Telegraph Road are, and hopefully maybe his musical progression will eventually bring him closer to it than this album did. On another note, it's great that he's still around, and that he's able to make more music, any kind.  <br />
0792151712|4.0|This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe.  Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject).  Still the cinematography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever.  This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well.  And it succeeds.<br /><br />Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune.  Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own.  Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy.  His romantic bravado in the freezing water, saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her, was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.<br /><br />Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom.  Evil, decadent rich people.  Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.)  Clich&eacute; followed clich&eacute;.  But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life.  It was strange to see her in the early scenes.  She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her.  But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.<br /><br />Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, \\"We're the luckiest sons of b...s in the world.\\"  (Yeah, right.)  And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: \\"He won't amount to a thing.  Trust me.\\"  And, \\"Freud, who is he?  Is he a passenger?\\"  (Check the heads of the midbrow audience nodding knowingly.)<br /><br />My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the salvage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe.  Duh.  In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand.  Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent.  Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money (as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset).<br /><br />All right.  Why did the Academy vote this best picture?  Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves.  I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue.  Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.t sons of b...s in the world.\\"  (Yeah, right.)

1401301363|5.0|<br />I can say, without embarrassment, that it took Nigella Lawson to get me to cook. Through her words, wisdom, and her book \\"Forever Summer\\"  - with it's abundance of lamb, mint, and lemon - Nigella not only introduced me to the ease of cooking, but also to the mystery of spices and spice mixtures such as Sumac and Zatar.  And perhaps, more importantly, Nigella and \\"Forever Summer\\" provided me with a healthy portion of reliable recipes to cook, eat, and enjoy with friends. \\"Feast,\\" is like part two of my culinary education. <br /> <br />\\"Feast\\" is full of recipes for good food, cookable food, the kind of food you want to eat. The kind of food you want on your table when you celebrate, entertain family and friends, or when it's just dinner for two or even one.  True to Lawson's style, nothing is to fussy or labor intensive. Whatever labor you put in you get back ten-fold in the results.  <br /> <br />While Lawson does occasionally borrow from her earlier books like \\"How To Eat\\" and \\"Nigella Bites,\\" it's only to offer up a different version of the dish, and it's often even better. And, it's refreshing that when Nigella uses a recipe found in another cookbook, she gives credit to the chef and the book. Then of course she twists and tweaks the recipe: making it even better. <br /> <br />\\"Feast\\" is my fall 2004 cooking bible.  <br />
B00005ATQF|3.0|There are lots of movies on the Vietnam War out there and this is certainly a good one. But the actual \\"Vietnam\\" part of the story is completely overshadowed by R. Lee Ermey's incredible performance as the maniacal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, The Drill Instructor From Hell. Truth be told, my father (a former Marine officer) said that his time spent in training was quite a lot like that of Joker, Cowboy, Snowball, Pyle and the rest. My father loves to tell me how his DI once told him, \\"Candidate, you would have to improve fifty percent just to be an a*****e!\\"<br /><br />That said, the first part of this film is--I must be honest--pure schadenfreude. I cannot count how many times I laughed at the insults Sgt. Hartman would hurl at his recruits. Ermey got the role after the original actor could not convincingly perform the role. It's said that Ermey, a real Marine Drill Instructor, stood at attention and let the crew throw tennis balls at him while he screamed obscenities at imaginary recruits...for fifteen minutes. Can you imagine how convincing that was?<br /><br />There's something deeply (and sadistically) humorous at how much power his character holds over the recruits. And--again, I must be honest--Pyle (played wonderfully by Vincent D'Onofrio) is a perfect sad-sack character who can't do anything right. Until, that is, the torment of boot camp begins to slowly push him over the edge. I won't spoil it, but once that part of the movie is over, I usually change the channel.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film does not make salient and provocative points regarding the Vietnam War--Joker's chastisement by a colonel (\\"What is that on your body armor, soldier?\\") is a perfect example--but we've really seen this all before. We all know war is hell; we all know that Vietnam was a collosal \\"foxtrot uniform\\" (as my father would say). The actual \\"Vietnam\\" part of the film adds little that we did not see in either \\"Apocalypse Now\\", \\"Platoon\\" (which came out the year before FMJ), \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\" and \\"Hamburger Hill\\" (both of which came out the same year), so why do we need to hear it again?<br /><br />To be honest, I'd have been far more interested in a black comedy chronicling the transformation of these young men into Marines than in what we see here. As good as the film is and as wonderful a director as Kubrick was, this film was lost in a flurry of Vietnam movies. That very fact consigns it to also-ran status, but the fact that the bulk of the film is just like all the other Vietnam movies really keeps it from truly standing out the way most other Kubrick films do.ar before FMJ), \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\" and \\"Hamburger Hill\\" (both of which came out the same year), so why do we need to hear it again? <br /> <br />To be honest, I'd have been far more interested in a black comedy chronicling the transformation of these young men into Marines than in what we see here.

B00006SFBD|4.0|A freind of mine got this for me as a birthday present about a year and a half ago, before we had both listened to it and even though alot of parts really jumped out at me it whent by mostly unnoticed... <br /> <br />the first 20 or so listens for me were pretty uneasy, I had to try really hard to keep my mind wrapped around all of the songs... but I've always loved a fair judgement, I never really thought of this as an album you just pop in with some freinds, its more like an individual experience that needs to be undertaken in complete privacy... not only is this not accessible, but its heavier than hell (what more could you ask for in a metal album?) this is one heart wrenching son of a bitch from beginning to end, and it starts off on all cylinders with opener \\"wreath\\" which may be the heaviest opeth song in some time... and pretty much runs that course througout  <br /> <br />This album has a surprising lack of melody compared to earlier works, but there is still the heart stopping \\" a fair judgement\\" (the second solo in that song is so depraved) and the remeniscent \\" for absent freinds\\" which is an instrunmental, that really makes you long for the people you are not with anymore.... <br /> <br />I think the best song on this album though is \\"masters aprentice\\"... there is some serious morbid angel riffing going on here, but midway through it turns folkish, and then weighs down on you with a very heartfelt ending, and the drums kick your ass and impress you all the way through the songs 7+ minutes....  <br /> <br />One of the coolest things about this album for me, is that not only is it creative, but the musicianship is also awe inspiring... and could be apreciated by anyone regardless of what style of music they apreciate the most. Deliverance doesnt have alot of clean vocal passages, much of the melody is found more often than not in the guitars but I'm not complaining one bit. My only real complaints: at times wreath drags on, and the cheesey solo in the middle of the song doesnt help much either, and there is a part on the title track that I wish they would have grooved on for a little longer... but these are minor. otherwise the album is flawless, once it grows on you, to me much of the highlights are not songs, but individual parts of the album as a whole... it actually took me a while to match the parts that stuck out to the songs they belonged to. This is one of the best albums to listen to when you're sure youre not doing anything for an hour or so, or if you just want to go for a walk... however you listen to it, it deserves all of your attention, I still find new things when I listen to this... the replay life is endless. <br /> <br />this is better than still life, but not as good as my arms your hearse IMO (not to take anything away from the other opeth albums just because I didn't use them in the comparison)... I'm pretty glad I got this album for free. This one was my first opeth album and needless to say I was impressed and whent out to buy more, and now opeth is one of my favorite bands, so check it out...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I used to never like slipknot but after hearing this album i am a huge fan they incorporate the perfect blend of heavy stuff and not so heavy stuff. after listening to this my 2 new favorite songs are Duality And Circles. They still arent my favorite band but they have gone about 100 notches up after this album. Buy this Album
B00005JNEI|4.0|I found this film to be rather tremendous, and strongly recomend the DVD version to all other parents whose children occasionally have difficulty sleeping.  Sure to get the tykes dreaming sweetly before the end, much like Disney's Cinderella.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Like all albums this work has it's ups and downs.  If you look past the glitz, the glamour, and the faux darkness you will here something that is short of nothing short of a musical masterpiece.  Being a musical masterpiece the majority of the praise for this album should go to Jeordie White, who wrote the majority of the music on the album and the two following albums.  Secondly, to those who say it was Trent Reznor's input that makes this album, that is obviously wrong.  The band Marilyn Manson has always been on Nothing Records, but it was not until Smells like Children, which is nothing more than a glorified remix album, that their sound solidified.  There was one very obvious addition to the roster, Twiggy.  Antichrist Superstar was Twiggy's first chance to affect the sound of an entire album.  The first we heard of this album was through The Beautiful People.  This song is the begining of what was to become a formula.  Catchy songs for the people, this is Brian Warner.  Marilyn Manson is a product made for mass consumption.  If this is ever doubted this, the message is in many of his lyrics as well as the entire album TheGolden Age.  This album is a fine example of the difference between writing good parts and writing good songs.  Thou very simple to play, to image and create these songs from the vapors is jaw dropping.  First the album draws you in with a beautiful Hate Anthem.  Holds you there and with a single, and takes you on a tour deforce of rock.  By rock I mean playing styles.  Irresponsible Hate Anthem is pure metal.  Little Horn is basically hardcore punk.  Cryptorchid is minimalism reminisent of Tones on Tail.  All thetracks are laced with programming of course, this serves only to add volume and a sense of depth not overcome the tracks.  All and all this album is a musical train wreck (awesome), made popular my a believe it or not style stage show and marketing.  Remember, Brian Warner is the man who once went up to a you Shaquille O'Neal and said::
0312995423|1.0|This reader expects Science Fiction to stretch the boundaries of credulity and physics, but not a tale about the NSA breaking codes with its super computer promoted as contemporary fiction. This story is just bad and unbelievable.  <br /> <br />It reads as if it were written by a committee of at-risk 9th grade boys. It's disjointed and many parts are a real stretch to even associate with the story line. Examples of really silly subplots are: the NSA has hired an ex-felon high school drop out self taught male chauvinist pig programmer and given him access to its most secret computer equipment and programs; the heroine who is roughed up by several men, subjected to a murdered colleague, exploding electrical equipment, fire systems (her sheer blouse, sexy long legs and dishabille are described in detail) still has the ability to help break the most secret code; and, in the space of 24 hours the hero is brutalized, beaten, shot, gassed and can still fly from Spain to the US overnight with time left over to make passionate love in a hideaway with his girlfriend heroine who has recovered from her own traumatic abuse.  <br /> <br />The publisher apparently could only find 4 reviewers willing to write anything at all positive about the book so St Martins packed the front with three pages of expansive hyperbole about Brown's earlier books (which are, IMHO, also very thinly plotted). This reader has to acknowledge the effort and work necessary to knit this thing together and convince a publisher to market it, but that, by itself, is only worth one star for nerve.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|As a kid, I loved this film. I can't wait for the DVD so I can give it to my kids. <br />Background - If an alien race wanted to make contact with humans, and do so in a way as to assure that we wouldn't shoot at them, what would they do? Contact our children.  <br /> <br />Story - This kids in the story are contacted in their subconscious with dreams of computer components and circuit boards. They begin building the parts and find that they are building equipment that could allow them to travel into outer space. They allow the 'auto-pilot' to take them to a predesignated location where they make contact with the alien race. <br /> <br />The film goes through the usual childhood angst. It has the childhood crush, the school bully, etc. It stars some of Hollywood's brightest child actors including River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke, and it's easy to see why they became excellent adult actors (if only temporarily in the case of River Phoenix).  <br /> <br />Some people have given this film poor reviews, but to me it's obvious that they are watching it from the perspective of an adult. Since I never grew up, this isn't a problem for me! Get this for your kids, or just for yourself. <br />
B0002VKZL6|3.0|If you liked the golden heart/sailing to philadelphia but not so much ragged, than perhaps you shouldn't bother. This is another CD full of smart lyrics and mostly laid down, acoustic songs which can make you yawn. I hope the next album will be more electric, but I am afraid MKnopfler may be not coming back from this more \\"mature\\" music. Only time will tell I guess
B00000JLWW|3.0|Is \\"Titanic\\" a marvelously crafted film?  You bet your life preserver it is.  It is hard to argue that the film did not deserve the Oscars it won for Visual Effects, Film Editing and Cinematography.  However, does the fact that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences went insane in 1997 (awarding 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations) make it a great film, or is it simply a bunch of eye candy wrapped around an unbelieveably cheesy love story?<br /><br />Rich girl meets poor (but plucky) boy from the wrong side of the tracks and starts a romance doomed to failure.  My goodness, we surely have never seen this story before, now have we?  No amount of special effects, as magnificent as they may be, can conceal the cringe-worthy dialogue between Leo & Kate that the viewer is forced to endure.  The dialogue makes me think at times of those wretched, teen-angst-riddled WB dramas that currently infest the airwaves.  There are whole scenes that are almost unbearable to watch, the dialogue gets to be so poor.<br /><br />Even the spectacular nature of the movie has waned a little bit in the intervening years.  Like many summer blockbuster flicks tht are largely propelled by their special effects, \\"Titanic\\" is one of those movies best seen on the big screen.  Once it is transferred to the more confined medium of a television screen --- even a big one --- the impact of the images on the screen tends to be lessened, and one is forced (sadly) to rely on the skill of the actors to maintain the interest of the viewers.  I don't think anyone is going to remember \\"Titanic\\" for its riveting performances.  Kate Winslet does an adequete job, but I think the Academy was being pretty generous in giving her a nomination for Best Actress.  Nothing against the old crone who played the billion-years-old Rose, but what in her performance really merited a nomination anyway?  As to the performances of the rest of the cast --- well, I think it says volumes that the Academy, while it was handing out nominations left and right, elected not to honor most of the principals with acting nominations.<br /><br />This isn't a totally horrible film by any means --- at points it can be quite moving & touching.  There are times when the ship was near sinking, as one sees the various passengers coping with a death that is rapidly approaching, that one wishes the whole movie could be like this.  Unfortunately, James Cameron preferred to go the route of cheesy romance, and that results in an average movie at best.g out nominations left and right, elected not to honor most of the principals with acting nominations. <br /> <br />This isn't a totally horrible film by any means --- at points it can be quite moving & touching.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|As I read the reviews of this film it strikes me as odd...Most of those reviewing the movie and claiming that none of it's characters would actually exist in real life, have two things against them...First of all not one of these people reviewing the film from this angle are in Idaho....I lived in Idaho for 6 years and want to say definitavelty that these kinds of people not only do exist in real life but exist in Idaho...Secondly if someone made a film full of a cast that \\"would or could actually exist in real life\\" it would possibly be the single most boring movie of all time...This is why reality TV is so popular it is really not reality but what we \\"wish\\" reality was. <br /> <br />This is the second greates film of all time!  The only movie that even falls into the same catagory is PeeWee's Big Adventure. <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Yes, it's true, what a let down!!! <br />First, a big fan of the universal 1930 monster movies, this was the golden age monster movies, frankenstein, dracula, the wolfman, the invisible man, the mummy and etc!!! <br /> <br />So I was waiting for this since I heard that they gonna make a movie with Van Helsing and sadly this movie is a big miss!!! <br /> <br />Stephen Sommers, who gave us 2 good popcorn movies with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns continues with a similar kind of movie, but this time, it's bad!!! <br /> <br />The beginning is kind of good, shot in black & white, it'S really cool to see that the movie is begenning after the first Frankenstein. The special effects are really good too, but this is the only 2 good things I can say about the movie. <br /> <br />The storyline is bad, it could be a lot better, the acting: the actors tries their best, but you know, when you have nothing interesting to say you can't make miracles. It's sad because theres good actors in the movie : Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsdale. And the Monsters, ouf!!! The worst count Dracula I ever seen, Frankenstsein, a very boring new version of monster and The Wolfman, who is kind of interesting but you don'T see him very much! <br /> <br />There'S some good points, like the special effects, the mood, the colors, but it'S all!!! <br /> <br />So, personnaly, a very bad movie who could be a lot better, because there was a lot of potential! It'S sad, because i wanted to like it! <br /> <br />2 stars because of the special effects, the atmosphere, and some good action sequences!!
B00005NGZX|5.0|Saying that the current hardcore/metalcore scene is plagued by hordes of uninteresting, generic, mass-produced bands is not only true, but also an understatement.  To that, all I can say is: \\"Thank God for Converge, and especially for Jane Doe.\\"<br /><br />This magnum opus of an album lives and breathes like a monster.  Some describe Converge as math metal or mathcore, but Jane Doe is indubitably shooting straight for your heart, not your brain.  Converge creates an overwhelming wall of noise in every song and affects in a way not unlike My Bloody Valentine's Loveless.  The extremely abrasive, chain saw guitars and the snarling, ferocious, heavily distorted vocals of Jacob Brennan evoke an otherworldly feeling that is simultaneously powerful, chaotic, and beautiful.  The awe-inspiring, climactic finale of the title track is very nearly tear-inducing.  As clich&eacute; as the claim may be, for me, this album was/is life-changing.<br /><br />Describing each and every one of the songs is unnecessary; this albums works beautifully as a consistent, cohesive whole that outweighs the sum of its parts by far.  Singling out any one of the songs effectively cheapens this masterpiece's worth.<br /><br />You may or may not fully realize this album upon first listen as I did, or you may never get into it at all.  As I stated earlier, the album is aimed right at your heart, and everyone will undoubtedly have his or her own, unique reaction to it, whether it be love, hate, or indifference.  All I can say is, give it a shot.  If you hate it after one or more listens, I'm sorry for wasting your time and/or money, but if you have an experience not unlike mine with it, welcome to the cult.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|A great collection (27 songs) for the price.  I guess there are different interpretations of what makes a number one song (on which lists?), but I figured that Please Please Me and Do You Want To Know A Secret would have been included. But I guess it wasn't possible to include everything. Nonetheless, it's a nice selection of  most of their well-known songs and the sound is excellent.
B000002MJ0|5.0|It would be far too easy for me to simply slap this album with a 4 and a half star rating, state, \\"this isn't Loveless,\\" and call it a day, but instead, I'm choosing to review this (outstanding) album as if the monumental, phenomenal, perhaps-best-album-ever Loveless was never created.<br /><br />The humbly titled Isn't Anything is one of the most underrated and tragically ignored albums ever.  I would say that it's easily among the top 25 albums of the 80s, but hardly anyone has a strong opinion on it.  It has become massively influential throughout the alternative/indie world, but never duplicated.<br /><br />Looking at the cover art and song titles like \\"Soft As Snow (But Warm Inside),\\" you're given a clue as to how the album sounds: distant, distorted, and dreamy.  The song craft is strong, the vocals are ethereal, and the guitars are deliciously, noisily lush.  Listening to the sound samples on Amazon does no justice to this album, for it is far better experienced on headphones during a sweltering summer day or a bitterly frigid winter night.<br /><br />In my humblest opinion, Isn't Anything is certainly essential.
B00004STUL|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie. Smith and Lawrence and Pantoline in a cop buddy-buddy action film; it should be great! Will Smith is the rich kid, suave and sophisticated, who is a cop because he wants to do good. Martin Lawrence is the family man who can't seem to find an opportunity to do it with his wife. And Joey \\"Pants\\" is their tough tlaking boss.  <br /> <br />But its not very good. Lots of guns and car chases, but the humor is forced and the plot is not just predictable but stupid. \\"Bad Boys, Bad Boys, watcha gonna do when it makes you puke?\\".  <br /> <br />Any of the Lethal Weapon movies are superior to this film.
0143034448|5.0|Yes, you must take your time reading it.  <br />Yes, you must weave your way through Thackeray's references to the culture of his time.  <br />Yes, it is worth your time to read.  <br /> <br />Vanity Fair is, quite frankly, a staggering achievement. It is a witty, engaging, and scathing look at status in society: How people get it, how people lose it, and how people get it back. And in 840 pages, Thackeray manages to encompass virtually every interlocking element of 19th Century England.  <br /> <br />For the life of me, I cannot understand the other two reviews, both of which refer to this book as boring. Every page is rewarding, and only becomes more so with repeated readings. Becky Sharp is a relentlessly interesting, amoral character, and we can only watch the arc of her life with fascination and grudging respect.  <br /> <br />Thackeray refers to Vanity Fair as \\"A novel without a hero,\\" and rightfully so. No one is spared his barbs, including the sweet, yet dull, Amelia. Thackeray holds up a mirror to the pretensions of the middle and upper classes, but does so without sanctimony or tendentiousness. All in all, it is a very approachable book. <br /> <br />So, read Vanity Fair. You will want an edition with copious footnotes (I prefer the Oxford edition) so you understand some references to the events of Thackeray's day. However, once you get used to the rhythms of Victorian prose, you will find it a very energetic and entertaining read, and the themes it encompasses remain true to our day.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Horrible.  Awful.  Deplorable.  None of these words can sum up just how terrible this film was.  The plot of Van Helsing seemed as though it was probably written by a third grader.  As I sat in the theater watching this garbage, I could imagine a ten year old child saying to his film-maker father \\"and then Frankenstein swings in on a rope, and then the Wolf Man jumps out of a tree, but then here come some flying vampires, but's its all OK because Van Helsing has a silver stake firing MACHINE GUN!!\\".  Nothing in this film made sense.  It's creators took pages from some truly excellent horror stories, wiped all of their buttocks with them, stapled them together, and called it art.  The characters were about as deep as your average kiddie-pool, it would be generous to call the plot \\"moronic\\", and the \\"love-story\\" definitely the most contrived I've yet seen.  Even the CGI dominated action scenes were implausible.  If anyone reading this has seen \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\", expect more of the same.  It's the only movie that I've seen that approaches van Helsing in its awfulness.  Everyone associated with making this tripe ought to be ashamed of themselves.
0393035158|5.0|Mr.Harris makes a compelling,cogent and logical argument for \\"the end of faith\\".His documentation and copious footnotes show that this is not just a rant against religion but a genuine attempt to illuminate how blind faith has effected our society and culture-past and present.Unfortunately I am reminded of something I once read: \\"To those who have faith,no explanation is necessary,to those who don't, no explanation is possible\\". I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind, but in the end,Mr. Harris is preaching to the choir
068987474X|5.0|As a fan of \\"Sex and the City,\\" I had seen the episode in which Berger gave Miranda insight about the new guy she was dating, and that he just wasn't that into her.  After reading a review about this book in a magazine and after the authors' appearance on \\"Oprah,\\" I knew I needed to get a copy.  I had been in a relationship for a very long time, and had made a multitude of excuses for a person who in the end really didn't deserve them.  After reading this book, my eyes were opened wide, and my attitude has been adjusted.  I just might buy a copy of this for any of my single female friends for Christmas!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|In its own way, this film is a minor classic already. It has created a whole new genre; the zombie comedy. Zombies, of course, have always been kind of humorous, with their shuffling, growling, and slowness. Of all the monsters to have to deal with, one gets the feeling that zombies would be the easiest to dispatch. A zany group of Brits, who have all worked together previously on British television, have put together a film that combines the bawdy and the bizarre; a kind of dead-pan English humor meets graphic gore Fest; a kind of Benny Hill meets George Romero in a pub and they hatch a plot.<br /><br />The primary writer was Simon Pegg, who also played Shaun. The script was very clever, full of pathos and pratfalls, and it was as much a social commentary as it was comedic. There is a depiction of the English Everyman that is leaden-eyed, drooling dumbly, a populous slogging through their gray lives barely breathing; vacuous, desensitized, barely breathing. They are slaves to their daily routines, lurching home after working at a job they detested to their identical row houses. It took people a while to even notice that the undead were walking among them.<br />There was a distinct Thames TV feel to the movie. I half expected Rowen Atkinson, Stephen Fry, or John Cleese to pop in.<br /><br />Pegg, as Shaun, worked in an appliance store. He would shuffle through his boring day, and then race off to the pub at night. On weekends, of course, he would get serious about his drinking. His pub of choice was the Winchester, named after the American rifle and not its British heritage. Shaun's best friend, and primary roommate, was Ed, played by Nick Frost. Ed spent most of his time playing video games, eating junk food, drinking beer, selling the odd weed or drugs, and waiting to meet Shaun at the Winchester. He was uncouth, boorish, and a bit loveable.<br /><br />Kate Ashfield played Liz, Shaun's longtime girlfriend. She wanted to break up with him. She was tired of the same old routines. She wanted to dump him and move on. There was only one complication; a zombie infestation. Bill Nighy played Phillip, Shaun's stepfather, and Penelope Wilson played Shaun's \\"Mum\\". They were quite effective, and almost stole every scene they were in. Nighy is a great character actor, and he did especially well.<br /><br />There were several poignant scenes mixed in with the comic mayhem. Pegg played the scenes emotionally bang on. He is a fine actor. Wisely, he never played Shaun as a caricature. Shaun, as a character, could have stepped off the pages of a Harold Pinter or a Tom Stoppard script. Shockingly, mixed in with the comic elements of killing zombies with cricket bats and gold clubs, many of the scenes of gore were quite graphic; equal to the zombie thrills in Danny Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER. In a way, this film was made as an answer to that film. Initially, the zombies were less a threat than an inconvenience, and interference in the drinking bouts. Forting up at the Winchester was absurd, but it was the only \\"logical\\" choice Shaun and Ed could come up with.<br /><br />I liked this film. After all, how many zombie films quote Bertrand Russell? I think it will be a candidate for cult status.old routines. She wanted to dump him and move on.

B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park has always been simple cookie-cutter bacon butt garbage.  It seems like these manufactures whipped up another batch and now we are forced to jam every friggin song down our throats when we here this crud on the radi-Ho.  I can not tell you the furious, unembroildled anger that builds up inside every damn time the local radio station blasts good songs from Alice, Rob Zombie, Perfect Circle, only to round out the night with \\"Breaking the Habit\\" or \\"This is where I BEEEEEEELONG\\".  Shouldn't we be moving forward?  Haven't we had enough of this \\"poor me\\" music already?  If you thought nu metal was getting sidetracked from good old fashion rock and difficult rythms, just turn on Kroq now; you'll hear grown adults screamin' like 12 year olds wailing to godawful music and cheesy lyrics about \\"growing up\\".   <br />         Enough of my complaining.  Why I picked this CD for my equally childish rants that no one really wants to hear?  Plain and simple:  It makes rock and rap look bad.  It takes the worst from each world and rolls it up into one trash-heaped lump.  First of all, the lyrics.  These guys don't have brains like Rage Against the Machine, they don't have deep and thoughtful mind-expanding lyrics like Nirvana, and for the sake of argument with the crowd that enjoys Linkin Park......they don't even have a touch of originality like Korn did.  Song structure is basic:  Verse 1, chorus, Verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus.  The ryhmes are shot:  The rapping in this version is more like \\"candy wraping\\" or \\"wraparound style\\":   <br />\\"Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them <br />Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin' <br />It's like nothing I can do would distract me when <br />I think of how I shot myself in the back again\\" <br />This is NOT rap, each word simply ends in a ryhming word, and Mike doesn't even try to speed up the gauntlet a little.  But I'll take the white rapper any day in comparison to the band's take on heavy metal:  Chester.  He shows us that just anyone can be a frontman, whether you sound like a screaming gay guy, or a helium filled balloon.  Sure Janes Addiction's frontman had some high vocals, but it was met with enthusiasm because the music playing and lyrics were mature.  This guy sounds like a coyote, in a bad need of an exorcism.  And then of course, the music:  Here we have dumbed-down simple \\"play along with us,kid\\" riffs. It's a real step down from difficult compositions that Tool or Rage create.  And what about the crowd that listens to Linkin Park:  18 and under in most cases.  Even the frontman of Linkin Park has expressed in many reviews his pride for not having any use of \\"explicit language\\" in his cd's.  He wants to make dark, but holsom music for his fans, and he feels that cursing is just childish mumbo jumbo.  He has a point, but this is just sales hype.  This guy drops the F-word as often as their songs cycle the Radi-Ho. <br />       This review is not really a shot against anyone, it's a shot against the genre that is being molded from fans of Linkin.  It ponders the question that if we keep on making music like this, Are we most likely going to be entering an endless age of mind-numbingly non-complex music and cry baby wailing?  I certainly hope not, but it looks like the jury's out.  So please break the habit people, before its to late:  Once those 13 year-old girls grew up, Backstreet Boys was history and the world was a better place; Linkin Park certainly won't be any different -So break your cd's tonight. <br />          <br />
B00009MGQL|4.0|I drive an Audi A6 with a Turbocharger.    I'm also a Jeff Beck fan and the two seem to be a natural mix.   What the real surprise is that the Audi has a Bose Stereo and now I'm listening to Jeff like never before... and that is the key for \\"Jeff\\". <br />Listen to it loud, listen to it really loud while screaming down the freeway.  That's when you hear the complexity and multi-layering of this hot little biscuit.
B000001EL3|5.0|It's very clear that this was the album that made KISS big, and I mean very big.  By this time they knew that they could do anything and it was gonna be right.  So, who could they hire that can make something different and make it sound it good?  BOB EZRIN.<br /><br />On this album they included almost all kind of music. This was done in '76, if they had done it today they could have included like 24 songs, because the music is so diverse.  Getting an album with \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Beth\\" together? WOW, it's got to be hard.<br /><br />To me, this album is very difficult to top.  They created a great atmosphere: 1) They included orchestra in a great way. 2) They started to use the comic \\"vibe\\" very good and it's when they create the \\"superhero\\" persona. 3) They included a very instrumental ballad (Beth) something that was never done before (at least no for a group like KISS) 4) They came out with something like \\"God of thunder\\" and it sounded like if it was recorded in hell 5) Well, they tried to do \\"Rock'n'roll all nite\\" 2,  but they came out with \\"Shout it out loud\\" which (and don't get me wrong) is extremely good but the first classic it's impossible to match.  Anyway,  it's impressive the sound on every song, all of them are instant classics.<br /><br />As an additional note, it's quite clear that they had personal problems from this one till the end. It's obvious that they were already famous and they could do anything they wanted, but Ace and Peter really lost the reality and they started to do stupid things.  That came out years after this album, but the true is that Ace didn't played the guitar on \\"Sweet Pain\\", and I won't be surprised if he didn't played on some others. Peter was as useful as nothing, the one thing that he did great was to pressure Paul, Gene and Bob to include \\"Beth\\".<br /><br />This is the first CD to buy when you're collecting R'N'R CD's.<br /><br />Highlight: Detroit Rock City, and the rest of the 8 songs.<br /><br />Lowlight: Nothing.Nothing. <br />
B000001FN3|4.0|Alan Parsons had already spent his time producing and engineering, like the Beatles' Abbey Road, Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother (yes, which gets overlooked compared to his engineering on:), Dark Side of the Moon, Paul McCartney, The Hollies, Pilot, etc. It would only be natural that he wanted to explore his own musical ideas, and team up with Eric Woolfson, with a host of vocalists and musicians. Tales of Mystery and Imagination is a collection of songs based on various poems from Edgar Allen Poe. What's really interesting in the total lack of synthesizers (although synthesizers would appear with full force starting with I Robot), yet still retaining that '70s hi-tech feel. \\"A Dream Within a Dream\\" is the opening cut, an instrumental which is a wonderful piece that no doubt defines the Project's instrumental sound. \\"The Raven\\" is the first vocal cut. Here a vocoder is used (which I understand was a custom-made vocoder made by EMI). Andrew Powell includes his orchestra and choir (the orchestra and choir sounds exactly like that on Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother, although Powell didn't conduct the orchestra on that album) in that song. \\"Tell-Tale Heart\\" is an unusual cut, the only Alan Parsons Project cut to feature the vocals of Arthur Brown, as in The Crazy World of Arthur Brown (who gave us the 1968 hit \\"Fire\\") and the overlooked prog rock band Kingdom Come (not the '80s U.S. band). \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" is a ballad, which defines the softer side of the Alan Parsons Project. \\"(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" was the hit on the album, but I never actually heard this song on the FM dial. It's a more rocking number. Andrew Powell's \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" is of course, a largely orchestral piece, but with one part featuring John Leach playing his cimbalom (Hungarian dulcimer) and kantele (Finnish zither). \\"To One in Paradise\\" is another ballad, it's interesting to note Eric Woolfson provides backing vocals. Meaning that while Turn of a Friendly Card is the first Project album where Woolfson sings lead (like on \\"Time\\"), he did a little backup vocals previous, like \\"What Goes Up...\\" on Pyramid, and of course \\"To One in Paradise\\", as mentioned. <br /> <br />In 1987, when this album finally saw the light of day on CD (on Mercury), Alan Parsons decided to give it an '80s facelift, with digital treatment, big '80s drum sounds, and Orson Welles providing some narration. At least it wasn't plastered with Yamaha DX-7s and other similar digital synthesizers of the time. The LP reissue features a booklet that gives background to the musicians involved. I liked the one regarding Arthur Brown: \\"Whatever happened to the Crazy World of Arthur Brown? Did he get 'Fired?'\\" (get it? As in his hit \\"Fire\\"). <br /> <br />As for the original LP (20th Century Records in the US, and in the UK on Charisma), it features the same cover, but without the mummy on the front, and that stripe in the middle, rather than near the bottom. Here you get the chance to hear it the way it's supposed to be, without the '80s digital treatment. <br /> <br />It's a nice album, but I thought I Robot was even better.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I have been expounding the merits of Gilmore Girls since its' very first season, and continue to do so today - five years later. Like most shows, it has had its' ups and downs over time. However, I can assure you that the first and second seasons of the show are particularly fabulous and highly recommended. <br /> <br />This show is for individuals who want to see Intelligent, Vibrant, Hilarious, and Heart-Wrenching television - all in one amazing package. The best place to start with this show is definitely Season One. Where you are first introduced to the characters and will fall in love with them. <br /> <br />The Second Season is a continuation of the trials, tribulations, love stories, and heartaches of mother and daughter, Lorelai and Rory Gilmore. The \\"Girls\\" are surrounded by the crazy town of Stars Hollow, the 'elder' Gilmores, and potential love interests. And, while the premise may sound saccharine or mundane, believe me, it is anything but! The writing infuses the show with the kind of wit, sarcasm, and emotion that other shows would kill for. And, often the plethora of emotions are captured in a single *scene*, let alone a single episode! <br /> <br />Lauren Graham is the rock of this show. She is absolutely astounding. I have never had a \\"favorite television actress\\" before her. Her dialogue delivery is bar-none the best on television, because she doesn't just get the words out at break-neck speed. She also infuses the words with the exact emotion they call for. This season shows the continuation of her engagment to Max (Scott Cohen), and the re-appearance of Christopher (David Sutcliffe), the father of her child. <br /> <br />Alexis Bledel is also great as Rory. In the second season she deals with confusion in her love life, as Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) comes to Stars Hollow and makes her doubt her feelings for sweet boyfriend Dean (Jared Padalecki). You also see her continuing struggles at the haughty Chilton Prep School. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is equally fantastic. Special mention goes to Kelly Bishop as Emily Gilmore - who in my mind is really the third \\"Gilmore Girl\\". Viewers familiar only with the first season will also get a more in-depth view of Luke (Scott Patterson), as he struggles to raise his nephew Jess. Other standouts include Melissa McCarthy (Sookie), and Keiko Agena (Lane).  <br /> <br />This show has always been about the smaller moments in life. If you're waiting for car explosions, graphic sex, or foul language, then you're watching the wrong show. But, if you want to watch a show that will engage you, take you inside its' world, and make you care about the characters, then this is the show for you. And, let me also state that this is not just a show for women! There are guys out there who will find this show just as amusing.  <br /> <br />So, if you were on the fence before, and wondered whether checking out this show was worth your time. Get off the fence, and jump right in. Trust me... this is definitely television worth watching.  <br /> <br />
6305508550|5.0|Great office movie. Echoes the thoughts of Corporate workers everywhere. Recommended to everyone who works in an office. Great twist at the end!
B00005Y7AW|4.0|\\"Poses\\" is more mainstream than Rufus' debut, less symphonic than \\"Want One,\\" and yet all three of his albums seem to fit no one else out there but him.  In \\"Poses,\\" there's a rainy-day feel to many of the songs.  Just look at the titles: \\"Grey Gardens,\\" \\"Evil Angel,\\" \\"In a Graveyard,\\" \\"One Man Guy,\\" it is clearly not an optimistic record.  Yet, this music is very comforting, largely due to Rufus' sincere delivery.  His often lazy drawl is befitting of the music, in that you wouldn't expect messages so sad to be sung pristinely.  The strongest moments on the album are Rufus' poetic lyrics, especially when paired with unique, touching melodies; Rufus Wainwright is so talented that he could sing \\"bla bla bla\\" to some of his melodies and it would somehow be effective.  The best examples of this are found on songs like \\"Poses,\\" \\"The Tower of Learning,\\" and \\"Evil Angel.\\"  The few uptempo numbers, particularly \\"California\\" and \\"Shadows\\" are catchy but less adventurous.  Rufus Wainwright is on a level with Stevie Wonder in terms of having the unique ability to write unusual (if not abstract at times) lyrics that are somehow able to touch on the most real of situations and feelings.   <br />If anything drags the album down, it's simply the tempo; most of the songs are slow, often dramatically orchestrated, but rewarding with attentive listening.  Rufus' self-professed attention to detail and desire to make each song perfect is always obvious.  The imagery he describes tell more of a story than most songwriters out there .
B00003CXCQ|5.0|It is of course a wonderful Cinematic achievement. Beautifully done, and very true to the Grimm tale. However, it has one of the most disturbing subjects in a Children's story  I have ever heard. The stepmother sending out a Huntsman to cut out her heart?!?! Then trying to poison her. And the forest scene is outright terrible. Not recommended for kids under 12, in my opinion. I was scared for a long to time to watch that after the first time. It took me 5 years to see it again after I was 8 yrs old. Otherwise, a beautiful movie with great music.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Time (and repeated listens) will tell -- but this may be his best album.  I think the AMG reviewer Stephen Erlewine described the album well: \\"It's not far removed from Smith's previous work, but it feels like a step forward from the fussy Figure 8 and more intimate than XO.\\"  The fuzzy guitars and keyboards on certain tracks fit the music well (and, at times, rock), and I think they did a fine job with the final mixing.  If you like Elliott Smith's other albums, you should get this.  I also think this album would be a good introduction for someone less familiar with his music.    I hope people don't get too hung up on how the album may have been different.  I think the production is well done, but the final mixing and production is a minor point considering the beauty of the melodies and lyrics.    By the way, I think the placement of \\"Ostriches and Chirping\\" is great, because it effectively splits the CD into 2 \\"sides,\\"  which is a nice touch.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Match #1 John Cena vs. Big Show (c) for The United States Championship: Great way to open the show. These guys don't have the best chemistry, but it was still good! Cena hits Big Show with a massive FU (after a cheap shot with the chain) to win the title!!! 7/10    Match #2 World Tag Team Championship Sudden Death feat. Garrison Cade & Mark Jindrak, La Resistance (suck), The Dudleys, and Booker T & RVD (c): Awesome! Had a good pace and was a perfect length time wise. Booker and RVD win after a 5 Star Frog Splash on those stupid Frenchies (Rob Conway sucks!!!). 8/10    Match #3 Christian vs. Chris Jericho: I'm glad these guys' feud is over now cuz it was definitely getting old! Not too much to say here...it was a decent mid-card match with Trish ruining the match, costing Y2J the match, and then turning on him and going heel (lame!). 6/10    Match #4 The Rock 'N Sock Connection vs. Evolution: Great match, one of the best on the card! The only reason Evolution won is because they felt they needed to keep the Orton/Foley feud going another month. Yeah they had a great match at Backlash but the feud sucked! The Rock is ripped off yet again. Orton was the only bad thing about this match... 9/10    Match #5 Sable & Torrie Wilson vs. Miss Jackie & Stacy Keibler (2 of the sexiest women alive!!!) in a Play Boy Evening Gown match: Horrible match! But it was great \\"eye candy\\" none the less. Torrie and Sable win, in a total waste of time. 3/10 for the hotties...    Match #6 The Cruiserweight Open: This surprised me of how good it ended up being! It sucked that Chavo ended up retaining his title, but a great performance by everyone in the match...except for Funaki who was eliminated after like 7 seconds, haha! 8/10    Match #7 Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as the special guest referee: This was a disappointment, and that is even an understatement. Goldberg wins after no effort by both men. Atleast the match ended the way it should have...Stone Cold STUNNING both those sell outs right out of the WWE!!! And for that it gets a 5/10.    Match #8 WWE Tag Team Championship Sudden Death feat. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas, The APA (awesome!), The Bashams, and Rikishi & Scotty (horrible) (c): The APA should have won! But Fatty and ... retained their titles unfortunately. Yet like the RAW match, this was also pretty good except for the end. Oh yeah and the Bashams suck really bad! 8/10    Match #9 Molly Holly vs. Victoria (c) for The Women's Championship: If Molly looses (which she does, haha) she will have to have her head shaved! Good ending with Molly getting shaved and not a bad match to go with it! 7/10    Match #10 Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guererro (c) for The WWE Championship: Great match, but too long! Ofcourse Eddie cheated to win cuz he will never be able to \\"actually\\" beat Kurt! Kurt sure showed him at Summerslam 5 months later! 8/10    Match #11 Undertaker vs. Kane: This match wasn't really that good. Taker's entrance was \\"phenominal\\" though! Taker wins with the tombstone piledriver and improves his Wrestlemania record to 12-0. 5/10    Match #12 HBK vs. Chris Benoit vs. HHH (c) for The World Heavyweight Championship: Match of the night, and one of the greatest main events of all time! What a SLOBBERKNOCKER!!! Almost 30 minutes of action with great performances by all 3 men! Benoit is the greatest and proves it for sure in this match by making HHH tap out to the Crossface!!! Benoit WINS!!! 10/10    Bottom Line...Wrestlemania XX is Spectacular! Get it!
B0001L3MI0|1.0|I thought this was going to be one of the greatest movies ever, after I saw the trailer way back when. I had no idea of the atrocity I was about to partake of. We were teased into thinking this was going to be an EPIC, COLOSSAL sci-fi adventure about aliens invading the earth. The scenes of those HUGE flying saucers were plain awesome. INSTEAD, what do you get? As silly, corny, fluffy, inane piece of GARBAGE that you could EVER hope to see. There are so many eye-rollingly bad pieces of dialogue, so many useless characters, so many moments where even one's suspension of disbelief is stretched too, too far. Call it a b-movie, this film has to rank as one of the greatest blown opportunities EVER. I HATED IT!!!
B00000I8UK|5.0|This recording is way ahead of it's time. It has to be the best cd I have ever listened to. It is just mind blowing. The group dynamics are amazing as are the solos. Find out for yourself but be warned, you will not be able to put it down.
B0002I831S|5.0|No surprises.  Few embellishments and distractions.  Zero commercials.   <br /> <br />I have been eagerly awaiting this series for decades.  Bring on the next two box sets!   <br /> <br />Yes, the interface is clunky.  Should I care?
B00006690G|5.0|as a reviewer for Amazon sometimes you have to review things that you dont normally lsten to.  Peo_PLE you have to be living under a rock for the last 5 years to NOT know who EMINem is!! And on Novemeber 16 His new one ENCOre, the sequel to the SHOW DROPS and PEOPLE, it is going to be BIG!!!  ALso, for those who dont know He ISNOT named for the candy, but for his name Marshall MAthews (two m's) and before that his name ws Rabitt.  Just so you know..<br /><br />Now for my review.  From the samples, its pretty good, i guess, but I liek classic rock like Dillon and Bodge, so this isnt my cup of tea.  But come on PEO_PLE!! iT\\"S M!  I'll post a review of Encore when it drops and let ya iknow what i think of it too.
B00005JLR2|4.0|I caught this on Disney Channel because, of course, no one saw it in the theatres. Watching it and then owning it, I both was surprised by its quality, and understood why it flopped. <br /> <br />First, the good points. The animation is spectacular. Sheer visual beauty. And, in this age of computer animation, this may be the high point and last hurrah of hand-drawn characters: incredible \\"acting\\" by the hand-drawn characters. The expressions and shifts of expression managed by pencil and eraser have to be seen to be believed. <br /> <br />Second, concept. This is the highest of high concepts, using a combination of eighteen-century elements and science-fiction technology in what must be described as pure mythology: it takes place in the impossible, a universe called \\"the Aetherian\\" where people can breathe in space-winds. It demands imagination and complete suspension of disbelief. The translation of Stevenson's classic to this mythological space is, simply, a treat. <br /> <br />Third, addressing the issue of parental abandonment and preoccupation and its effects on teenage rebellion. Everybody knows Disney heroes have only one parent. But this is the first time I remember that that's explained this way: \\"Your father not the teaching sort?\\" \\"No, more the leaving and never coming back sort.\\" Set against this, and without the Stevenson characters of Dr. Livesey and Squire Trelawney to distract, the bond that grows between Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver becomes the centerpiece of the movie. It also leads to some incredible moments whenever these two legends clash. At one point I blurted out, \\"He's going to kill him!\\" <br /> <br />So these are the things which I loved. I did not like the compression of time on the Planet itself; I thought the palette of color used for the pirates was literally overshadowed by the backgrounds -- who was coloring this, Don Bluth? B.E.N. was mostly only distracting, but I think that could have been remedied if the Planetside scenes weren't so time-compressed. And you've got to love a character that uses the name Lup in a sentence. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Still Here (Jim's Theme)\\" is my guilty pleasure song of the year. There's no one like John Rzeznik to capture the feelings of a rebellious and immature adolescent. Although, the chorus does invite you, if you can, to soar. <br /> <br />It should be clear by now why this movie tanked. The good points I list above doomed this movie. Because who the heck would watch this? It's too scary and too deep for young kids. It's too high-concept for most grownups. Its attempts at kid-friendly humor clash with the attempt at integrity of vision. It's too fantasy for sci-fi fans. It's too spacy for fairy-tale fans. It's got too much old-fashioned (\\"outdated\\") hand-drawn animation for the cutting-edge CGI fans. It directly addresses the hearts of teenage boys who feel trapped and misunderstood: and what self-respecting rebellious kid is going to go see a Disney movie in the theatres? <br /> <br />Exactly. No one. But they should watch it on DVD.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This album is a MASTERPIECE.  Nuff said.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Join Will Smith in this action-packed sci-fi murder mystery where nothing is what it seems and the truth will surface. <br />In a society where robots are everyday households items which people trust Detective Dale Spooner (Smith) is going to appear slightly paranoid when he accuses a unique robot called Sonny (Alan Tydck) of perpetrating a crime after the suicide of their creator (James Cromwell). <br />Absolutely brilliant! Based on a short story by Isaac Aminov Alex Proyas did extraordinarily well at making this a sci-fi masterpiece unlike John Woo's adaptation for Paycheck. <br />With superb special effects and CGI, a fantastic storyline, great acting all around I, Robot has got as many twists and turns as a rollercoaster ride that I would go on again and again!  <br />Buy this or miss out on or one of the best films of 2004!
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard this album while crossing the atlantic and it really grabbed my attention from the first riffs of \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\"  I vowed then and there to get hold of the disc at duty free on my return. <br /> <br />On checking out the band bio, I was suprised not to see The Chameleons mentioned as an influence as the synth/guitar mix really reminded me of Fan And The Bellows (anyone who likes this album should check that out too IMHO). <br /> <br />What more to say?  This album will be staying in, or close to. the player for a fair few months yet (listening to it now as it happens). <br /> <br />Buy it or be a loser ;o)
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I am a huge fan of Trey Parker.  In many ways, I consider him to be, along with his partner Matt Stone, a maverick force in American comedy.  His personal vision is original and his satire is fearless.  His humor is often topical and I almost always find myself nodding in agreement with his iconoclastic insights.  With \\"Team America,\\" I think Trey made a few mistakes.      The main strength of \\"Team America: World Police\\" lies in its perfect parody of Bruckheimer action pictures.  To see this idiom done with puppets really exposes its innate stupidity.  Here, Parker triumphs once again.  Parker's score is absolutely hilarious, as always.  We get a G.I. Joe-like Team America theme song (\\"Freemdom is the only way, yeah...\\"), a sappy patriotic country ballad, Kim Jong Il's rendition of \\"I'm so Ronrey\\", and an opining lover's lament in which the lead compares how much he misses his girl with how badly Michael Bay missed the mark when he made the movie \\"Pearl Harbor.\\"  Very funny stuff.    As far as the political content is concerned, I say it is hit and miss.  The representation of the U.S. as a team of self-rightous, freedom fighting, blowhards is very apt.  The running gag of Team America destroying world treasures in their hunt for terrorists is a scream.  However, as much as I am all for the ridicule of self-important celebrities, I found Parker's portrayal of Liberal Hollywood as anti-American \\"*ussies\\" in cahoots with the terrorists to be extremely misguided.  I happen to think that anyone should feel free to speak their minds whether they have an audience of one or of twenty million.  Just because Sean Penn is an actor doesn't mean that his opinion is worthless.  To suggest that he is naive or even insincere in his political beliefs is just disingenuous and, therefore, not very funny.  By making a movie in which he criticizes celebrities for making political statements, isn't Trey Parker committing the very same crime he is charging to other celeb's?  Isn't thata political statement?  In fact, this film is filled with political statements.  The final assertion, that pacifists are unrealistic *ussies and that \\"dangerous\\" people actually need a good ass-kicking, is just not productive.  Many people throughout the world consider George Bush to be a dangerous person.  This kind of reasoning, or lack thereof, just gives justification to the actions of terrorists.    All that aside, I give \\"Team America\\" four stars because it is a damned good movie.  I still think Trey Parker is one of the most important comic minds of the last twenty years.  Definitely check this one out.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid.  I had the originals on VHS back in a time when they were released separately and they were fun to watch.  But VHS is a dead form of media now, and now DVD is the superior form of entertainment.  When I found that Star Wars was being released as a box set on DVD, I was estatic.  But the news came that it was going to be the special editions, ONLY.  Now why would anyone think that just releasing a revised edition of a movie by itself is a smart idea?  Other directors or studio's have released special editions of past movies, i.e. Independence Day, E.T., Terminator 2 to name a few, they also released that special edition as an extra with the ORGINAL movie, so you can enjoy the original if you didn't like the extras(Independence Day Special Edition sucks balls by the way).  But I can't understand Lucas's logic behind this decision to just release the special editions.  True it is his movies and it's a story that he wishes to tell to masses, but he should be grateful as a storyteller and artist and release the ORIGINAL editions with them to show appreciation to the fans and to show how much he has advanced or how much he's taking for advantage nowadays when back then it was so much harder, and the end result was still nothing short of amazing.    I didn't mind the special editions whatsoever, there were points where I agreed with others(the greedo scene, the added Jaba the Hut scene, etc.) on how they were unnecessary and just made it stupid, but overall I was happy.  And seeing the new changes for the DVD release, I must say the only noticeably change that I've seen AND am very upset about is in Return of the Jedi.  I mean what the hell?!  Why would he put the punk from Episode 2 in there instead of the older Anakin.  I heard it was because when you die as a Jedi, you assume the form of your Jedi form, which in Lucas's view is the horrid actor that portrayed Anakin from Episode 2.  But how is that possible?  He wasa little prick throughout the whole movie, he sure as hell wasn't pure.  But honestly, the older Anakin seen in the original changed and converted back to be a Jedi in that he relized his ways and conformed, helping his son and basically apologizing for what he has done, thus converting back to a Jedi and being pure.  (...)  In conclusion, this a decent set, could've been ALOT better, but oh well.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I would totally disagree with the purists, that George should not have fiddled with the original trio of movies. All 3 Movies look great and the added effects are icing on the cake. George as others have stated was adding those elements that money and technology would not allow him to when the movies first came out. No disapointment here, and bravo to Lucas for not milking us by releasing these as singles first and as a trilogy later.
0684833395|5.0|Ok, I can see how the cynics could get all deep and delve through the mixed messages of war and rank in this novel, and how the contradictions could be seen as frustrating, but, as far as I'm concerned, this is the best book ever written, better that Don Quixote and the Bible combined (though I've read neither). Here's what I think. I don't think the book was hard to get through. I read it very quickly the first time, although, I later went through it a second time with a dictionary, circling the words I wasn't familiar with (of which there are plenty) and wrote their definitions in the margins. Now, whenever I am bored, I can just grab this book, open it to a random page, start reading, and laugh and laugh and it will never get old because the contradictions and the nonsense are the exact ingredients that make life itself a never ending roller coaster. A bit over the top? Ah, who cares, it's not like this is The New York Times. Don't be afraid of this book. Read it, but make sure you keep an open mind because the moment you insert a prejudice or a preconceived idea of right or wrong you WILL get angry and throw the book and you may end up hurting a pet or loved one.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked was the BEST musical EVER!!!!!! <br /> <br />The music will blow you away, especially the singing! The lines are so clever. I saw the musical w/ Idina Menzel and it was amazing! You're laughing and crying and it has such a good story! <br /> <br />GO SEE IT IF YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006V9A0|2.0|Hmm... where's \\"Territorial Pissings,\\" \\"Blew,\\" \\"Verse Chorus Verse\\" (aka Sappy), \\"Aneurysm,\\" \\"Negative Creep,\\" \\"Big Long Now,\\" \\"Serve the Servants,\\" \\"Radio Friendly Unit Shifter,\\" \\"I Hate Myself and Want to Die,\\" \\"Scentless Apprentice,\\" \\"Something in the Way,\\" \\"On a Plain,\\" the studio version of \\"All Apologies,\\" \\"Polly,\\" \\"Even in His Youth,\\" \\"Floyd the Barber,\\" \\"Dive,\\" etc., etc...? Okay, not all could have fit, but there were much better songs than \\"Dumb\\" and maybe even \\"Been a Son.\\" <br /> <br />The problem this seems to have is that it was just hastily put together. A lot of the great Nirvana songs were left out. All that seems here are the \\"hits\\" plus a few more that whoever made this album would think could please the fans. Only one song... ONE song, from the band's \\"Bleach\\" album is here. Two from the \\"Incesticide\\" album. Four from the \\"Nevermind\\" album. Another four from the \\"In Utero\\" album. And two more from the \\"Unplugged in New York\\" album. Then there's the unreleased track \\"You Know You're Right.\\" <br /> <br />I think people should just own all of Nirvana's albums instead of relying on this \\"greatest hits\\" album. As mentioned before, many of Nirvana's greatest songs were omitted. So... grab the band's studio albums, the live album, and seek out the other albums that contain a few Nirvana rarities (the Outcesticide series, Grunge is Dead, The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience, and more). <br /> <br />Well... it seems like the Nirvana box-set (containing 50-ish songs, I think) is about to see the light of day. Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore is gonna write some linear notes on it. Well... hopefully we finally get the Nirvana set fans have been awaiting for some time... <br /> <br />Oh yeah, like I said, skip this, wait for the box-set and buy Nirvana's other albums.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|There's a great scene on the beach between Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton, which seems almost improvised, where they talk about his reputation for non-commitment and her supposed non-date with his doctor. Ironically it feels like a scene from \\"Annie Hall\\", and this mostly charming movie could have done with more seemingly spontaneous moments like this. But director/screenwriter Nancy Meyers (\\"What Women Want\\", the \\"Parent Trap\\" remake) is borne out of the packaged Hollywood filmmaking that finds double-takes and double-entendres suitable replacements for insightful wit in a formulaic romantic comedy. Luckily, as embodied by the two veteran actors, the characters do not come off as menopausal stereotypes like some pre-\\"Golden Pond\\", sunset-gazing couple. True, there are some serious sitcom lapses in Meyers' script, and it does lack the uniquely quirky perspective of a James Brooks in the similar feeling \\"As Good As it Gets\\". For the most part, however, this is quite a step up for Meyers, a refreshing look at the emotional complications that come with love among the more mature set. What is particularly nice is how sex is treated as an emotional release rather than just an act of pure passion.<br /><br />Nicholson plays womanizing record producer Harry Sanborn like most of his late-career roles, i.e., with a sense of eye-rolling panache that somehow gets dismantled when his character reveals too much of his vulnerability. It's probably the unsurprising aspect of his acting that allows Keaton to steal the movie from him. Looking svelte and unapologetic for her age, she brings a lovely sense of gravity to her role of successful playwright Erica Barry, a familiar type who lives in a Pottery Barn-furnished world and has rationalized love out of her life. Keaton has a great honest moment when her character reveals her true feelings outside the restaurant where she catches him on a date after their own tryst. The film somehow loses footing after this scene, as this last portion feels like the story is marking time until the plot strands eventually sort themselves out to the inevitable ending.<br /><br />The film looks good in a \\"Metropolitan Home\\" sort of way, and the supporting cast is quite capable and serviceable. Keanu Reeves is surprisingly believable as the lovelorn doctor smitten with Keaton's character, but he is given short shrift by the script and comes off ultimately as a plot device. On the other hand, Amanda Peet comes across as alternately bright and flighty, a fetching combination, as Erica's daughter. Sadly underutilized as usual, Frances McDormand steals all her scenes as Erica's sister. Someday she will hopefully repeat her success with \\"Fargo\\" and get a meatier role deserving of her smart talent and saucy sense of humor. And even more hopefully, perhaps this movie will provide a springboard for other older-skewed romantic comedies given our country's aging demographics...but who am I kidding?els like the story is marking time until the plot strands eventually sort themselves out to the inevitable ending.

B0002KVUKW|4.0|...but not Hugh's best work.  The movie's good, if you like the monsters of old (Frankenstein, Dracula, the Werewolf and toss in Mr. Hyde as well).  Hugh is definitely great as Van Helsing, Kate Beckinsale is wonderful as Princess Anna and Richard Roxburgh is WONDERFUL as Dracula!  There's also A LOT of action in this movie and Van Helsings gadgets make Inspector Gadget look like a sissy!<br /><br />Overall, the movie's a bit campy, but something you'd want to watch when there's nothing else on television.
B00028HBKM|5.0|So many reviews are expressions of one's beliefs that they fail to pay tribute to James Caviezel, a young man whose faith and strength of character is reflected in the depth of this role. Every actor searches for a role that will define his skills and be a part of his being. The role of Jesus will be such a role for James Caviezel. This is a movie that causes us to look at the history of the time and how politics, greed, and fear combine to create suffering for an innocent Jesus. Whether one is a believer or not, one has to look at the screen as a canvas where Mel Gibson as an artist uses Caviezel as his instrument to create a masterpiece. It causes one to be humble in the presence of such power and glory. Thank You Mel and Thank You James for sharing your commitment and passion with the world. You said to the world \\"the battle of good versus evil is still the same\\"---here it is ---this hasn't changed in over two thousand years.
B000002BQK|5.0|You just have to look at the beautiful CD cover (back and front) to be able to tell that this album symbolised Mariah's new-found freedom, both personally and musically. One door closes and another opens... <br />While the Butterfly symbolises freedom and letting somebody go in the title track, as a Gemini myself, the Butterfly also symbolises variety (\\"like a butterfly flitting between different flowers, variety is the spice of life\\"), and this is also true with the many different musical and vocal styles used throughout the album. <br />The listener is taken on a dreamy musical trip - from poignant, bittersweet ballads (\\"My All\\", \\"Outside\\") through sensual, chill-out tracks (\\"Fourth Of July\\", \\"The Roof\\")to soul/hip-hop masterpieces (\\"Breakdown\\", \\"The Beautiful Ones\\".) <br />As always, Mariah's lyrics are in sensational form - I bought the CD the day it was released (the guy in the CD store had to open a box for me!!), but had to go to uni straight after. With no CD player in my car, I spent my breaks reading through the lyrics and just could not WAIT to get home to experience the music with them.  <br />I was  was mesmerized from my first listen.  <br /> <br />1.Thanks to the CD single, I was already familiar with the sexy, funky \\"Honey\\" (how about that awesome film clip?)  <br />2.\\"Butterfly\\" is simply beautiful lyrically and musically from start to finish (though I do agree with others in that I wish she kind of let her voice go a bit earlier)  <br />3. The latin guitar in \\"My All\\" makes the song what it is;  <br />4. \\"The Roof\\" (one of my favourites) is sexy, laid-back, mellow Mariah at her best;  <br />5. In the style of \\"Underneath the Stars\\", \\"Fourth Of July\\" takes us on a sweet, sensual trip of intimate discovery and connection... <br />6. \\"Breakdown\\" wasn't one of my favourites at first (like most it took me a little while to catch on to the hip-hop R'n'B Mariah), but I just love it now (even the rap in the middle, which is in the same style of the track.)The lyrics are heartbreaking and (as she does so well) reflect a time in my life I was yet to experience. Also probably one of Mariah's most visually stunning music videos! <br />7. Like \\"Breakdown\\", I didn't catch on to \\"Babydoll\\" until about the 10th time I listened to the album, but my goodness, what a track! A bittersweet tale of deperate longing with a gorgeous soft beat backing it up.  <br />8. I had the privilege of watching Mariah perform \\"Close My Eyes\\" in her 98 Butterfly Tour in Perth, with her childhood photos displayed on a screen behind her. A beautiful song about too-long-ago lost innocence. <br />9. Another stunner from the Butterfly Tour was \\"Whenever You Call\\" (probably the vocal highlight of the night) - Mariah's voice sounds amazing. I do prefer her solo version to the duet she performed with Brian McKnight for #1's. <br />10. Similar to what she did with \\"Fantasy\\" on the Daydream album, we are treated to a short remix of \\"Butterfly\\" - \\"Fly Away\\" <br />11. You can pick a Prince song a mile away, but Mariah and Dru Hill make \\"Beautiful Ones\\" their own. Once again, Mariah does her cover tracks amazing justice.  <br />12. \\"Outside\\" is the 'token self-reflection' track for Butterfly (Mariah's good for those), but where some of them can seem a little too 'drippy', this one is beautiful lyrically, musically and (especially) vocally.  <br />13 & 14. More remixes - this time \\"Honey\\" gets a reworking. I personally love cranking up the \\"Def Club Mix.\\" <br /> <br />Butterfly and Music Box continually run neck and neck in the race for my favourite Mariah album - each time I listen to one or the other, they take the lead. So at this moment, Butterfly is my all time favourite Mariah album.  <br /> <br />Do yourself a favour. Don't let this album 'Fly Away' from your grasp!
B0000AMRJD|5.0|First of all, why everybody is complaining about the soundtrack? Moroder's disco-synth tracks capture 110% the feeling of the era, this was exactly the music that coke-heads of the early 80's were listening to. For comparison nobody complains about the music in Miami Vice...Style and feel of Scarface and Miami Vice are very similar beacuse of the Miami location(colors of the buildings, palm trees, expensive cars of the 80's, neon lights at night), clothing, drug related story etc. In Miami Vice the music makes the feeling complete and that is also what makes Scarface a whole enjoyable experience capturing the essence of this era. <br /> <br />Pacino plays the role of a century. In 1983 Oscar winner for best male actor was Robert Duvall in Tender Mercies!!! Now comon meng! Duvall in Tender Mercies pales compared to Pacino in Scarface.  <br /> <br />From the first seconds of the first scene where Antonio Montana is interrogated you can feel that Pacino's acting is beyond extraordinary - even the look on his face when he is asked the first question makes you smirk. \\"Okay, so what do you call yourself? Como se llama?\\" :) For the interrogation scene alone Pacino should have won the oscar.  <br /> <br />Another great character in the film with memorable lines was Omar Suarez - \\"I will talk to Frank personally!\\" and \\"We coulda gotten some other space cadet to do it cheaper, for 50 bucks!\\" <br /> <br />Like one reviwer said, this movie is beyond legendary.
B00062IDCO|5.0|I was raised on TOS, it was with excitement that I awaited STNG, as well as STDS. While I enjoyed STNG I accepted it slowly and only because of the characters whom I seemd to connect with. DS9 not so much, it became a soap opera to me and I couldn't follow or relate to the war story line at the time. But then came Voyager. My shining star in the Delta Quadrant. I go against every die hard TOS fan I have ever met when I say this is my all time favorite. Never have I enjoyed a series more, and the last season while peppered with some rather slow stories, ended the way I had always imagagined. Voyagers actors and techincal staff (writers, producers, directors, editors) should be commended for the level of stories that were told throughout it's lifespan. The final season came way to early in my opinion and I think that Paromount is sadly mistaken in it's choice to not use the characters in a motion picture. Give Voyager a chance and revel in it's creative and supremely implemented stories. Go Kathy!
B00005JKN9|1.0|Leonardo DiCaprio was prettier than Cameron Diaz. As a heterosexual, I find this fact deeply disturbing.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I just purchased this last night and, Already being a big fan of this film I was happy to see all the anticipated extras yet, Very pleasently surprised to see extended scenes of previously unseen footage put back in within the main body of the film.  It makes the film now flow like chiffon!  And a LOT of the new scenes are dealing with or have Landau as Lugosi in them and he is simply brilliant and earned that Oscar.  If you like \\"Ed Wood\\" you MUST HAVE this \\"Special Edition\\"!  Jimmy - [...]
B00005JKC3|2.0|A convoluted story line and some of the least believable special effects to attack the silver screen in generations spoil a film franchise that had promise. Director Ang Lee does some intriguing things with the camera work, though some of it is mildly distracting.  Lee doesn't seem to get the best out of some very talented actors, and the whole story takes an agonizingly long time to develop into a superhero story.  When it does finally become a comic book movie, it has several sequences of entertaining action that are at least enough to slightly forget just how badly animated the green beast looks compared to his 'real' surroundings.  A short scene that pits the angry giant against several mutated canines looks like something out of a low budget commercial for sugary cereal.  In the end, it is a major dissapointment for Marvel fans who have come to expect much better recently.  It's yet another case where a film about extraordinarily intelligent scientists isn't nearly as smart as the characters are supposed to be.
1591840562|5.0|I don't read too many business books because I find most of them boring but from the first chapter of this book, my attention was captured.  Guy gives such practical and logical advice without getting too technical.  He also gives many examples from various companies of what works and what doesn't.  It is great for those starting a new business or those struggling with their business who are looking for solutions to strenghten the business.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Of course, I loved these movies like we all did. And I haven't actually bought this yet (though heaven knows I probably will) because I have them on VHS and I'm not crazy about the new footage either. But I did buy the 'Alien Quadrilogy' box set and as I opened it out and laid it on the kitchen table, there was the answer staring me in the face. TWO VERSIONS of each film. The original AND the remastered version. A load of bonus features. Nine discs in total. George!!! How hard can it be?!!
B00005JNEU|5.0|I'm from a small town in MN....football is very important to all of us.  In this movie, based on the book of the same name, the events happening on the field are as close to real as I have seen in a movie since \\"Remember the Titans.\\"  Every hit, every injury, every pass, is exactly like that that we see on the field every Friday night, or Wednesday night, or whenever the game happens to be during play offs. <br /> <br />As far as the characters go, Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job in the role of Coach Gaines, and Tim McGraw an excellent job as the bullying father, which was a surprise to most country fans.  All the players on the field for the Permian Panthers did an excellent job also, but the Dallas Carter Cowboys were not a realistic size for a high school football team.   <br /> <br />If anyone wantst to see a movie and be able to relate to a football player after the show, this is an excellent movie to see.  I went with two football players, and they both felt everything that was happening.  This is a good sign that it is a realistic movie.
B00000JG41|5.0|this album can't be reviewed without a song-by-song review, and really mean anything: <br /> <br />1.  Sweet Charity:  um, the beach boys.  it sounds like the beach boys.  there's not even a strange twist.  it sounds just like the beach boys.  but for some reason, i find that i would much rather listen to this song than the beach boys. <br /> <br />2.  None of Them Knew They Were Robots:  this sounds like the beach boys too!  only, this one has the bungle twist.  a mix of several styles of music.  i don't even know what kind of music you call that intro.  it's crazy though.  swing, jazz, rock, awesome song.   <br /> <br />3.  Retrovertigo-  really, really beautiful acoustic-like track (of course it has the bungle twist).   <br /> <br />4.  The Air-conditioned Nightmare:  this is a STRANGE song.  the beach boys appear on this one again (not literally).  the really fast drum thing is cool.   <br /> <br />5.  Ars Moriendi:  haha,  how to describe this madness?  let's try this:  the main basis of the song is POLKA.  it's surrounded by some arabic music, blended with some techno, and fused with some metal.  confused yet?  you gotta hear it.   <br /> <br />6.  Pink Cigarette:  a slow kind of song to show off patton's voice.  i personally don't care for this track, though it seems to be most bungle fan's favorite track.   <br /> <br />7.  Golem 2: yeah, there's more to the title.  i'm not typing it:  at first, i thought about gameboy when i heard this song.  it's got this techno like sound to it...and i swear there's a part of this song where mike patton sounds just like prince.  it's great.   <br /> <br />8.  The Holy Filament:  pretty good track, reminds me of a slow, pretty faith no more song.   <br /> <br />9.  Vanity Fair:  sounds like demonic do-wop music.  it would sound pretty commercial if it weren't for the fact that it's bass is tuned INSANELY low, almost making it sound funny, and there's an almost radiohead-eque thing going on in the middle of the song (it's my favorite part of the whole album). <br /> <br />10.  Goodbye Sober Day:  possibly the best bungle song ever.  it's pure madness.  tons of different styles, from jazz to monk chanting to CRAZY METAL with patton doing a fantomas like vocal thing.  great way to end the album (though i would have ended it with vanity fair).   <br /> <br />that's pretty much explains it.  you're cd collection is missing it's brain if you don't have this cd in it.  so give your cd collection it's instrument of thought.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie was just that. Even though epsiode 2 was better, I still love this movie as well. I love everything about the star wars galaxy and this movie just furthers the story. It helps make the original trilogy even better, by making us see how this all came about.
6300215814|3.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards the film director raved about this movie and loved how it turned out, \\"It is a story of love that should be and no matter what the obstacles are it will overcome all odds.\\"  This movie took place during the 1960's.  The two main characters are Paul and Holly.  Both of them have late night jobs and they live at the same apartment building so they would see each other late at night.  Paul and Holly should get married and be with each for the rest of their lives.  Paul will go through anything to get Holly to fall in love with him.  He will go through any obstacle that he has too. <br /> This movie isn't the best movie whatsoever it lacks a lot of fundamentals that would make a good love story.  The setting of the movie was extremely vague and could have been in a nicer setting.  I know that the setting fits their life styles but it was to bittersweet for me.  Many different parts strike me as amusing or good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of sixteen.  This film is not recommended for any of the young kids.  It would be hard for the kids to sense the tension that continues frequently between Paul and Holly. <br /> Even though Paul has a job he has a mistress who gives him money every month.  Since Paul and Holly have late night habits they see each other quite often and Paul started to become interested in Holly.  This is a critical point in the movie because the tensionIf he only knew about her inability to keep keys, save money, and remember little things.  As far as one Hollywood Executive's advice to Paul she is a bad investment.  After knowing these things Paul is still crazy about getting to know Holly better. <br /> Holly does keep one commitment though.  She goes to visit the Sing Sing (a concert hall where people act) weekly to act out a play as being a courier between a convicted drug dealer and his attorney.  Sing Sing is like a movie studio place where different actors and actresses go to perform different plays.  It's a chance for them to show how good they are at acting and to make a little extra money on the side. <br /> Paul tries his very hardest to not let his mistress find out about Holly.  Holly's deserted husband makes a presence in the film after Paul noticed the same man coming around the apartment.  Holly convinces her husband that she will go back home with him in Oklahoma, but they had to take the bus back if she was going to go.  She made Paul go along to supposedly say good bye to him.  The next thing Paul knows is Holly stabs her husband with a knife right to the heart.  The whole time Paul was just a shield against her now ex-husband.   <br /> Holly has a brother named Fred.  He is about to re-enlist into the army because this guy Jed wants him too and Jed his Holly's former husband.  After the stabbing she plops Fred onto the bus where she kicks him and tells him that she loves him.  This was a very weird part in the movie.  Jed didn't even have the chance to say he hates her.  It may confuse the viewer, but it's just another step for Paul and Holly to get together.    <br />As Paul sees how Holly encounters relationships and how she deals with them he is unsure about her now.  We are led to still think Paul has undying love for Holly.  He finally confronts his mistress and tells her about his relationship with Holly.  He also tells her that he is leaving on a trip with Holly.  The mistress offers him one-thousand dollars for the trip but he refuses quickly and decides he can do it on his own.  This again shows how much Paul loves Holly. <br />  Holly now decides that she is going to leave her old days behind and settle down with the ninth richest man in the world.  Yet in some kind of way Paul thinks he is winning her heart.  The only ring that Paul can afford is a crack jack's box ring which he would get engraved.  He feels like he is winning her heart and this sets the film into a race to see who Holly will end up with. <br/> After Holly's last gold digging chance didn't pan out as planned she got in trouble with police.  She decided she needed to get out of the country.  When they arrived back into their town they still lived in the building.  Paul wanted one chance with her so she brought his fifty dollar check to go into the \\"powder\\" room.  He realizes it just isn't worth it anymore so he leaves her to her Latin lover.   <br /> Holly gets word that her brother was killed in a jeep accident.  She throws a fit in her apartment and destroys everything.  She was unable to deal with the situation, and Paul, being the nice supportive man that he is, goes to confront her and help her through her grief.  The next morning she got right up acting like nothing even happened. <br /> The last scene in the movie was the last chance for Paul to woo Holly.  They road in a taxi together and the whole time Paul was hoping Holly would realize what a good guy she was.  They were riding to the airport where she would meet up with her new fianc.  Holly threw her cat out the window and asked the driver to stop so she could kick Paul out at that time.  Paul immediately let's his heart pour out to her.  He tells her that, \\"she will never be able to trust or commit to anyone.\\"  After Paul got out she started crying and ran out and got her cat and immediately started following him.  It seems apparent that Paul and Holly will live happily ever after.  Paul should have just stayed with his mistress; at least she could pay the bills.  Now finally Paul and Holly may live happily ever after in love.   <br />  I really didn't like this movie, but if a person has a night to waste they should watch it.  Paul and Holly give hope to anyone in love because they ended up together and both of them got through their obstacles.   <br />
6305558167|4.0|Beautifully filmed adaptation of the King Arthur legend by master director Boorman (\\"DELIVERANCE\\" \\"HOPE AND GLORY\\", etc.) captures the blood and guts realism of battle as knights in full body armor clash on horseback and in fields of combat while awaiting the coming of a prophesied King who would unite all of England under one Banner. And so the viewer watches as a Saul-like figure named Uther becomes ruler only to lose his kingdom to the lust of his own pride and flesh. The offspring of his doom becomes the legendary King Arthur who is taken under the wing of Merlin a sorcerer in an age where \\"the one God comes to drive out the many gods\\". One of the delights of Boorman's \\"EXCALIBUR\\" is in Nicol Williamson's playful performance as Merlin who remains omnipresent even as he weaves in and out of the story foretelling, interfering, wisecracking, leading, guiding, and contending with the evil Morgana, Arthur's sister (a chilling Helen Mirren). The movie is worth watching for his performance alone. Also notable is Nigel Terry in the role of Arthur who first appears as an absent minded squire yet gradually (and with Merlin's encouragement) grows into a capable and beloved leader. The sumptuous Cherie Lunghi plays Queen Guenevere who becomes the lover of one of the King's best friends, Lancelot. Their adulterous relationship sows the seeds to the kingdom's downfall along with Morgana's insidious plotting which results in an incestuous encounter with King Arthur, the birth of their child Mordred, and an epic final battle which brings the saga to a close. \\"EXCALIBUR\\" is a wondrous feast for the eyes that incorporates all the myth and mystery of the Arthurian legend (i.e. the sword in the stone, the Lady Of The Lake, the knights of the round table, the search for the Holy Grail, and Arthur's death journey to Avalon) while reveling in a scrumptious array of scenery and images. The film is an unequivocal success despite a few confusion moments that won't distract those familiarwith the story (or with Thomas Malory's \\"LE MORTE DARTHUR\\" upon which the screenplay is based), but may cause some to scratch their heads in puzzlement (if only for a moment). LOOK FOR: Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, and Gabriel Byrne in early cameos. ULTIMATE GROSS OUT MOMENT: when Perceval confronts the dead corpse of one of the knights hung from a tree by Morgana and a crow pulls the guy's eye out of its socket! RATED R/140 minutes.
0312330529|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Ok, slightly self- indulgent in places and over-romantic in its portrayal of the Bombay mafia, but if even 50% of the story is true to the author's life then it is an incredible tale, beautifully told. A brilliant descriptive writer, Roberts held me spellbound to the last. I eagerly await the next offering from this new superstar.
B000063DI9|5.0|This is truly what i hold to be par for metal albums most days. This album is catchy, great muscianship, awesome songwriting, and still holds true for the bands formula while adding in new textures. My favorite maiden album by far it has everything you could want. It has the big epics, the short radio hits and the great story/guitar solos. Its not the greatest album in terms of individual songs but as a whole its nearly flawless and thats why its my favorite maiden album and close to my favorite metal album pick this up if you get a chance
B00002ND77|5.0|Show business and the film industry is brutally selective, and ethnocentric.  It is very important that there are more filmmakers and media artists for marginalized people's voices.  To all justice seeking artists, &quot;be systematic, and persistent, and do as much as you can, always.&quot;  Address the source(s) of any problem.  As S.Lee has shown, doing true, good work and earning a comfortable income is very doable.  Language is a tool.  <BR>Aside:  In the U.S., only two parties could ever be in presidential office.  Unless the odds for the other parties become as good, there would be very little or no change in America's domestic or international conflicts.  All that is said by these two candidates before election will always be unreliable ------ this is nothing but a show.<BR>Suggestion:  <BR>*1)  Allow only equal campaign funding and methods for all official political parties.  All political representatives of each district must daily reside in the area they are representing.  All public information(or at least the office phone numbers and the dates or websites for minutes/publications) must be made available beside every national, state, and local newspaper box in the country.  <BR>2)  *Only the popular vote is valid.*  Any complication can only be resolved by a total re-casting.<BR>Now, could it be any more fair than that?!  <BR>Red tape serves only the ruling class, since only they make the rules.
0618526412|5.0|I was astonished when I read a review below discrediting this book because it is \\"depressing.\\"  A good book is not necessarily one with a happy ending.  In fact, so many classics are not happy at all. (i.e. The Grapes of Wrath, The Scarlet Letter, Sons and Lovers, etc.)   I am tired of hearing people say that they disliked a book or film because it made them sad.  There is more to it than that!  Reviews are supposed to be objective if they are to help readers in finding meaningful books.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is well written. Each chapter makes to reader want to see what is going to unfold next. The words the author uses will help build young peoples' vocabulary. The way Jonas makes sure that every word he uses to express his feelings or emotions have to be an accurate desription. The story line will appeal to any twelve year old because of the anxiety they are feeling at that age. The characters are believable. The Jonas's world is a serious place to live everyone must conform to the rules. The story is built around the responsibilities of turning twelve. The Giver teaches Jonas his responsiblities are the communty's new Reciever and it opens his eyes to a whole new way of life. I only have one caution for parents.  Parents should read this book first because it has a shocking way of dealing with people when they are no longer useful or cannot conform to the communites way of life. I recommend the book for mature pre-teens to young adults.
0792844882|3.0|This movie is not good but I was entertained by it in that cult movie way.Yes, there is some naked women,but not muchand it was done kind of tastefully.I have seen much worse on cinemax and HBO.It is sad to see that Elizabeth Berkley's acting skills are  sompletely horrible in this film and the director should share the blame for that.The story is simple.Real simple.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather: What can I say that has not already have been said. This movie is a classic mafia/gangster masterpiece. I was very impressed by everyone's performances, in particular: Brando and Pacino. I loved everything about this movie, especially the second half of the movie...I was at the edge of my seat on what was going to happen next. My favorite scene: Michael surrounded by Rocco, Al Neri, and Clemenza with Clemenza taking Michael's hand...kissing it and then saying...\\"Don Corleone\\". Truly memorable. I rate it 10/10 stars. <br /> <br />The Godfather Part II: My personal favorite of all three films. The thing I found most fascinating about this film was the character of Michael Corleone. How very different from the one in the original. I actually found him to be the most dangerous character not only in Pacino's Mafia/gangster characters, but in all gangster movies I had ever seen with all respect to: Carlito's Way, Casino, Scarface, and Goodfellas. I say this because he never has to raise a hand or a finger to commit such destruction to his enemies. A simple command from his voice, and his enemies shall suffer. Pacino took it to the max in this film. <br />Also the comparisons between father and son were excellent. I noticed how they differed between each other. With Vito being a loved and respected Don. While Michael being more feared and dangerous. Notice how much more powerful he is than his father in this one. Truly Coppola at his best. My favorite scene, the kiss of death. 10/10 stars. I WOULD GIVE IT 11 IF I COULD. Outstanding film. <br /> <br />The Godfather Part III: I enjoyed this final installment to the godfather series very much. I loved how they brought back many characters from the original film such as: Don Tommasino, Johnny Fontane, Lucy Mancini, Callo, Enzo the baker, etc....good move. Is it just me, or is Al Neri one dangerous and loyal man to Michael or what. I liked that they had him in there by Mike's side again, very trustworthy. I missTom Hagan very much in this one, but George is one good lawyer from what I saw. Vincent, although very tempered like his father, I liked how Michael talked to him in the hospital, telling him to how he always felt responsible for him and how he did'nt want him to end up the way his father did. His attitude in the second half of this film was much more mature and presentable. Sofia as Mary was not an outstanding performance, nor was it a bad one at all...it was a pleasent one. I did not find it bad compared to what others think. My favorite scene, Michael lets out a horrible scream while laying by his murdered daughter, which to me represents all of Michael's past tyrant acts of killings and murders and horrible choices he made, the ordered killing of his brother, etc. Very good scene!!! 8/10 stars. Good movie to end the godfather story. <br /> <br />Best trilogy I've ever seen!!!
B00000AFDW|5.0|I loved PSYCHO CIRCUS since the day it came out, back in 1998.  It was what we've all been waiting for - a KISS reunion album; perhaps a bit of the magic wore off after finding out that neither Ace nor Peter played on each of the songs, but it was still KISS reunited!<br /><br />I review this album at this later date, because I pulled it out to listed to last night and realized how much I enjoy it every time I come back to it.  It shows just how solid, fun and mature KISS had become, sonically.  This album showcases KISS at their best, at their stereotypical image, and even at their cheeziest kind of moments.  But we all know there is a certain cheese-factor inherent to KISS, and we love them for it!<br /><br />Strong points on PSYCHO CIRCUS include the title song, INTO THE VOID (Ace is back!), YOU WANTED THE BEST (everyone sings and has a good time trading barbs, yay!), WITHIN (Gene as creepy as ever as the demon), JOURNEY OF 1,000 YEARS (truly an awe-inspiring epic by Gene...could even be an ELDER II sequal-type song!), and even PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE STATE OF R'N'R (yes, admit how cool and fun this song is!).<br /><br />This is not just a great record for KISS fans to own, it's a great rock and roll testimont that EVERYONE should own!  Rock on!
6305252521|4.0|This movie was nothing i've thought of Jim Carrey to star in, i mean i watched this in 1999 but the review comes back to it. Jim plays a normal man living in a fake world created by tycoons greedy for money, so they air his life from when he was born till the day he actually finds out there is a real world out there. The funny thing about this movie is when he tries to escape and explore the world, or find his high school love in Fiji, but seems to be in traffic jams, and various characters stops him, like the stupid bus driver, turning the gear to rear and busting the bus. It's funny to see a man living in a world he thinks is real but is surrounded by pro actors, all his life.<br /><br />It was funny, and sad but it is something to watch. I wouldn't call it the best, but it's a movie you should take a look at, because it has never ever been done in the movie business back then and now.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Subscribing to the credo \\"if you see and hear it, it must be true\\", intelligent people have become disciples to this anti-Bush diatribe.  This film is not a documentary to expose all the facts.  It is propaganda to promote a political view.  In the spirit of what is \\"is\\", half-truths are slickly and sardonically conveyed.  Although I believe everyone should see this film for perspective, consider this: Moore publicly states that 9/11 was a trivial incident and regards terrorism as a nuisance.  He has an agenda.  If you concur, then don't check the \\"facts\\" as presented by Mr. Moore.  The path of deceit upon which this film led you may prove problematic.
6305364648|2.0|I recently succumbed to an opportunity to screen this film for the first time in eight years, hoping to blot-out or at least ignore the reputable chauvinistic elements in favor of the film's redeeming features.  Alas, I confess, I'm not as resillient as I thought. <br /> <br />While the stereotypical portrayal of those of middle eastern origin is roughly on par with that of a million other right-wing action flicks, the film's blatant sexism is in a class by itself. <br /> <br />Granted, I've never liked Jamie Lee Curtis, but her demeaning portrayal in the role of  Schwartzneggar's wife is almost too painful to watch.  Apart from the scene in which she is confined and interrogated on account of her husband's suspicion of having an affair, her on-screen persona embodies little more than that of a jittery, bumbling, dim-witted scream factory, with little more purpose than to showcase the potency of her soprano-tinged shrieks from scene to scene. <br /> <br />Then, of course, there's the role of Juno Skinner.  Anyone inferring the casting of Tia Carerre in the role of the antagonistic XO as conducive to the presence of a strong-willed femme fatale are bound to be sorely dissappointed.  Quite frankly, this non-imposing second-in-command couldn't be more frail if she tried, her physical potency limited to the muzzle velocity of her concealed .45 and further compromised by the fact that she can't seem to hit the broadside of a barn door.  She willfully allows her associate to repeatedly smack her about the face, brushing off his abuse with little more than a lame-brained \\"At least you're paying me a lot of money\\" remark.  The mere presence of wielding the business end of a hold-up offers no bearings on her propensity to get caught off-guard on both occasions and (get this!), she instructs her subordinates to hold off on unveiling the week's supply of nuclear warheads until she can get her purse out of the way!   <br /> <br />Then, there's that stupid cat-fight-in-the-back-of-a-runaway-limo sequence, in which the two feminine leads squeal about in a lame-brained hair-pulling contest, practically clawing up the upholstery in the process. <br /> <br />Granted, certain degrees of sexism still tend to be an integral component in the majority of hollywood flicks, but I can only tolerate so much. <br />
B000005RY7|4.0|\\"Killers\\" was released in mid-1982 in between the dismal concept album \\"(Music From) The Elder\\" and the strong comeback \\"Creatures Of The Night\\", which would be released later that same year; the album was released only in Europe and Japan, and was only available in the U.S. as an import.<br /><br />Kiss' future was very much in doubt during this time, after both Peter Criss and more recently, Ace Frehley departed the band. The lead guitar spot was still vacant as Kiss had not found a replacement for Frehley yet, so they enlisted Bob Kulick to fill in as a \\"ghost\\" guitarist until they eventually brought Vinnie Vincent into the fold during the recording of \\"Creatures Of The Night\\".<br /><br />Basically, \\"Killers\\" is a \\"best of\\" album featuring songs from the classic period from the 1st album through \\"Unmasked\\", as well as four unreleased tracks that Kiss recorded as demos in 1981 for their next album. Bob Ezrin was tagged to produce, and after hearing these demos, he promptly discarded them and suggested they record a concept album instead. From this came \\"The Elder\\", a move that would have negative repercussions on the band.<br /><br />The four unreleased tracks (\\"Partners In Crime\\", \\"Nowhere To Run\\", \\"Down On Your Knees\\" and \\"I'm A Legend Tonight\\") are decent, but are not quite on a par with the Kiss of old; however, they were a definite step in the right direction which saw Kiss finally getting back to their hard rock roots. I like the extended, remixed version of \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" on the Japanese version of \\"Killers\\", and also the \\"Alive!\\" version of \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\".<br /><br />Of particular note, the European version of \\"Killers\\" features the alternate Kiss logo; the lightning-bolt \\"S's\\" of their usual logo had to be replaced with normal S's in Germany, because the lightning bolts bore a very close resemblance to the Nazi \\"SS\\" symbol that was banned after World War II; the ban was due to an American law imposed on the Germans after being defeated by the Allies and has been in place ever since.ted by the Allies and has been in place ever since.
B00005QATY|5.0|This movie is kick ass! two words GEORGE NELSON. This guy is rightious, if it weren't for him I don't think that I could give this movie five stars! The rest of the charectors are great as well, but in my opinion, George Nelson is on the throwne of great charectors! everytime I watch this movie, I always look forward to the part where the cops are car chasing George Nelson and all of the sudden, George starts shooting the live stock and all this time the cops are a little distance away from Georges car and some cows walk between Georges car and the cop cars and the car in front rams into the cow and I swear the front of the car jumps two or three feet in the air and it just totals the car. Everytime I see that part, I swear I am going to kill my self because I am laughing so hard and I can hardly breathe, let me tell you why I think that part is holarious! because back in 1994 me and my dad were driving out in the backroads in his 1973 ford high boy, we had just barely got done restoring her so she still had some bugs in the engine that we had to work out and she died on us, so my dad's friend came and towed us back to the farm with his 93 ford truck and basically the same thing happened to us, we were a ways from the farm and we were being towed back and this damn cow got right between the two trucks and SLAM we hit that damn cow and literally ran over the damn thing and it hurt like a bitch when we hit the roof. That is why I find that part so funny, because I can't imagine how the cops in that first car felt, plus it brought back some old memories, not to mention the look on george nelsons face, something happened to the cow and the cops which he hates one almost as worse as the other. Another reason why I think it is so funny is because movies don't usually show that anymore and you aren't expecting it and then all of the sudden the car jumps three feet in the air and the cow is laying in front of the car as mangled as the car is. It is kind of sad when you think of the situation and probably to most people that scene is really uncool but if you have ever had that experience, I can promise you that you will laugh your ass off! all in all this movie is totally kick ass, so get home early one night,sit down with your family, get the bowl of popcorn, and grab that bottle of beer and sit back and enjoy the ride
B00000IJPU|5.0|I was surprised that BEST OF THE BEAST had a single disc version, since the double disc version is definitive.  This is one overview of the MAIDENs, and the compilation of the top 20 on the Eddie Game  CD was actually voted on, so it is representative of fans at the time that was produced.  If you can get it, EDDIE'S  ARCHIVES is also a great compilation overview, as is the VIDEO compilation DVD with some superb 3D graphics work.  On top of that, LIVE IN RIO is a brilliant best of view.    Iron Maiden is still one of the greats in this genre; very few of the current kids bands come close to the consistent quality Maiden has, and this applies to most of the surviving Hard Rock bands from the 70s and 80s, especially DIO ... the Voice of metal; Bruce is great, but still second to the master vocalist DIO.  11/2/08 : The thing that had not occurred to me was that the track listing on the single disc is closer to the top 20 track set which was the \\"fan voted\\" list for the ED HUNTER triple disc set ( I have not seen this available recently).Anyways, for fans of all the incarnations of Maiden, if you can get the Double disc set, it is a 1996 disc set originally that appears to have been remastered in 1999, or so, and then released in some markets as a single disc only, with not much thought for track listing. Maiden deserve the double disc best of.
B0000028UK|5.0|OK. Ive been into 90s grunnge/alternitive months now. Pearl Jam is either my 1st or 2nd band of the kind. I have 4 of their albums so far (this & Ten as burned copies, & Vitalogy & Yield). This is probably their best/masterpiece, even better than Ten. Now Ten is an album full of those great classics too, but the songs on Vs. have more detail than just stories about Eddie & other people. The songs still basically have the same stories on some of Ten's songs, but more understandable. I didn't like this album too much when I 1st heard it, but most of the songs had to grow on me. Now its in my top 5 favorite cd list. I definatly dont have an all time list yet, since I havent heard much classics from the 60's-90's era. Anyway, onto the songs...<br /><br />1. Go: Hard rocking opener with twisted lyrics & vocals from the man Eddie Vedder. Nice. 8.5/10<br /><br />2. Animal: 1st radio hit from the album, sounds alot like Even Flow, but at least the lyrics are different. One of the best. 10/10!<br /><br />3. Daughter: 2nd radio staple, an acoustic ballad about a daughter who lost her family, very sweet sounding. The opening acoustic riff also sounds like the one in the intro & outro for Hootie & The Blowfish's Only Wanna Be With You. 9/10<br /><br />4. Glorified G: Angry, catchy, fun, political, violent, and dancable all at the same time!! This has to be the best on the album! Too bad it wasnt a hit, but not all awsome cuts have to. 20/10<br /><br />5. Dissident: Another hit from the album, very good bass intro. Deep lyrics. 8/10<br /><br />6. WMA: Probably the worst on the album, but still decent, also the longest. 7/10<br /><br />7. Blood: Now THIS is a classic. Has Eddie screaming throughout most of the song. At least he mellows a bit a minute later. 9.5/10<br /><br />8. Rearviewmirror: Everyone says this is the best song on the album, and i'd have to say I can't agree on that. Still very good though. 8/10<br /><br />9. Rats: Funky, fresh, and catchy. One of the best. 9.5/10<br /><br />10. Elderely Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town: OMG, OMG!!! The BEST Pearl Jam single EVER tied with Jeremy! Very touching, also something happy and feel-good for a change. If you havent heard the beautiful chorus, shame on you! 4th radio hit from the album. 15/10<br /><br />11. Leash: Has Eddie screaming again, but not as loud. Gotta love the catchy chorus. Awsome, 9/10<br /><br />12. Indifference: OK, not as good as most of the songs on here. This is probably my least favorite instead of WMA. A ballad, but probably my least favorite of them (that i've heard so far), still not too bad. 7/10<br /><br />Overall, this was a totally awsome release from these boys, it even beat Ten in lyrics and sound. Dont get me wrong, Ten is VERY on par with this, and also gets 5 stars. Ill do a review for it evantually. Two more things, the longer songs (WMA & Indifference) couldve used some work with the production, theyre a little too overproduced. It was the fastest selling ever, but its pretty underrated for no reason at all. There may be plenty reviews, but not that to match up to Ten's overexposure.<br /><br />Wait, there's 1 more thing.................<br /><br />BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!! I dont mind if you read this review, but BUY IT RIGHT AFTER! Peace!of the best. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Elderely Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town: OMG, OMG!!!

B000000OAN|5.0|Queen have always done consistently Great work; this album is great. The music is GREAT music, and whatever you think the genre is, it really does not matter... this is superb music.  As noted by some reviewers, this was Queen's breakthrough album ... and the attention given to it in the 1970s, was because of ONE dj at the time ... if you look at the Hollywood brand DVD's with Live at Wembley, and BEST OF, volume 1 ( Which does not have the horrible editing done by DO-RO ) you will discover who this dj  was.  Out of the first 8 albums, two have been put into the DVD audio format ... this one, and THE GAME... both for excellent reasons.  Totally awesome CD, worth every penny.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love Japanese animation!  I think it is so interesting how the characters' eyes are so big, and their emotions are so obvious without them speaking of it.  My favorite Japanese animtation books/movies are stories where the main character(s) use(s) magic to save the day!  This movie was not only jam packed with magic, and made with beautiful animation, but the characters were so memorable, and the story really pulled you in!    I waited months after getting this movie to actually watch it, because despite all the rewards it received, I thought it looked kind of boring.  But when I watched it, all two hours and five minutes of it, I was still waiting for more!  The story was always exciting and kept me in anticipation.  It was full of action, magic, romance, friendship, and even a tiny little bit of comedy.      If you have loved Hayao Miyazaki's past movies, love Japanese animation, or just want a good movie to watch, I would highly recommend this movie to you!

B00005JNEI|5.0|This documentary is the most powerful and compelling film ever made.  Anyone who watches it is shown the plain truth, the words uncomplicated and the images clear.  Every Bush supporter I have invited to see my DVD responds with a vehement \\"no\\" as if they fear what is shown with such simple art.  Now I understand how millions of Jews were murdered under the very noses of the German people. Sadly, like the Germans,  Bushist Americans would rather believe propaganda than learn the truth.
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is one of those books that you wait to find for five years, even a decade. You know how it is. You read a really great book and, on coming to the end page, immediately want to find another book just as good to fill its place. So you go out looking for such a book, but cannot find it. You look for a week, then a month, then months turn to years, and finally,5 to 10 years later, you finally find a book that is a really great read. <br /> <br />Shantaram is such a book. It is an A+ story that captivates you on page one and sustains the pace through every one of its 920 pages. It overflows with a wide range of characters of every moral persuasion, good and bad. And it is rich with the big themes on the nature of humanity and the human struggle to survive and thrive, for better or worse. In addition, the actual writing is superb, descriptive and often beautiful, without ever descending into sentimental or maudlin. Roberts always manages to find the right phrase or word to bring into clear focus the incredible wide range of experiences he paints. I might add, this is one book that I do not want to see as a movie, because there is no way that a mere movie could be a fraction as good as this glorious, three dimensional work. <br /> <br />I'll be lucky if I have to wait only another 5 - 10 years to find another book this good.
B000002UAX|5.0|While numerous people have debated the greatest rock group, the most influential, etc., I ask what group could have put songs ranging from easy listening to pop to progressive on one album and have it sell millions of albums?  I am unable to name another group who has managed this feat.  This double album set is a concept album from the viewpoint that it is an exploration of music and the variations possible within rock.  A concept difficult to perceive, but this album was The Beatles being as creative and innovative as they could.<br /><br />Contemporary pop and rock is represented by songs such as \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.,\\" \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" and \\"Blackbird.\\"  Yet, there were songs that had elements of psychedelic rock, such as \\"Dear Prudence.\\"  However, it is not so much the works that were expected of the Beatles that make this album what it is.<br /><br />A first inclination of the scope of this album occurs at \\"Wild Honey Pie.\\"  This one minute song is very experimental with some of the simplest Beatles lyrics ever.  Clearly intended to explore the bounds of what was acceptable.  The experimentation expands well beyond this song.  \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" was written as a satire to a gun magazine article with a similar title.  However, the song also has elements that imply substance abuse and just a bit of psychedelia.<br /><br />Lennon and McCartney included themselves in their satire and commentary.  \\"Glass Onion\\" is an overview of what some past lyrics and a bit of a wakeup call to fans that the Beatles were singers and everyone had to find their own truth.  The song clearly states that there are other ways to look at the world other than through their lyrics and music.  One last comment on the extent of satire in this album:  \\"Little Piggies.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" could be interpreted multiple ways, but the line \\"He's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son\\" implies that criticism of the American tendency to interfere in world affairs.  Remember particularly that 1968 was the height of the Viet Nam war and the cold war was ongoing.  Lennon especially was very anti-war and while he liked America in general, he did not like his perception that its people often acted violently.<br /><br />Another of the unusual songs is \\"Yer Blues,\\" which seems to me to have a Hendrix influence.  While the style is distinct from Hendrix, it was easy for me to associate this song with Hendrix.  \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" sung so effectively by John Denver, is sung by Paul.  While John Denver sang this song as a country song, the Beatles have a folk interpretation.  Sandwiched between the heavy \\"Yer Blues\\" and the fast paced \\"Me and My Monkey,\\" the song seems orphaned.<br /><br />\\"Helter Skelter\\" is famous by its association with Charles Manson, but the song is actually about a relationship.  The song is a hard rocker, one of the hardest, but the subject is relatively mundane compared to its infamous association.<br /><br />\\"Revolution #1\\" is made to sound like a slowed version of \\"Revolution\\" released as a single opposite \\"Hey Jude.\\"  This version stands on its own as distinctively unique and more acoustic than the single.<br /><br />One of the most amazing songs to me is \\"Revolution #9.\\"  It has been reported that Lennon and McCartney called this a \\"sound collage.\\"  Perhaps so, but looking back with the perspective of time, you can see a connection between The Moody Blues albums \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and \\"In Search of the Lost Chord,\\" both released prior to this album, and the subsequent King Crimson album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\"  All three albums are now considered by most informed fans to be part of the evolution of progressive rock, and it is easy to see that \\"Revolution #9\\" fits into the progressive rock classification.  This song is one of the most unusual Beatles' recordings and an indication of how deeply experimental portions of this album were.<br /><br />This review would be remiss if I failed to include a comment about \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" one of the most incredible songs ever recorded, which automatically makes it one of the Beatles and George Harrison's best.  If music was always this good we would do nothing other than listen to music.<br /><br />There are many more songs on the album that the word limit of this review prevents me from covering.  I leave it to the listener to appreciate those other numerous songs.<br /><br />What exactly makes this album great?  That is hard to define.  The most important thing to consider is context.  This album was released in 1968.  Many of the musical styles included on this album had either never been done before, or were new, cutting edge rock in 1968.  Added to the newness of the styles is that it was customary then, as now, for most groups to generally stay within a particular range on an album.  True, there were variations that could even encompass a stray song that did not fit with the rest, but in general you could count on an artist to stay in a particular realm.  The Beatles broke that rule by including multiple styles on this one album, helping laying more groundwork for rock to further splinter into multiple genres.  Even in our more \\"enlightened\\" age of music, there are very few groups that could do what the Beatles did on \\"The White Album\\" and have it meet with any success, either critical or commercial.  The fact remains that the Beatles not only did it, they did it well, and at the same time created a work that remains one of the classic works of rock.> <br />This review would be remiss if I failed to include a comment about \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" one of the most incredible songs ever recorded, which automatically makes it one of the Beatles and George Harrison's best.

B00005JKED|3.0|Only the powerful perfomance of Denzel saves this movie from being another action-thriller with the same archplot that ends up in the same hero-villian chase which has become a redundent characteristic of most hollywood movies. What makes me sad is that a lot of these movies have great casts and plots, except for those finalizing sequences when the plot comes to resolution. This robs many of these movies of their potential to suprise and thrill viewers. Does a lot of people really enjoy predictability? I mean these filmakers would not be doing this if it was not working for them at the box office. Does this mean that the majority of people are so shallow that they would not demand more creativity and innovativeness from what they are fed entertainment wise?  <br /> <br />It grieves me think that \\"Training Day\\", as well as so many other movies, could have been phenomenal had it had a more original ending. The way some of the stories (that get subjected to this malaise of creativity) are so good at the begining makes me think that the writers have to \\"doctor\\" their stories to fit in the archplot paradigm. Or maybe they just get lazy. Either way this is a diservice to the industry.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I've heard many complaints about this score, but as a simple fan--not a music major, a composer, or critic--I like it.<br /><br />It has one musical theme that runs through it, making it memorable and easy to hum along with.  I like to have instrumental music for background when I'm working, but I like to have a tune--no elevator music, please.  It's fast-paced and energetic like the movie, and unlike some soundtracks (*ahem* LotR), is fairly good about not varying madly in volume from track to track.<br /><br />I've heard complaints that the music doesn't fit the film, but every time I hear it I relive the wonderful movie all over again.  To me it seems to be the perfect music for a pirate film--it evokes images of crashing waves, booming cannons, and fast-paced battles on the high seas.
B0000844I8|4.0|Contrary to many reviews here, there are two very compelling reasons to purchase the Ultimate Edition: DTS 6.1 ES and anamorphic widescreen. This is the first release to include either of these. Granted, that does nothing for the purchasing incentive for many people, but there are still many technophiles for whom these matter a lot, and this release to directed at them. <br /> <br />As for the movie, I've always liked it. It's got to be the only thing of Roland Emerich's that I find good, much less decent. Yes, it's rather cheesy, but I find the mixture of sci-fi and ancient civilization to be a very fascinating and original idea. The fact that it is a wall-shaking, action rollercoaster is very attractive, as well. <br /> <br />I've noticed the TV/movie debate and I'll throw in my 2 cents. I've seen a lot of the TV series and I've never really liked it. I understand that a TV series needs likable, bumbling characters with goofball senses of humor and with a wide range of out-in-the open idiosyncrasies. That's not at all realistic, though, and I prefer the movie's angle. The movie's characters consist of a kickin' squad of serious marine types, similar to the squad in Aliens. Personally, in a movie with military squads, I find that more enjoyable. Maybe the whole TV/movie debate is akin to a geek/jock debate; I don't know. I do know, though, that I find the movie's characters, though more one-dimensional, at least more believable and responsible. <br /> <br />Anyways, I recommend the movie as an adrenaline-pumping, popcorn flick and this new edition is required viewing for any technophile with a souped-up home theater.
038073186X|5.0|Lehane became my favorite writer of private eye novels, and while I am sad he has left that series behind, he is certainly improving as a writer. This is a fantastic thriller that will keep you turning pages from the minute you start. I don't know if any other writer in crime fiction can match Lehane's dialogue. Getting into many plot details in a review would be the same as giving it away, so I won't do that, but this is a wonderful book for anyone who loves nail-biting suspense and great plot twists.
B000006TRV|4.0|As a depressed, immature, drug-addicted teenager, nothing spoke to me quite like the manipulative lyrics of \\"The Wall.\\"  As a happy, relatively mature, sober adult, they readily reveal themselves to be less profound than originally thought.  That being said, I have spent more money on this album and the film companion than any other single work of music (and this includes a recording of Berlioz's \\"Damnation of Faust\\" on which I appear).  I have owned it on vinyl, cassette, CD (twice - after one copy was stolen from my car), and the film on VHS and DVD.   Why do I keep going back?  Two reasons: no matter how confused I think some of the lyrics are now, there is no denying the soul poured into them; and this album is undeniably an essential work in defining the (albeit flawed - much like this album) history of rock and roll in all its self-indulgent glory.   Students will be listening to this album 200 years from now (if we still exist on the planet), and despite our short-sighted present day society, that says something.  <br />  <br />OK - let's get to brass tacks.  Why will this album continue to be heard?  Grandeur.   While really only being the story of a boy who lost his father in WWII, then lost his soul to the excesses of rock and roll, lost his wife in that process, then, ultimately, lost his marbles, \\"The Wall\\" sprays to all fields, touching on themes of fascism, the judicial system, and nuclear war.   It doesn't matter that a lot of these themes miss their targets, it was ambitious enough to try.   The songs are connected the way that the songs in any decent Broadway musical are: similar melodies, similar voices, similar endings.  Not a lot of rock musicians (people most comfortable with a 4/4 tempo and a tonic, fourth, fifth chord progression) could even come close to the cohesion present here.   <br /> <br />My personal favorite \\"song\\" on this album has always been \\"Nobody Home\\" - while not the melodic masterpiece that \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is - \\"Nobody Home\\" so accurately describes the general hopelessness of a drug induced depression both in lyric and in melody, that I find it somehow strangely comforting.  \\"And I got a strong urge to fly/But I got...nowhere to fly to\\" - truer words have yet to be spoken about the funk that drugs can lead to.  I appreciate that Roger Waters wasn't just writing about drug use, but albums ultimately speak to the listener through their own personal experience, and that was my personal experience with the lyrics he wrote.     <br /> <br />As I have only given this album four stars, I must explain.  There are too many songs on this album that force me to hit fast forward.  \\"Nobody Home\\" is followed by \\"Vera\\" and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" which leads into \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"  Huh?  I appreciate breaking up a theme, but jeez, I thought we were done with the WWII talk on side 1 of this work.  Also, it galls me that one of the finest works in the film (and one of the songs that actually connects some themes) is left off the studio album.  \\"The Tigers Broke Free\\" is a great piece of music, and more in tune to the concept of the album than \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" ever could be.  I also (despite the fact that it is a really good song) find \\"Hey You\\" an unnecessary element to the album.  It just doesn't fit.  \\"Master of the House\\" is a great bit of theatre in \\"Les Miserables\\" - but it is there ONLY to create a hit - and that's what \\"Hey You\\" is.    <br /> <br />To sum up - this is an essential bit of music to own if you truly want to represent music in your collection, just be aware that no matter how great it seems, it fails on several levels.  Buy this album and decide for yourself.   <br />
B0001MDP3G|3.0|This is both the best and the worst Civil War/Love Story film I've ever seen.  Quite simply, I've never watched another movie that left me with the question \\"What did I just see?\\" ringing so strongly in my head. <br /> <br />There are elements of this film that seem designed for sophisticated film audiences.  There are other elements that are going to be satisfying to serious Civil War history buffs.  There are also elements that seem designed for gum-cracking 15 year old girls.  In this mix, there is an often beautiful movie suffering from an identity crisis. <br /> <br />Is it an art film?  Is it a history film?  Is it a standard Hollywood formula blockbuster?  The truth is, it's all three, and it remains conflicted and somewhat confused between these three identities for the duration of the film. <br /> <br />On the up side, the film's portrayal of the filthy, bloody desperation of 1864 is spot on.  Never before has a film been so frank and forthright about the actual living conditions of Civil War soldiers, or as unflinching from the actual nature of Civil War combat, which was at times as hellish and terrible as any human experience to date. <br /> <br />As for the question of desertion, by 1864 parts of the South were starving.  Men were leaving for home not because they missed their wives and sweethearts, but because their families were desperately begging them to come home to put in crops, plow fields and bring in harvests.  The currency was crashing in runaway inflation, and it was their family's economic desperation that tore most deserters away from their duty, not emotional desires.  This film does a fine job of portraying that desperate time. <br /> <br />I also can't fault the actors.  All the performances are first rate, and while I did find the superstar faces somewhat distracting from the \\"history film\\" experience, I guess it was really just the heavy-handed directing, especially where the romantic odyssey was concerned, that brought me to the brinkof nausea at times.  I can empathize with love at first sight, and with the innocent ardour of a simpler time, but when these are repeatedly fed to me with a firehose and a baseball bat, I can't help but rebel. <br /> <br />Worth watching, but it could have been much better with less stars and less Hollywood formula.
B000024D4R|5.0|WELL, THE FIRST TIME I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM, I STILL HATED PINK FLOYD, BUT ALL I NEEDED WAS JUST SOME SECONDS OF \\"DOGS\\" SO I REALIZE THAT I WAS IN FRONT OF SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY DIFFERENT..... <br />HOW CAN WE DISCRIBE THIS ALBUM?? WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU ARE USED TO RADIO SINGLES AND ALL THAT CRAP, DON'T LOSE YOUR TIME AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER \\"ARTIST\\"... <br /> <br />iT'S JUST INCREDIBLE WHAT COMES OUT FROM THE SPEAKERS WHEN YOU PLAY ANIMALS....GILMOUR'S GUITARS ARE JUST BREATHETAKING...AND ALL THE SOUNDS CREATE AN INMENSE COLLAGE THAT WILL OPEN THE MIND OF THOSE WHO LISTEN CAREFULLY..... <br />ALL I'VE GOT TO SAY IS THAT THIS ALBUM CHANGED MY LIFE -REALLY!- <br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR:READ GEORGE ORWELL'S ANIMAL FARM.. <br />
B00005JM0B|3.0|With all of the reviews for Terminator 3 I'm sure this has been pointed out before, but I thought I would add it anyway.  I just caught a fullscreen version of this film on cable and I noticed something I hadn't seen before.  I put my Widescreen Edition DVD of this title in and sure enough it was something I hadn't seen before.  The picture is cropped.  It isn't the full image.  It seemed like most of the picture from the bottom was chopped off.  Things like this drive me crazy.  I thought one of the good things about this DVD was how nice the picture looked.  Anyway, it probably doesn't matter because I am sure they'll release another version of this title soon, like every other big movie, so maybe they'll get that one right.  They probably did it on purpose so people like me would go out and buy a corrected version when it comes out.
B000002H70|5.0|This is my Cure's favourite album...Why?? easy....all the songs are great!! Robert Smith really sings with his soul, and the other members of the band -specially basist Gallup- help Smith in creating atmospheres that sound like water falling over you... <br />If you liked the singles released from this album, you should listen to songs that were not singles: Closedown, Disintegration, Homesick and Untitled... <br /> <br />I think this is the album where The Cure turned from a succefull  80's band into the leyend they are nowadays...
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I loved this movie...the scenery, costumes, acting (well, Kraven could have used a little lesson) but overall, I just loved it. This music lent a classical yet modern feel to it.  I seen it at the movies when it first came out, then I rented it 3 or 4 times and finally bought it and watched it about another 25 times, Maybe I just cant get enough of Viktor (grinz). I wait patiently for Underworld 2 to be released, Ill be the first in line to watch it.
0064407667|1.0|This book is not appropriate for the intended age group.  It isn't just a series of unfortunate events, but a series of perverse horrors.  Any child who isn't disturbed by these things has likely been exposed to (and hardened by) abuse, either personally or through media. <br /> <br />The unlikely and weak plot seems to be simply a dirty string tying the sadistic events together. <br /> <br />The characters aren't much better.  All are static.  Most are flat.   <br /> <br />The 'humor' would mostly go over the heads of elementary aged kids.  Adults may enjoy the spoofs of literary peculiarities.  Adults could be either amused or distracted by the definitions the author puts in.  I understood the humor but didn't find it very inspired.  The few feeble jokes certainly weren't worth the drudgery of reading the sickening book. <br /> <br />The only good things I can say about the Bad Beginning are that a) it is short, and b) that the author obviously didn't waste much time or energy writing such simple trash. <br /> <br />Most unpleasant books have some good thing to offer other than enjoyment--be it clever writing, an important lesson about the world, or insight into humanity and its potential.  This book has almost no merit whatsoever.   <br /> <br />Adults, don't waste your time.  Kids, don't pollute yourselves.   <br /> <br />If you want to read about human cruelty, try nonfiction such as histories, biographies, newspapers, or court records.  At least they won't try to cast evil in a 'fun' light.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|While I'm not a big Knopfler fan, I've listened to his music for years.  I bought the album unheard at iTunes and I can say that I was really pretty pleased.  The album covers pretty well travelled territory for Knopler musically but, as is usually the case, the stories told are evocative and engaging.  The album rests on a mostly folk/blues foundation with some really beautiful understated guitar.  Someone looking for a Knopfler album with hard riving guitar licks will likely be disappointed but if you dig that sort of restrained playing that let's you know the guy's a master guitarist but doesn't have to show it off then this will be more to your liking.  What drive the songs musically are the rhythms and the stories can be pretty compelling.  They are populated by the same sort of characters often found in Knopfler's songs, tragic (sometimes comically) figures on the wrong side of the tracks of life.<br /><br />I recommend this album if you are looking for something in the folk/rock genre with a strong sense of storytelling and an understated musical style.
B00003CXIY|5.0|screams the boys on the handicapped bus that one of them stole.<br /><br />If occasional raunchy humor does not make you wince, then there are plenty of laughs here along with \\"the greatest story ever told\\" of young college buddies racing across country to intercept a rogue videotape sent by mistake. DJ Qualls is very very good here in a breakout performance as the geek with low self esteem. Seann (E.L.) is hugely funny. Tom Green's actually unbelievably funny in a strange way! Considering this film, the cast is perfect.
B000002N25|5.0|Romantic interludes from times of old, stories from a grizzled war veteran, father and son in New Orleans; all of these and more can be found on what may be Mark Knopfler's best album.  Wonderful folk, Celtic and Acadian tunes populate this work to create a richly textured landscape.  I've had the album for years and it has never been far from my reach and was one of the first albums to make its way onto my iPod.<br /><br />Definitely a must have album for those seeking to escape from the bone grinding pop music machine.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell. This movie will get you to laugh. Especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work (preferably cubical style).
0061020710|5.0|The Colour of Magic is not your standard fantasy fare. True, it contains many of the elements that one expects to see in a run-of-the-mill fantasy novel - wizards, muscle-bound heroes, dragons, trolls, etc., but there is a not so subtle difference. First of all, this is a funny, funny book - intentionally, not accidentally so. Secondly, all the tired old elements from pulp fantasy that you find here are being used as a send-up, both of those fantasy cliches, and of the lives that we, the readers, live.<br />The book's protagonist, Rincewind, is a pathetically failed wizard, who knows but one spell, and that one he cannot use, for it may destroy the world. He manages to survive, barely, in the dive taverns of the great city of Ankh-Morpork on his desperately clever street smarts, and a penchant for languages. Against his better judgement, Rincewind hires himself out as a guide to a hopelessly naïve tourist, Twoflower. Soon, Rincewind, Twoflower, and Twoflower's fierce, animated, magical luggage are swept from one incredibly dangerous adventure to another, from the fiery destruction of Ankh-Morpork, through near annihilation in the temple of an unspeakable Abomination, a deadly power struggle in a kingdom of magical dragon-riders, to being nearly swept right over and off the rim of the world. Along the way, Pratchett manages to lampoon Fritz Leiber, H.P. Lovecraft, Robert Howard, and other fantasy standards, even including a throwaway Star Trek joke.<br />The Colour of Magic is the first of Pratchett's Discworld novels, a long series of books set in an impossibly clever and humorous alternative world. It is fantasy at its freshest and most irreverent. Mr. Pratchett should have to include warning labels on his books that they may become addictive, for it may be nearly impossible to read just one.<br /><br />Theo Logos
6305508550|5.0|Office Space is from Mike Judge the creator of Beavis and Butthead and the shots he take at coporate America in this film are so true. It's ironic on how close to home this movie hits. I work for FEMA in an office job and this movie is almost like going to work for me in a funny way.    Peter(Livingston) hates his job. He has the most annoying boss anybody could ask for and he  drives Peter nuts. Peter can't stand his job and his goal is to do absolutely nothing. He wants to do nothing and so he goes to a hypnotherapist to tell him about his problem. After an accident during the session Peter quickly finds himself stuck in his new dream of euphoria.    He likes a waitress a waitress named Joanna(Aniston) who works at the burger coffee join that him and his buddies go to. He gets her to come along in his quest of nothingness.     Layoffs are happening at Peters place of employment Intec. He is expecting to finally get laid off, but ends up with a promotion while his two best friends at work are scheduled to get fired. The three refuse to take it and come up with a stratedy to get back at Intec. They come up with a computer program that steals the extra cents from checks when they round down on the numbers in writing them. It's similar to the plot of Superman III. The plan backfires in Peters face and he is also struggling with his relationship with Joanna. He now must fix everything or wind up in jail.    The movie is great. A lot of people wont enjoy that much, but for those who work daily office jobs this is one of the greatest movies you'll ever see. We've all wanted to do what Peter does as work in which he just tells everybody how it feels. His boss is such a pefect image of a corporate america boss and it's sad on how true the impersenation is.    The actors are all pretty good in the film. There are no stand out roles and you won't be blown away by any performance. You will however love many of this memorable characters including Milton the psycho stapler lover is was the original idea for the whole movie.    If you have an office job or have ever had one than Office Space is a must own. Even if you haven't you'll still like the corporae America office humor. You won't want to miss this one.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|This CD was the perfect escape from the usual \\"warm and fuzzy\\" <br />Christmas CDs put out by the Country music industry and the John Tesh crowd of recent years.  It is sacriligious enough that you don't feel like you're listening to the local church choir but not so much that your kids can't listen with you. <br />The music, even the instrumental ballads, have that characteristic Tull sound, with Anderson's impeccable flute playing and Barre's unmatched sounds on the guitar. (Admittedly it isn't the \\"in your face\\" hard rock sound of 70s Tull, but c'mon, it's a Christmas album).  Get it, you won't be disappointed.  Even the remakes of the more conventional Xmas tunes won't make you feel like you're listening to Perry Como.
B0002DB52M|5.0|Its not too often that this happens while wallowing through the quamire that is the product of the movie industry, that a little gem is discovered. This movie is longer than most but in the process of excavating the mountains of garbage that one normally has to burrow through to find something that says something important, it shines out glissening from the mud. <br /> <br />The anti-American accusations are simply interesting and that is all. This is quite a normal response indeed to a fictious account of humans excoriating their souls for the purpose of self preservation as Americans do. But isn't the US village simply analogous of the rest of our brutal world? Americans do not have a monopoly on the bad human behavior depicted in Dogville. Humanity, just as individuals, are equally as pathetic as America, no more, no less and this incredibly articulate movie, brilliantly describes our sad condition so perfectly. And because it does this, it is warning us of our future imperatives and even informing our evolution. For this reason, it is profoundly pro human. <br /> <br />Many have talked about the technical and artistic attributes of this movie and so I have nothing to say about this except everyone involved in this piece of art has contributed to a cinematographic experience that I and others have not had for some time and will remember forever. <br /> <br />Thank You, Mark Cross, NIUE Is

0393035158|5.0|Religion is massive lie.  Human should never live a lie.    Lies perpetuated as faith is a big fraud on humanity    Why has Sam Harris's book been a best-seller and aroused such emotions.  Sam Harris is great writer who wrote a great book.    Truth, Truth, & Truth.  We know that which is True. There is also False.    True-False, Real-Unreal.      We have to teach children about the false-unreal.  Super-man, Bat-man, Spider-Man are all false, unreal fiction created by Humans.  The Sun-Earth-Moon is true, real.  We are all living on the Earth Now. Are you not living on the Earth.      The truth is that religion is false, i.e  Lies, Lies, Lies.  As adults, we should not live in a world of lies.   We must embrace Truth, Truth from Evidence and Science.     \\"Politics & Religion\\"  In polite company, keep politics and religion to yourself if you want peace.    In the U.S. there is elections, rule of law and the separation of church and state.  In poltics, open elections decide who will be the U.S. President.   The U.S. Constitution made religion a private, non-state activty.      Anyone can practice their religion as long as it is with their private, time, money and energy.   The state shall not proscribe doctrines in politics and religion.  The vote is a secret and private vote.  Religion is a private matter.   This formula of election and private religion has led to unparallel peace and freedom in America.      However, in the world, not all want to keep religion a private matter.   All the world's religion are hell-bent to converting you to their faith.   Those non-believers are considered Infidels .  Many Islamic nations do not have seperation of church and state.    Israel is founded as a Jewish-based state.      The U.S. President is a born-again Christian.     If religion were to be kept as a private, non-state activity, the world would be a better place.   However, the ugly head of relgion has been reared again.  Again and again, we are forced to deal with religious fanatics hell-bent on death and chaos.       Relgion is the BIG LIE.  A lie is a statment, idea, claim to truth that has no factual, empirical evidencet to support the statement.   Claims to truth must be supported by empirical evidence.  Empirical evidence is that which is true by observation and experiment.   The Earth has one Moon.  Maxwell's four equations govern the interaction between electro-magnetism.      Humans generally have two eyes, two ears and one nose.       All claims must be supported by observation or experiment-based evidence.        With so many religions, holy books, doctrines, not a single relgion is based on evidence.   In fact, religion is the opposite of evidence.   That is the reason the are so many religions in the world.  Religions vary arcross time and space.  Religions ideas differ among people of the same faith.       Religion is a fraud, sham and a lie.   The worst aspect of religion is that it is a lie.  Lis are claims which are false, untruth.  Those with beliefs in religion are \\"Living a Lie\\".     \\"Living a Lie\\"  The U.S.S.R. was a big lie.  Marx-Lenin communist dictatorships were the big lie.   Many intellectuals knew they were \\"living the lie\\" under a communist dictatorship.   Communism is secular lie before it collapsed.  Faith is a religious lie.       Lies, big lies in religion are harmful, abhorrent, and damaging to the future of humanity.   Just as Super-Man, Bat-Man, Spider-Man, Santa Claus, are human fiction and human folklore.   Intelligent adults know Super-Man, Bat-Man, Spider-Man are fiction for the purpose of entertainment and human creatvity.    No one kills each other over Bat-Man and Spider-Man.    The same is True for Jesus, Mohammad, Moses, and Buddah.   Fake, phony, lies and pure human fiction.       Religion is a lie, lie, lie just as true belief in Super-Man, Bat-Man and Spider-Man is a lie.       For those religious fanatics who want to convert the non-believers, where is the \\"scientific evidence\\"   Whereis the proof.  \\"Where is the beef\\".    \\"Incredible claims requires incredible evidence\\"  Where is evidence that \\"god\\" created the world in six days, not seven or nine or a thousand days.  Who created \\"god\\".      Does he, she or IT drive a Honda, Toyota or Ford to work everyday.   Does \\"god\\" have green card to live in the USA or lives underground.       Religion will never have evidence to prove anything.  It is the BIG LIE.  The six billion people of Earth need to abolish religion because living in a big lie is dangerous and false.   The six billion people of Earth need the Truth, Truth, Truth and more of the Truth.      Truth can only be confired by empirical science and empirical experiment.       TRUTH MAKES YOU FREE.    DO YOU FEAR THE TRUTH.    TRUTH TROUGH SCIENCE.     THE END OF FATIH IS THE END OF LIES, UN-TRUTH   THE REALIZATION OF FREDDOM FROM IGNORANCE.      Sam Harris maybe compared to Charles Darwin, Galileo Galilei,  and other greats liberated men and women from lies, false and ignorance and religion.    The Book is great, no less than a miracle, must buy, and must buy  for those who seek the end of faith, and liberation from the big lie.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Imagine, if you would, finding something with empty calories that you just can't stop consuming until, when it's finally over, you find yourself stuffed and feeling sick. That's kind of the impression I got after watching Van Helsing. There is nothing there, but you can't help but watch and enjoy the total ridiculousness of it. It is entertaining for sure, with incredible eye candy, but leaves you with a hollow feeling. The plot, for what there is of it, is basically this : Hugh Jackman plays Gabriel Van Helsing, monster hunter axtraordinaire. He teems with a beautiful Transylvanian princess named Anna(Played by the exquisiteley beautiful Kate Beckinsale), and later, Frankenstein's Monster(Will Kemp), to stop the king of all things that go bump in the night, Dracula himself(Played by Richard Roxburgh), and his evil spawn and vampire brides. There is some more mumno jumbo about Anna's family and all that, but does it really matter?. Nope. Not at all. In fact, none of it matters. Director Stephen Sommers makes movies that don't recquire a solid, coherent plot. Just lots of fun, lots of action, and lots of effects. Mission accomplished. Sommers, who has already made his print on Hollywood with \\"The Mummy\\" and it's sequel, follows his same old formula. The movie is a non stop rollercoaster ride that just flies off in all different directions that it is hard to keep up. The sets, production design, and locations, are nothing short of gorgeous and breathtaking. One gigantic plus the movie has. Sommers knows how to film a set and amazing locations and he films the heck out of every one. So much so, that the film is more about the photography than it is about anything else. Jackman is a very nice, likeable guy, but he seems to be at odds with the role. He is at once interesting and inviting, and the next seems wooden and off somewhere else. Beckinsale is unbelieveably gorgeous, and the camera loves her. At least she has a strong character to play instead of the usual damselin mistress. Roxburgh, as Dracula, hams it up in an off setting performance. He seems to be channeling the old school style of Dracula acting instead of anything new or scary. His accent sounds forced and off centered at times as well. No doubt the actor is good elsewhere, but he seems to flimsily do it here. The movie does a nice job of incorporating all of the classic Universal movie monsters like The Wolfman, Jekyll And Hyde, and others, into the movie. The beginning of the movie, filmed in glorious black and white, is the finest part of the entire movie. It really felt like those old type films. If only for a short bit. The CGI is good in parts, obviously fake in others. There is so much CGI and effects and the like, that the film goes on overload and out of control. It seems that the whole point of the movie was to get to point A to point B just so they could set up some extravagant action/chase/CGI scene, with nothing keeping it together. If you like this sort of thing, which I do, you will probably dig the simple popcorn entertainment of it all. But a little goes a long way sometimes.
B0001I561E|5.0|I'm an avid fan of Disney and had this pre-ordered months in advance... And it really was worth the wait!!<br /><br />There's a huge amount of extras... Read the specs above for details... There are interviews, making of... Stuff for kids... Just loads and loads.<br /><br />Something I seemed to miss, however, was the included signed sketches from the animators... WOW... Great!! Most certainly something you don't pick up with the average DVD.<br /><br />Whilst this set is fantastic, it's more for die-hard Disney fans. If you just want to see the original movie, pick up a cheap DVD off eBay... You'll certainly be missing out, though!!
0312995423|2.0|It started out fast paced but once things start going wrong, it would drag to get to any result. I kept wanting to skip most of the chapter just to get to the point.

B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles portrayed exponential growth with Revolver. Revolver is one of my favorite Beatles albums and definitely one of my all-time favorites. Here's my evaluation of each song: <br /> <br />1. Taxman - A George gem about the treacherous British tax system where the highest progressive tax was at 90%. Paul provides a killer bass line and, I believe the solo.  <br />2. Eleanor Rigby - Whereas most authors can tell a dramatic story in hundreds of pages, Paul delivers a beautiful story in less than three minutes. Paul's classical influence is delivered here with help from producer George Martin.  <br />3. I'm Only Sleeping - A Lennon song, capturing a \\"sleepy feeling\\". This tune was the prelude to the excellent \\"I'm So tired\\" in the White Album. <br />4. Love You To - George's second song on the album, performed exclusively with Indian instruments. Not one of my favorites, but definitely another leap by the Beatles into the realms of experimentation. <br />5. Here, There and Everywhere - Paul gives us yet another beautiful love song which John has referred to as one of his two favorite Paul songs, the second of which is \\"For No One\\", also in this album.  <br />6. Yellow Submarine - A great sing-along sung by Ringo with a little help from the boys. John and George's first LSD experience provided to them by a dentist friend of George's inspired this tune. While going down the elevator, John felt that he was ridding a yellow submarine.    <br />7. She Said, She Said - Inspired by a quote from the \\"Book of the Dead\\", John wrote this psychedelic piece after he heard Peter Fonda repeatedly tell him \\"I know what it's like to be dead\\". This song was written during the time when John's LSD usage was at its peak. <br />8. Good Day Sunshine - A happy poppy tune by Paul. <br />9. And Your Bird Can Sing - The opening harmonized riff and solo show John's ability to write innovative guitar pieces. I wish they had Paul's harmony on the last chorus in all the choruses!  <br />10. For No One - Another beautiful composition from Paul infused with classical influences. The chorus is one of my favorite melodies ever. Paul also provides us with excellent lyrics, dispelling his reputation of just being the melody man. <br />11.  Doctor Robert - According to John, Dr. Robert was someone from whom they could get all the drugs they could digest.  <br />12. I Want to Tell You - Before Revolver, George was limited to two songs per album. This was the first time and the only single-disk Beatles' album that George was able to have a third song. Great chorus.  <br />13. Got to Get You into My Life - Paul disguises his pot smoking experience with \\"I was alone, I took a rid, I didn't know what I would find there\\". I remember a TV commercial for \\"Tab\\" cola in the late 70s that ripped off this tune's middle melody. <br />14. Tomorrow Never Knows - John's masterpiece and bona fide acid trip experiment with music. The solo has a combination of backward guitars and tape loops of Paul laughing at high speed (the \\"bird sounds\\"). Ringo's unique drum work shines and, without it, it wouldn't have sounded the same. And what an ending to an awesome album! <br />
B00001SIES|5.0|I discovered Muse first, and heard all of the talk of them sounding like radiohead.. So I went back and listened to every radiohead album. Sorry, but after listening, I've come to the conclusion that Muse just has so much more emotion in their music, something that radiohead lacks.  <br /> <br />This is one of the finest albums to ever grace my ears.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I have to say that after the cool reception of the film by critics and viewers alike, I wasn't expecting much. So, I was quite surprised when I found to be liking the movie a lot more than I had originally intended. I am a sucker for a good adventure/action film, and who doesn't love it when it is a giant disaster flick?. Director Roland Emmerich gave us the hit \\"Independence Day\\", but then again, he also unleashed the horror of \\"Godzilla\\" on us as well. Here, he delivers a pretty solid, interesting, human, and exciting tale of mother nature gone awry. Dennis Quaid stars as Jack Hall, a climatologist working for the government, who is at odds with his son Sam, who is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. The strained father and son relationship is put to the test when the earth is hit by global warming that puts everything and everyone in danger. Tornados level Los Angeles, including some nifty scenes of the Hollywood sign and Tower Records, and cause a flooding of New York City and so on. Jack is stuck in Washington D.C., and son Sam is holed up with some friends and other New Yorkers in a museum in New York City. Sam being there for a school affair with his friend, and female companion who, not surprisingly, he longs for. Other typical characterizations of people litter the crowds of trapped city goers. The first hour sets up the severity of the storms and the destruction and isolation, while the second half spends the rest of the movie with our trapped cast fighting to stay alive from the ever dangerous weather. It is nice to see Dennis Quaid in such a film. I have always liked him and his work, and have always felt he was underrated and overlooked a bit in the grand scheme of things. He's a good actor. It is surprising to see smaller, indie-type actor Gyllenhaal in one. I haven't seen most of his work, but I do like him. He does just fine here. If he had done \\"Spider-Man 2\\" because of Tobey's back injury, it might of been okay after all. Both fit pretty well here. Emmerich's movies are always made for the effects and overal epic-ness of it all, and this one is no exception. The father-son storyline isn't a new one, and there is nothing here that adds to the overused plot line, or enhances it. Surprisingly, at least to me, it wasn't tne needless, thankless, lame plot ploy that a lot of people thought it was. I liked it, and it worked for me for some reason. The effects and destruction are quite a spectacle. That is for sure. The New York devastation more so than Los Angeles or anything else. Who doesn't want to see a ship harbored in a hustling section of downtown New York?. The effects are wild indeed, but seem more settled and level than those in Roland' previous opus'. If that makes any sense. While the effects and all that are great, fun to watch, and what most people are only interested in, I found myself being more interested and involved with the second half of the film. Watching everyone trying to live, and Jack trying to trek to New York to resuce his son. Ian Hol, famous from \\"Alien\\", has a supporting role here as a Professor. Also expect to see Sela Ward, who has a rather small role as Jack's ex-wife and Sam's mother, who is trapped in the hospital she works at. And Perry King also appears in the film, albeit a small role, as The President Of The United States. It's harmless fun that is definitley fun and entertaining to watch. The scariest thing about the film is that it leaves you with a question....what if?.
0312962118|5.0|This is one of the best books ever put down. Set in 1950's, a CIA assassin is sent to USSR to kill Joseph Stalin. This novel is so realistic, so action-packed, so absorbing, full of characters you can't let go off. It is a masterpiece of fiction. It should be read by everyone who appreciates great fiction. It is on the same level as \\"The Berkut\\", two incredible novels.
B00005LLAC|5.0|Good CD the first CD is just the normal Marshall Mathers LP but the second disk has some good songs and the remix of The Way I Am with Marlyn Manson and some instrumentals.
B000069I1H|5.0|Not only the best cop comedy movie ever, but one of the best comedies out there, the best Eddie Murphy movie ever (at least of the dozen or so I've seen), and I'd even go so far as to say it's one of the best Robert DeNiro movies ever.  \\"Showtime\\" - the name of the film as well as of the reality tv show within the movie - stars Murphy as an inept, action-movie inspired junior cop who moonlights as an aspiring actor, and DeNiro as a more capable cop who ends up in trouble with his superiors after getting into a scuffle with the media.  In order to avoid a lawsuit, the police department have to make DeNiro star in a new reality tv series that'll follow he and brand-new partner Murphy (chosen specifically by the producers because DeNiro doesn't want to work with Murphy, who previously botched a major operation by trying some overly flamboyant heroics he apparantly saw in a movie) on their appointed rounds.  Great comedy ensues, with appearances by Rene Russo as the show's producer and William Shatner as himself (brought in to give DeNiro acting lessons!) in a small but brilliant part.  One of the very best comedies in years, and a much better action movie than most (but not all) big-budget summer blockbusters.  One of the few repeatedly-laugh-out-loud movies in too long.
0679735259|2.0|<br />Dispatches by Michael Herr is a book that was made to show how terrible the Vietnam war was. Herr being an independent reporter had almost no restrictions except his own. The images you can depict in your head as you read this book are terrifying. Going in to vivid detail is one of the greatest parts of this book.  <br /> <br />The ability to kill in cold-blood is one topic that is touched on a lot in this book. This changes the soldiers lives forever, endless nights men stay up and think about what they have done. The ones who didn't mind killing found some hate in the enemy that kept them going, and found fulfillment in carrying around weapons. Something almost always went wrong. The men were never fully informed on all the thing that happen to them, this added to the stress the soldier go under during battle. Your knew that if you went with the marines you would get shot or wounded.  <br /> <br />Often crude language is used, and the thoughts of the men are just terrible. The men speak and think as if death is just around the corner for all of them. The men that fought this war were unhappy, because they thought they were fighting in an unjust war. They had no motivation to be brave and become hero's. It's interesting to read this book while the war on Iraq is going on. Could it be that the same deluded American people are at it again? Could this war be another Vietnam war?  <br />Throughout the book Herr talks about video clips that his partner Jim Page got. These are described so detailed that I felt as if I was going to vomit while reading it. Men pray to God for the first time ever. In such a tragic time in need of some hope some help from a higher power. Men break down and cry wishing they could have paid more attention to church, like there lives were already over. Men found God and comforted themselves. On the battlefield seem as if they are not alive like it is a dream. <br /> <br />The book seems to be an emotional one. Its one of the only books that was mad from the point of view of a grunt soldier (foot soldier). I think that Dispatches was mad to show America what war is really like, and to think before you go to war. There must be many things there before you can go to war, like the full support of the people who are fighting for your. I think this book should be read in our class rooms to teach the kids that could be our leader for years to come see how terrible war is.  <br /> <br />Dispatches is a good book, possibly a great book, and certainly ranks amongst those books which I would consider as a 'must read'. Writers such as Herr, while not necessarily contributing as combatants nonetheless make a huge contribution to our perception of war itself. This book is about nobility amidst futility, it is about a noble endeavor pursued by ignoble methods ultimately it is about the death of innocence, and how we should never lose our childish qualities.  <br />
0316168815|5.0|I waited for a long time to read this book. The story is told from heaven, by a young girl who was raped and murdered. Hm. I wasn't sure about this, as I am generally not interested in science fiction, and this seemed to come pretty close. <br />I'm glad I changed my mind. The story of the rape and murder is told with great sensitivity, without losing any of the horror. This is one of the most redeeming novels I have ever read. The aftermath of the murder is so tragic. We see the unbelievable grief and suffering of her family, and yet I was left with a firm belief in humanity. This story is a testimony that we really are strong, we really can endure, and in the end, somewhere there is true healing.
B000000WF9|5.0|This is the very first (and up to date the only one) Nyman soundtrack for a Science-Fiction film. <br />The soundtrack for Gattaca is based on the usual Nyman composing and use of strings and piano in a minimalistic fashion, vith a very good result. <br />Music is very quiet, intimate and almost inaudible at times, very relaxing to listen to after a hard day at work. <br />The theme for Jerome and The Morrow is wonderful and reprised along the album, to a good result. Also magnificient are the theme for Irene, The Crossing, The Departure and Irene and The Morrow. <br />More varied than the soundtrack for The Piano and enjoyable to listen too. <br />Both Music and sound quality have a lot of presence that makes you feel like you are on the recording hall with Nyman and the musicians, very realistic and inmersing. <br />A masterwork.
068987474X|5.0|Finally, I get the picture!  So Luke Yoder didn't want to marry me because the attraction had fizzled?  Really, I learned alot from this book.  It put my \\"thinking hat\\" on.  For I realized that, even in my prior Amish and Mennonite religions, I tried really hard to get a guy's attention. When the fact was that he wasn't attracted.  I have seen many an Amish girl never get married(I talk about this in \\"Leaving Lancaster County\\") because \\"Mr. Right\\" never asked her.  Maybe I could \\"sneak\\" a copy of this book underneath my Christmas Cookbook that launches in December when I visit Lancaster County again!  Never hurts to try!  Great book, even for an X-Amish gal!
B0002S94OS|4.0|Anyone who wants to diss these guys are only jealous of their success. \\"Ashes of The Wake\\" debuted at number 27 on Billboard?? This is an unbeleivable accomplishement for any \\"underground\\" band, much less one in this genre. And, in my opinion, this performance backs the positioning in it's sales. This should be required listening for any metal fan.  Highly recommended.
B000068FWC|4.0|Some songs just seep into consciousness. They get blared over the radio constantly and millions suck them in without even knowing what hit them. The vast majority of such songs exemplify insipid lyrics and melodies (i.e., the kind of songs you hate but can't stop singing). This complaint does not apply to Supertramp's \\"The Logical Song.\\" If you were alive in 1979 you heard this song. I remember hearing it as a kid and liking it tremendously. The lyrics seemed to hit on something that other pop songs at the time recoiled from. It's philosophical. It's intelligent. It talks about lost youth and the bizareness of growing up in the modern world. Hearing it again as a \\"grown-up\\" brings out some of the more \\"grown-up\\" themes that flew over me as a kid. Especially: \\"Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical, liberal, fanactical, criminal; Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable!\\" Only years later did I find out the song's title and that Supertramp, a British group, included it on their album \\"Breakfast in America\\". Of couse I went out and picked up the album and was hit with a few more surprises: I had also osmosed \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Take the Long Way Home\\" and \\"Breakfast in America\\". I should've realized earlier that these were all the same band because the production of the album is very consistent throughout. Listening to the album today reveals it as one of the late 1970s pop masterpieces. It's not trite, it's not melodramatically feel good. It's filled to the hilt with great sounds, instrumentation, and songs. Not only, it also has enough \\"seen-it-all\\" lyrics to keep the most fervent cynic entranced.<br /><br />It is disappointing to find out that the band started to fracture irreversibly with this album. Songs like \\"Casual Conversation\\" and \\"Child of Vision\\" mirror John Lennon and Paul McCartney's vitriolic rants from album to album after the Beatles' demise or Fleetwood Mac's not so subtle brickbat throwing on 1977's \\"Rumours\\". Why does success spoil so many great bands? And why do so many successful band members feel the need to make personal rants on mass produced albums? It's a strange, often repeated phenomenon in rock music. But, those who aren't aware of the strife, or choose to ignore it, won't be bothered by it when listening to \\"Breakfast in America\\". The music speaks for itself.subtle brickbat throwing on 1977's \\"Rumours\\". Why does success spoil so many great bands?

B000000H7I|5.0|I love mullen's vocals on \\"effigy of the forgotten\\" its realy difirent from his other style...But still good. I must say that suffocation being one of my favorite bands in the scene? I hold all of their albums very dear to me and makes me proud to be a fan of pure and technical deathmetal. I recommend!
B000002MUQ|5.0|To begin with, I love this album.  Everything's so good on it. Music is well composed, produced and performed, front concept is such an original, weird but simple and elegant cover, as well as the inlay with the egg balancing on Eddie's guitar.  The opening with The Seventh Seal is overwhelming, Eddie at his best with the Hagar's voice in top shape.  There are several Van Halen classics on this album, like Don't Tell me, The aforementioned The Seventh Seal, Not Enoug, Take Me Back and the underrated but filled with Eddie's virtuosity and pyrothecnics Aftershock. The icing of the cake are the strange Strung Out and the dynamic Baluchitherium.  All the energy of Van Halen is back on Balance.  Sound quality is pristine, drums are very well captured with a lot of punch, bass guitar is absolutely there, with a lot of \\"weight\\", not hidden in the mix (as is the norm on Rock recordings), Eddie's guitar is very sharp and Sammy's voice is well defined, always very present on the mix.  Balance is a very consistent album.  Not only for die hard fans.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Stephen Sommers, the man who brought us the \\"Mummy\\" movies, wrote and directed the clever monster movie, \\"Van Helsing.\\" You've got to hand it to this guy for single-handedly trying to bring back the long-lost and much-missed \\"rainy Saturday afternoon adventure epics.\\" <br /> <br />The film is gorgeous. Snowy, gothic, shadowy Eastern European locations predominate, and the aggressive, brilliantine CGI will take your breath away. Actually, there were a couple of moments where I just had to pause the film to turn to my friend and say \\"this movie sure looks EXPENSIVE, doesn't it?\\" before both agreeing that we \\"liked it more than we thought we would.\\" <br /> <br />Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a sort of nineteenth century monster-hitman who must take on Dracula, The Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster in seemingly one lost weekend. He arrives in Transylvania and is practically spit on by the trembling, untrusting townfolk. We have to deal with terrorism and a waning economy in today's modern world, but THEY have to deal with vampire's brides swooping down from the clouds, baring fangs, hissing, and devouring \\"one or two villagers a month.\\" <br /> <br />Van Helsing quickly proves himself to the sexy Transylvanian princess (Kate Beckinsale, who never wavers in her commitment to her Slavic accent AND her eye makeup). Although it is never explained where she gets her highlights, after a brief scuffle that establishes sexual tension in that action-movie way, they are off as a team to try and defeat evil from reproducing, and conquering the continent, while upholding a commitment to a Royal Bloodline, that Dracula and his henchmen will finally be destroyed. <br /> <br />Again, I'd like to thank the filmmakers for making it a BIT more complex than it could have been. Dracula, though evil, is funny and charming. The Wolfman, though hairy, is Beckinsale's brother (and his wolf infection, oddly enough, seems almost to be an allegorical stand-in for the AIDS epidemic) and the Frankenstein monster, though ugly, has issues of his own. <br /> <br />The supporting cast do more with campy with one-dimensional roles than anybody ever could have asked. Richard Roxburgh, as the Count, has a lot of fun with his part. Shuler Hensley, as Frankenstein's monster, is teriffic. \\"I want to live\\" he declares simply while dangling over the edge of a cliff toward the film's end. And as cheesy as the moment was, I found it weirdly touching. The film has a relentless energy and bounding enthusiasm, so every moment counts, and with all of its flaws, I was never bored. <br /> <br />Early sequences, such as the black-and-white opening horror homage, and the rooftop battle, with of all creatures, a fantastic Jekyll--Hyde CGI creation, are memorable. However, inattention to certain major details brings the film down a few levels from classic, unvanquished  adventure films such as \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\"  <br /> <br />To start, the dialogue is exceptionally bad, and it didn't need to be. The plot has more holes than a slice of Finlandia swiss. Character relationships are glossed over. Much-needed attempts at humor fizzle. Van Helsing's romance with Beckinsale is virtuallly ignored. Hugh Jackman is a wonderful actor, but his Van Helsing has all the range of a William Shatner film festival. And if he's the film's central hero, with sequels certainly to come, we've got to know him and like him. Instead of probing a bit more, we're left to ponder the three g's: grunts, grimaces, and grizzled objections of complaint. <br /> <br />That being said, the film is a lot of fun, with dazzling spectacle and great, relentless action sequences. The DVD is generously packed with behind-the-scenes extras, that step-by-meticulous step systematically destroy every illusion that the production spent gazillions trying to seduce us with. <br /> <br />On one further note, I am sure kids would love this film, but I would advise parents to use extra caution. I was a sensitive, fragile little boy and I have a feeling certain scenes, like those fangy flying wraiths devouring fleeing villagers, would have kept me up for a night or two. <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|OK I'll get it off my chest that I'm a conservative that usually does not agree with Michael Moore.  Having said that, I support the idea of getting a look at other opinions and views.  One show I used to always watch was Bill Maher's old show, \\"Politically Incorrect\\" because it usually contained opinions from both sides and each side was given a voice.  And it was amusing.  \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" however is not such a case.  Its a film full of a bunch of little conspiracy theories that are presented as facts.  I wouldn't even go so far as to call them that because you can do the research on your own to find that a lot of the film's scenes are edited and distorted to present an illusion.  An illusion that is sadly being misunderstood by many Americans who are accepting this film as fact.  After picking it apart, to call it a documentary would be a joke.  Now effective propaganda?  You bet!  If you are the kind that doesn't really follow politics you would almost without a doubt walk away from this film, hating the Bush Administration.  But if you did your homework and found out all the liberties that he took with all the various parts you would find out what a fake of a movie this really is and how insulting it is to the intelligence of the American people.  Now I know your probably wondering what I am talking about but the truth is I could write pages and pages on the lies in this movie.  My advice is to watch the movie.  Then watch \\"FahrenHYPE 9/11\\" and visit [...] and realize what exactly Moore has done here.  Now I am not putting down the liberals here.  There are lots of good arguments that could be made against Iraq, the War on Terror, and the Bush Administration.  This film isn't an agrument.  Its a magic trick.  And a lousy one at that.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|After writing and directing the empty blockbusters of the Mummy and the Mummy Returns, Van Helsing finds him looting Universal's monster vault once again, this time featuring the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolfman (Will Kemp), and of course, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh).  Hugh Jackman stars as the monster hunter Van Helsing, teamed up with a princess (Kate Beckinsale) and a loyal friar (David Wenham from Lord of the Rings), sent to Transylvania to stop the count from unleashing a horde of bloodsucking offspring.  Some spots of the film are deliciously campy, while others stick out as plain dull.  The opening is a wonderful homage to the classic Universal monster films, and buffs of classic horror will find plenty of references and homages in the film.  The special effects are some of the best CGI seen today, and Van Helsing is more satisfying than Sommers' Mummy films, although underneath the break neck pace and special effects there isn't much left to it.  It's still worth seeing and it has a bit of a surprising ending, and a sequel is almost virtually inevitable.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film is a must for all. It brings to life the events of the last days of Jesus Christ. It is well made and has made every attempt to remain accurate to the facts as written in the Bible. It certainly touches the heart and makes for a good discussion topic. Well made, filmed, and the actors are superb, a joy to watch. I could not stop myself from having a secret weep. So watch with hankies at the ready. It will not disappoint. Top marks to Mel Gibson and his team, and also to the Person who made it all possible in the first place.
B000001FDQ|5.0|Looking at the album cover, it may seem this is the usual Hard Rock record. It is not... <br />Only the visionary and twisted mind of Malmsteen, on par with his virtuosity could conceive and perform an album such us this. <br />Here you have one of the Bibles of electric guitar playing, both composing-producing and performing wise. <br />Evil Eye, Icaru's Dream and Black Star have the most beautiful notes I ever heard been pulled out from an electric guitar. <br />This album is absolutely amazing and surprising, guitar playing is redefined on it. No dout about it. <br />The arpeggios Malmsteen gets are second to none, as well as his artificially generated harmonics. <br />Give it a listen and you'll know what I'm talking about. <br />A must have, very recommended.
1558216847|1.0|This book is a fake.  Its been known to be a fake for decades <br />but for unknown reasons many people would rather read a fake <br />book about the USSR than read real accounts of people who <br />suffered horribly under stalinism and communism. <br /> <br />Why is it a fake?  There is nothing in it (including the  <br />identity of the author) that can be proved out. <br /> <br />No such person as \\"Slavomir Rawicz\\" was an officer in the <br />polish army or the polish army in exile.  No such person <br />appears in the soviet records and neither does the camp <br />he claims he was at.  There is no evidence of his ever having <br />been in India.  It would be different if some parts of his <br />story at least could be confirmed by others, but not one <br />single part of it can be proved by anything but his word to <br />have happened. <br /> <br />Those who promote this FRAUD are doing a terrible injustice <br />to the real victims of the soviet system.  Why anyone would <br />choose to ignore true stories of poles and others supported <br />by facts in favor of a ghost written book full of nonsense up <br />to and including an encounter with a snowman is beyond reason. <br /> <br />If you want to learn about polish officers in the USSR, a <br />fact to start with is that tens of thousands of them were <br />executed and thrown into mass graves.  Others were put into <br />real camps in the gulag and then found there way out either <br />by escape or through the releases that were arranged by  <br />strong men who did not forget them and forced the soviet union <br />to release many of the remaining survivors. <br /> <br />Those stories are real and the brave actions of those involved <br />is real.  Those who promote this work of fiction and fraud <br />are doing a disgrace to the memory of a great many victims <br />of stalinism. <br /> <br />
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Will is not exactly what most women would consider the Catch of the Week.  Sure, he's charming, devilishly handsome and terribly winsome when he wants to be, but. . .well, he's never at any time in his life held a job, content to live off the royalty's of his dad's one hit song; he cares only for himself and is perfectly pleased, even proud, to be shallow and without any hidden depths; and even if all this is not a deterent, the relationship will last no longer than two months at the most, and it will revolve mostly around sex. <br /> <br />Marcus is. . .well. . .the opposite.  He's a very sweet child, but not smooth or cool to say the least, and sweetness doesn't really matter terribly in the junior high.  Also, Marcus cares almost too much.  His life is his Mom and his Mom is unraveling.  Marcus finds himself stuck.  He has to be the man of the house, and he has to hold his fragile family together because his mother is just not up to the task.  Lately, she's been crying a lot. . .even in the mornings, and she's never cried in the mornings before.  This occupies Marcus' thoughts more than school or reputation or anything else.  It influences his behavior, making him an even easier target for the cruel schoolyard crowd. <br /> <br />Will and Marcus find their lives suddenly intersecting.  This is the basis for the newest adaptation of a Nick Hornby (\\"High Fidelity\\") novel, entitled \\"About a Boy.\\"  And it is excellent.  Will, played perfectly by Hugh Grant, is perhaps even more hopeless than Rob Gordon, John Cusack's character from \\"High Fidelity.\\"  Marcus is played by newcomer Nicholas Hoult, who is a true find.  Casting is a major factor in films with large child roles, but Nicholas is absolutely perfect as Marcus.  The rest of the cast is well-chosen as well, but the film really comes down to Will and Marcus and the smart screenplay--and these three elements make it a five-star film. <br /> <br />Will, always the commitment-phobic playboy, discovers the world of single mothers, which he sees as the Holy Grail of Bachelorhood.  What could be the downside?  These women are emotionally scarred, hungry for physical affection and too reluctant to pursue any relationship for too long because of their children.  Brilliant!  To meet these beauties, Will shows up at a meeting of SPAT--Single Parents, Alone Together.  To join up, he invents a 2-year-old in his own life who, naturally, is always with his mother whenever the opportunity to meet him shows up.  Through the group, Will finds himself paired with Marcus, who needs somebody to lean on as his mother is spiraling out of control.  Before long, Will's life starts to find something it's never really had before:  Meaning.  And Marcus finds his world expanding and himself growing up as he finds someone who cares about him other than just his mum. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  \\"About a Boy\\" is very funny, poignant and meaningful.  Also, the direction and cinematography do nothing but enhance the plotline. . .they are right-on as well, and do not detract as so often is the case today.  The characters are worth caring about and the plot is enveloping.  The soundtrack is very well done by Badly Drawn Boy.  \\"About a Boy\\" is one of those films that hits high marks on all levels, and it can actually maybe even benefit the viewer to see it.  I have nothing bad I can say about the film.  Perhaps I can't even articulate the good--the excellent--points of this movie here.  Just watch it.  It's very much worth your time.

Im sure that metallica's early sound influenced many deathmetal bands too, as well as, antrhax,megadeth,kreator,sodom's has influenced thousends of deathmetal bands, etc...So you realy need to get your facts straight buddy.Now its obvious that you know zero about thrash and deathmetal, to actullie think that slayer is deathmetal or nu-metal--that to me is laughable because when slayer was formed? Deathmetal  was far from begining let along nu-metal and  any  deathmetal vocalist are all well known for grunting over the microphone  and slayer's vocalist, you can actullie understand and he does not grunt, so therefore? Slayer is NOT deathmetal! Its an insult to any real thrashmetal person to have slayer's music compare deathmetal and whats worse? You compare slayer's sound with nu-metal... Whats wrong with you ?Its funny how you call them 15 year olds and yet your the one who has no clue about metal, at all.Anyways, metallica's \\"ride the lightining\\" is without a doubt even better then\\"kill 'em all\\" and its sure a masterpiece.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Although the timeline in this movie seems unthinkable we don't really know. Intact mammoths have been found frozen before they could begin to decompose and with food still in their mouths. The \\"Oceanic Conveyor belt\\" has slowed 20% since 1950.  The \\"Greenland Iceshelf\\", which 'feeds' it, has failed to form 5 of the last 7 years.  London is in the same latitude as Moscow.  The only reason eastern and northern Europe has a temperate climate is because of the Oceanic Conveyor belt, the South and North Atlantic currents and others.  The artic ice is melting at an alarming rate exposing the warmer water beneath it, which is further warming and melting the arctic ice and affecting the North Atlantic Currents.  The antarctic ice shelves are disappearing.  One shattered completely... in '99?... to the shock and suprise of scientists who would have believed it impossible for such a large expanse of ice to disappear that fast.  Global warming does create new ice ages, search the terms online for yourself.  <br /> <br />I found the movie, although lacking in depth, fun to watch, a good wake up call and, allowing for hollywood dramatization, for the most part true to the science.  I think the person who wrote the official review would have done well to have researched the facts before writing it. :-)
0671015206|2.0|All in all, this book has plenty of good advice.  However, I was annoyed and even slightly angered by a few things.      First, I lost count of how many times I saw the word \\"frugal.\\"  After what had to have been the seventeenth time, I thought to myself:   Mr. Stanley, I get the point.    The point being, live in squalor and hoard your gold coins like you're a king of avarice.    Except, not me.  That's not how I want to live.  I'm more of a Kiyosakian.  Being cheap might help you get rich, but once you're rich, you're still cheap.  So why bother?  And in my book, being cheap doesn't help one to get rich at all.  It only helps to pay the bills.  That's important, but it's not getting rich.    Another thing I couldn't stand isn't so much bad advice or bad writing as it is an example of behavior that the book advocates, in the same cheap/frugal vein.  A woman is clipping coupons like she does everyday, because she is . . . . frugal.  Her husband comes home,and his ship has come in.  Much of the stock he owned has up to this point appreciated immensely, he cashes out, and decides to give his wife a major anniversary present.  He lays down $8 million in stock in front of his wife, and says, happy anniversary.  She says, \\"Thanks.\\"  And then she goes back to clipping her pathetic coupons.    This book admires this lady's . . . frugality.  I, on the other hand, get nauseous.  $8 million.  If it had been me, I would've taken the money back, divorced her on the spot, and called my lawyer in anticipation of legal battle to follow.    And an issue that is more style than substance.  The author lists attributes and behaviors of the millionaires next door, and one item on that list is the cars they drive.  Apparently, they all drive American cars.  Not Japanese cars.  Not German.  Not Korean.  American.  And only full size cars.  Not compacts.  Not mid-size.  Not mini-vans.  Not SUVs.  And only sedans.  Not coupes.  Not convertibles.  Not motorcycles or electric scooters.  Onlyfull size American sedans.  And when these cars aren't being referred to as full size American sedans, they're being referred to as \\"Detroit metal.\\"      Ooooooh.  Detroit metal.  Now THAT'S cool.    Apparently, people who are . . .  frugal . . .  spend their money on third rate gas guzzlers.  I'm sticking with my Toyota, because it sips gas, and it NEVER breaks down.  Ever.  That saves me money.    Aside from these things that stick in my craw, this book is not without merit.
B000000JO3|4.0|Well not a five in my book, why you may ask. well because I am not a fan and write this as a guy whom just listed to it. I think the recording albeit it is an old record, sounds like a dubbed tape to an 8 track. So if you want Punk you got it, if you want loud punk in your car its not here.
B00005JMX6|2.0|I ended up hating myself for sitting through this entire movie instead of turning it off.  My expectations were not THAT high, for sure, but it was total mess.  Offers a handful of PG-13 soft-core scenes (yes, even on the unrated dvd) designed to titillate teenage boys, but the other 90% of the movie fails to tie them together.  Who ever thought characters could be SO unlikable and undeveloped?  Seth Bullock's performance as the caricature [person] is easily the best thing about it.  That, and seeing Elisha Cuthbert in a role she's more believable in than the counter-terror intelligence analyst on Fox's \\"24\\".  Another great example of Hollywood insulting the audience with underwritten crap.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a fascinating docudrama, a \\"blend of fact and fiction\\" that centers on the preparation for the Mr. Olympia competition in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1975. The months before the competition is where the story has been enhanced for added dramatic effect, and follows the bodybuilders as they get ready from Muscle Beach in California to a gym in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Lou Ferrigno (later to be better known from his \\"The Hulk\\" character) is one of 5 time winner Schwarzenegger's main challengers, and their determination and discipline is extraordinary, and gives one admiration for what bodybuilders go through, and appreciation of their ability to change the human form, even if like me, one finds the look rather reptilian and gross.<br /><br />It's hard to not like Arnold Schwarzenneger, \\"The Austrian Oak\\", here 28 years old, 6'2 and 240 lbs. He has a disarming charm and bravado, and a natural intelligence, and the mental aspect of bodybuilding cannot be underestimated.<br /><br />Conceived, directed and written by George Butler, this is a marvelous look into the \\"no pain, no gain\\" challenge of sculpting with muscle. The pacing is great without a single scene lacking interest, and the editing excellent. Total time is 85 minutes.<br /><br />The DVD \\"Extras\\" are not to be missed, especially \\"Raw Iron\\", which includes many outtakes and tells how the film was made, and \\"Iron Insights\\", an interview with Schwarzenneger where one finds out which scenes were created and which were actual events.<br /><br />A film that will be of interest to anyone who likes success stories and how it is achieved by those who challenge themselves and keep focused on the positive, it will also be enjoyed for its pure entertainment value.
0446678430|4.0|Read any of the 5 star reviews, and that's what I'm saying.  But I only give it 4 stars for two reasons.   <br /> <br />1)  RK says one of the things to do on the road to riches is to hire a personal bookeeper.  Say what?  Right now, I am in the E quadrant.  I have one income from one job comprised of one paycheck, with no car payment, no credit card debt, and no kids.  I'd be a fool to think that everything in this book applied directly to me . . . , but a bookeeper?  Why?  What is he talking about?  I pay my few bills, I save what I can, I think about how I'm going to graduate to the B and I quadrants.  Even when I am operating in those quadrants, I will take advantage of the services of an accountant, not some mysterious bookeeper. <br /> <br />2) And this is the major one-- RK likes Network Marketing.  Now, anyone with two or more brain cells to rub together knows that Network Marketing and MLMs and pyramid schemes are cruel, corrupt, flagrant, fraudulent, cultish scams.  Everybody knows this.  Everybody, including the MLMers themselves.  They know this, and, protecting their Golden Calf, they lie lie lie about it.  I am disappointed Mr. Kiyosaki advocates them.  He should know better.   <br /> <br />Beyond these two issues, this a great book, deliberately light on hard numbers, facts, and techniques.  This is about changing the way you look at things, yourself, the world, so you can then later use the numbers, facts, and techniques to your best advantage.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! It does have a few lulls where some humor misses the mark but all in all this movie should delight anyone with even a trace of a sense of humor.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Beyond all the controversy there is one reason why this film has been so successful: it strips away the faade that this administration has erected in an effort to prevent the people from seeing the actual results of its mistaken policies.  Just as people will rubberneck to catch a glimpse of an accident, people are driven to see this movie to witness the unvarnished realities of the Bush administration: massive debt, overwhelming government growth, rampant militarism and the loss of world respect (just to name a few). <br /> <br />Moore uses a good balance of humor and pathos to paint a portrait of how an unsuccessful businessman can ride the coattails of his wealthy friends and family all the way to the Whitehouse.  He goes on to show how this rich cabal uses their privileged position to further their agenda around the world with sometimes disastrous results.  Bush himself said it best when he addressed the audience at a fundraiser as the \\"haves... and have mores\\".  The unabashed hubris of this so called Christian is on display like feathers on a peacock. <br /> <br />I can see from the one star \\"reviews\\" that many right wingers have not seen this film.  That's too bad.  They are depriving themselves of some truly first class humor.  For example, there is the hilarious introduction to our attorney general: \\"In the year 2000, [John Ashcroft] was running for re-election as Senator from Missouri against a man who died the month before the election.  The voters preferred the dead guy.\\"  Even an Oxycontin addled ditto head should be able to appreciate the humor in that line. <br /> <br />There might even be a few republicans capable of comprehending some of Moore's more subtle jokes.  Take for instance the scene where he presents the military records documenting Bush's suspension for dodging a National Guard medical examination.  As the camera zooms in to show the condemning sentence and highlight Bush's name, the narration is interrupted for a couple seconds to play the guitar lick from Eric Clapton's version of \\"Cocaine\\".  Get it?  Now that is funny! <br /> <br />My favorite laugh-out-loud section is Moore's introduction to \\"The Coalition of the Willing\\" including Palau, Costa Rica, Iceland, Romania, The Netherlands, and Afghanistan.  If I'd had a mouth full of something when the clip from Nosferatu appeared, I would have spewed it all over the screen. <br /> <br />Of course there are more serious moments that were just as effective.  The scenes that show how the war in Iraq is being fought by the economically underprivileged (definitely not Bush's haves and have mores), the gruesome footage from the war itself (surgical strikes -- nice clean war, yeah right Rumi), and the personal accounts of unnecessary loss of life drive home an unmistakable message: Bush and his cronies have made huge mistakes and the \\"have nots\\" are the ones paying for it.
6305949980|5.0|Listen up all you wanna be goth-good charlotte loving high school losers.  This movie is not your messiah.  Billy from Good Charlotte is not a god because he has Jack and Sally tattoos.  Get over it and grow up.....with that said..... <br /> <br />The Nightmare Before Christmas is a beautiful movie.  Tim Burton outdid himself with the creation of these characters who reach out and touch the audiences souls much more than most movies starring live actors.  Danny Elfman's soundtrack is by far the best movie score I've ever heard.  His compositions flow perfectly with the the tone of the movie, and they help to tell the story even better, something only one other musical (South Park:Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) has ever been able to do. <br /> <br />This movie is such a joy for Halloween, Christmas, or the year round.  It's an enchanting tale that brings to life the holidays that entertain and excite us throughout the entire year.  Buy this movie.  It's amazing.
B0002CHOUA|5.0|This album is great!  I have only been listening to Nightwish for about three months and I have all their albums and I've seen them live!  There awesome!  This album is their best one in my opinion.  It's definetely their heaviest.  If you are a Nightwish fan, even if you're not the biggest Nightwish fan, I suggest this album.  My favorite song is track nine \\"Ghost Love Score\\"  If you like epic metal, thats the song for you.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Well, John Ford has been quoted as saying that this movie was about fame, about BEING the man who shot Liberty Valance.  LOOK where that fame took him.  The people with the familiar faces made this movie very watchable.  Gene Pitney had a hit song about it (not used in the movie).  And yes, to one reviewer, sometimes murder MAY be the answer (as in \\"Slingblade\\") but Liberty's body was not \\"riddled\\" with bullets.  He was put away with one shot.  And who are these new sissies who insist on \\"extras\\" on their CD; who cares about extras?  Enjoy the flick!  This IS one of the great Westerns along with \\"High Noon\\", \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\", etc.  So lay your money down.  This is a classic.
B0000028P8|5.0|This is Mariah's first live recording and she proved everyone wrong cuz she's an incredible singer LIVE! You'll be totally blown away by her performance on this cd. Its Mariah at her finest; no studio B.S. <br /> <br />The 7 songs are taken from her debut self-titled album and her sophomore effort Emotions. 1 of them is a cover from the Jackson 5's I'll Be There. Out of the 7, 4 of them were number 1's! Mariah used her god-given vocals to play around with the arrangements of the songs. The arrangements were broken down into its simplest form and I must say I liked it. It was an honest and true performance, straight from her heart. It was an intimate setting, the concert. <br /> <br />Carey's vocals were strong and powerful on every song. Let me give you the low-down on the songs: <br />1. Emotions - sounds great live, and those high notes! Super! (5/5) <br />2. If It's Over - I don't know why people don't like this one, I think its better live than recorded (in Emotions LP). (5/5) <br />3. Someday - Is it just me or is it that the backing vocalists are trying to overpower Mariah? Seems like it. Perhaps Mariah's giving them some spotlight. (4/5) <br />4. Vision Of Love - The flawless debut single EVER! Great singing, but still loved the recorded one with the mysterious start. (4.5/5) <br />5. Make It Happen - This is the only song I skip most of the time. The piano was excellent but doesn't seem to grow on me. (3.5/5) <br />6. I'll Be There - Loved the lyrics, Mariah and Trey's vocals were amazing on this one. (5/5) <br />7. Can't Let Go - My favorite, I simply loved the bridge part. A slow and soothing song. Awesome stuff! (5/5) <br /> <br />If you doubt Mariah's singing, thinking that hearing in not believing (on her recorded LPs, that is), you should get this. Mariah shines in her performances. Her vocal gymnastics are inspiring, magnificent, breathtaking. Grab this!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It is very well done, and is extremely frightening.  The lighting is way cool and interesting, and watching what a hardcore badass Riddick is is way fun.  You so do not want to mess with this guy, he's a totally rad annihilator!!!
0451529308|5.0|Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.  <br /> <br />I think I read Little Women first as a preteen.  I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society.  But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story.  The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered. <br /> <br />The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read.  If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it.  Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined.  At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is the most powerful film I've ever seen. And while the acting, and the direction were marvelous, the music was key in creating the film's dark, brooding, and hopelessly depressing atmosphere. By far the highlight of the entire score was the gorgeous theme music. Performed on strings,the music helps drown out whatever hopes you may consider having thorughout the movie. I cannot stress enough- see the film and then you MUST  go out and get this soundtrack. Even without the film accompanying it, music this gorgeous, this moody, and gut-wrenchingly sad provides that same feeling without a movie to go along with. A MUST-HAVE.
B00007BH5C|5.0|This is the second soundtrack to the mega-successful box office hit, The Lord Of The Rings. Howard Shore managed to handle this heavy task and transform it into an a amazing work of perfection.  <br /> <br />There are more new themes introduced in this soundtrack. Rohan's theme is calm, soothing (with the string instrument) and grand at times (the horns). It really created the identity of the city. It is one of my favorite themes, second only to the Elves themes. I absolutely loved the opening anthem Foundations Of Stone, with the disturbing sounds of the choir (if you can recall its the part when Gandalf fought with the Balrog of Morgoth). The songs are not in the order in the film but its a great opus. The mood and emotions of the film are expressed perfectly and its unbelievable how the music flows in the film. <br /> <br />As I mentioned in my ROTK review, I loved music for the Elf kind. Evenstar is very emotional and it moved me so much! Arwen's grief is portrayed beautifully. See how the music connects alot with the film! Music of Gandalf (The White Rider, Forth Eorlingas) is magical and enchanting. Ben Del Maestro is a beautiful vocalist. My other favorites would have to be The Hornburg, The King Of The Golden Hall, Helms Deep and Riders Of Rohan. The fierce anthems (Isengard Unleashed) fits well with the film. Gollum's Song is very haunting but its majestic at the same time. <br /> <br />You need to watch the film and listen many times to the cd to really appreciate it. Howard Shore is an amazing composer, made him a well-known composer. I don't understand why this soundtrack wasn't even nominated for Best Score in the Oscars. But it won a Grammy, so it shows!
B00005JMYI|2.0|There were some laughs in this movie, however they all involved something not involving Will Farrell.  Jack Black was funny.  Steve Carrell was funny.  All the cameos were funny.  That bald dude with the moustache from Out Cold was funny.  Will Farrell was not funny.  He is never funny and needs to go away.
B0002IQHY8|2.0|Well, Alan is experimenting with new directions.  I appreciate a musician doing that, particularly after Alan's long history of writing some of the finest music I've ever heard with the Project over the last 25 years.  Valid Path seems to be an attempt by Parsons to fuse his keyboard/studio production acumen with an L.A.-sound influence.  It's not rock, it's not anywhere near vintage Parsons.  It sounds more like electro-pop, with a sidearm rap flavor (sans the rapper), probably inspired by the co-producer and co-writer, P.J.Olsson.  If you purchase the album, you will not hear the traditional world-class vocalists and studio musicians that have graced Alan's other projects.  Valid Path is a wonderfully recorded/produced, gritty, disonant, non-flowing effort that I found supremely disappointing.  Even Alan's traditional instrumentals included on every album he has ever made are lacking in substance and consistency somehow - this is what bothered me most.  I never expect such a wonderful musician and writer as Parsons to churn out the same musical approach with every album he releases - but he has continually influenced me, over the last quarter-century, to expect nothing short of excellence from him.  I feel that, in my most humble opinion, that Valid Path was unworthy of him and I would not recommend others to hear it.  I'd rather they, and myself, remember Alan Parsons for who he was.
B000002L9W|5.0|All tracks are good specially: <br />_Yankee Rose <br />_Shy Boy <br />_Goin' Crazy! <br />_Tobacco road <br />_Elephant Gun
B000003TA4|5.0|in my opinion, and probally many other people out there, nevermind by nirvana was one of the best rock albums ever made.  It launched nirvana into the the permanent music spotlight, even if kurt never wanted it that way. heres my rating of the songs on this cd. <br /> <br />1. smells like teen spirit- 5/5 most popular nirvana song and one of the best in 25 years <br />2. in bloom- 5/5 good solo and good baseline <br />3. come as you are- 5/5 great lyrics by cobain and good riff <br />4. breed- 5/5 great guitar  and drums <br />5. lithium- 5/5 my favorite song good jazzy feeling from drums and bass <br />6. polly- 4/5 the version from their live cd is better with drums (muddy banks of the wishkah) <br />7. territorial pissings- 3/5 worst song on the cd but its still pretty good <br />8. drain you- 5/5 great vocals and guitar <br />9. lounge act- 5/5 love the bassline and vocals <br />10. stay away- 4/5 good bassline  <br />11. on a plain- 4/5 good guitar and vocals <br />12. something in the way- 5/5 great emotion
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere In Time is the first studio-album from Iron Maiden I have ever heard and it is still one of my favourite albums of all time. Somewhere In Time, released in 1986, was the first album on which Maiden uses guitar and bass synths. It gives the album a different vibe when comparing it to their earlier albums. The album starts out with \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\", one of the most underrated Maiden songs of all time. This song always grabs me when the intro starts. \\"Wasted Years\\" is one of Maiden's more radio- friendly songs. In the Netherlands it was Maiden's greatest hit. It is a catchy rocker, written by Adrian Smith.     Although the guitars on Somewhere In Time do not sound heavy due to the synths, I would say that Somewhere In Time contains the fastest songs Maiden has ever released. Just listen to \\"Loneliness Of The Long Distant Runner\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait.\\" Fortunately there are also some slower song like \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" and \\"Alexander The Great\\". \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" is an atmospheric simple bass and drums based song, with an excellent solo. Therefore  it is a pretty unusual song, but it is still great. \\"Alexander The Great\\" is a rather slow and epic song. This song probably contains the longest guitar-solo Maiden has ever played on an album. It is one of my favourite Maiden solos. \\"Sea Of Madness\\" is the heaviest (guitar-sound wise) song on the album. Check out the intro of \\"Sea Of Madness\\". I think that this song is also one of the must underrated Maiden songs.    I personally think that Somewhere In Time is one of Maiden's strongest albums. I really like the desolate atmosphere on the album. The whole sound on the album is totally different than on all of their other albums. Even Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound different. Although I am normally not a fan of high range vocals, the vocals on this album work perfectly. The songs are both catchy and complex (for Maiden standards). Although Somewhere In Time is not one of Maiden's easiest albums to get into, I highly recommend this album.
B000002572|1.0|This is perhaps the eptiome of souless commercial corporate rock.  Tom Shultz, guitarist/producer extradinaire has managed to scrub every last bit of life out of this bleak, shiny and bland recording.  The album sounds like robots played it, from the cliche guitar licks to the Mr. Roboto voice of Brad Delp.  Its all so \\"perfect\\" and just dead sounding.  This band helped inaugurate the awful awful mid 70s to early 80s era of souless corporate bands like Journey, REO Turdwagon and the all time masters of musical mediocrity: Foreigner, uggghhh!<br /><br />Bands like Boston and disco are just the type of commercial crap that drove me to abandon radio forever and start listening to punk, progressive rock, 60's garage and psychedelica, jazz, classical, etc.  I first heard this band in highlschool when I was in 11th grade and thought it was OK.  But that was highschool, Im an adult now, I've listened to an incredible variety of music and realize just how bad this stuff is.  Boston are mindless top 40 mush designed for mass consumption and it doesn't work for me even as nostalgia.  Its the aural equivalent of cotton candy:  looks and tastes good, but has no nutritive value at all, just empty calories. If I never hear \\"More Than A Feeling\\" again it would be a 1000 years too soon.  Negative 10 stars.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|This is a cocert i've been waiting for very long.And i must say i was very pleased.The chance that Blind Guardian had of setting their own festival in Germany paid off.The lightning, pirotechnics and the shots of the entire band are great(except maybe for the drummer's shots, cause he appears very seldomly and for short amounts of time).The Bonus songs in the second DVD where they are playing in another city: it's like watching an ugly looking bootleg.The documental is very interesting, though. <br />My only complaint: the stage presence of the members of the band other than Hansi is kind of uninspiring: i just wish they could move, run and jump a whole lot more!..but other than that, the setlist and production values put this gem along-side the Rock In Rio DVD from Iron Maiden and below the masterfully made Live At Budokan from Dream Theater. <br />
0385337388|5.0|This book knocked my socks off! I loved it as a 4th year med student and I love it more as an intern!  Humor like this is a way to survive life in the hospital and we read it as part of our intern book club!  A must read!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Pretty bad monster movie that has everything but a director who knows how to write and direct.  I enjoyed both Mummy movies because they were campy enough for the audience to have a good time with and you had characters that you cared about and rooted for.  Van Helsing does not only lack these qualities  in spades but it shows that it was the chemistry of the actors who made The Mummy Movies successful, not the director who directed them. This movie is just plain bad from beginning to end. Hugh Jackman is a great actor but he's stuck with a really bad character that has no charm or charisma and the rest of the cast is stuck in the mud with him. Dracula is a whiney wimp in this film and the Wolfman looks too fake to really take seriously. The special effects are fine but lacks a real feel to them and the great cinematography is wasted in a story that actually makes no sense what so ever.   <br /> <br />Van Helsing is a great example of what can go wrong when you don't have a competent director who knows what he's doing.  <br />
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Why people think this girl is special is beyond me.  She's nothing more than a no-talent who wishes she were Madonna (but sorry to tell her she'll never be on Madonna's level).  What can I say?  The girl can't sing, her songs have no point, and she tries to be shocking, but she's not.  Everything she tries to shock people with has already been done years ago.  And do we really need more songs about how she's not a girl anymore and she's a woman now?  Enough already!  We get it!  On this album her songs sound the same as her previous 3, filled with cheesy lyrics, plain Pro-Tools music, and computerized vocal effects (but even that doesn't help her terrible voice).  I don't have anything against Britney, but what has she done that's so great?  Oh, well.  If you like wasting your money, go for it!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|After watching the previews and listening to reviews from both professionals and trusted friends I was very excited to see this movie.  Unfortunately, the result did not live up to my expectations.  The main problem was that there were too many plot lines.  They weren't too difficult to follow, however, and that was the problem.  If separated into their respective stories each plot line couldn't have taken more than 10 or 15 minutes, and you can write a decent story in that amount of time, but not a good story, and certainly not a great one.  <br />   Because of the title I was expecting the movie to leave me with the warm fuzzies, but most of them left me feeling dissatisfied.  I'm a big Colin Firth fan and I was grateful that at least his story was good.  That saved it from my rating the movie one star.   All in all, I wish I had never seen the movie.  I would have been much happier with my illusion of a good movie.
B00005JM0B|1.0|When I heard that they were going to make a \\"Terminator 3\\", I was excited.  I love \\"Terminator 2\\".  The way it talked about the human condition, the bond between a robot and a boy, \\"There is no Fate, but what we make\\" and the strength of women.  It had a lot to say. \\"Terminator 3\\" had absolutely no redeeming value.  The way Arnold says \\"Talk to the Hand\\" to how they totally negated the \\"Fate\\" quote in \\"T2\\" really made this movie seem like on big expensive joke.  It was too short, not smart enough, said nothing about the human condition, and finally, where the hell was the \\"Terminator\\" theme music.  It was orchestrated at the end.  You cannot have a \\"Terminator\\" film begin without the theme music.  This movie just makes me mad thinking about it.  If James Cameron does not one want to come back, ask Ridley Scott.  Do not let Jonathan Mostow screw up a potential \\"Terminator 4.\\"
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Wow...I'm exhausted!  Hugh Jackman is wonderful; you cannot fault him, though you do chuckle - again, he is a man with power who cannot recall his past.  And Kate Beckinsale is really showing her stuff.  When you look at Cold Comfort Farm, Underworld and now Van Helsing, it shows there is little this lass cannot do and do well.  The action is non-stop - literally.  It must have more near escapes than any ten - make that twenty - movies put together.  The sets are moody and properly monster movie Gothic.  And you get Vlad Dracul, his brides and a horde of baby vampires - the children of the night - that Drac is trying to bring to life.<br /><br />But that is only the start.  There is Dr. Jekyll and Robbie Coltraine as Mr. Hyde - as an appetizer.  You mustn't forget a werewolf or two and Frankenstein's monster.  Oops, almost forgot Igor!  By this time, you are ready for Bobby \\"Boris\\" Pickett to break into The Monster Mash!  The same bunch that did such a bang on job with The Mummy, which I thoroughly enjoyed, does this.  Only someone needs to tell Stephan Sommers often less is more and more is just too much.  This movie is a perfect example of so much going for it - too much going for it - that it overwhelms you.<br /><br />Van Helsing (Jackman) is an immortal who has memories at being at Masada.  The Church sends him out to hunt down evil and smote it by any means needed.  After taking down and dispatching Jekyll/Hyde, they send him to Transylvania to handle Drac the naughty vamp.  Seems Dracula and his three brides are making a nuisance of themselves at a local village, and only thing keeping them and the werewolves in line as the ancient family Valerious, but they are now down to a brother and sister.  Anna Valerious watched as her brother battles a werewolf.  The brother saves her, but goes over the cliffs, later to become a werewolf.  Van Helsing and Carl, his religious sidekick, arrives on the scene, but the villagers are not so happy to see them.  Seems the vamps only want one or two villagers a month, not too bad, they think.  Carl please note is David Wenham (Faramir from Lord of the Rings!), in case he seems familiar.<br /><br />Van Helsing, Anna and Carl join forces and the villagers attitude soon changes as they learn the Dracula is trying to bring his thousands of bat babies to life.  The key is Frankenstein's monster, very sympathetically portrayed Shuler Hensley.  It comes down to a battle of the titans between Dracula and Van Helsing, (they second time they have gone down this road) and this time the town ain't big for two these two; one has to bite the dust or each other!<br /><br />The is no pace to this movie, it's totally pedal to the metal the whole way, where The Mummy movies see slow in comparison!  Shame.  This could have been one really great movie.  The cast was right.  Great special effects, it was just you feel like you have been beat over the head with every cinema monster ever to lumber through Universal's backlot.<br /><br />Obviously, this is left open for a sequel.  And despite this disappointment, I will be eagerly watching.  Maybe if they look at this one and see what they did wrong, second time around they might get it right.  Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi this ain't; it's not even the classy stylized battle of Lee and Cushing.  But they I didn't want it to be.  I just wanted a few moments to catch my breath.  The ending is very beautiful filmed and the emotions reach you, almost poetically.  Shame more of that could not have be sprinkled into this rest of the script.ps only want one or two villagers a month, not too bad, they think.

B000053V7Q|5.0|This DVD is beyond excellent.    I would recommend any and all purchase it.  What an awesome entertainer -
B00003CXCT|1.0|You can digitize them - no problem?  But I want the content the same.  Other than that, I'm not buying them until they get it back to where they were.
B00000373U|4.0|This mellow moody masterpiece is fantastic. When i listen to this i just want to lay back on my bed and just listen to Elliott. He was such a great singer/songwriter. I have Either/Or and his Self titled album. I like this one a little bit more than the S/T though. The only reason this baby didnt get 5 stars in my mind is that it seems like he has a little bit more potential in him than he really showcases in this album..i dont have every Elliott Smith album like i said, so maybe one of his other ones show him at his best.... <br /> <br />Bottom line is this cd is great and i would suggest it to anyone that just wants to mellow out. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: \\"Speed Trials\\",\\"No Name #5\\",\\"Angeles\\" <br /> <br />
B0002KQNJU|4.0|The animated title sequence was added to the film by the American distributors/producers (Martin Ransohoff). That is probably why it is not on the dvd edition, being it is the directors' cut. There were various other items that the American producers did to the film, including speeding up some sequences to look like \\"Keystone Cops\\" segments and dubbing the original voices with different dialog lines, because at the time, the studio didn't know what to make of a comic horror film and how to market it.
B00005YUPO|5.0|I first purchased this DVD for my daycare group, and they went crazy for it. They would scream and clap everytime it started. These were children ages 1-3.  I have never seen any other DVD/show that kept the children so involved and entertained. When my first grandchild was born I gave one to her when she was 4 months old, and even at that age, she was total engrossed in it, too. This is the favorite of the whole series!
0345452577|3.0|I have read all the Alex Delaware books and have been disappointed in the last couple. When I saw he had invented a new protagonist I hoped for something new and different. Instead I read a less skillful version of the Alex Delaware books, and I think I know why: The Conspiracy Club feels like an old, long-neglected first shot at writing a thriller, reworked enough for publication, but not enough to be a good book.<br /><br /> Jeremy Carrier is a psychologist who works in a hospital in an unnamed Midwestern city. Alex Delaware, remember, spent his early life in the midwest. Carrier drives a Nova, and another character has a Falcon in his garage. Novas haven't been made since 1979, Falcons since 1970. So I think Kellerman probably started the book in the '70s. But it had a lot of work done on it in the '80s or early '90s. All the doctors have pagers, but none has a cellphone, a laptop, or any other of the gadgets we take for granted today. The hospital computer has a 2400 baud modem. We are told it is old, but it's safe to say that no institution has had that slow a modem for over a decade. Carrier uses it to connect to a database at a local newspaper, after paying a fee. He has never heard of Google, or apparently even of the web.<br /><br /> There has been some updating, especially near the end, and it is not coincidental that the pace picks up in the later pages. I think Kellerman stuck his manuscript in a drawer in the early '70s, pulled it out and worked it up 15 or 20 years ago, and then finally did a bit of rewriting recently to whip it into shape for publication. The result is as you might expect: amateurish in places, with an unconnected feel.<br /><br />The Conspiracy Club is acceptable to pass the time, but I don't believe anyone who knows and likes the Delaware series will feel the need to read more about Jeremy Carrier, and I doubt that Kellerman has any intention of writing more books about him.

B000255LNE|5.0|Phil Collins' \\"Love Songs\\" is a 2-CD set containing a great selection of Phil's greatest ballads. It's a terrific companion set to his \\"Hits\\" album, featuring not only such favorites as \\"One More Night,\\" \\"Against All Odds,\\" \\"Groovy Kind Of Love\\" and \\"Two Hearts,\\" but also such buried Phil treasures as \\"Can't Turn Back The Years,\\" \\"This Must Be Love,\\" \\"Testify,\\" and \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy.\\" There's one new song, the lovely \\"Tearing And Breaking,\\" which is an outtake from the \\"Testify\\" album, as well as \\"I've Been Trying,\\" a song that Phil recorded for a Curtis Mayfield tribute album, and \\"Somewhere,\\" the old Broadway classic from \\"West Side Story\\" that Phil did for another tribute album a few years back. And finally, if that weren't enough, the double CD set concludes with some excellent live material, including live renditions of \\"Separate Lives,\\" and the old Sinatra fave, \\"The Way You Look Tonight.\\" This is a great double album to own whether you're  a diehard Phil fan OR just a casual listener. Quite simply, if you like Phil Collins, then you're gonna love \\"Love Songs.\\"
B0002V7ODI|4.0|I'll be discussing both the two disc and three disc edition of \\"Hellboy\\" here. Unfortunately, the automated systemed won't allow me to post this as a separate review so, just in case the review shows up under both, I'll include both.<br /><br />TWO DISC EDITION:<br />It must be hell to have horns and a stone hand. Rasputin the mad monk who manipulated the Russian royalty prior to the Russian Revolution never died. He not only survived being stabbed, shot, poisoned and drowning but during World War II he worked for the Nazis. Hitler hoped that Rasputin might be able to unleash the 7 Gods of Chaos to help Hitler win the war and dominate the world. The only thing that can stop Hitler and Rasputin's minions which includes a nasty masochistic half mechanical man named Kroenen (Ladislav Beran in some scenes)is Professor Broom (Kevin Trainor as the young Bloom) who has studied the occult. He and a group of American soldiers storm Rasputin's castle stopping the 7 Gods of Chaos from entering our world. In the process Rasputin is sucked into the other strange realm and a tiny red monkey like creature that looks like Satan with a stone hand is released into our world.<br /><br />Sixty years later Rasputin's minions revive him bringing him back from the other side. Meanwhile Professor Broom (Hurt) has established a paranormal division of the F.B.I with Hellboy (Perlman) and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones but voiced by David Hyde Pierce of \\"Fraiser\\" fame) a half human/half sea creature and Liz (Blair) a human with the ability to control fire. With the addition of a new assistant John Myers (Evans) recruited from the F.B.I. these five are all that stand between us and chaos. The only problem is that Rasputin has plans for using Hellboy himself to help release the 7 Gods of Chaos himself.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy\\" looks surprisingly sharp and vivid capturing all the primary colors that percolated beneath the surface of Mike Mignola's comic book. The film does suffer a little bit due to all the extras included on the first disc and could have benefited from concentrating only on picture and sound quality of the film on the first disc and all the extras on the second.<br /><br />The two disc set clearly went on an eating binge. How else to explain all the wonderful extras packed on this great set. To begin with we have a nice introduction by the director. On the first disc featuring the feature film there are branching behind the scenes sequences you can access while watching the film itself and then return to where you were. It's a fascinating glimpse behind the movie almost giving you the experience as if you were on the set then watching the assembled dailies the next same day.<br /><br />THREE DISC DIRECTOR'S CUT:<br />There are some subtle and not so subtle differences in \\"Hellboy-The Director's Cut\\". The big difference involves how Rasputin was changed when he came back from the other side. There's also a number of dramatic moments such as Professor Broom discovery of his cancer as well as some fight sequences that have been extended in minor but subtle ways. That said, it's essentially the same film but richer for the include of the 15 or so minutes of additional footage.<br /><br />The first disc has a brand new commentary by director del Toro and a commentary/isolated score by composer Beltram. The storyboard track now has new images added to it (quite a bit more as a matter of fact).The \\"branching comics\\" feature is much more extensive than the previous one but the features on the first disc remain pretty close to the previous edition.<br /><br />The second disc has the bulk of what disc two of the two disc set had but there are a couple of additions worth noting. There's also a multi-angle storyboard comparison (which I believe to be new). I couldn't find the UPA cartoons on the original but haven't had a chance to investigate all the noons and crannies of the three disc set.<br /><br />Disc three has a new video introduction by Ron Perlman. Here we get a video and audio commentary by the main actors(in fact it's the same as the audio commentary from the previous edition only this time we see the actors as they recorded their commentary and also see the movie as their watching it in a picture-in-picture mode). There's production workshops also included here, make up and lighting tests (although all involve the final make up for Hellboy), \\"A Quick Guide to Understanding Comics with Scott McCloud\\"--a featurette. Mike Mignola is absent from the commentary track but his pre-production artwork is included here. Ther's also the director's notebook (again--it's on two discs here for some strange reason), conceptual art galleries and comic book artists pin-ups on the last disc as well. Personally, I would have put the actors in pip mode vs. the movie as the version they're commenting on it is the theatrical release not the Director's Cut. Not sure why Columbia chose not to do this. Aside from that minor complaint (and not being able to find the UPA cartoons), this is the ultimate fan boy edition. Oh, there's also a reproduction of part of Rasputin's diary by Mignola as well included in paperback form.<br /><br />The packaging is nice with three slimline DVD holders highlight Red, Blue and Liz. Personally, I would also like to have had a booklet similar to the one that came with the two discs set. Also, I'm unclear why the \\"seamlessly branching\\" DVD technology wasn't here to allow both the director's cut and the theatrical editions (much like \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\"). I don't have any use for keeping the previous edition (it was traded in) just for the theatrical cut (and I personally feel the Director's Cut is a superior version of the movie even though most of the changes are fairly minor overall).<br /><br />Overall, this is a terrific boxed set that has some minor flaws. Hopefully Columbia will learn from this mistake and correct any future releases of Director's Cuts vs. theatrical editions. Also, releasing both at the same time so fans can make a choice (vs. being double dipped) would be the right thing to do from a customer service stand point. Plus, there wouldn't be all those used copies eating away at their sales of the set.it's the same as the audio commentary from the previous edition only this time we see the actors as they recorded their commentary and also see the movie as their watching it in a picture-in-picture mode).

B000002R9X|5.0|\\"Free Hand\\" is Gentle Giant's 7th album, and it's also one of their finest. Like their previous album, \\"The Power And The Glory,\\" \\"Free Hand\\" has plenty of masterful progressive rock to spare, but is also quite accessible-sounding in places. These are great songs---all seven of them! Personal favorites include the literally snappy \\"Just The Same,\\" the vocal brilliance of \\"On Reflection,\\" the great rock of the title track, and the very beautiful \\"His Last Voyage.\\" \\"Free Hand\\" is a classic Gentle Giant disc. (One last note: I don't understand the complaints about the mix of the One Way Records edition of \\"Free Hand.\\" The CD sounds pretty awesome to my ears!)
0807205567|4.0|I picked this up without any recommendation, it just looked interesting (maybe because it was read by Tim Curry, who did an excellent job). I didn't expect much, probably because of the cover quote by Philip Pullman, whose Amber Spyglass I despised; on the other hand, it was also recommended by Lloyd Alexander, of whom I am a fan. The writing got off to rocky start, but I was instantly (and continually) intrigued with the setting. Despite much of the story being set in a superficially standard medieval fantasy land, Nix has added other elements to the setting that result in a creative and original story with likeable protagonists and an interesting plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading Lirael next.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|This is another great album by Bob Dylan.  It's his first real \\"rock\\" album, with \\"side one\\" being electric and \\"side two\\" being acoustic.  The album gets off to a great start, with Bob's first hit single, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\".  After that, we get many more of his recognized \\"classics\\", along with some great lesser known songs.  One of those classics is \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", which has several more verses than the Byrds hit cover version.  This is really just a fantastic album from start to finish, and I highly recommend it.
B00005JNEI|1.0|In this review I will attempt to see past my own political allegiances and concentrate merely on the film, as that is what reviews should focus on. <br /> <br />First and Foremost:  I find this film to be abysmally bad.  I am not a fan of Michael Moore, but can at least appreciate some of his earlier work.  However, this film implodes on itself.  <br /> <br />The film is structured in almost a 2 part format.  Part \\"A\\" the remarkable buffoonery of George W. Bush.  However, the rest of the film seems to paint W. as a manipulative evil genius.  For me, this is a painful contradiction.  How could someone so inept and visionless as one part suggests, still be clever and insightful enough to \\"trick\\" the entire country and propagate a regime? <br /> <br />Another qualm that I had is Moore's now trademark style of editing.  I find it to be \\"MTV paced\\" with quick cuts and loud music, and other auditory stimulation.  A good documentary should let interviews play out, allowing the audience to come to a conclusion based on their own interpretation and intelligence.  With all these quick cuts and eye candy, I feel as if the film tries to force a point (that may or may not have any merit), simply to cut away to another snippet of information (which may or may not be taken out of context) <br /> <br />The film is also sloppy...which there is a certain forgiveness to be had in all documentaries (and I would be the first to argue function over form).  But for this film, the content left me feeling empty, and the technical aspects of the film are lacking.  So for me, the film is like a chocolate Easter bunny.  Well designed packaging, but forever hollow on the inside.
1400034779|5.0|I loved this book so much. The characters are so interesting. And the events that happen really held my interest. I loved the stories of Precious starting her Detective Agency and the people who she takes on as clients and helps. I also enjoyed the parts about her personal life, as she deals with the marriage proposals.<br /><br />I listened to the Book on Tape, and it was wonderful. It was read with such depth and meaning, and the characterazations were outstanding. Very enjoyable.
B000024D4R|5.0|This Floyd album beats them all. It has the band playing at their best. Rogers Waters and Nicks Masons rythem pounding, Richard Writes keyboards are awsome and non other than David Gilmours guitars wail and flow fluently. Listen to how Rogers singing and Ricks keyboard combine together in SHEEP and Davids three guitar onslaught in PIGS(3 different ones). I like Dark Side as much as anyone but I also think it is over rated and Animals is way too under rated. I find putting on a good set of head phones and just absobing this album to be the best way of enjoing it. Do your self a favour and buy this C.D. today, you will not go wrong, promise!!! <br /> <br />Krazeehoser
B00005JN7O|4.0|Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow is a beautiful science fiction movie. Just sit back, and look at the screen. The story is good. But theres not much chance for the outstanding actors do alot of actual acting - they more or less pose for the camera.<br /><br />But even so, I really did liked the movie. The film itself takes you back in time, and the special effects are amazing.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|Even though we havent seen this type of taxi-adventure-ride before, we sure have seen films failing despite a cool setting because of a very weak plot. Lots of them too. <br /> <br />   \\"Collateral\\" has a solid premise to take off from, but the scriptwriter does a lousy job executing (pun intended) his job.  <br />   As a \\"too-bad-not-to-wear-shades\\" contract killer hires a cab in his route to deliver 5 very important hits in one long night weird twists start tangling up as the cab-driver and the killer find themselves all caught up in a fate game. <br /> <br />   Sounds good? I thought so too which is why i ended up in the movie theater seeing this. But then, just as the problems begin for the hostage taken cab-driver so do those for the viewers. <br /> <br />   Tom Cruise (playing the hitman) is not a bad cast for this per ce, he's even given some above average dialogue to work with, but he's also made into a walking cliche. Slick suit outfit, obligatory shades, able to use slang as well as namedrop I Ching and Buddhism all in a night's work, hi-tech gadgets, bad-a** walking style, it all looks like he was ripped out of a manga strip and inserted into this movie.  <br /> <br />    The cab-driver, hmm, well, there we have an attempt to work away from the cliches which fails because it's too rare a picture (and too awkward) to be believed: clean, punctual, orderly, a genius for the fastest route available (timed to the minute), philosophical, charming, among a variety of other virtues. Sounds like your average big-city cabbie to you? Didn't think so. Far from even? Right on. <br /> <br />    All this could've worked despite its clumsiness. As said above, the dialogue is not bad, there's a couple of brilliant punchlines, the subtle humor is well mixed-in. Following par is the cinematography, the photography, and the direction. L.A is given a pretty smooth nocturnal look and the characters flow through the city streets in their cab effortlessly. There's a maze but they are not hindered. It's all charming really and this is quite undeniable. The setting is achieved in convincing manner.  <br />   But. <br />   Yes, there is a a but, and perhaps predictably it's the plot. Stretched so much you'll think it's about to snap any given moment and shatters will jump out of the screen, it undermines all and whatever good things \\"Collateral\\" has to offer. Stretched so much in fact, that at times i thought whether the scriptwriter was actually intending a very dark comedy but failed spectacularly to bring it across as such. <br /> <br />   Giving away all the plot failures would obviously spoil it for those that havent seen the film (which might be a good thing actually) so I'll sum it all up saying that when the supposedly big twist arrives towards the end of the film it's so cheesy the screen almost turns yellow with holes. For the viewer who's long past the impressionable stage, the plot cracks will become apparent within the very first half hour and will only increase dramatically as the film progresses. They are that obvious. <br /> <br />   Which is a pity of course, because \\"Collateral\\" does have great potential written all over it especially because the idea behind it is very intriguing.  <br />   As has been proven though in the past, it becomes for once more apparent that no matter how good the rest of the components of a film are, if the script is not solid the whole construction starts crumbling right before your eyes. We've seen far too many such crumblings before to tolerate one more, havent we?
B0002D6JX2|5.0|I had never heard of Delta Goodrem before, until I started sufring the net and caught some clips of her preforming on Top of the Pops. I was blown away, by her talent and beauty. It's a shame that she had a rough last year, but it's nice to hear that she's doing well and is on the come back trail. I just wish that radio stations and certain music stations would start playing her music more, instead of the Britney's, Justin's, Usher's and everyone else who gets major radio and video play. Talk about favoritisim! Why not try to open your minds up to other artists from around the world? They are just as good, if not better then some of the artists that are coming out of Canada and the US lately. Just give Delta a chance and who know's who might actually like her! I can't wait to buy her second CD!
B0002OERI0|4.0|Ok, I am not usually one to flaunt around knowledge of mainstream artists because i am a metal fan and love the underground. Green Day i know very little about, minus the basics that a) they have influenced the genres of punk and rock since the late 80's and b) that song \\"Time of Your Life\\" gets played at each and EVERY single life event. High school graduations, college graduations, weddings, funerals...you name it.  <br /> <br />That song was when i broke off my early ties with this band. I dubbed them sellouts, a band that had filtered out any creative or original idea for the smell of green in the pocket and millions of headbopping fans.  I never even gave Warning a chance, and from the looks of it, i made a good choice. So when i heard that Green Day's new album was called American Idiot i again wrote it off as petty and redundant.  <br /> <br />So my roomie picks up this cd and pops it in the cd player one day, and i decide to give Green Day one final chance.  Man i'm glad that i did, because this album has given me a new ray of hope for this band.  First off this album is very conceptual, as well as epic for the genre. Two 9 minute long songs! (well really just multiple songs in one, but still, its diverse and awesome!) The other songs though all do not sound the same, they are very different and diverse. Green Day incorporates tribal drums as well as some symphonic elements into these songs.   <br /> <br />Lyrically this album reminded me of the mid 90's for the band with albums like Insomniac and Dookie. Very powerful lyrics that touch base with a lot of the elemetnts of modern day America.  Yes there are ballads on this album, but they are good! They won't be used over and over again at social functions, but really, these are songs that shouldn't be tired out or killed thanks to radio airplay.  This may be one of Green Day's least commercial albums because of how different and unique it is, and thats probably why i have enjoyed it as much as i have.  <br /> <br />Now i am not saying that they should repeat this formula over and over again, but Green Day has found a side of themselves that has been 15 years in the making.  It finally took an ambitious project like this one to exert all the inner force that this album portrays.  Wonderful!  <br /> <br />Green Day...saved.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I had as much fun as everyone else with this film, but there is an old movie that the overall plot structure was lifted from directly, and I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it.  The movie is \\"Carnival of Souls\\".  In that movie, a young woman improbably survives a car crash.  In the ensuing weeks of her life, completely normal events suddenly turn horrid, populated by ghoulish ghostlike beings, and then turn back to normal just as rapidly.  She is inexplicably drawn to an abandoned amusement park, where the ghouls entice her to join them in a dance (think of the elderly tourists in MHD).  At the end, her car is fished out of the lake where it crashed, with her dead body inside.  I am really amazed both that David Lynch did not attribute his plot outline to this horror classic, and that nobody else has mentioned it either
B0002S943O|2.0|I have always believed that this film achieved the pinnacle of concert cinema, even rivaling Jonathan Demme's \\"Stop Making Sense.\\"  Anton Corbijn's direction was totally meticulous, contemporary and cinematographic.  As for the group, what can you say?  Alan Wilder was always the true creative genius, and as fans know, \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" (the material behind this film) was Wilder's experiment and his urgency basically broke up the band.  This was Depeche Mode's last and best achievement.  Also, Dave Gahan wasn't quite as nerdy as he's become in live performance now (yes, it's ironic).<br /><br />OK, so here's the problem:  The transfer sucks, and adding to the comments that the manufacturer didn't go back to the original prints for a quality transfer, the big problem here is one that should have expired years ago in the DVD world:  It's not in anamorphic widescreen format.  Rather, the full-screen image contains black bars on the top and the bottom.<br /><br />What this means is that all modern televisions (i.e., HDTVs) will display the film as a small box inside their full, widescreen frames.  Isn't that great?  Good job, Mute (or whoever performed the transfer).  The DVD is totally worthless, especially for the future.
0060012218|5.0|Even with PFLAG and gay-straight alliances, how do you handle being a gay teen, which, if the locker room crowd finds out, makes you lower than lunchbox-toting Brian Bund in the hierarchy of high school?  How far do you go to prove you're straight?  And what happens when the straightest butch hunk o nthe football team starts making out with you in the parking lot?<br /><br />I could say \\"Be true to yourself, don't forget your real friends,\\" but Brent Hartinger says it more eloquently than ever in this first-love journey into the geography of that strange alien place known as high school.
B0002SROT0|1.0|I was a late fan to Elliott Smith-dom.  I heard Son of Sam on the radio a few times and picked up the Beatles-esque Figure 8, declaring it one of my favorite albums of all time (I gave that CD five stars in my review).  I also picked Elliott's older releases though I didn't enjoy them nearly as much.  A common observation on Figure 8 by Elliott's fans and critics is that it is overproduced.  I'm not sure I know what that means, but if there was ever an overproduced album, \\"from a basement on the hill\\" is it.  Hmm, how to articulate this?  On many of the tracks, it's as if someone in the background is trying to ruin them (much as Jonny Greenwood tried unsuccessfully to do on Radiohead's Creep) by adding a dissonant something extra to each of the songs.  I've listened to this album three times now, and shaken my head in disgust after each listen.  I was looking forward to the follow-up to the tuneful and supremely melodic \\"Figure 8\\"... tragically, that will never come.  RIP Elliott.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|This film is a visual orgy, Mamoru Oshii has outdone himself by providing the first true sequel to Ghost in the Shell in 9 years (the TV series and sequel Manga both follow tangent timelines).  Anyway, having seen this in the theater recently, I am thrilled it is to be released on DVD so quickly, but just one thing, where is the English soundtrack?  Yes, the geniuses at Dreamworks/Go Fish Pictures have decided to release a bare-bones Region 1 DVD w/ no English translation, which will only limit this films appeal w/ mass audiences in my opinion.  Part of what made the first film such a hit on DVD was the English soundtrack, and the dialogue in this film is twice as confusing.  I hope people w/ dyslexia or other reading impediments will be able to keep up, b/c it's very technical and philosophical.  If they do an English dub, please iclude the original English voice cast, who has done an excellent job on the Stand Alone Complex series DVDs (except for the actress playing Motoko, they replaced her).  All in all, a 5 star work of art all the way!    Edit: the UK and Australian DVDs of this film do feature an English dub with the original cast from Stand Alone Complex, plus there is a blu-ray release on the horizon featuring said dub for the US.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|Well if you ignore the fact that this movies makes no sense, then it's pretty good.  I've scientifically analyzed every second of this movie, and the plot is more inconsistent than the Yankees (I won't go into detail about the inconsistencies, but they're definitely there).  This movie is also full of annoying characters, especially Tommy.  I estimated that kid to be approximately 4'2\\" and 67 lbs.  Yet he thinks he's a badass, and he beats the crap outta kids twice his size, including a 17 year old at the movie theater.  That kid could have done several things to avoid the beatdown he got from little 9 year old Tommy (stepped on him, flicked him in the forehead, picked him up and tossed him into the corner, etc).  And not to be nitpicky, but if you notice the outside of the theater, two of the movies playing are Se7en and Dumb and Dumber.  Those movies were released a year apart and were in theaters nowhere near the same time, just in case anyone forgot.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|Admittedly, this is not Knopfler's most rousing effort. Most tracks are very subtle, very low-key. If you are looking for lots of up-tempo tunes from MK, this album will disappoint you. Despite the slow, mellow consistency of the album, there are a few gems. The title cut is a beauty, Boom, Like That! is a whopper with a groove, and Postcards for Paraguay is a reminder of why Knopfler is so winsome-wonderful guitar work, an intriguing story, and a melody that takes you along for the ride.
0380973650|5.0|I read this book just after it came out.  I first became aware of Mr. Gaiman through the Sandman series, and was eager to read more of his work.  When I started reading this book, everything else stopped, because I couldn't put it down.  At night, I would have dreams that seemed to lead right back to the book.  It's not often that you find an author who can get that thoroughly into your head through a book, but Neil Gaiman is one of those rare few.
B00005QDW5|3.0|This package could have been a lot better if the egos could come together and replace some of the material that shouldn't be on this release with some earlier material that SHOULD be on the cd.  I said in other Pink Floyd/Roger Waters reviews that you should listen to each Pink Floyd/Roger Waters cd from beginning to end to feel the concept.  There is no way you can do it listening to a greatest hits cd, especially one that follows absolutely no concept format.  Sure there are some fine songs on here but could have been done much better.
0553260111|5.0|If you've seen the movie you'll definately like this book.  I think that this book was alot different than the movie, but it still kind of followed the same storyline.  I really liked this book alot better than the movie.  Out of everyone I know that's read it they say it is the coolest book, and way cooler than the movie.  This book is one of my most favorite books.  It's a must read book.
B000002UB3|5.0|Back to front, this is a must have.  This could be George Harrison's greatest contribution, also.  The songs blend into one another and seem to bring out the finest song writing which includes all four Beatles.  Sinatra referred to \\"Something\\" as being the greatest love song ever written by Lennon/McCartney, when all along, it was Harrison who wrote it.  Another rumor was that Harrison wrote \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" while sitting in Clapton's garden.  All around great effort.
B0001QNFXW|5.0|This DVD makes you feel you're among the crowd in Verona watching Jay Kay strutting his stuff on stage, even while the rains poured. In here are songs like his rendition of Bad Girls, the hits Cosmic Girl, Love Foolosophy, among others. Electric performances, awesome music and cool extras like the pre-show documentary  make this DVD a must-buy and must-keep.
B000002JEV|4.0|A few of these tracks were found on bootlegs and radio.  Nice to have them on a cd.  As I mentioned in a review for \\"How the West Was Won\\", you should also pick up the latest DVD release.  A few of these tracks are also on the DVD.  The video release for \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" is also on the DVD.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I was so excited this was finally released on DVD.  I just adore Frank Langella.  Wait till you see the extras on this DVD.  There is about 40 minutes worth of interviews with John Badham and Frank Langella, talking specifically about the making of the movie.  I learned so much about the movie I had never known before; like the names of the houses and castles that were used in the film, how they filmed certain scenes, etc.  Just getting this extra was well worth buying the DVD.  The photo gallery was a little disappointing; you have to manually move from picture to picture, and there's absolutely no music at all in the picture gallery.
1582403589|4.0|I certainly read my fair share of comic books. However it is in an inexpert method, I must say, I am reviewing this graphic novel (being a few years unaccustomed with comicbook story and art). <br /> <br />Right off the bat I will say this book is definitely no less then four stars. It surely is in line for more if there was a second volume in tow (coming in December I believe), but I will evaluate the story as it is in this volume only. <br /> <br />My only qualm about the book is the jumpiness it seems to expedite. Though you could consider this a good attribute as far as the writing goes. You just seem to want more in this very good story by Mr. Kirkman.  <br />It was the second time that I read \\"Days gone bye\\" that I really began to lean heavily on the art to tell the rest of the story that isn't worded. <br /> <br />And as the story goes, this is a very Human story. The one good and priceless facet of which is the fact that I can see myself as the story's protagonist, who is devoid of superpowers or genetic superiority.  <br />He's just a Man, a man who desperately wants to find those that he loves and were lost in the chaos of the world's new normal. <br /> <br />\\"Days gone bye\\" has a first-rate beginning, shortly after which the story begins to move very quickly ascending toward the story's climax, a little too quickly in my opinion, as mentioned before.  <br />But around a 1/3 of the way through the graphic novel the story starts to settle a little bit to a more measured pace. It is around this point in the story that some of the more poignant scenes take place. <br /> <br />Though it is probably from an untutored eye in, my opinion Mr. Tony Moore is quit the exceptional artist. I am not sure I can amply evaluate the penciling/ink considering I do not usually come by art with the paperbacks I read other then the cover art. But, in my unqualified opinion the art is terrific. And I mean that literally also. <br />This book is four stars <br /> <br />Mr. RobertKirkman has done a good job in proving that... <br />In any good Zombie story (film or literature) the scariest things are the HUMANS.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|Like one of the previous reviewers, I also greatly anticipated the release of this album in '79. I thought Rumours was too poppy and commercial, but it showed the tremendous promise held in this fresh Mac line up. The pre-release publicity back then was that this record was taking an almost unimaginable amount of time and money to make, and the result was going to be worth it. I couldn't wait. When I picked it up on the day it was released, I loved half the album. I felt the \\"strange\\" material that Buckingham recorded was trash. Over the years, I have gradually warmed to these songs, and upon hearing the second disc in this release, I am totally won over. In fact, most of the versions on the second disc are superior. They are less commercial and polished than disc one, and they are like a breath of fresh air. To top it all off, the second disk has the songs arranged in the same order as the original, so it's as if you're listening to the  Tusk that could have been - and you are!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This CD by Peyroux demonstrates her special talent to sing so romantically; the opening song \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\" is both a very strong way to start the song set and a woman's cry for romance that is so well sung it's unforgettable! I envy the reviewer who writes that he personally saw this young lady perform! Lucky him!<br /><br />The next song on the CD is \\"Don't Wait Too Long,\\" a beautiful romantic song partly written by Peyroux herself! Other great songs include \\"J'ai Deux Amours,\\" \\"Don't Cry Baby,\\" the awesome \\"Careless Love,\\" and \\"This Is Heaven To Me.\\" \\"This Is Heaven To Me\\" ends the album very well.<br /><br />As others have noted, Madeleine Peyroux can perform just about any type of song: ballad, torch, blues, jazz and pop. When she sings she emotes very well and you can really feel the feelings she describes in her songs.<br /><br />The liner notes include beautiful pictures of Madeleine. The sound quality is excellent as well.<br /><br />I can only hope we don't have to wait another eight years for such a great CD by Peyroux to come again! Her talent is on a par with Ella Fitzgerald and Judy Garland at the very least. I highly recommend this CD for Madeleine's fans as well as fans of this type of music. GET THIS CD, sit down and relax, perhaps with a glass of fine wine, and enjoy a five star performance many times over playing this CD!
B00000JG41|5.0|This album kicks everyone's ass.  Even if it is a \\"Joke\\" it is still the best pop album of all time...it sure as hell beats all that garbage you hear on the radio.  I'm not going to write much here, just buy the damn album.  It's dreary and dreamlike and all those other artfag terms that are synonymous with \\"RAWKIN\\".  Bungle Owns.
6305508550|5.0|Anyone who has ever lived in a cubicle needs to see this movie... just not when the boss is around!  It is funny and painfully close to cubicle truths.  Like a live action Dibert cartoon... bureaucracy victims will be rolling on the floor in laughter.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|We all know the tale of Belle (the Beauty) and her beastly prince. Boys and girls alike grew up begging to hear the story at bed time, over and over and over... <br /> <br />Of all the fairy tales out there \\"Beauty & the Beast\\" is the favorite of most kids, especially the girls. I am no exception. I was already in my twenties when I found out that the Disney Studio was creating this, my favorite tale, in animated magic as only Disney can do! It was torture to wait for the movie to hit the theater. I took my little boy to see it on opening weekend. I was as enthralled with the magic as he was. <br /> <br />Today, I still feel this way about the movie. Of course I purchased the VHS on the day it was released to the public. However, getting this tale in DVD was a \\"no brainer\\". DVD lasts so much longer than VHS and is not quite so fragile or wear out so quickly. On birthdays and special occassions, this would be a wonderful gift!  <br /> <br />And let us not forget that unlike the VHS, this DVD set has so many extras! The movie may be 90 mins to two hours long, but the extras are even longer! You get behind the scene glances and see the wonder of how it was created. I had no idea that there was so much involved! Animation gets no better than this. <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|everytime I listen to this CD.  Love the lyrics, most of all, I love that rich voice.
B0006213WG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from the guys this time as they've been out of the country and experiencing different aspects of life since their last offering.  I couldn't believe how good this album is!!  They've definately matured musically.  The instrumentation on this album is super.  While their other stuff (past albums) is great, this is near the top of their best stuff yet.  Very recommended CD.
B0002S943O|5.0|I highly recommend this dvd. I owned this same concert on VHS video for several years and so I was excited to see it come out on DVD. However, when I read some of the other reviews here about \\"grainy\\" video, I held off. Finally I bought it and I am 100% happy with it, and I don't understand what this talk of \\"graininess\\" is all about. I find the video to be very sharp and clear, and better than the VHS video. But the DVD also includes a number of extra features - such as an MTV special with interviews with DM, and the original video that is on the screens.  <br /> <br />I think this concert captures DM at their peak - and I saw them live in both 1988 at the Rose Bowl concert, and on the most recent Exciter tour and have the dvd's of those concerts too, so I can compare. And their series of videos for their individual songs is too abstract and boring for my tastes. THIS dvd from 92 or 93 is the one to have!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from these guys this time around.  After so long since their last offering and hearing so much hype over this album, I didn't know what it was gonna be like.  Word was it was gonna be more like a rock opera ala \\"Pink Floyd\\".  I wouldn't call it that, but it's definately good stuff.  Many of the songs do run into each other, but it all works and you can listen to all of it or bits and pieces.  Some of the best stuff they've put out.  **For the super fan, there's also a limited edition version that has a hard-cover book included with the lyrics and artwork instead of the booklet in the jewel case.**  If you like \\"Green Day\\" (and if you're reading this, you must on some level), then you'll love this.  Very recommended CD.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I really think this is one of the best heavy metal albums ever made. The number of the beast and other 80s maidens kick ass, but i think this one is better than some of the 80s maidens. There's really nothing to complain about on brave new world, the whole thing rocks. If you listen to dream of mirrors you can see that it's a lot better explained than some of their other songs like de-ja vu on somewhere in time.Iron maiden has become one my fav bands now. If you're a heavy metal fan and you don't have this get it because it's excellent.UP THE IRONS!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I will never go see another Michael Moore movie again.  A thinly veiled, 2 hour politcal plug for the Democratic Party.  Just about as interesting as watching Kerry campaign commercials (and about as honest).
B000004166|4.0|I don't know alot about the Mozart concertos are Grumiaux except that he was a belgian violinist. All I can tell you is they sound good and It does have five whole concertos on a two C.D. set for under twenty dollars. Go ahead and buy.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|It is hard to even criticize such an musical icon/legend as Ray Charles. This album is a well done, worthy album, yet It lacks the classicism of classic Ray Charles albums (which is to be expected).  Ray Charles still proves his flexibility to do any project thrown at him, no matter the genre be it country, blues, jazz, or rhythm and blues.  My top rated song is his duet with Norah Jones, which is a classic.  The other duets are worthy as well, yet his duet with Norah just outshines the others.  I highly recommend adding this album to your collection whether just for listening pleasure, or as a collector's item.  Ray did it again with his last album.  4 stars.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|This movie is all special effects.  But the performances by the actors are not believable nor humorous(though they try too hard to be.)  Somehow I just picture a bunch of half-bored overrated actors and actresses in a blue room.  The effects are good but I don't feel like the people are really \\"there\\". If you don't understand the meaning behind that commit, then you must like this movie.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was great in the X-men movies, but he is lacking sorely in this and the woman(whoever she was) was horrid, so was the goofy side kick who was trying too hard to be quirky and sucked at it.  Frankenstien's monster was a just a fat dork, drakula was a goof, and Van Helsing just wasn't.
B000002JPA|5.0|Good short melodic songs here make this Dream Theaters best album.  This one and awake are just incredible because they don't have all the dumb epics they seem to favor these days a la Inner Turbulence and Train Of Thought, where they basically suck. <br /> <br />Dream Theater needs to return to albums like this one to be good again.  Highlights: Another Day, Pull Me Under, Surrounded
B000021Y7Z|5.0|There's not much else to say about this concert film. Anyone unfamiliar with it who stumbles upon these reviews will certainly understand that they should see it. <br /> <br />If you're still not sure...  note that you don't have to be a talking heads fan or even know one of their songs to love this film. I dare say you don't even have to be a music fan... this film will just make you feel good regardless. <br /> <br />&#62; edited to add: I see the most recent reviewer also mentions the workout benefits of the film... obviously I'm not the first to have thought that one up...  we stopmakingsense exercisers should compare notes on # of viewings (I must have hit a few hundred by now) <br /> <br />PS: You should be standing when watching (to facilitate movement or dance).  If you're all alone and feel funny then put on your sweat pants and jump on your exercise bike or stepper.  It will be the funnest 10 pounds you ever lose.
B00005NEUF|5.0|......but that's more than enough. Oasis, Primal Scream, Radiohead, they were all options, but when it comes to The Strokes, then you've got everything that is Rock n'Roll. Good lyrics that makes sense (in oposite of Oasis's \\"What's the Story...\\"), energy that sustains itself trough the entire album(in oposite to \\"Give in but don't Give up, by Primal Scream), simplicity in the arrengements (in oposit of Radiohead's \\"OK Computer), a crap, but undeniable, efective production, in oposite to all the others also called \\"Rock N' Roll's Saviers\\", dirty guitars, dirty vocals, drums that seems alive (listen to Track 4, \\"Barely Legal\\", for instance). Sure, 2001 were all about The Strokes, and now, not so much. But it was there, and till now it's worthed. Good music, simple and plain: that's the most eloquent sentence that comes to my mind to describe this album. It saved 2001, it saved more than we could expect; or would you like to listen to Mickey Mouse's music (Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake with N'Sync) till your brain refuses to come closer to any music or music relateds, like a \\"Pavlov Brain\\" or a \\"Clockwork Orange lobotomy Brain\\"  ? <br /> <br />PS. you probably now that, but this album version contains NYC Cops, therefore, it's the album as it was intented to be.
B000002UR7|4.0|... that this is the same band who wrote OK Computer.  This album is in the shodow of OK Computer and I have a feeling that Kid A will turn that shadow into total darkness for Pablo Honey.  Which is a shame.  Any day Radiohead would like to just throw out a CD of songs instead of musical landscapes would be fine with me.  \\"Vegetable\\", \\"Think About You\\", \\"Stop Whispering\\" and the big hit \\"Creep\\" are enjoyable today as they were back in 1993.  If you are a Radiohead diehard you probably own this CD and it has about 4 inches of dust on it because it's all about Ok Computer.  If you want a good CD with the more traditional verse, chorus, verse this is good for you and you will enjoy it.  This CD beats anything done by Blur or Oasis.  So you could imagine if that's the case with Pablo Honey, OK Computer is very close to scripture. <br /> <br />   <br />
B0002XNSY0|5.0|If, by some unlucky accident, I had read the book first, I'd never want to see this movie. That was \\"Red Alert\\", an extremely forgettable crisis-thriller, set in the \\"near future\\" -- a \\"future\\" most inaccurately predicted. Think a 1950s Tom Clancey, only dumber.<br /><br />And it doesn't help that I'm not a big Stanley Kubrick fan. As a director, he was OK, but I was never much impressed when he wrote his own material. Or, as in this case, when he did his own adaptation.<br /><br />Yet somehow this ends up being one of my favorite movies. So what happened?<br /><br />The story goes that Kubrick decided to do a nuclear-crisis movie (a logical choice for the post-Cuban Missle Crisis era). and bought the rights to \\"Red Alert\\". Heaven knows why he chose that book -- perhaps he got it cheap. Anyway, when Kubrick sat down to write the screenplay, he couldn't get serious. Every attempt to transcribe the book's turgid plot into a movie came out comic. He fought it for a while. Then he went with it.<br /><br />The result is one of the funniest movies ever made -- all the funnier because it's about humanity's self destruction. The strange thing is that the screenplay is actually pretty loyal to the book, even preserving the Mad General's obsession with \\"Purity\\". Though not his name, of course.<br /><br />It probably helped that Kubrick had the cast he had. He had Peter Sellers as Doctor Strangelove. And Peter Sellers as the President. Then there's Peter Sellers as the Air Base Ops Officer. Peter Sellers was also supposed to play the cowboy bomber pilot, but a back injury forced them to bring in Slim Pickens (Yahoo!). Which was probably just as well.<br /><br />Note that the multiple casting of one actor was not played as a gimmick. And there *were* some other fine performances, notably George C. Scott as a creepy Air Force general (toting a book labeled \\"World Casualties in Megadeaths\\"), and Keenan Wynn as an uptight Army Colonel, and Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper (the name speaks for itself).  You'll also spot James Earl Jones in a very small part.<br /><br />Of course, what I'm really reviewing here is the DVD with all its bonus material. Which I haven't actually seen, since it hasn't been released yet. Still, I have to doubt whether Roger Ebert, Robert McNamara, or Bob Woodward have anything to add, beyond the obvious platitudes. I am curious to know what Spike Lee has to say, though.ck D. Ripper (the name speaks for itself).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I usualy can only tolerate to see a movie/show 2 or 3 times. I watched this series 4 times back to back and plan to watch many times more. It baffels my why this was canceld. There are series with 4 seasons that aren't half as good. Maybe the sifi channel will pick it up :(
B00005JMH2|1.0|Shall we dance was a wonderful story about a businessman taken by a woman in a window, and he ends up taking (and loving) the dance even more than the woman, although his wife, once learning why he is coming home late, doesn't quite understand the need to dance.  Oh yes, it was Japanese, the dance was classic ballroom, and the notion that a man taking dance lessons could somehow be almost shameful made perfect sense. It was a great movie. <br /> <br />Now Hollywood, not quite satisifed in thier never-ending quest to take movies made right the first time and remaking them and destroying any charm, humor, or romance (see Sabrina, Charade/Something about Charley, Alfie, Tall Blond Man..., has gone and tried to adapt \\"Shall We Dance\\" as a star vehicle for Jennifer Lopez.  Maybe it's just that she constantly choses bad movies, or maybe (\\"horrors\\") she can't act, but there is no chemistry whatsoever with Richard Gere, and the dancing is just mediocre. And not enough of it, because you have to suffer through dialogue which has as little resemblence to the original script a Kerry's health plan has to Bush's.  Susan Sarandin is wasted. The only good thing was realizing that Gere can actually dance, and may have done the bulk of his work in Chicago (excpet the last tap number, where the shoes were defnitely smaller....) Rent the original.
B000006JQ5|5.0|The 2 cd Best of the Beast is awesome.  With this one 2 cd set, this is the only Iron maiden cd you'll need.
B000002H4Q|5.0|<br />Wow its fromt eh 80's but everytime i listen to it, i am amazed.. ok enough nostalgia.. <br />Its a long album with 17 songs.. Im no musciian but to make such a long album, have so many tracks and to be a complete success - well its genius! <br />If you like any of The Cure's music then you will love this album.. I do!! Absolutly
B00005QW5X|5.0|My brother in NYC made me watch this movie one night and I will admit I was reluctant because I'm not a huge movie person.  But this was unbelievable, I can't imagine that one or even two people could come up with this.  Not only are the songs absolutely amazing (I listen to them everyday) but how they are animated and performed into the movie are brillant.  The make-up and costumes are fantastic, oh and the story is not so bad either.  Actually, everything about this movie is excellent, except for Johnny Gnosis' voice but other than that the story is engaging, the music is incredible and the performances are so great.  But I really have to give it to John Cameron Mitchell, the man is a genius, I know Stephan Trask had something to do with the music but JCM co-wrote, starred and directed this movie and I think the guy is awesome, the word genius does come to mind.  I had the pleasure to meet him a few weeks ago and was so star-struck that I couldn't find myself to tell him how great I thought everything was.  I'd really recommend this movie to anyone and I am.  Even if you're not really into the philosophy or music just see it for the one-liners and the entertainment, anyone should be pulled in by the first performance in the restaruant with \\"Tear Me Down\\", I couldn't stop laughing.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I just finished watching this film. I did not expect it to be THAT good. I am torn by two contradictory  emotions. I want to weep, yet I remind myself of the expression on Kevin Spacey's face at its finale, and I want to pay him homage by smiling and rejoicing in the mysteries of life. <br />American Beauty is simply great. If, halfway through, you think you are bored, hold your horses, because you will realize that a slow- down was needed for us to appreciate the grand finale and the wonderfully summed up \\"meaning of life.\\" <br />Watch this movie, my friend, and then tell all your loved ones  how much you love and appreciate them. Life is too short and unpredictable, we all know that, but what we forget, sometimes, is that while we're at it, we ought to live it with all the grace we can muster. Cheers!
B0002OERI0|2.0|I would hesistate to write the truth, though diehard toddler Green Day fans are smacking up excuses for a \\"dead\\" album...thats shows the desperation that Green Day has headed down. Whether people say this album revolves around politics or not...the hype it has been given is worthy of me writing the truth, as I am a person who respects \\"music\\"...something you cannot call this.  <br /> <br />Sure there are some catchy tunes...but I thought Green Day, for what they have been labeled...were innovators. Apparently that does not shine through within this album...if you can even call it that. I'm surprised this piece of plastic sold.  <br /> <br />I cannot deny that Billie Joe Armstrong sure has a magical touch to play a guitar...but did he have to use that musical talent on punk rock, and more noticable: rebeling with the other foolish punk bands of today. <br /> <br />George Bush will win this election, whether Green Day or any punk rock band will face it. So its just silly to talk about not being part \\"of a redneck agenda\\". It shows how immature they are, and desperate...so they can join the \\"Rock Against Bush\\".  ***cough**** no sign of an innovator there. I respect good music, and have been satiable with SOME of their older songs...but now, after my daughter bought this album, I threw it out the window.  <br /> <br />BUSH CHENEY 2004
068987474X|1.0|Greg and his acccomplice lady co-writer paint the world of romance in black and white: he LOVES you or he does not.  And, should there be any ambiguities, any missed phone call (note: one missed phone call can be construed within this book as a sign that he is \\"not that into you,\\") any poor behavior, the cure is simple. Dump him.   <br /> <br />This scorched earth policy may be great if you are looking forward to dating dozens of people over the course of your romantic career, but should you be in the process of finding a way to interlace your life with a complicated, three-dimensional human being, if you take this book's repetitive message to heart, there's a good chance you'll wind up single and proud. <br /> <br />In addition, Greg's supposition that men must do all the calling and pursuing and women must wait or walk, makes for a lot of 1950s style pining for the phone to ring.   <br /> <br />If you want the guy, put down the book and pick up the phone.  And if he doesn't want you, let him tell you.  Don't take it from Greg. <br /> <br />And remember -- dating is supposed to be fun.  <br />;-)
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Really enjoyed Van Helsing for what it is - A movie of groundbreaking special effects! Amazing, imaginative, and fast-paced. The kind of movie that is fun to watch several times because there will always be things that didn't get noticed the first time around. The movie was also pleasantly atmospheric. It is not a deep movie. Pretty basic really, but a lot of fun to watch! Not as serious as the old Frankenstein and Dracula movies but it was not intended to challenge the classics. It was intended to be very, very, visually stimulating and surprising - and it is!
B0002KQNJU|4.0|Well before director Roman Polanski made such classic films as \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" his first American feature was this bizarre 1967 horror-comedy called \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers,\\" which finally makes a long overdue DVD debut. <br /> <br />Jack MacGowran plays Professor Abronsius, a bumbling, low-rent Van Helsing who, with his timid assistant Alfred (played by a wide-eyed Polanski), journeys to a remote Transylvanian village to investigate Count von Krolock (Ferdy Mayne), a cunning vampire.    <br /> <br />The movie is both a sprawling, surprisingly scary parody of the old Hammer horror films and a goofy, uneven, swinging 60s comedy (its alternate title, \\"Pardon Me, Your Teeth Are In My Neck\\" was foisted on Polanski by the studio but... it does match the tone of some of the humor).   <br /> <br />In the end, scariness wins out for a lot of reasons: Krolock's long chat with the Professor about his plans for him is bleak and coldly, darkly sophisticated; the production design is dead serious and beautiful, with great use of matte paintings and animation. And Polanski's movies also always boast sharp edges and joltingly grim endings and, even though it's a comedy, \\"Vampire Killers\\" is no exception; it closes on a note so harsh it almost doesn't seem fair.    <br /> <br />It's also hard to ignore the fact that Polanski's then-wife and co-star, Sharon Tate (who is jaw-droppingly beautiful here) would, in less than two years, be murdered by followers of Charles Manson - an unhappy footnote for such a unique little horror classic.
B00004SC3M|3.0|Cos lets face it, we all get what we want when we're naked! ;)<br /><br />I don't really understand why there's some questionable reviews about this DVD, but everyone has their own opinion I guess. I found it to be quite a fast paced movie, although I'm not keen on Sean Connery (Mac). I don't like the spelling of the name :) and the only reason they had to bring in Catherine Zeta Jones (Gin) is because he's getting on a bit now! I'm always going to be a bit iffy about Catherine, as her accent is so WEIRD now, and she reverts back to her Welsh accent, particularly when she wants people to believe she's still the same little Welsh girl that starred in Darling Buds Of May. I don't think so! She keeps saying \\"combuder\\" instead of \\"computer\\". Watching her struggle with the name Kuala Lumpur in half-Welsh-half-American is genuinely funny.<br /><br />Both actors do a great job of portraying their characters. Sean Connery does a brilliant eye roll a lot of the time, and is probably the only actor who can get away with saying \\"If I'm late, I'm dead\\".<br /><br />The film is shot in Kuala Lumpur, what looks like Scotland, and London, I think. The Scotland scenery looks lovely, very peaceful and remote. The building used for exterior shots of Mac's safe house (Castle Duart on the Isle of Mull) is the ancestral home of the Chief of the Clan MacLean.<br /><br />I love the whole stealing of precious items, it's so weird how much thought & work actually goes into it during the film. And you're always holding your breath, waiting for them to hit a laser, or for a security guard to spot them.<br /><br />The finale to this, I will NEVER understand, no matter how many times I watch it! It's very subtle, highly original, and you're left guessing until the very last frame, and trying to search the screen! In this, there are double-crosses, triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses, enough to leave you spinning. Is he double-crossing her? Is she double-crossing him? Is Ving Rhames in this for anything other than hard cash, and lots of it? Considering he doesn't have much of a role, and he's not really who you think he is!<br /><br />There's been a lot of comparisons to a movie called The Thomas Crown Affair. Sorry, but I haven't seen this, so I'm not likely to compare.<br /><br />There's a lot of sexual chemistry between Catherine & Sean, although you'll be glad to hear, they never really get it on, and it's almost a paternal attraction on Sean's side.<br /><br />Forget the negative reviews for this movie. You're not supposed to take this film at all seriously, you're supposed to be watching the pretty lady get herself into all kinds of positions (Michael Douglas must love that!) with some laser beams.this for anything other than hard cash, and lots of it?

B0002J4ZWS|4.0|Has there been a mainstream movie in the past 10 years that wraps itself up as movingly and satisfyingly as \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" ? If so, let me know about it because I don't think I've seen it.  <br /> <br />After years of being available only on a ho-hum DVD with no extras, \\"Shawshank\\" finally gets the double-disc treatment.   The movie - in which Tim Robbins plays a convict who, over the course of decades, seeks an elaborate revenge - was a flop when released in 1994. Now it's a popular favorite that holds the No. 2 spot on the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 movies. It's just a good, old-fashioned yarn.  <br /> <br />Unknown screenwriter Frank Darabont adapted Stephen King's short novel, \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\\" into a script that was so sought-after that he was able to demand the right to direct it, and this is an excellent book-to-movie translation. In fact, the few moments when \\"Shawshank\\" doesn't quite work are when Darabont injects scenes that weren't in the novel - when every tough guy in the prison-yard is struck speechless by the sound of Mozart, for example, or when the elderly prisoner Brooks makes his somewhat tear-jerky re-entry into society.    <br /> <br />Critics of the movie claim it's often sappy and, at times, maybe so, but it has the kind of sap that makes movies entertaining, it's the kind of earnestness that's just too much trouble to resist.  <br /> <br />Critics also claim it's too long but, at 142 minutes, I think it's just right. Constant TV broadcasts of the film disguise the fact that this is a story about patience.   Patience tends to chafe against commercial breaks and TNT's habit of using pop-ups to remind you that, say, \\"Law & Order\\" is coming on next. <br /> <br />Patience is also what makes \\"Shawshank\\" a slow-burning, engrossing fuse for the first two hours, and the final act a series of beautifully timed storytelling explosions - the Raquel Welch poster, the drain, the rain, the shoes, the bank, the final hearing, a box under a rock and one beautiful beach.

B000001FKY|5.0|There is only one rock album ever made that is better than this one.  And that is \\"Pyromania\\"-- Hysteria's predecessor.

B0006A9FMI|5.0|I had the immense pleasure catching \\"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\\" when it was briefly in the theaters. I never saw the original, let alone consider myself a fan of Japanese animation I must confess. I saw this particular film when I saw the trailer during another movie and was compelled to see it.<br /><br />The premise of the film revolves around a series of murders commited by female robots that were designed for pleasure. Batou and his partner Togusa investigates who is behind these killings. During the course of the investigation Batou (who is a living cyborg) is haunted by his former partner Major Motoko Kusanagi. The sequel is different from the original \\"Ghost in the Shell\\". In fact, I don't think this film is really a sequel. The storyline is more focused oh philosophical ideals like is it really a good idea for mankind to immortalize their own image and soul with androids? Most of the familiar characters from the first \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" film is in this movie (including the major) but the premise of the film is completely different and does not pick up where the first film leaves off. There might be some people who might be turned off by all the philosophizing that goes on in the movie but I loved it (as confusing as it was). The animation was totally mindblowing as was the surround sound. I felt like I was right in the film itself because of the surround sound. The music was stunning. I loved the music so much that I bought the soundtrack. If there was any flaws I found with the movie, I guess it had to be the times that I could not figure out what was going on, namely when Batou and Togusa went to investigate their prime suspect in this elaborate mansion. After awhile, I realized what was going on. Despite the confusion, I thought that particular moment in the film was amazing. The animation was nothing that I had ever seen before, a good mix of computer and Japanese animation. \\"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence\\" is one of my favorite films of this year, if not my favorite film of the year. I can't wait to buy it on dvd. It will be interesting to see how the film translates onto dvd.not my favorite film of the year. I can't wait to buy it on dvd.

B0001I561E|5.0|I had seen Aladdin 12 years ago in theaters when I was about 7 years old and in 2nd grade. Now I am 19 and the other night I had a dream where I saw Aladdin.

This DVD really relieves some of my childhood memories.
B000075BFK|4.0|A good double disc cd but it would have been much better dayz if Afeni & Suge left the beats and original recodings/guests on the songs (Much like they took the quality of \\"Until the End of Time\\" down by doing the same thing - how you gonna have rappers on here who never knew, met, or had a cd out when he was alive!!  - plus I doubt Pac would do songs with half of them).  How you gonna put 2 songs on each cd that are the same and 3 more that were on other cd's!!!  A few songs with the Outlawz and a few w/ Kadafi (R.I.P.) which I am happy about.  Has some classics and some more deep, touching songs that Pac was so good at delivering.  Teh beats are still good and gusts are pretty good just a few I don't agree with.

B00005JMJG|1.0|I would like to have my mind earsed so I wouldn't know I watched this movie.  It is slow, not funny (think really not funny), and just drifts along a piece of wood at sea.  One day the wood might find, but otherwise it just drifts along.  This is about like the movie, it just drifts, and some scenes are way too long.   You can rent this one, but I would not buy it unless you need a $20 coaster.

B000066C1N|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the best OST I have heard since The Lion King soundtrack ten years ago.  The songs fit absolutely perfectly with the movie, and Bryan Adams' voice is as amazing as ever.  It's hard (but not impossible) to find an awesome sountrack that brings tears to your eyes for a \\"kids movie\\" but this is one of the few.  I'd recommend this OST to anyone, even if they haven't seen the movie.
B00000IBRI|5.0|The first movie of Dario Argento's I watched was Opera. The second movie was Tenebrae. Out of all three movies directed by Dario Argento that I have seen so far, this is the best one. Everything about this movie is enjoyable.<br />  The soundtrack is amazing! It is peacful yet keeps you on the edge of your seat. The music fits in incredibly well.<br />  This is the first horror movie that has made me cringe..the murder scences are really full of gore. I could feel the pain the victums were going through! I had to bite on a blanket I was covered with.<br />  During this film, I fell in love with Jennifer. She is an innocent girl who gets involved with the murders happening around her and soon becomes the next victum. There were times I thought she was a goner but like most movies, the main character does not die.<br />  To be honest, this is my favourite movie I own. I could put it in my dvd player and watch it again right now. I just finished it before I started writting this too! I have tons of movies, mostly horror, and out of all the ones I own I have never felt that way before. This movie is truely amazing. I do not see why fans bash this great movie. I enjoyed it a lot. I had low epectations because of other reviewers but bought it anyway. I am extremely glad to say, I was filled with satisfaction while watching this.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|So, the long awaited slipknot album comes in, and what is the result? Metal music fans enjoy it, the 2 dimensional slipknot fans don't. I can explain why this is. The music now incorporates harmonies, acoustics, and the vocal style has changed slightly. The lyrics have progressed just enough to make the real \\"maggots\\" go crazy and not understand them. Truely, I think they are coming near their sound, but they need to make an inclusion of the previous albums and keep the acoustics to a minimum. There are guitar solos in this album, which is real plus. Most of the tracks are enjoyable, but they are not mixed in well, and the shift between them is strange. You go from an acoustic track and wait a few seconds and then an awful transition into yelling is there. Those are my only complaints, however, and this album remains good in my mind, despite the faults. In general though, nu-metal/original slipknot fans will not likely enjoy this quite as much as fans of other metal genres.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore outdid himself -- which is saying quite a lot -- in this film.  The documentary combines good investigative journalism, old-fashioned muckraking, a nonpartisan spirit, and patriotic indignation at the theft of our nation by a few greed-mongers pretending to be \\"Christians.\\"  I'm hoping that in a few days we'll have some regime change here in the U.S. and if decency and morality does triumph then Moore's film needs to take credit for awakening some of those who've been lulled asleep by the captive mass media.  Thank God for independent film-makers like Michael Moore!
B0000017CA|5.0|Acid bath's first album is a true exploration into the darkness within the human mind. The songs range heavier to clean, eerie songs. Each provokes the mood of the listener and tosses about his/her soul in a pool of thought, from beginning to end. The poetic look into death, drugs, love, and their reachs adds to the underlying feeling that you are listening to more than you are hearing. Dax's vocals and lyrics have yet to be matched by any other vocalist. Make sure to pick up this album, by any means necessary.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Tunisia-Sicily-Luxembourg<br /><br />Patton, the movie, does not chronicle General George S. Patton Jr.'s entire life, only the last three years, starting from when he landed in Casablanca, Morocco in November of 1942 until relieved of his command of the 3rd Army in October of 1945.  The movie mainly highlights his exploits in the above mentioned countries in WWII.  In North Africa, he and the British General Bernard Montgomery were on the trail of tanks sped along by the German General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps.  Later in Sicily, he and Montgomery raced each other to take Messina fighting the Germans along the way.  During that time, the infamous slapping incident of a soldier occurred which would haunt his career to the end.  Once in continental europe, Patton's 3rd Army would lead a blistering pace to liberate the beseiged city of Bastogne, Belgium, on the border of Luxembourg, and the entrapped U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division on Christmas day.  The movie captures Patton's personality in the military arena, that part of his life that was his heart and soul.  In the movie, he describes himself as a \\"combat soldier\\", and it is all too clear that he is deeply hurt when benched by his commanding officers to not fight at places like Normandy.  Indeed, it seems he was more hurt and angered by orders not to fight than by orders to answer to his subordinate, General Bradley (Karl Malden), who was promoted to Patton's position.  The story for this movie is based on two books, one written by General Bradley himself; the title for this review is a comment Bradley once made about Patton.  In the movie, the relations between Bradley and Patton (George C. Scott) were always good; General Bradley, in the film, saves Patton's life by pushing him out of the way of a runaway ox cart that finally crashed into a parked jeep, a foreshadowing of how Patton was to die a few months later.  Patton died on December 21, 1945 after having been in a coma for 12 days following an automobile accident in Germany when a U.S. army truck crashed into his car.  This dvd has within it a chronology of Patton's entire life, mentioning his exploits in the first world war and his competing in the 1912 Olympics in the modern pentathlon.  He was buried in Hamm in Luxembourg, fitting, in that the people of Luxembourg still regard Patton and his 3rd Army as their liberator.  I love this movie.  I could watch this movie over and over until the real doomsday!  It is biased toward the Four star General Patton somewhat, however, historians seem to agree that he was America's greatest military commander.  There is no adult material in this movie, the \\"F\\" word is not said, however, all of the \\"B\\" word expletives are.  In fact, the first one is said after the 11th or 12th word to come out of Patton's renowned trash mouth at the beginning of the movie, so be forewarned!  Trash mouth aside, I give this movie 5 stars; I give the real Patton 5 stars-FIVE STARS!!!<br /><br />What I loved most about Patton which this movie brings out was his knowledge of history.  He not only studied the past, as Confucius urges (my favorite quote-see my review of Swords, Ships, and Sugar), he lived it and relived it since he firmly believed in reincarnation.  One of my favorite scenes is the one where he makes his driver turn in the wrong direction and leads himself and Bradley to the ruins of Carthage in North Africa.  He has a flashback of what actually transpired, explaining everything that happened there on that battlefield 2000 years ago.  Spooky stuff, and probably explains Bradley's quote, my title for this review.  Was Patton a child of God?  I think so.  If God can give visions and dreams of the future, can he give visions of the past???  Interesting.  (I personally don't believe in reincarnation, it's not in my bible, yet I don't think it's a critical issue).  My favorite reply of Patton's in this movie was his answer to a priest who asked if Patton read the bible he kept byhis bed.  He replies, \\"Ev'ry God d--ned day!!!\\"  Me, too!!! ME TOO!!!<br /><br />The reporters and journalists who swarmed around Patton, particularly after the slapping incident, reminded me so much of the scribes, pharisees, spies, who hounded Jesus, ready to twist and turn around every word that was said to nail him on.  I loved the bible verses that were read while he was walking out to meet the newsies which are from Psalm 63, probably from the English Standard Version.  The last verse, my favorite, reads: But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.replies, \\"Ev'ry God d--ned day!!!\\"  Me, too!!!

B00005OM5L|5.0|I received this review copy several years ago now. That interest has come and gone, affliation with that site has waned.    But I still have not seen a better music DVD. If my house catches fire, I'm taking this DVD with me!    Out of all the DVDs I've got, this one is the pinnacle of production and material.    My admiration for Clapton waned a bit when he diverted to more mainstream music - I am not a big fan of the unplugged series.    However there's no doubt that Clapton is the finest guitarist and musician of our age. He has become that humble legend.    Two songs stand out for me - \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" and \\"Old Love\\". Very few songs draws out emotions in me, these two brings a tear to my eye. He guitar solos are supernatural. I think the audience has a moment of silence when he ends because they are dumbstruck by such a 'GODLIKE' performance. Other guitarists can try to emulate Clapton but they come out looking like they masturbating with a cheap Ibanez.    Played back on a state of the art DTS surround system, it's almost as good as being there. Play it on a rainy day!    I have captured them on CD and play them in my car - it's uplifting, life changing music. I'm certain our grandchildren will be looking at this DVD and they'll stare back in wonder when you say \\"I went to an Eric Clapton concert\\".
B00003CX97|5.0|The first Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929 stipulated many things in regard to treatment of prisoners.  The Japanese signed, yet did not ratify, this convention's stipulations; Lt. Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) continues to bring to the attention of Colonel Saito which stipulations he is violating.  Forced by his command to surrender to the Japanese, Nicholson realizes that he is there to document the prisoners' abuses which he makes all too clear to Colonel Saito.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is somewhat based on a true story, the characters are fictional.  The movie is based on a book published in 1954 by a Frenchman who was an actual POW in S.E. Asia.  There were two bridges built over the river Kwai during WWII, a part of the Death Railway which ran through Thailand into Burma where the Japanese hoped to expand their operations.  This railway did claim thousands of lives due to exhaustion, tropical diseases, malnutrition, sometimes torture as this movie hints at by the shots of many crosses shown marking the graves of soldiers who died in the camp.  Nicholson and his officers are cast into \\"ovens\\" for days on end without food or water.  The medic for the camp goes to Saito pleading for their lives and gets the comment given in the title of this review.  Nicholson is dead set on principles, and somehow manages to outwit Saito, later nearly befriending him.  The clash of the two colonels is comical at times, and, as others have noted, the movie does not realistically depict the sufferings of POWs under the Japanese.  The movie, to me, is a story of survival, honor, and wits on the part of beleaguered POWs.  Whistling while on the march, building this bridge are important actions in maintaining the soldiers' morale.  Escaping the camp, planning to blow up the bridge are others!<br /><br />I saw this film on TV, probably in the very early 70's with my dad, my family's war movie buff.  I've always wanted to whistle a tune like the British soldiers under Nicholson.  I've always remembered this movie.  This movie is such a classic, still so very suspenseful, no matter how many times it's seen.  Recommended!!!I've always remembered this movie.  This movie is such a classic, still so very suspenseful, no matter how many times it's seen.  Recommended!!!
B0000666DW|5.0|Mastodon does it again, this time with their first full length edition cd. Mastodon has a great sound, mixing the technical with the heavy. Every song is worth a head bang at some point. Their drummer is especially talented, and provides a great back drop. The lyrics are good. The vocals sound great for the music, but unfortunatelyt, mastodon focuses heavy on the musicianship and there really aren't enough vocals at times. However, this is highly ignorable because the musicianship is fantastic. All in all, this is a great band, and should be looked into by any fan of the metal genre.
B00012FXAE|5.0|If I could I'd give it 6/5.  This is my favorite movie of all time, and it has been since I was very young.  I saw the first film when I was about 3 or 4 years old.  The Colonial Marine characters in this film may be steriotipical, but they are still extremely beleivable.  This film moves like a rocket at 10x the speed of light.  The Special Edition is also wonderful.  Sometimes I wonder how much $ it cost to film some of the scenes that were never included in the movie.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|They only like movies about people from the 16th century counting match sticks that go on for 3hrs anyway. This movie rules! If you are looking for a really entertaining way to spend a couple of hours I highly recommend this movie. You'll be glad you watched it.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|This reminds me of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin so much.  It's so obviuosly based on a comic book, unlike the first film, which is genualy entertaining.  This movie is Matrix Reloaded vs. Bad Vampire Movie.  If you liked the first movie, you should see this because the 3rd Blade film is coming out soon, and you should probably bridge the gap between this and that.  The ending seems important, but the rest is mind numbing.  It's overly long also.  It drags on from about the middle to the end, despite the various gun firing and fist fighting.
6305622930|5.0|One of the great movies of the 1970's was \\"Patton\\" with an outstanding preformance by George C. Scott.  It was a bit controversial at the time because it was shown to a general public that was seriously divided over the on-going Viet Nam War.  For many, the movie represented a glorification of war while, for others, it represented the power of the individual.  It was a favorite of then-President Nixon (which was another mark against it for some).  What it was for most of us was an excellent historical biography that displayed the best that Hollywood had to offer.   <br /> <br />There was a lot of technical achievement in the film and it won Oscars for Art/Set Direction, Sound, and Editing while losing out to \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" in the category of Special Visual Effects.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of the film was George C. Scott's title role performance.  He vividly portrays a determined, emotional, passionate man whose quick tongue and temper got him as much time in the dog house as in the spot light.  The movie portrays the dilemna of a brilliant general leading a citizen army.  No problem with the troops but they all had families and congressmen who seemed to have better ideas on how to do things.  Patton, the ultimate warrior, died shortly after WWII.  His portrayal in this movie makes one wonder if that wasn't for the best; who could imagine a peacetime Patton after what he had experienced? <br /> <br />\\"Patton\\" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (a relatively obscure Franklin Schaffner), Best Writing (Francis Ford Coppola) and, as no surprize, Best Actor.  George C. Scott actually declined the award although without all the hoopola of Marlon Brando.  Karl Malden gives an excellent preformance in his supporting role as General Omar Bradley. <br /> <br />I hadn't seen this movie in many years until just recently.  Frankly, something about it seemed to have lost a bit of its' luster.  However, I watched it so many times back then that I could practically say the lines along with Scott.  More likely it was because the political and military climate had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.  Oddly, maybe this was a movie that was released at just the right time.
B00008EYA5|3.0|I've seen alot of movies, beleive me.  This movie is worth watching, but it's very immature and predictable.  First off everyone communicates with each other like they're all in high school.  Everyone wants to fight.  Secondly, there are several things about the movie that are predictable.  (Betrayals, bulky hobo concealing guns (duh!))  This is action packed and suspensful towards the end, but don't expect anything intelligent.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I just saw this and then Fahrenhype which shows how so much in this movie is positively untrue. The bin Ladens did not leave when the planes were grounded and they left on their own with no help from the government. Several people who seemed to be interviewed by Michael Moore were interviewed by someone else and had no idea the footage was being used for this movie. They were extremely indignant to think they could be put in a movie without their knowledge. All those who think this is great should watch Fahrenhype and then form an opinion.
0780622553|4.0|Great atmosphere and acting.  Great mood.  I once heard someone say that The Matrix stole from this plot, but that's bogus.  The only thing similar is the false reality.  I'm not sure which movie was better, but they're both worth watching.
B00005RYKV|5.0|I rented this movie not really expecting much of it. When I started to watch it I found the flow of the movie very appealing to me. It is about an exiled Yakuza that goes to america to live with his brother that he sent to college only to find out that his brother is a street thug drug pusher. The movie then follows along how the exiled Yakuza moves his useless brother and worthless friends up in the ranks of the underworld Yakuza style and their eventual fall in a very realistic way. People are saying that the movie is boring but i think they were expecting the wrong things from it. This movie is not really an action movie anyway. It is very real in the sense of the route some people take and the way they end up because of it. I would say rent it and not buy it although it is a very good movie see it for yourself then decide. Yes the movie is not totally action packed and yes it moves along a slower pace but that realism is actually enjoyable to me rather than seeing constant gun battles for no reason or very stupid fight scenes like the crazy 88's in Kill Bill as another reviewer mentioned.
0780624890|4.0|You like guns and vampires?  Well, let me personally invite you to see Blade.  Blade is based on a comic book, but it's not so evident in this film like in some other comic book based action movis.  Blade runs  through vampire dance clubs at night shooting the hell out of vampires and slashing them with his blade (heh...).  It's a cool and fun Sci-Fi/Horror/Comic Book adventure.  Watch out for the old CG effects.

B00012FXB8|4.0|This was David Fincher's first movie, and it's never listed in his fimographies on DVD special features, because he disowned it and walked out on post production.  It's sad.  That's the first event where Fox started to become the controlling greedy machine that it is now.  They do make the best movies, don't get me wrong, but the way they pushed David Fincher around was wrong.  He never had the whole script on the set at one time and a butchered version of the movie was released in theatres in 1992, but now the original vision is available for the first time.  It's the complete version of Alien 3 that was ment to be.  It's too bad about the audio for alot of the deleted scenes though.  The voices are all washed out.  I'm sorry, David Fincher, maybe some day you'll let someone interview you about the movie, because us fans would really like to here it from the director instead of anyone but.
B00064MW6A|4.0|Don't listen to the bad reviews! This movie rocks for three reasons. 1) It's as exciting an adventure movie as Indiana Jones. 2) Halle Berry puts on an awesome performance and shows why all the guys love her. 3) The story isn't completely about a superhero fighting the good fight, but there are some good twists to it. It tells a good story that everyone can get something out of. It's better than any Batman movie. The dialogue is well-written as well. Don't judge the movie until you've seen it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. It turned out better than I thought it would.
B0000057C5|5.0|I was thinking of giving this cd 4 stars but no- it's a five star deserver. This was the first cd I ever heard of them, I heard it at work one day and loved it. My co-worker gave it to me but I really didn't appreciate it until later. I used to only listen to the songs &#34;Engel&#34; and &#34;Du Hast&#34; but then it broke and I had to get it again. Now, with a brand new copy, I am content at last and listen to the whole cd with much love and affection. The first version I had contained two bonus tracks: English versions of &#34;Engel&#34; and &#34;Du Hast&#34; whereas my new cd contains the one bonus track &#34;Stripped&#34;. Let's get started, shall we? <br /> <br />1. Sehnsucht (Longing): Longing is so cruel! You were right when you wrote these lyrics, Till. This starting song of the cd is just so BAM! It's got the perfect amount of energy and umph that every cd needs to capture ones' attention. I loved the mixed in wailing/singing voice in the background. It's just so catchy. Everyone with me now: &#34;Sehnsucht!&#34; &#62;O <br /> <br />2. Engel (Angel): &#34;God knows I don't want to be an angel&#34; states the lyrics during the chorus. This is like, the only song I know where they have a woman singing with them. I wonder what happened off cd between the singers... OH! Sorry. Um, it's a really clever song, I love the whistling that Flake mixed in. Probably a keyboard filter, but you never know. In the english version they had to re-write the lyrics and so I didn't care for it as much. When a band has to change what their song is about to appeal to other people that's just sad. We should all be open to everything. <br /> <br />3: Tier (Beast): The song about the beast that dwells inside every man. Ooooh, catchy and fast with a great opening and chorus. Again great mixing in and FX throughout the song. Clever and smashing. <br /> <br />4: Bestrafe Mich (Punish me): When I first heard this cd I knew nothing about the band and thought that there were two people singing together until I got it again and realized it's just ONE PERSON: Till, one of my idols now-a-days. His vocals here are INCREDIBLE- or incredible enough to sound like two seperate people @_@ This song has great music to it too and altogether it one of the best on the cd. <br /> <br />5: Du Hast (You Have): Not to be confused with the word &#34;Hasst&#34; which means &#34;Hate&#34; This song is a lyrical genious to me (despite the repetetivity). The song is about getting married and has german plays on words in it, so when they did an english version, again they had to re-write it and it lost the impact *cries* It has a beautiful melody and is just marvelous. This song was also what got them reknowned over in america. <br /> <br />6: Buck Dich (Bend Down): Gotta love this song. It's so catchy and though I haven't seen I hear that the live performance is scandalous (laughs evily) It's great and has very good lyrics as well. The music is so cool and again has great mixings on it. Till's speaking is so rythmic its fabulous. <br /> <br />7: Spiel Mit Mir (Play With Me) This song has one of the creepiest melodies I've ever heard. It belongs in some scary movie (they're on a lot of soundtracks, so it probably is somewhere) A song about incest- but it's really good despite that. Really! It's so brooding and foreboding. <br /> <br />8: Klavier (Piano): This is my favorite song on the cd actually. I think I have a habit of liking the odd songs of theirs best. This song is the prettiest on this album and has INCREDIBLE words. It's so touching and poniant. The earnest melody line and double vocals Till does (along with some beautiful deep humming) are spectacular. The song is about a boy watching a girl play the piano and he kills her. It gives me goosebumps listening to this song it's so haunting. The best line is when he says &#34;And when she played I held my breath&#34; giving it this feeling of anticipation and expectance at the same time of turmoil. It's great. <br/> <br />9: Alter Mann (Old Man): This song has some incredible lyrics as well. I love how they can mix their music so that they play mega-heavy guitar riffs but still make it a slow pretty song. You know you're a good musician when you can accomplish this. This song is about learing a lesson from an old man. Toughtful and brilliantly done. You know sometimes I think I compliment this band too much, but they really do a good job with their music! <br /> <br />10: Eifersucht (Jealousy): Ah, no gothic band is complete without writing a song on this topic! This time Jealousy is a cannibalistic cuissine! Hurray! Declaring lines like &#34;I am more handsome; cut up my face&#34; and what not he reduces himself down to a tasty hacked up meal. This song is not for those of weak heart, or else just never read the translations.  <br /> <br />11: Kuss Mich (Fellfrosch) (Kiss Me {Furfrog}) Ah, an interesting song to say the least. It's really got a super catchy chorus and has the strangest sound FX I've ever heard them use,  sounding like a cartoon is playing in the background or something. It's really catchy and has a great piano/techno mixed solo that lasts a few seconds but is really good! This is a good cruising song. I can totally drive in the car jamming to this- which may not be exactly safe, but is enjoyable. <br /> <br />And the optional: <br />12: Stripped: I believe this is a remake actually, but that doesn't make it any less good. It's great- in fact it's the most addictive of their songs I've ever heard. After only listening to it twice I had this song in my head for a week- and so did my sister and brother and they'd only heard it once. It's catchy and the vocals are really cool. So is the keyboards and the guitars on this song. It's really was a good choice to cover, if that's what it is. Another really good techno solo provided by Flake. And TADA! We're finished; it's time to push the repeat button and listen to this cd again- trust me, you'll want to!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|They did a really good job with this.  Worth buying and  <br />watching.
B000003RCY|5.0|One thing that constantly happens in this modern world of wonder and spectacular music is that we hear music from a band we like, so we buy their album and we love it, we cherish it and then we simply just can't get enough. We need more! The only thing to do with a band you like when you have their latest album is to travel backwards across their music evolution and get their earlier cd's. This is always a gamble because the further back you go the rawer the sound and music gets. Thank god that Rammstein was perfect from the start and only got better (how they improved upon perfection is beyond me, I just know that they did). The first album I had of this band was \\"Sehnsucht\\"- which is great- and so I got \\"Mutter\\"- which is better- and so then I had little choice but to get their first album for more. I was blown away by it- what a debut!    1: Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flamen Sehen (Do You Want to See the Bed in Flames?): This is a great opening song for a marvelous cd. I put on this cd thinking the opening track could make or break the the album. It starts off with this catchy distorted guitar rythem and then just gets harder and catchier as it goes. A relief to me.    2: Der Meister (The Master): This song is actually really pretty during the chorus. Till does a great job singing here- but this isn't the prettiest song on the album. Actually this cd contains the prettiest song they've ever made (I think) but it's not this one. This on is super addictive and has smashing bass on it. Gotta love bass....    3: Weisses Fleish (White Flesh): Ooooh the song about... well it's either raping a girl or something along the lines of forcing himself upon her. It's so hard and has this clever warpy guitar solo that leads into a clever drum solo. Very addictive as well.    4: Asche Zu Asche (Ashes to Ashes): Looooove this song. It's so freaking brilliant. It's driving rhythm and clever words. My favorite part is where in the verse Till repeats himself as a whisper in the background, sounding more and more gruff and angsty. Angsty- that's exactly the word for this song. \\"Ich komm wieder!\\"     5: Seemann (Seaman): Okay, THIS is the prettiest song on the cd. One reason I wasn't too scared about getting this album is because I own \\"Lichtspielhaus\\" and saw the videos to this song and the next one after this. They were both really good and so I wanted the album for these to songs alone. I was just pleasantly surprised at how I much I love the whole album. This song is so sad and even more driving than track four- in a more earnest way instead of an angsty way. Till sound so pleasant here when he sings. Not a spoken word in this song- sung from start to end! Great guitar and bass duet too.    6: Du Riechst So Gut (You Smell so Good): This song is the most techno on the cd I think. Not that that's bad at all- infact it has one of my favorite guitar duet/solo's in it. Yes, it sounds like one guitar playing it but let me assure because I play guitar: there are TWO playing that damn thing! It drives me crazy- oh. Sorry, getting off subject. Um, this was I think their most popular single from this album, and if not the albums pics and theme is from it's video. This song was re-released in '98 and has a GREAT music video for that version too.    7: Das Alte Leid (The Old Sorrow) My favorite line in this song is where Till screams out \\"Ich will F******!\\" Which is German for the F word and together means \\"I want to F***!\\". It repeats and goes up higher and higher and higher until fades away.(Eeya! Thanks to Svesteli pointing out that in the background they sing \\"Nie mehr\\" so it does mean \\"I want to **** no more\\" or it can go with the last line \\"Nie mehr, Das Alte Leid\\" or \\"Never again, the old sorrow\\") It's really addictive as well- man if this album was an illegal drug we'd all be in trouble, wouldn't we? It's chorus is a brilliant mixture of being half sung prettily and half spoken (gruffly of course). It's very good.    8: Heirate Mich (Marry Me): Oooooh! LOVE- THIS- SONG. When I saw the live performance of it on my affore mentioned DVD it soon became one of my ultimate favorite songs. This song is about odd grave robbery of a loved one. Marry me? I most thoroughly enjoy the filter on Till's voice during the opening and ending.    9: Herzeleid (Heartache): This is my favorite song on this cd... I don't know why, I mean, it's not the best, but whenever I put this song on I just feel complete. The slowly spoken verses are drilling and the part where he screams out \\"Herzeleid\\" is beautiful to me for some odd reason. Like he really is in pain...     10: Laichzeit (Spawning Time): Ah, the song of raging hormones (I suppose -_-) The lyrics are both disturbing and amusing to this one. Any song that proclaims \\"He loves his dog\\" deserves special note for being different >.>    11. Rammstein: This is a song about an actual accident at the Ramstein (with one \\"m\\") airbase. Lovingly commenting about how brightly the sun shines over the utter chaos. This song is actually very catchy when I stopped and really listened to it. It's the PERFECT finish of this album.    So, there you have it. I'll leave you all with a warning: Get this version here with them all shirtless and with the flower in the background. I unfortunately own a version that has wonderful pictures of their heads on a white background, but inside two of the songs lyrics (\\"Das Alte Leid\\" and \\"Herzeleid\\") are written down in french. I saw this and was like \\"What the heck?!\\" I mean, I'm not french- they don't sing in french- why are these two tracks lyrics in french?! There are lots of sites online with both the german lyrics and the english trans. if your like me and want to get the real GERMAN words. Honestly! So beware the white covered version (onless you don't care).
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a CD very special to me for reasons I'm about to explain. First off, my story about how I got into Christina... During the time she first came out, I was 'musically retarted' and almost never listened to any music. I'm unsure why, but maybe because I saw music in general as lyrically explicit or too much rap; teenybopper music was another form of music I had against, and this was how Christina started out, so I was not a fan from the beginning. After I graduated from HS in 2002, I had just started regularly listening to music, and I was soon listening to decent pop/rock bands like Ace of Base, Smash Mouth, Blink-182, and A*Teens. <br /> <br />Last Thanksgiving 2003, I was remembering how the \\"Dirrty\\" music video had so much media attention when it came out the year before. When I first saw it, I thought of Christina as just a Britney Spears wannabe. I was bored one day around this time and decided just for the heck of it to listen to a 30 sec sample clip at Wal-Mart.com of \\"Dirrty.\\" It turned out to be the most catchy song I had ever heard of and was listening to the full song around 45 minutes daily for two months! After *finally* beginning to grow tired of \\"Dirrty\\", I checked out \\"Beautiful\\" next and loved it, then \\"The Voice Within\\", and finally \\"Can't Hold Us Down.\\" After listeing to those songs in full, it was January 2004 when I decided to purchase her CD, feeling very confident that I will love the rest of the songs and would be worth every cent. And I was very right. <br /> <br />I was reading a recent review here on Amazon about this album by \\"Foxy\\" from, I think, October 12? It was his/her final sentence that inspired me to take the time and write this review. He/she said that this album helped him through hard times, and this is one of the major reasons I find this CD a special treasure to me. My mom has been seriously ill this whole year and was in a major hospital twice for a very long time each time she was there. And I would be there every chance I got when I wasn't working and even during the hardest times there, I would put this CD in my player and it helped make me feel better and kept me entertained through emotionally difficult times. <br /> <br />Another major reason for this CD being my favorite is that it proves that Christina has one of the best singing voices the music business has EVER had. She can do many things with her voices that others can't, especially the high notes. Not only her voice is truly amazing, but her music is, too. She can sing any type of music she wants, and she does exactly that on this album. Here, she does pop, rock, classical, jazz, hip-hop, ballads, slow songs, gospel, you name it!! <br /> <br />Now I understand Christina's music, image, and her life's history, so I can't criticize her like some others do. As mentioned before, I got the CD in January and I am still not tired of it. Though, I AM ready for her next album which she is currently working on now. It's assumed to be 1930s and 40s flavored jazz and soul music, and she's already changed her image from a \\"Dirrty Girl\\" to the Marilyn Monroe type classic-Hollywood style. <br /> <br />Thank you, Christina. Your highly-developed, state-of-the-art CD has influenced my taste in music and you continue to amaze me. Never stop what you are doing.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park was definitely very strange for me. One day a friend brought over Hybrid Theory and popped it into the stereo and I was shocked that I liked it. I never liked metal (or any hard music) or rap, and I'd never been exposed to nu metal. Well I have to say I really like Linkin Park a lot. I haven't heard Hybrid Theory in a long time, and all I can remember from it is One Step Closer, which is probably my favorite LP song ever.    I don't mind the rapping at all when it's done over these kind of beats and guitar riffs. Actually, I am able to get very into it and appreciate it. Mike Shinoda has done awesome. One major factor in me liking LP so much though is Chester's voice. He's just got the voice, he can scream and keep it sounding good. He does awesome scream singing while keeping it melodic. That's rare to come across, in my opinion. (I was never a fan of screaming either) He's just as awesome of a singer when he's singing softly as well. (softly being anything where he's not screaming)    The only dissapointment in this CD really was the short CD length - about 36 minutes I think. I was just kinda mad that they made the CD look bigger than it really is with those two fillers, but Session is a good one, so I don't mind it really.    I like all but three of the songs on this CD (Lying From You, Hit The Floor, and Nobody's Listening). I picked up Meteora instead of Hybrid Theory because I wanted Linkin Park but I wanted to try something I haven't heard before, even though I could barely remember Hybrid Theory. And now after hearing Meteora and hearing LP being way better than I remembered, I have to get my hands on Hybrid Theory. I gave Meteora 4 stars but consider it 4.5
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|i will admit that i have only seen the show 4 times but all 4 times have been great. gilmore girls is a very well put together show and it is alright for teens to watch. im a teenager and i love it. im right there with rory with all the feelings and confusion that teens go through. so all you teens out there youll love it.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I thought they did a outstanding job an this!  there was nothing wrong with this movie.  They couldn't find a better Peter Pan if they searched the whole world. Great Job Jeremy! Hope you do a sequeal.  good luck.
B0002VEXUA|5.0|This DVD is a must have for every Oasis fan. It is an excellet tribute to their best album. It includes every song from Definitely Maybe on DVD Audio, including Sad Song which was previously unreleased in America. They also included a live performance and a documentary for each song. All of the promo videos from this album, both the UK and US versions can be found on this DVD. The extras include all sort of interesting things such as the infamous \\"Wibling Rivalry\\" interview. <br /> <br />The one complaint I have about the DVD is I would have preferred one great concert from that era instead of different shows for each song. It's nice seeing different shows, but there is some varying quality for each one. Plus, the Top Of The Pops performance is mimed which I feel is like a waste of time. However, don't let that stop you from buying this excellent DVD!
B0000714B5|5.0|I am at a loss to understand the one star reviews and most of the negative comments even in those that were more charitable. <br /> <br />In comparing the story as told by the film with that of Hesse's novel, I can only say that upon first reading the book long ago I was surprised and disappointed to find the story of its Siddhartha not that of the historical Siddhartha Gotama, said to have become the Buddha.  I still do not understand that - whether it arose out of a hazy knowledge of the true story on Hesse's part or as a subtle literary or metaphysical device. <br /> <br />On first seeing the film, also long ago, it seemed somewhat flat to me, perhaps reminding me of the disappointment I had upon first reading the book.  Now, thanks to the availability of the DVD, I have just seen it for the second time.  There is depth, breadth and beauty in it I did not appreciate when I first saw it.  I look forward to seeing (and hearing) it again, now whenever I wish. <br /> <br />It is not the story of the Buddha, but it shows much through which he might have passed and, more abstractly, through which any of us might pass.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This movie sucked! What was Universal thinking when they greenlighted this script to be made into a feature film? I understand that a studio needs to make money, but to use the various monster properties in this manner is nothing short of sacrilege to any serious monster movie fan. The film itself, while flashy and indicative of the CGI technology that is available today, lacks any sort of plot, subplot, etc. Yes, Hugh Jackman is a good choice to play the famous vampire hunter. Yes, Kate Beckinsale is a fine choice to play the associate/love interest. No, the \\"Big Three\\" of Universal's stable did not belong together in this abortion of a film (at least not in the manner that they were presented). No, Richard Roxburgh is not a convincing Count Dracula, nor can he act the part (a tree could act the part better). This \\"plot\\" is reminiscent of the 1970 schlock \\"Dracula versus Frankenstein.\\" Dracula, a scientist? Riiiiight. The Wolf Man, a mere pawn in the movie? Sure, of course. The Frankenstein Monster, a verbal, lonely misfit (okay, truer to the Shelley Monster)? Possibly entertaining, but not the film for it to happen. I am glad thay I did not waste the price of a movie ticket, or the price of the DVD. I rented it, and that is money and time that I will never get back.
B000060P79|1.0|This album sucks. All it is people bitchin and moaning about their girlfreinds. Anyone who calls this album punk is an idoit. I'm tired of hearing punk-pop posers on the damen radio and mtv.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I must admit that after the first three listens I walked away after hearing this album in digust over most of the production and in some cases, the song writing.    But as most great records do, time and repeated listens greatly change things.  It was almost like night and day.  After having the disk for four days and thinking how much it is not like Either/Or and how only Twilight seemed to be good, the forth time around depicted something almost entirely different.    When first listening to 'Coast to Coast,' I couldn't get past the incredibly long length and untimely rock action.  Then, I suddenly found it to be quite a briliant opener, certainly grabing your attention.    This sort of revolation took place in almost all the songs.  It seems as if Elliott's message was simply buried under the production and anyone who is capeable of digging to find, listening until it makes sense, will experience the great reward that lies in the majority of the songs.    Only 'Strung Out Again' seems worthless to me now.  Other songs not quite as good are 'Ostrich & Chirping' which as someone said would work better as an into to a track, not a seperate one...somewhere else on the CD like at the beginning of 'Coast to Coast'; also Shooting Star seems a bit annoying not unlike select tracks from XO and Figure 8...simply too much emphasis on the lead guitar and too poppy of production.  Also, the last two tracks are missing a little something.  14, 'Little One' is not unlike the Lennon songs at the tail end of Disk 1 on the White Album.  15, 'A Distorted Reality is Now a Neccesity to Be Free' would benifit from a better mix and production.  The drums are mixed terribly low.  I also think that track 10, 'A Passing Feeling' would be a better suited closer, ending the album on a happier note, just a thought.  But then on secong thought, 'A Distorted Reality...' does contain some of the albums best imagery and ideas; so I don't know if i would like anywhere but at the end.  \\"Shine on me baby, cause it's raining in my heart\\" works pretty well as final comments from Elliott Smith.    My favorite songs would be along the lines of King's Crossing, Twilight, Last Hour, and Memory Lane.  King's Crossing specifically is the one that stands way out.  So much disgust, so much nothingness.  The line \\"I can't prepare for death any more than I already have\\" says it all, about the song, about the album, about Elliott in his last stages.    In general though, since this is Elliott's longest record, it is hard to complain about how much good material is present.  Maybe it would be better if the production was slightly more minimalistic and less experimental but after repeated listens, the songs speak for themselves and the production only adds to them.      A Great CD, one of the ten best this year.  This and the self-titled albums are personal favorites this last document being totally different from the rest of his catelog but still boosting a large number of great songs.  This is highly recommended; just know it takes a few listens to actually make sense and reveal its charm and desperation.  It is the same old Elliott, sad and depressing only this time there seems to be an absence of hope...A Fond Farewell to a friend indeed.  He will be missed.
B000066NW0|1.0|There is one way to describe avril's music crappy.She is also a poser queen. No one over 11 listens to this crap anyway.This album is a discrace.Hopefully the band breaks up so we don't have to listen to anymore.
B000002H97|4.0|This was one of my first real metal albums, and it started me off well. It is Metallica's best album, but it gets old. I would thoroughly recommend this to anyone interesting in getting into the metal genre, but unless you are sheltered from the outside world until pop and hip hop take over everything and metal music is all demolished, you will find much better bands/albums in the genre to listen to.  <br />I rate this album a 3.5-- for being good all-around, but not time-withstanding. <br /> <br />Buy it for a (temporarily) good listen, but don't be scared to look into other metal bands and don't be surprised when you find they are better than Metallica.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Live at Budokan is simply great. The band is in top form and it's a 3 hour tour de force. The show was wonderfully shot and the screens with the images being projected were so much better compared the corny images on the Metropolis DVD. The bonus disc is great also. Especially the old footage of the band waaaaay back in the day when they were still wet behind the ears. Also known as Majesty :-P That was a real treat to see. The documentary was great also. Kind of glad that John Petrucci didn't fall asleep on stage for too long. :-P This is the best live Dream Theater DVD and or CD that i've ever purchased. Go and BUY IT!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Not only should this movie win documentary of the year, it should also win film of the year. The manner in which the film is presented is quite entertaining as well as informative. I suppose it is possible to look at this movie with a negative mindset, and see it as all made up lies, but I can't see how. Even if only 10% of the material about the Bush family is true, it is still enough to deem Dubya unfit for office. However, I believe Moore did his homework, and gives an accurate light on the whole mess with this presidency. I can see this movie being shown in history classes in the near and distant future, as an example of a presidency gone wrong, and the beginning of the biggest mess in the Middle East.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Mark Knopfler is such a pro! So secure in his artistry that he does not have to prove it -- it's just out there. This disk may be best evidence. A fun, sometimes touching, always entertaining collection of songs. In my opinion, true fans who are not just looking for riffs but for good singin' and good playin' will love this disk. I've been a fan for years and have never heard Mark sing better; and good playin' goes without saying if this guys gets anywhere near six strings. God bless Mark for this one!
B0001KL5DA|4.0|The only reason why I started to watch this show was because the first three episodes were free at the public library. And boy, did I get hooked. I loved this show to death-the characters were so rich and fulfilling and colorful and likeable, and the season finale was gripping. When we last left the show, Nate discovered that he had AVM, a brain condition, David came out of the closet, Brenda decided to institutionalize her brother and other half of her life, Billy, Claire's bad-boy boyfriend, Gabriel, robbed a store, and Ruth started a sexual affair with Nokolai, her boss. Now, as we enter the second season, it starts off with a bang, then getts dull, then ends with a big bang. In my opinion, it started off really well for the first four episodes, then it got really dull and tedious, then the last two episodes were amazing. In this season, Nate begins to rethink his life with AVM, Gabriel digs himself further to his grave and takes Claire down with him (God I miss that guy), Ruth begins to get overzealous of her relationship (and go with The Plan), and David ponders his life without Keith. And oh that Brenda. Now, with Billy out of her life, she takes on a hobby-writing a novel. And oh, yeah-cheating on Nate. She used to be really likeable and real in her insecurities (...). And the same goes to Keith-he's getting too confusing and and tough for David. And here's another complaint-too many unnecessary subplots, such as Keith's neice, Taylor-as much as I like her, STAY OUT OF THE FISHER FAMILY! One bright spot is the wonderful Patricia Clarkson as Ruths' bohemian, Joni-Mitchell-playing sister, Sara. She looks like she has a blast playing it. And kudos to the amazing Lili Taylor for playing Lisa, an old friend of Nate's. And just as I thought that I was done with it, it reeled me back in-and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the third season. It's definitaly not the best season, but it's SIX FEET UNDER-just watch it.
B00005JLR8|4.0|Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie: <br />puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)?  Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)?  What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)? <br />Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad. <br />Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy. <br />Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease. <br />In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind.  Isn't that what movie making is all about?  <br />
B00000ADG2|5.0|You know and I can say that some songs on the cd came more to light to me now that I am a little older and have been through some things. The Final Hour is tight, I named my blog after it!
B000002G26|4.0|excelente compilacion; pero... falta un hit para ser completa. se trata de \\"one night love affair\\", un temazo de mediados de los 80's que se obvio en este resumen. la razon?... cosas de los sellos. se deseas lo mas escencial de B. Adams, esta es tu opcion; buen sonido por lo demas tambien.
B000002UB3|5.0|I think D. N Voetberg needs to take his meds.these songs are classics,its not like 50 cent dumbass rapper.This is music!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I've been a fan for a good long time and I haven't yet been dissapointed. This is an amazing album, and if you don't have it and you're a Green Day fan, you're seriously missing out. Now if we could revoke the new fan club that ejected all the members of the original club, we'd be right on track.
B000084T18|1.0|Two words:No Talent <br />Any idiot could make a crappy rap song!And this shows it!
B0001D0FTW|5.0|As everyone else has mentioned, this CD is just spectacular.  I can honestly say that Edguy is one of my favorate bands.  This CD does not include a skip button.  Every song is great.  Personal favorate (which changes daily) is Mysteria.  A great opening track with powerful guitars and fast double bass, blended in with a great chorus.    I have been trying forever to find a band that has a powerful vibrato vocalist in the vein of Bruce Dickenson of Iron Maiden while keeping the \\"castle\\" feeling of power metal to a low, and this band is it. I can't wait till their next release.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not one for Space Opera's, so I was very reluctant to watch it when my husband first brought it home.  My first thought was Great Another Star Trek. I couldn't have been farther from the truth.  This series (in my opinion of course) is more entertaining than Star Trek. <br />Firefly is funny,dark, clever, artistic, great characters, and unusual ideas of the future.  I loved it so much that I was extremely disappointed that Fox cancelled this show, and yet excited to hear they are making a movie. <br />Rarely do you see unique TV shows in the days of reality TV, and I find it sickening that FOX probably replaced this one with another mindless show that is far from reality. <br />I highly recommend.
B0000028RR|5.0|Ahem, there's not much to say really because there are only good things to comment on. Zack de la Rocha is a great rapper, I don't usually like rap but I like Rage. Tom Morrello  is a very imaginative guitarist and I hope it goes well for him in Audioslave. BUY THIS ALBUM if you are a grunge fan, you'll like it 'cos I certainly do. <br /> <br />Cral, age 15
B000001FN3|3.0|Ok. This is tricky, since this review pops up under both the 1975 \\"Gold CD\\" edition AND under the 1987 reissued edition, so I'll talk about both here.    I got to hear the Original '75 version of this album as my first exposure to this material. That was, in my opinion, one of the revolutionary discs of the 20th Century. True, other groups had done orchestral works, and \\"concept\\" albums, notably The Beatles and Pink Floyd, both of whom who Parsons engineered for, among many others. But this disc was of special interest to me personally. Being a fan of Poe, this album was a revelation, and clearly launched Alan's Project to several fantastic albums over the next several years. Would there have been an \\"I, Robot\\" or \\"Pyramid\\" had this disc not preceeded them? The original 1975 album is a brilliant interpretation of some of Poe's most famous works. It's orchestral, it's moody, it's very much an evocative piece.    The '87 reworking of the album has added nothing of note and actually is more distracting, especially if you are familiar with the first version. Inserted are guitar licks that make more noise on the tracks but don't add more meaning or give more substance. And a brief narration by Orson Welles is included, which is interesting, but for me evokes Vincent Price's work on Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" album, so that isn't a positive!     I guess there was money to be made in this tweaked reissue, but for me the original is worth seeking out and getting. Not the newer version.    So take note: I give FIVE stars to the 1975 version; but only Three to the '87 remake.
1591840562|3.0|You just gotta love a guy who keeps re-inventing himself. That's the premise I took when I bought this book. Unfortunately it borrows on old (read: late 1990's) euphemisms mixed in with a bit of new formatting. Sure, the rules for the 'start' have some soundness, but there's just too much re-spun 90's 'if you build it they will come'. Time to wake up and smell the experience, which is what we need more of in this book. A good airplane read, but that's the problem...once you've landed, it's done.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|A lot of people aren't prone to DVD bonus features because they feel that it takes away from the initial movie-going/ watching experience. This DVD reaches above and beyond most others in regards to the bonus features. I wish to focus on one feature, however, and that is the 20th anniversary special showing that occured in LA. In case you are not aware of what I am writing about. John Williams conducted a live score which played while the film was being viewed at the premire of the 20th anniversary showing. Despite that fact that two hours of constant playing is a task in itself, attempting to parallel the score to the actual film footage in front of a live audience is above and beyond the call. Spielberg actually offers the DVD purchaser three versions of the film: the original theatrical release, the 20th re-release (which has a few tweaks to the digital representation of certain words to ET (ultimately making his mouth round out for words spoken)), and the 20th re-release with the live score by John Williams. THe latter is the most breathtaking which, after watching all three, is why I give this film a 5. It reintroduces this film with a brilliantly clean audio presentation. If you enjoyed this film the first time around, it is definitely worth the DVD purchase.
B00005JMH2|5.0|This movie came at a time in my life similar to that moment in Richard Gere's character, John Clark's. A moment when you know you have a good life, a good job, a good family life, but for some inexplicable reason you're not bouncing with joy or overflowing with a zest and zeal for life and living. The routine of day to day living has zapped that inner child's creativity and desire to laugh and live outside the box. <br /> <br />I've not seen the Japanese version. But I love to dance. That's why I came out of our little hometown Bijou theater last evening, with a smile on my face and heart. It's simply one of those 'feel good about life' movies and in a world of chaos, hostility and imposed fear upon the masses, this movie will lift the spirit of any adult who searches for ways to coax the small child within them out to play. <br /> <br />The acting was good, Jennifer L taking a backseat and doing a find job of it, while solid and consistant Susan S convinces you that she too has lost touch with being fully in a viable relationship by hiring a PI to investigate her hubby's sudden departure from their routine. Richard G does a real good job of convincing me that his life has hit a lull, a point where too much comfort and routine brings his spontaneity and lust for life to a stand still. He does a good job of accomplishing what he sets out to do, as far as the dance, and not to give the plot away, succeeds in mastering his life. <br /> <br />Go see it! It's only a few bucks and you won't miss 'em, what with the cost of living these days. Live a little, you'll come away feeling like it was money very well spent. The small crowd in our little theater on opening night all agreed that it was good and worth some good laughs and deepens one's appreciation for the human spirit brought to life again.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Jonathon Demme's 1984 concert film of the Talking Heads was an incredible experience. Sadly, when the original soundtrack was released, it contained only nine of the songs performed. Not only that, but they were entirely out of sequence, completely destroying the original purpose behind David Byrne's conception of the concert. Thank God they released this anniversary edition of the soundtrack, as this really does the film justice. Every song is here, and in its proper place, the way it was meant to be heard.    So, what is the big deal, you ask? Well, picture this. The soundtrack begins with \\"Psycho Killer,\\" one of the first really big hits for the group. Instead of the entire band being onstage, David Byrne walks out with an acoustic guitar and a boom box. He presses PLAY on the box, which cues a drum program to begin playing. So the first song is just David Byrne singing and strumming his guitar, accompanied by pre-recorded percussion. For the next song, \\"Heaven,\\" Byrne is joined onstage by bassist Tina Weymouth. Then Chris Frantz's drumset is wheeled out, and the three of them go into \\"Thank You For Sending Me an Angel.\\" We finally hear some real drumming, not the predictable, computerized beats in \\"Psycho Killer.\\" The album really begins to come alive. Then they go into \\"Found a Job,\\" and things get more interesting. Byrne swaps his acoustic guitar for an electric, and lead guitarist Jerry Harrison comes out, meaning we now have two guitars. By the time the fifth track, \\"Slippery People,\\" is underway, the entire band (including the extra musicians and backup singers) are on the stage, and now things are cooking. What happens over the remaining twelve tracks can only be described as an overload of the senses.    The purpose behind the concert was to provide a unique experience for the concert-goer, to create visual as well as aural art. Some of that sense is lost on the CD listener, but some of it remains. The songs were translated to disk beautifully, so that they still retain just about everything that made them a pleasure to listen to while watching the film. One can almost picture David Byrne running laps around the stage, dancing with the lamp, or wearing the big suit.     The concert resulting in the film and this album was performed shortly after the band released their 1983 album \\"Speaking in Tongues.\\" So, needless to say, many of the songs you will hear are from that album. And I have to say that for each of them, I prefer the live version to the studio version. Each one of them sounds more vibrant, more full of life when performed on the stage. The improvisation on \\"Burning Down the House\\" is as good as it gets. Ditto \\"This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody),\\" which is one of the most beautiful things I've heard, and I don't even like love songs. The studio versions lack that extra energy. Their pulse is just too slow. This is never more true for \\"Life During Wartime,\\" which is actually a song from 1979's \\"Fear of Music.\\" But anyway, this song displays Byrne's tendency to perfectly mismatch music and lyrics. The pulsating beat of club rock flows beneath what I interpret to be a humourously disturbing tale of a country under martial law. The song should not work as well as it does, and yet somehow, they pull it off. Anyway, after hearing the live version of it, I can no longer listen to the studio version. Also noteworthy is the improvisation on \\"Crosseyed and Painless.\\" The intro and the extended guitar solos are just the icing on the cake for that one!    If there is a bad song on this album, it would have to be the interlude by the Tom Tom Club (a solo project of Heads drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth). \\"Genius of Love\\" could have been a great song. The instrumentation is very good. Sadly, it's ruined by Frantz's raucous babbling. He's attempting to be random like David Byrne, but tragically, he's not good at it. Other than that, this album is solid gold. It demonstrates the full potential of live music, and sounds amazing while doing it. Whether you're a fan of the Talking Heads or not, this album belongs in your collection.
0385659806|3.0|Well, I really struggled with commenting on this one.<BR>The examples of Aspie traits are brilliantly conveyed: fear of certain colors, following rigid daily routines, hating to be touched, etc. For the first half of the book, Christopher is quite engaging. Then we come to The Discovery ... downhill from there. I just wasn't buying that knife.<br />Frankly, I was rather shocked that Christopher was seriously (Aspies don't joke - they say what they mean) considering stabbing a certain person, but realized he wouldn't be able to get what he needed from that person at that time if he did. <br />HELLO? He would be more concerned about being locked up forever (either in a hospital or prison) I'd think; he's terrified of crossing the authorities already over a mere &quot;caution&quot;. This incident led me to believe that he is a potential danger-to-himself-and-others. <br />Which leads to ... the subway/tube train incident, where he nearly gets himself killed, then starts ranting about cutting off strangers' fingers (which he has mentioned occasionally) because they show concern for him. <br />I guess I just didn't buy into the premise that he was capable of such violent thoughts, yet had not gotten into more serious trouble than just hitting a classmate and a cop. In the real world, the authorities would never have let someone go who was on the tracks without permission; Christopher would have been taken into custody for it.<br />On a related note, I was troubled that he seemed quite so paranoid? I chalked that up, at least in part, to the Stranger Danger material with which he is inundated at school. <br />Was that was a joke - along with Christopher's hatred of France?<BR>I had given up caring much about him by the very end. I did muster up enough enthusiasm to find hid dad's choice of gift inappropriate given the color scheme.<br />Overall, it seemed as though the author was intent on setting up an Aspie protagonist, which he does fairly well (see above re: knife). It was the plot that was the problem
B00005JLYW|5.0|I only watched this because Drew Barrymore is my favorite actress. Yeah, it's pointless AND relatively plotless, but it's damn fun! The special effects are overdone, but who cares? If you're looking for a meaningful and inspiring film, look elsewhere. The outlandish style is almost mocking the first \\"Angels\\" movie to the point of comedy. It's a thrill ride. The soundtrack is great, especially the tracks from Pink and Nickleback. Besides who wouldn't like watching Drew? Don't be too critical, just enjoy!
0676973760|3.0|I'm not sure what I liked more, the book or the negative reviews. Having spent the last 5 years of my life in undergrad philosophy, Life of Pi didn't offer any new philosophical insights. For those who grasped the point made in the end, it's a rather old argument, but presented in a very colourful story that at first I wasn't able to get into, but then became quite enthralled with.I can't help but wonder if the people who didn't &quot;get it&quot; were distracted when reading. I notice a number of reviews saying the beginning has nothing to do with the middle or end. Not to be vague and blunt, but the beginning is the beginning that leads to the middle and the end. In order to find the significance in the story, simply pay attention to who and what Pi is during his time in India. His devotion to religion and family, the influences of his two friends Kumar and what each represents and the small bits of information into the character of animals and humans.Did the book make me believe in God? Well, no, that would be sort of silly. As someone very non-religious I doubt any book could do that. But I understood its message clearly enough and I even agree with the principle. Especially as its presented in this work, its very moving, something I'm not apt to say often.For the life of me I can't figure the reviews from people who say it has no ending, I'm not sure what more they hoped for, what the thought lacking. I read the ending no less than 6 hours ago, it was clear to me and very appropriate as well. Again, I suspect perhaps some readers were just too distracted or were reading in such a way as to focus only on the hapter at hand without appreciating the whole story as it had been built to that point.In any event, I'd certainly recommend the book. It draws on in some places but more than makes up for it on the whole.Life of Pi was a good story. Not in the sense in that it had plenty of action, lots of violence or contained an exorbitant amount of plot twists but because it contained a very original story, on a setting that has been literarily exhausted over time; the castaway.Despite this, I'm quite surprised that the novel was awarded as much critical acclaim that it has gotten. For a self-toted theological novel, it is quite weak on the religious aspects of Islam, Hinduism and Christianity, of which, I myself am almost totally ignorant of all but the latter. The story didn't show me any insights on the religions themselves or even delve deeply into the finer points each religion in question has, respectively.The bulk of the story, where Pi is adrift, is quite good on the whole. Martel writes in detail almost everything that could possibly effect and affect Pi on his journey and explains how Pi reacts and deals with each situation. It brings a sense of survival that all good castaway stories should have. Yet, at times, I found some of his description confusing. Some of descriptions of the lifeboat and raft interaction were tipsy and left me wondering what it actually was he was writing about.The strongest part of the novel, in which most people should pay close attention to, is the interaction between Pi and Richard Parker. Martel obviously spent a lot of time trying to deal with and plan this relationship throughout the novel and it came off very well in the end. I am not able to say whether or not he accurately portrayed a relationship between different creatures such as these, but his explanations and details were very logical and practical.The novel wasn't difficult to read. The linguistic level of the story wasn't high, there weren't a lot of suggested philosophical points being brought about, you weren't expected to understand adverse emotional troubles between many characters. All the signs of a mainstream novel these days. Despite what many critics and people say, this novel is not the quality of a classic. Yet, Martel may well be on his way to being a fine writer. This, his third novel, is certainly a step up from his previous work, so, keep an eye open for him in the future.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I missed it in the theaters the first time and now it seems I have missed it again. I have watched it so many times that I have every moment memorized. The music is perfect as well and that is what gives a movie its umph! Well written and acted. The actors were chosen perfectly for this movie. Everyone should see this \\"MUST SEE\\" movie.
0783225725|4.0|Having made an impressive debut as a director (as well as actor) in 1971 with PLAY MISTY FOR ME, Clint Eastwood turned his attention back to the genre that made him famous--the Western.  HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER was that movie.  And while it does bear a resemblance to the spaghetti westerns Eastwood made in the 1960s with director Sergio Leone as \\"The Man With No Name\\", it also takes on some chilling supernatural overtones.    Eastwood here is the mysterious title character who rides into the town of Lago, at the foot of the eastern Sierra Nevada at the edge of Mono Lake.  The townsfolk are immediately suspicious of him and scared, and they have every reason to be.  Only a year before, they witnessed their previous sheriff murdered by a trio of ruthless gunmen because the sheriff found out that Lago sat on valuable land owned by the federal government.  Instead of stopping the murder, they allowed it to happen.    But the more often Eastwood's character gets to have his way with the town, the more the people of Lago begin to turn on one another.  When word gets out that the three men (Geoffrey Lewis; Anthony James; Scott Walker) the town hired to kill the sheriff are let out of jail and vow to get revenge on the town, they realize they need Eastwood's help.  But Eastwood doesn't let Lago's residents off so easily.  Having ordered the town decorated blood red and renamed Hell, Eastwood disappears, while the townsfolk cower in fear at the outlaws return.  But the mysterious High Plains Drifter has a surprise for all concerned...    Thanks to a very good screenplay by Ernest Tidyman (SHAFT; THE FRENCH CONNECTION) and Eastwood's directing and acting, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER, despite its occasionally graphic violence and a fairly nasty rape scene involving Eastwood's mysterious stranger and one of the few women (Verna Bloom) in Lago, is one of Eastwood's best films, and one of the best westerns of the 1970s.  Eastwood's charachter may very well be an avenging angel, or even, tantalizingly enough, the ghost of the sheriff who was allowed by the town to be brutally murdered, thus giving the movie a creepy quality akin less to the spaghetti westerns and more to the gothic horror genre.  The psychological tensions in the town are laid out fairly well, and Lewis and his outlaw partners are appropriately nasty.  Billy Curtis' supporting role as the town midget, and the only one sympathetic to Eastwood's cause, is an interesting and offbeat one, and it works.    Eastwood actually filmed HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER on the shores of Mono Lake itself; the whole town of Lago was built from scratch.  With superb cinematography by Bruce Surtees and a haunting score by Dee Barton that echoes Ennio Morricone's scores for Leone, HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is a long way away from the John Wayne school, especially in terms of violence, but it remains an impressive mark on Eastwood's long resume as both actor and director.
B00012QM86|5.0|Nominated for twelve Oscars, it combines fantastic acting from Liam Neeson in the title role, superb direction from Steven Spielberg and the best film music of all time from John Williams. The sequence towards the end when Schindler bursts into tears is bound to have you weeping like a new born. If you haven't seen it yet then do yourself a favour and do so. You'll be treating yourself to one of the most beautiful, brutal and moving films I have ever seen.<br /><br />The acting, directing, and script was all really great! Liam Neeson was the best part about this movie, though. Even though he isn't my favorite actor, he still put on one off the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. He was great! Liam Neeson is one of the best actors ever! The story is really good, too. It's history with meaning, but it still makes a really good movie. If you aren't sure still whether or not to see it, GO SEE IT! I'm telling you it is truly one of the best movies you will ever see!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is the best EVER! It is so stupid and plotless that you can't help but laugh! I know a family from Preston, ID and they say this movie fits the place perfectly. Napoleon is so unique, that you can't try to compare him with other nerds or weirdos. This movie is great because it's also quotable. I find myself impersonating Kip, or throwing out \\"Eat your food you fat lard\\" during dinner. And the next presidential election, I'm voting for Pedro Sanchez. Honestly, this movie isn't for everyone, but if you've ever expierenced life in a dull town, or just find nerds hilarious, you'll love this movie.
B00005JMJG|3.0|I am not sure I am ready to proclaim this as one of the best movies of the year. Not just yet anyways, even though it's right up there. I guess I just wanted more from the ending, which is good but a little unsatisfying. I suppose it's always difficult to bring a fantastic story such as this back down to earth, or maybe I just don't want it to end, but the ending used is uninvolving to me. I am definitely getting it on DVD though, because it's worth having just for the visuals and the performances, and maybe the ending will work better on a second viewing. Even as it is, it's still better than the overrated Lost in Translation.
0064407667|5.0|I just started reading this series. I finished this first book in a few hours, it's really good. I really enjoyed reading this book despite the fact that it's a childrens/teen book and I'm in graduate school working on a Masters, I still enjoyed it like any other fiction. A good story is a good story and Lemony Snicket really did well on this story. <br /> <br />I like the way that vocabulary is introduced and defined throughout the story. For any kids looking to build their vocabulary buy this book. I would suggest this book for all ages. It's a fun series and I'm making my way throught the whole thing.  <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|Buy both to save you $$$$ !!! This epic adventure chronicles a very angry gal. Left for dead, Uma Thurman's character overcomes all odds to revenge her being shot at her own wedding and the loss of her baby. See the blood flow just from Volume 1 itself!!!!! For the conclusion which ties up \\"all\\" and I mean all ties pick up Volume 2 !!! Tarantino at his best shows why he is the top guy in Hollywood !!! If you like action, martial arts, revenge, swordplay, and more then this fits the Bill...LOL
B00005JNEI|4.0|What you think of this provocative documentary is bound to be colored by your opinion of Bush and the Iraq War.  In the interests of full disclosure, here's mine up front:  Bush is a failure as a president as well as a businessman; even if I approved of his domestic policy (which I don't), his hideous legacy in the Middle East, the consequences of which we will be dealing with for decades, would still tip the scales against him. <br /> <br />That said, I enjoyed Michael Moore's expose, even though it is largely preaching to the choir in my case.  Beyond the extent of the links between the Bush clan and prominent Saudi business interests, there was little in this film that was new to me.  Although I basically agree with the points Moore makes, I recognize that he is often unfair in the way he juxtaposes images and uses his commentary to create context.  An example: Moore would have us believe that Bush might very well have been pondering the above-mentioned Saudi links while he sat stunned before Florida schoolchildren following the attacks on the Trade Center, although it seems doubtful to me that he had received enough information to make such connections. <br /> <br />While \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" may not be as \\"fair and balanced\\" as the Fox News Channel (LOL), bear in mind that a documentary has no obligation to be.  Moore's film should be seen as a powerful polemic rather than dispassionate journalism; he cares deeply about his topic, and he is up front about where he stands on the issue.  Much of the criticism of him comes from anger and jealousy that he has touched upon a deep chord of anger toward Bush in this country by those on the right who are not above spinning facts themselves. <br />
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains was conciderd grunge but qnyone who has listened to their music can tell you their not. They are just a killer heavy metal band. This, Dirt is their crowning acheivement, dealing with issues of war, drugs  and self dispare. This is one of the most deppresing and inspiring albums of all time. Layne Staleys drug abuse had reached an all time low while his musical capabilities were at an all time high. Jerry Cantrell was shooting more herion then ever and writing the best songs and playing the best guitar solos of his carear.<br /><br />The album starts off with one of Alice In Chains best songs, 'Them Bones' its a heavy rocker with a great riff and dark lyrics of how they were slowly killing themselfs. The album then rolls into the great 'Damn That River' with a killer riff and solo. 'Rain When I die' is one of the deepest songs on the album with beautiful lyrics. Next is the AIC classic 'Down In A Hole' which went on to become one of AIC biggest hits, and for good reasons its one of their better songs, the lyrics reflect on self pitty and dispare and how Jerry was finding comfprt in his drugs. 'Sickman' is one of the craziest songs on the album with a crazy beat and strange vocals by Layne. Once again the drugs play influence to this song. 'Rooster,' one of Alice In Chains best songs. Rooster is Jerry Cantrells ode to his father who faught in Vietnam and adopted the nickname of you guessed it, Rooster. Next is 'Junkhead' which is the story of a man trying to by some smack, great song. 'Dirt' contains one of Jerry Cantrells best guitar solos, I mean every time I hear it I get chills. Next is 'Godsmack' which is sung by Jerry Cantrell and is about how his addiction to smack has taken over his life and how quick he would have turned his back on God for one more hit, very deep and very good! And yes this is wear Godsmack got their name. 'Hate To feel' is a strange song but very cool. The guitar is great and the lyrics are about not wanting to deal with whats happening around them. 'Angry Chair' was one of ALice In Chains biggest hits, its on the radio all the time its got a super cool riff and just all around feel to it, its one of the best songs Ive ever heard. The last song on the album is the best song Alice In Chains ever recorded and the perfect song to end the album. 'Would?' is one of my all time favorite songs its up there with Estranged by GNR and Dream On by Aerosmith. This was Alice In Chains biggest hit of their carear and for good reason, just listen. This song never gets played on the raio anymore and I dont know why. The albums worth the money for this song alone. I used to think the song would be better if Jerry put a guitar solo over the bridge but then i realized that no because the song is already perfect.<br /><br />Dirt is one of those rare achievments in rock and roll history that no one should miss out one so pick this up as soon as possiable.whats happening around them.

0782008119|5.0|Man this brought back some good memories, as I still listen to alot of what was portrayed in the movie. I want this movie on DVD. Personally, this period of time had a great influence on me, even though I still listened to Black Sabbath and other REAL rock / music bands from the 70's.  Singles was also another movie that had an effect on me like this one and to this day, when I watch Singles, I sorta get that \\"feeling\\", and when you got a movie that does that to you, you got something!!  For such an excellent and most of all entertaining documentary, Hype! deserves to be available in DVD.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I had my doubts before my brother bought this movie and then shot it into the DVD player, but after seeing it, I was speechless. The movie itself is just amazing in the fact that no one has done it before. The tale is also inchanting, as it moves from one part to another. Anyone can watch this and be amazed with the visuals, the music, and the plot. Pick it up and see if you enjoy it, I recommend it!<br /><br />The only downside I could find is if you totally hate anime, then this is not for you.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This CD blew me away in terms of producing.  Man, you can't get beyond a track called Oblivion on this CD!!!!  Very addictive.<BR>Sort of spacey, atmospheric feel.
B000002GKT|5.0|How did I miss this until now? This is an utterly fantastic live record -- at least as good as another live album from that era, Deep Purple's MADE IN JAPAN -- but here there is much more interaction between the band and the American audience.<br /><br />I don't think the band's label has helped -- A&M seems to have forgotten about many of its once-adored groups. And reading through the books, it's clear that Pie lacked a certain amount of consistency, so that their back-catalogue isn't as strong as say, Free's. But on this album -- a double on LP -- everything came together wonderfully.<br /><br />The CD documentation is woefully inadequate, so I still cannot tell you who the bassist or drummer is. But they form a great rhythm section in support of Pete Frampton and the soulful Steve Marriott.<br /><br />\\"Orlright? Orlright? Orlright?\\" is the classic opening dialogue that ultra-cockney Marriott starts with the San Francisco audience. And from that point you're hooked as the band make their way through seven numbers (some of their own, some blues standards), in their loud-then-soft style that gives plenty of space for the crowd to shout back. It's been said that what made Free a great band was the gaps between the notes, but that's even more true of Humble Pie. And as a vocalist Steve Marriott was just as good, if not more impassioned, than Paul Rodgers.<br /><br />The duelling guitars of Marriott and Frampton were highly influential on bands such as Wishbone Ash. And if you listen to Paul Weller's STANLEY ROAD, it's hard to argue that he doesn't owe a tremendous debt to the Pie. And then, of course, there came FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE in 1977, far poppier than FILLMORE and without the soul that this fantastic album overflows with.
B000001ELF|4.0|Great debut from Ace Frehley. 9 tracks are featured on his 1978 Solo and those 9 tracks are:  <br /> <br />#1: \\"Rip it Out\\" Perfect opening song, Ace's Guitar is Smokin' on this tune and Anton Fig's Drumming is MIND BLOWING! 5 stars.  <br /> <br />#2: \\"Speedin' Back to My Baby\\" Good song, catchy lyrics, awesome guitar work. Ace's wife at the time co-wrote this song with Ace. 4 stars.  <br /> <br />#3: \\"Snow Blind\\" My favorite from Ace's Solo. I can NEVER hear this song enough, it's that GREAT! Trust me. 5 stars.  <br /> <br />#4: \\"Ozone\\" Never really cared for this song, it's still cool, just NOT anything special IMO. 3 stars.  <br /> <br />#5: \\"What's on Your Mind\\" Great track with some of Ace's best lyrics, love it! 5 stars.  <br /> <br />#6: \\"New York Groove\\" The biggest hit out of all the KISS Solo's. This song really ROCKS! If you haven't heard the 1980 version from Australia with Eric Carr on Drums then you HAVEN'T lived yet! 5 stars.  <br /> <br />#7: \\"I'm in Need of Love\\" My least favorite from Ace's Solo. I never really have cared for this song. 2 stars.  <br /> <br />#8: \\"Wiped-Out\\" Cool song with cool Drums from Anton, Ace's laugh at the beginning is PRICELESS! 3 stars.  <br /> <br />#9: \\"Fractured Mirror\\" the single GREATEST instrumental OF ALL-TIME!!!! The Church Bells & the Birds churping at the beginning is just BEAUTIFUL! 5 stars.  <br /> <br />I recommend picking up Ace Frehley NOW!!!!
1400032717|5.0|This book is so utterly original, so achingly honest, and so completely outstanding I can't recommend it enough. The central character is someone I will never forget, and the subject matter and craft of the writing did for me what all great art should do: expand your heart and mind. <br />Please buy this wonderful book and then pass it on to others. <br />
B000005J56|2.0|You know what,get over it,if a dedicated cubafile like me is sick of seeing this album since it's concept still here,you need a life,Cuban music has nothing to do with these,be it as it may good preforms,live life Go on ex4plore,grow,if you realy try life outside,even if Castro falls down in national papers ,a list is much more refreashing!!!!
B0002P18GI|5.0|If you have ever experienced being in love with someone who was also your best friend, and the mounting urgency of feeling trapped because it became a &quot;with or without you&quot; agony, then you must see this movie. It portrays things beautifully: would you erase those memories? would you try things again? do you think it was only a matter of time and place, and if things were different when the relationship started then it would actually work out this time? is it the person, or the history with the person, or the environmental factors that determine the success of a relationship?<BR>I highly recommend watching this with someone you love. If you watch it with a bunch of buddies you'll miss the magic of a shared, unspoken thought, and the cuddling afterwards.
B000088E6D|5.0|Buble' has really done it with this collection! <br /> <br />Introduced to me by his role on the television series \\"Las Vegas\\", I purchased his self-titled album and am glad I did. <br />Where have they been hiding him??????? What a voice - so pure and unique and sooooooo soothing.  <br /> <br />His \\"Fever\\" and \\"Moondance\\" are destined to become 'revered' by music fans worldwide......
B000093BDX|4.0|There have been countless Beach Boys compilations ranging from very good (1974's popular Endless Summer collection) to awful (most of the many small-label rehashes). The most recent, official collection, Sounds of Summer - The Very Best of the Beach Boys is somewhere in between. While I agree it is nice to have so many of their classic tunes on one CD, I can't shake the feeling this could've been much, much better. For one thing, many lovely '60s tried and true classics are strangely missing, specifically the sublime beauty of 'The Warmth of the Sun', '409', 'Catch A Wave', 'All Summer Long', among others. Also, it would've been preferable if the songs were sequenced in chronological order. And the inclusion of subpar, smaller hits like their mediocre cover of 'Come Go With Me' and the silly 'Getcha Back' is questionable (Nice to have 'Good Timin'' here, though). So overall, I prefer out-of-print collections like Endless Summer or even the twin '90s collections, Greatest Hits 1 & 2. <br />In search of compiling a true Best of the Beach Boys collection, I burned several important tracks from my CDs onto my computer and sequenced them chronologically, as The Warmth of the Sun - The Best of The Beach Boys, in two seperate volumes. Volume one goes from 1961's debut single 'Surfin'' through 1966's #1 hit 'Good Vibrations', with all the important singles and album tracks in between. Volume two goes from 1967's 'Heroes And Villains' single through 1988's #1 hit 'Kokomo', again with important tracks in between. Both volumes total out to 40 songs apiece, and would be both two-disc sets. To me, they're truly the ultimate Beach Boys compilations, and I wish Capitol Records would do something akin to that. <br />I don't know how much I would recommend Sounds of Summer, but if you do get it, then perhaps it'll lead you to the cream of the Beach Boys' crop - their original albums.
B00005JMUA|1.0|I have long felt deeply insecure about the fact that I don't get why anyone likes Quentin Tarantino's work. I have seen Pulp Fiction several times and pondered what it is that makes it such a roaringly successful cult film.<br /><br />But I can't. And then along comes Kill Bill in two volumes to make me feel even worse. People rave about these movies! But I think they both stink; the second one worse than the first. \\"... breathtakingly cinematic epic\\"? No it's not. \\"... fueled by iconic images\\"? ... of a Kharman Gia's front end driving past a dry south-western landscape? No, not that, either.<br /><br />First of all, a martial arts movie with the original Grasshopper in the central role? How hackneyed is that? And swords? Professional killers use swords? Remember Bruce Lee's comment that if you're worried about self defense, you shouldn't learn Kung Fu, you should buy a gun?<br /><br />And at least with Charlie's Angels we go into the movie knowing it's a farcical exploitaition film; Tarantino has his eyes on philosophy. Yuck.<br /><br />Do not go to see this movie; do not rent the video; and definitely do not buy the poster or the action figure.
0060977264|4.0|Listen to your heart..  These are the themes of this lovely, poetic little book.  A celebration of love and a life-affirming tale.
B0001EFTVA|4.0|even people who are normally leary of anime are likely to enjoy this one. \\"tokyo godfathers\\" tells a charming tale of three homeless people on the streets of tokyo one christmas season. they stumble across a baby and work tirelessly to return the baby to her mother. what unfurls is not a unique sequence of events, but still it is told such skill and warmth that you're impressed with the quality of filmmaking and story telling. we find out about the drag queen's past and why he's out on the street, why the alcoholic is both miserable and excited at the thought of taking care of the baby, and why the teenage girl jumps between disliking the baby and being so determined to see it returned home.<br /><br />the story's complexity works well, only because each plot twist adds to the richness of the story. the complications bring depth to the characters and overall mosaic of characters without bogging it down. the pace is appropriate and moves well. the art captures the story's moments with skill and charm. and finally, the character development itself is as impressive as any well written film with real actors.<br /><br />while it didn't get a large amount of exposure across america, it does have traits that will make it appeal to a broad audience not normally interested in anime. if you're wondering if you should see this one or not and concerned because it's animated, don't worry about it, i think you'll be pleased with what you see.
038572179X|4.0|Dreamy young Briony Tallis allows an impetuous decision to destroy the life of her sister's lover and spends the rest of her life in atonement.  A very well-crafted story about the repercussions of jealous actions and the tremendous weight of regret.
0375422889|4.0|Marjane Satrapi recounts her post-exit tale of free life in Austria, as well as her return to Iran.  The story contains many cliches (Those that are free can't appreciate it...) as well as some insightful experiences of a bicultural individual struggling with an identity crisis.    The writing is very ironic, and I suspect this is by intent.  There are racist comments that are presented as naive ethnocentrism, or darker hatred.  But there's a message there about context...  We are all guilty of this from time to time, blinded by our own cultural views.  This doesn't make it excusable, but it does make it understandable, and the author does not hold herself above us in being guilty.  A less sinister show of irony is in the author's anarchistic friends enjoying the benefits of government holidays.      In the end it stands as an interesting work of \\"What happens next?\\" as well as a biting commentary on both East and West.  It will be a quick and entertaining read for those who read the first novel.  It lacks, however, the power of the original (or the Maus novel to which it's compared), and would not be as solid a stand alone story.  Despite that, I'll read Persepolis 3 when it comes out.
0142004235|5.0|A partially autobiographical tale of Steinbeck's own family, EAST OF EDEN is also a re-telling of the biblical tale of Cain and Abel.  Two brothers' lives split because of an evil and calculating woman who in turn gives birth to two boys who must face up to their past and find their true natures.  One of the finest novels I've read, and one deservedly receiving its just due, at last.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was very young, but I remember liking it even then. But now I really love this movie. One of my favorite movies of all time, right up there with Forrest Gump. This Anniversary Edition is a must have. And thank God it's a 2-Disc Edition, it deserves it. That movie is going to be added to my collection the second it hits the shelves at my work (Blockbuster). The movie it's self is just a really good, emotionally strong, kick-butt flick. It's a really sad movie, but that's what makes the film great. The song \\"Streets of Philadelphia\\" by Bruce Springstien is an awesome song. Overall, this movie gets a '10', 2 thumbs up, and 5 extremely big stars, because it was that gripping.
0571194370|4.0|INTIMACY is a very fun book about the agonies of a man who can't quite bring himself to leave, though he's persuaded himself this is exactly what he wants.  Not a terribly deep book but a good, light read with brains.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne has changed a lot, in my opinion, since \\"Let Go\\".  But I think those changes were made for the better.  Not only do her songs have less cheesy lines in them, but you can tell just by looking at her that she is more mature.  I found this album to be a little depressing because there aren't too many cheerful, upbeat songs like there were on Let Go, but still a cool pop/rock album!  Here are my ratings for each song:    1. Take Me Away-5/5.  This song has a hard rock beat, and is somewhat like \\"Losing Grip\\", the song that started off Let Go.  It is about just wanting to get away from all the pain and suffering being felt inside.    2. Together-4/5.  Avril's vocals in the chorus have a rather annoingly high pitch, but this song is still a good one.  In this song, Avril talks about not feeling \\"together\\" with her boyfriend.     3. Don't Tell Me-5/5.  One of my favorite songs on this album.  It has a rather mature subject, and is not exactly the most appropriate for younger kids.      4. He Wasn't-3/5.  The \\"Sk8r Boi\\" of Under My Skin, \\"He Wasn't\\" is really upbeat, and the lyrics are kind of cheesy in some parts.  In this song, Avril sings about the boy she likes turning out to be someone completely different from what she thought he would be.    5. How Does It Feel-3/5.  This song is slow, but Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.  That's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.  It is about wondering how other people view the world.    6. My Happy Ending-5/5.  Another of my favorites on this album.  It has a great beat, and catchy lyrics.  It is about an \\"UN-Happy Ending\\" with a boy.  Note that there is a kind of big cussword in the part after the first chorus.    7. Nobody's Home-4/5.  I guess this is the song I should be talking about the most, since Amazon won't let you listen to a clip of it on this album.  It is a kind of sad song about a girl who's been misguided, and who is alone and depressed.  The beat is good, and Avril's voice sounds nice.     8. Forgotten-5/5.  This song starts out in an eerie sort of way, then turns into hard rock and loud vocals.  This is yet another of my favorite songs.  It is about, of course, being forgotten and left behind.    9. Who Knows-3/5.  This song has a good beat, and is about making your dreams come true.    10. Fall To Pieces-3/5.  This song is slightly better then \\"Who Knows\\", in my opinion, although it sounds rather similar to it.  It is a love song, and Avril's vocals sound pretty good in it.    11. Freak Out-5/5.  This song sounds like one that would end a really good movie, or be the favorite on the movie soundtrack.  It has a good beat, and catchy lyrics.  I used to not like it, but yes, it is now ANOTHER of my favorite songs on this album.  It is about letting loose.    12. Slipped Away-5/5.  This is a sad song Avril wrote about when her grandpa died.  The beat is nice, though slow, the lyrics are good, and Avril's vocals sound great.  If you're easily depressed/disturbed then you might not like this song, though.    By averaging, I got the overall rating of 4 stars for this album, which is better then the overall rating I got for Let Go.  I would suggest listening to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing, though.
076790592X|3.0|After the buzz about this book finally convinced me to give it a try I was surprised by how little I connected with it.  Though the message is important, and Morrie himself obviously an exceptional human being, the writing style was only mediocre.  I was left feeling somewhat hollow when I finished the book, but it did accomplish its goal of impressing the great character of the title character.  Not the best read, by any means, but still a good lesson in dying with grace.
B000066NW0|3.0|Temporarily \\"Let Go\\" of all the rap, R&B, and upbeat pop, and listen to this pop/rock album full of guitars and high-pitched vocals.  Avril Lavigne writes her own songs, so sometimes certain parts come out sounding kind of cheesy, but most of the time her songs sound really good, and are rather catchy.  Here is how I rate each song on this album:    1. Losing Grip-5/5.  A good rock song where Avril's vocals really suit the music.  It is about being left alone when you need help most.    2. Complicated-4/5.  A catchy song that's not too slow, but not too fast, either.  I might have given it a higher rating if I hadn't listened to it so many times.  It's basically about someone trying to be something they're not.    3. Sk8r Boi-4/5.  An upbeat, feel-good kind of song with great guitars.  It's about a girl judging a boy before she really knows him, then realizing she made the wrong decision later in life.    4. I'm With You-5/5.  A sad, slow song where Avril's vocals sound fantastic.  Note that there is a cussword in the main chorus.  This song is about getting stood up, and having no where to go, and no one to turn to.    5. Mobile-3/5.  A more upbeat song.  It's about Avril traveling around the world on tour, and how it's kind of hard to be away from home so much.    6. Unwanted-5/5.  A hard rock song with awesome guitars, and slightly odd lyrics.  It's about...well...being unwanted.    7. Tomorrow-2/5.  This song is too slow for my liking.  It's about tomorrow being a different day, and how tomorrow things might change.    8. Anything But Ordinary-4/5.  Odd lyrics, but good music and a nice beat.  It's about doing anything to be different, and not wanting to be your average, everyday kind of person.    9. Things I'll Never Say-3/5.  Kind of cheesy-pop lyrics, and a more upbeat sound.  This song is about love, and having trouble getting your feelings out.    10. My World-5/5.  A fun, upbeat song about Avril's life.  The lyrics are a tiny bit cheesy, but still enjoyable.  Note that there is a cussword in one part of the song.    11. Nobody's Fool-3/5.  A kind of slow song about being strong, and not letting others push you around.  There is a cussword in the part of the song after the first chorus.    12. Too Much To Ask-3/5.  This song sounds very similar to the last song.  It's about someone just giving up instead of trying to make things better.    13. Naked-3/5.  Yet another slower song.  In this song, Avril sings about a guy she likes being able to read her mind, and being unable to hide things from him.    By averaging, I got the overall rating of 3 stars.  I personally would rate it 4 1/2 or 5 stars, but that's the way it came out.  I would suggest listening to clips of the songs first before purchasing this album, though.
B000002G60|4.0|Timing must be everything.  Within the same week I picked up this excellent 1996 set at a garage sale, fell in love with the addictive \\"Caramel,\\" and then heard the same song from the trailer of the new Mike Nichols film \\"Closer\\" starring Julia Roberts & Jude Law.  With its samba beat and lyrical imagery, \\"Caramel\\" is a gorgeous track, \\"It won't do to dream of caramel, to think of cinnamon & long for you.\\"  Vega does a terrific job on many of the tracks here including \\"Headshots\\" with Steve Donnelly's haunting electric guitar, \\"He's just a poster, but he's everywhere.  A face under a street lamp ripped & hanging in the air.\\"  \\"Casual Match\\" has a great insistent beat with Vega's haunting half-whispered vocals.  \\"Lolita\\" also percolates with a bopping rhythm track.  \\"Tombstone\\" is another catchy track, \\"I don't need to see the gates of famous men, but I do try to see the kingdom every now & then.\\"  \\"Nine Objects of Desire\\" boasts a number of sterling tracks.  I'll wait to see if \\"Caramel\\" is included in the soundtrack for \\"Closer,\\" but perhaps this set will again get some deserved exposure.  Enjoy!

IT APPEALS TO EVERYONE OF ALL AGES. CHRISTOPHER REEVE'S PERFORMANCE IS SIMPLY OUTSTANDING AND JOHN WILLIAMS' SCORE JUST MAKES YOU GREAT ABOUT THE MOVIE AND THE CHARACTER. THIS FILM REMAINS LOYAL TO THE ORIGINAL STORY. IT STARTS OUT ON THE PLANET KRYPTON WHERE SUPERMAN'S FATHER, JOR-EL,GIVES A WARNING THAT THE PLANET WILL EXPLODE WITHIN 30 DAYS,MAYBE SOONER. THE COUNCIL COMPLETELY IGNORES HIS WARNINGS AND ORDERS HIM TO REMAIN SILENT. BUT JOR-EL WAS NOT ABOUT TO SEE HIS NEWBORN SON DIE WITH THEM,SO HE BUILDS A ROCKETSHIP AND SENDS HIM TO EARTH TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THE MOVIE THEN SHOWS CLARK KENT AS A TEENAGER TRYING TO FIT IN WITH THE OTHER KIDS. BUT BECAUSE OUR SUN GIVES HIM GREAT POWERS, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO DO SO. AFTER HIS EARTHLY FATHER,JONATHAN KENT, DIES OF A HEART ATTACK,A PIECE OF CRYSTAL FROM HIS KRYPTONIAN ROCKETSHIP \\"CALLS\\" TO HIM. HE KNOWS THAT IT IS TIME TO LEAVE HOME,AND HE'S PROBABLY NOT SURE WHY.HE JUST FEELS IT.THE CRYSTAL LEADS HIM TO THE NORTH POLE (I'M ASSUMING IT'S THE NORTH POLE)AND BUILDS HIM A KRYPTONIAN STYLE FORTRESS.THERE, HIS REAL FATHER,JOR-EL,APPEARS BEFORE HIM AND SPENDS THE NEXT 12 YEARS EDUCATING HIM ABOUT THEIR WORLD AND WHO THEY ARE.HE REALIZES THAT HIS CALLING IS TO HELP HUMANITY AND BECOMES SUPERMAN.WHEN HE MOVES TO THE CITY OF METROPOLIS,HE BECOMES A REPORTER FOR THE DAILY PLANET NEWSPAPER,AND BEFRIENDS FELLOW REPORTERS LOIS LANE AND JIMMY OLSEN.IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE LEX LUTHOR,A NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL,ENTERS THE PICTURE.HIS PLAN IS TO TAKE CONTROL OF A COUPLE OF MISSILES AND DESTROY CALIFORNIA.BY DOING THAT, HE HOPES TO BUILD HIS OWN WEST COAST AND MAKE A FORTUNE. SUPERMAN IS THEIR ONLY HOPE TO SAVE CALIFORNIA AND BRING LUTHOR TO JUSTICE,AND HE SUCCEEDS.THIS FILM IS SO MUCH DIFFRENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHERS.THE OTHER FILMS RELY ON GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND EXPECTS US TO JUST ZONE OUT ON EYE CANDY,WITH NOT MUCH OF A STORY. SUPERMAN HAD AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS, THAT STILL HOLD UP TO THIS DAY, AND HAD A STORY JUST AS POWERFUL. A NEW SUPERMAN FILM IS IN THE WORKS, AND IT HAS SOME BIG SHOES TO FILL.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Absolutely wonderul with facts to back it up. Paul J. Thomas, in his harangue review, just proves he is the idiot. We have to get back on a good footing with the world at large and this documentary makes that unquestionably clear. Let's get some new blood in the White House. Kerry is our best chance to heal the wounds through sound diplomacy.
0671027344|5.0|This is by far the best book I've ever read. It's amazingly real and easy to relate to. I've read it 4 times, over and over and it's helped me become true to myself. Everyone should read this book.
038572179X|4.0|McEwan writes in a way that gives the reader a complete understanding of why the characters behave the way they do.  His description in Chapter 7 of Briony thrashing plants on the island, the description of the church and the house, are just extremely good writing. I also liked the way he gave the reader insight to the kind of person Robbie was by describing his room. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but sadly, I could not finish it.  I am a slow reader, and after plowing through Briony's experience as a nurse, I just was stuck and could not continue.  Still, I think it is a superb book, one that is enjoyed more for the reading itself than the story.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Technically, this movie is a blast.  For a geek like myself, it was fun sitting through the sections explaining how the movie got made.  There was the training of the stuntmen (but it conveniently left out the Bulgarians' strike for the extreme condition that they worked in and also the pay packets), how the scenes tied in together even when the location shoots were located at Mexico and Malta, the editing, the sound effects, et cetera.  The behind the scene segment also talked about what we already knew about the hurricane that destroyed the set, the delay due to reconstruction of the Troy fortress and waiting for Brad Pitt's achilles tendon to heel (ironic)?  In terms of the acting, it was good in patches but one couldn't help but notice that the acting was secondary to this grand spectacle when they had to strictly adhere to the structures to make sure that it worked like a clockwork.  Peter O'Toole was faultless in playing Priam and as Brad Pitt said himself, the scene of Priam asking for Hector's body back for a proper burial was the highlight of his career and understandly so.  Eric Bana was charismatic and tremendous as the reluctant and tormented Hector who fought for his beloved country, Troy and his obligation as a Prince and as a protector to his younger brother, Paris.  Brad Pitt was almost always criticised for being too good looking for his role but his presence in this movie was credible.  Sean Bean was faultless playing the king of Ithaca, a pragmatist ruler who mediated between Achilles and Argamenon and sided with the Greek for his country's livelihood.  Then, there was the priestess (an Australian girl whose name had escaped me) and also Achilles' love interest in this movie who stole every scenes that she was into.  Then, there was Brian Cox (reminding me so much of Dennis Hopper on a bad hair day), Orlando Bloom (not another epic movies with his involvement in it - yawn).  All these characters basically tied the whole movie together.  Despite that it's such a visually exciting movie, it is akin to Titanics, devoid of a soul which would make it a modern classics.  This disturbed me.  Perhaps, we all knew that this is a tragedy and in the end, everybody died.  There wasn't a just cause in this story and the massacre of people from both sides were simply senseless especially when we knew that it was all started of the vanity of Paris, falling in love with a married woman when he wasn't supposed to.  I would remember Bravehearts for we have a tendency to vouch for the underdogs especially when we know that  Conqueror was arrogant and devious in their conquest of Scotland.  We would also vouch for mel Gibson's character again in the Patriots for his family was under threat and as a father, he had to do what's necessary not simply to defend his family but also his country.  All of these were something that we would attach our feelings to but for a Greek tragedy that was almost four thousand years old, it's a bit difficult.  Wolgang Petersen wanted to do this movie because he missed his chance in the Gladiators but in the end, Gladiators, to me, scored on the emotional side as we had empathy for someone who had lost everything and to revenge against someone who had wronged him.  Anyhow, if you can overlook the mixture of accents in this movie, having Englishmen, Aussies, American, Bulgarians, Mexicans and if you can also overlook the faithfulness of this movie to the Greek tragedy, this is actually quite an entertainment movie to be shared around!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|So I downloaded this song from this chick who tells me that it is an advanced song from Radioheads new cd \\"Telephasic\\" and after listening to it, Im thinking Radiohead is getting heavy all of a sudden. I was really digging what I was hearing and i see a video for Muse's single and I was taken aback.  This whole time Im thinking Radiohead has done it again, and it was Muse.  \\"Absolution\\" is an amazing disc from beginning to end. There is no doubt that he sounds like Yorke, but there is something more behind his voice and after listening through a couple of times, you realize that Muse has a style all their own. \\"Butterflies & Hurricanes\\" and \\"Sing for Absolution\\" are standout tracks to me, but really, they are all good. Definitely worth picking up on this because if this disc doesnt make them big, the next one will. I saw them for 5 dollars a week ago, so you can still catch them before they hit.
1400031362|4.0|I just finished this book-- I really enjoy these characters, especially Mma Makutsi in this one.  I so enjoy the stories told through these characters... The bits of tradition told through their politeness or rudeness. This book ended a bit abrubtly for my taste... *I think the idea is that you will run out and buy the next book right away if you are not feeling closure from the previous book. Nice strategy ;-). I'm eager to get to the next one :)  side note: I wish I had some \\"Bush Tea\\" to brew up while I read this series. They have tea so often it becomes a very comforting ritual.  Off to make a cup now! :D

B000001DTM|5.0|This album, along with Radiohead's OK computer, sits on a pile of average junk that was the majority of the 90's music. Time has been very kind to this album, argued by many (including myself) to be the bands best work. Varied in texture and emotion, it tells a rough story of two lovers drowning in their relationship. Swirling around this very broad theme is a political and social prophecy of the infomation and tech overload we see today. Bono's lyrics were never better than here, and the band reinvents itself like never before. Everyone knows the popular Even better than the real thing, Mysterious Ways and, of course, One. Really though, the whole album contains the same strength these singles had.  <br /> <br />It's dark, it's emotive, and it's worth your dollar.
1884822312|5.0|I know what I have to do to improve my chess game - examine master games (and even annotating them and them comparing my annotations to GM annotations of the games), study the end game, play tournament length games and then study where my weaknesses were in the game, and so forth.  And of course there is looking at two 'til mate \\"puzzles\\" and trying to discern what the mate is as quickly as possible.  This book provides page after page after page of those puzzles, which is exactly what I wanted.  It also has page after page after page of three until mate puzzles, but that's a bit beyond me currently.  At my skill level, which is pretty low, it takes me anywhere from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to discover the two-until-mate problems in this book.  My median average for solving these is 5 minutes. <br /> <br />I also own the 100 Brilliant Ways to Checkmate book, which is good and compact, but it only has 100 puzzles - this book has thousands of them.  It's just what I wanted.
B000001A9P|5.0|This is CD is an absolute MUST for all of you who must have a certain interest in Stevie if you have scrolled down this page to read this!  <br />I was lucky as can be to witness one of the concerts from the Japanese tour where this CD was recorded. I will never forget this. Having the privilege to hear the wonderfully orchestrated tunes from Songs In The Key Of Life as they were created with lush strings and horns courtesy of the Tokyo Philarmonic Orchestra... Just brilliant. And Stevie was absolutely wonderful. What a voice he still has after all these years. I mean most of the singers voices seem to age after a while and you'll be sitting in the audience with fear when it's time for the high notes that they used to hit years ago. None of this with Stevie. The man has a crystal clear voice and believe me it ain't from studio work over these live tapes. It was just the same the day I was in the concert hall...  <br />You CANNOT Miss this one if you like Stevie's music cos' there is very little chance that you will get the same luck I had... <br />Blaise
0716736241|1.0|I am on amazon right now because I need to find a new textbook that is worth reading for my inorganic chemistry course. This book is garbage, it reads like an encyclopedia that was written by someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out for someone who already knows inorganic chemistry inside and out. I had no idea the book was filled with errors because the book does such a bad job of explaining inorganic chemistry that I don't know what is being talked about most of the time. Avoid this book and if you can name a better inorganic chemistry textbook let me know.
B0001I561E|4.0|Remember the good old days of Walt Disney animation? When favorite childhood fairy tales could magically be brought to life on the silver screen year after year? Well, times have certainly changed and not for the better. The last great effort from the studio, one that would unanimously be declared a classic, would have to be 1994's The Lion King, which went on to be the highest grossing animated film of all time, until recently when both Finding Nemo and Shrek 2 were released. Since then Disney traditional animation hit the skids - Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules - these weren't particularly bad films, they just never quite matched up with the quality, or box office bonanza, that either Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, or The Little Mermaid generated. Sure, the occasional success would come along - Mulan, Tarzan, Lilo & Stitch - but there were also plenty of features, as well intentioned and entertaining as they may be, that failed to even recoup their budgets - Fantasia 2000, The Emperor's New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire - and with computer animation taking off like a rocket in those years, the death knoll for the genre was ringing. Looking back on films such as Aladdin, when traditional animation was king again, it is sad to contemplate the fate and destination that the Walt Disney Company, which pioneered the genre back in 1937, is heading toward today. <br /> <br />The story for Aladdin follows the simple storybook procedures - boy meets girl, boy rescues girl from villain, boy becomes hero and wins the girl, etc. - but does manage to offer interesting twists on what would ordinarily be predictable conventions. A long time ago in the city of Agrabah in what would be the modern Middle-East, a gentle-hearted street urchin names Aladdin finds himself in the midst of an adventure he never could have imagined. It begins when Princess Jasmine, daughter to the Sultan, grows agitated of palace life and her being forced to choose among several suitors, prominent peacock princes, the man the law condemns her to marry by her next birthday. After she escapes one night over the palace walls and receives some much needed help from the street-wise Aladdin, her escapade creates even more trouble when it cause the young boy to be thrown in jail and, supposedly, beheaded. Aladdin, desperate to win the attention of the princess, accepts an offer from a sinister sorcerer to go into the Cave of Wonders, a legendary place filled with immense treasures beyond imagination, in order to retrieve a particular item for him. Jafar, the Sultan's royal advisor, has plans to take from the Cave of Wonders a mysterious lamp which houses a magical genie that grants the owner of the lamp any three wishes he wants - with a few exceptions of course. But when the lamp falls into the hands of the young street rat, things become more complicated and the traitorous advisor has further competition for the throne. Aladdin must now face the truth, both with the princess and himself, in order to set the world straight and save the day.  <br /> <br />The story for Aladdin works brilliantly for what it is, a well executed re-imagining of a classic storybook fairy tale with hilarious performances, enchanting songs, and a clear-cut moral lesson that wraps up everything neatly and cleanly. The better question that should be asked is whether it is predictable - at times, excruciatingly so, but, in the end, does it really matter all that much? Not at all, whether it be the smallest child or the oldest adult viewing this film. Let's face facts here, this is intended to be a children's film, there isn't much any filmmaker can do with this film that isn't going to bland and cookie cutter-ish to someone of the older set. Honestly, forget those people! Aladdin does what it's suppose to do - make us laugh, have in tears (pass the hanky), and lift up emotionally whenever the story demands it to. There isn't a single frame that feels out of place and any animatedfilm that can do that and maintain that credibility for several years deserves all the praise it gets. <br /> <br />The role of Aladdin, voiced eloquently by Scott Weinger, sets the proper tempo for the entire feature and represents a beacon of moral clarity throughout the film without having to be elaborate or over the top in nature to demonstrate that. Yes, it would have nice if the character hadn't been designed as a \\"Tom Cruise-like\\" pretty boy (not to say he should have been ugly but a little more common man-ish would have been better), but beggars can't be choosers, no pun intended. With that aside, the point of living up to your moral standards and not letting external appearances change the person you truly are inside is made crystal clear throughout the film by this emotionally driven hero. This especially hits hard to home for audience members who find themselves with their own \\"princess\\" in mind. Even when everything seems to be wrapped up neatly for Aladdin - Jasmine adores him, the Sultan believes him to be the proper suitor and next sultan, and no problems currently block his way to what he believed was \\"happiness\\" - he can't help but feel morally guilty about the whole situation. He holds it in himself as best he can until he put up with this false charade any longer and goes to tell Jasmine the truth, only to be interrupted by a rather large problem. The point is made though - as the Bible once noted, the truth can set you free, and that should always be a person's best policy no matter what the situation or what it may cost you. The most notable highlight of the film is without a doubt the phenomenal \\"Genie of the Lamp\\"! Right here, direct from the lamp - Thank you! Joking aside - The Genie, voiced brilliantly by well-known comedian Robin Williams, is one of the most vivacious, astonishing, lighthearted, and flat-out memorable characters to blaze the silver screen in a Disney animated film in decades, and possibly for years to come as well. There was a rumor going around that after Robin Williams came in to do the record session for the Genie, the directors of the film were left with nearly sixteen hours worth of material! For anyone who has seen one of his comedy shows, like the one that was presented on HBO not too long ago, this shouldn't come as a surprise. It would wonderful if Disney were to release that material one day but there's serious doubt that would ever happen - Williams has been pretty strict about his role with the film and Disney has been on thin ice with him for several years. <br /> <br />Overall, Aladdin, though seemingly like any other storybook fare, defied conventions and raised the bar when it came to all future animated films from that moment on, which, to this day, has yet to be lived up to. Despite clearly being predictable and often over the top in nature, Aladdin achieves an almost uncertainty in modern cinema, which being able to work those discrepancies to its advantage in creating a purely entertaining feature film for all ages, as the genre began. And it doesn't hurt in the least that certain lessons are picked up from the film along the way, each applying to varying degree of audience members. For example, the film becomes a true wake-up call for all us pathetic saps out there who still fail to grasp the concept of what women want. Women aren't superficial, despite what the Paris Hiltons of the world may make you believe. Many would rather spend the rest of their lives with a poor honest man then a man who relies solely on vain appearances and a relationship built up by lies. Is it pathetic that someone can pick this up from an animated film intended for children? Yes, but wherever one can get helpful advice that works, use it and apply it whenever you can. Honestly, this can be stressed eloquently enough in today's society - Don't waste an opportunity to be with someone when you have it in front of you and be honest if you do follow through with it. As long as you honest with yourself and the person you are with, all the disadvantages in the world can't change the person you truly are inside.

B00005JNJ7|4.0|I must first note that I DID probably laugh harder at Team America than I ever have at any other film.  It's the most juvenile thing you'll ever see, but really hilarious and surprisingly technically sophisticated.  The parody songs in particular are sheer genius.  You may go in expecting to be offended, but as it turns out, it's so omni-offensive that, unless you're particularly uptight, it's difficult to be actually offended by any of it, even things that in any other context you'd find utterly horrifying.  <br /> <br />So why only four stars?  Well, as funny as it was, there were some things that could have been a lot funnier.  Sorry, right-wingers, but the lambasting of liberal ideas was a lot less sophisticated than that of conservative ones.  I don't have a problem with seeing my own beliefs skewered, but Stone and Parker seem to have been struck with a singular lack of creativity in this regard.  Satire has to bear some relation to reality; otherwise, it isn't effective satire, since it's not actually criticizing anything.  Michael Moore as a suicide bomber?  Please.  He's a ripe target for mockery, but that's pretty far off the mark.  I suppose it's probably just that leftist philosophy is less loud and obvious than its right-wing counterpart, but it requires some actual subtlety to mock effectively.  Also, I don't know whether it was just a failure of nerve or if they're carrying water for them or what, but the conspicuous absence of the Bush cabal is disappointing.  Clearly, there was lots of wasted potential for hilarity there.  Finally, although the theory of the three different types of people is funny, you get the distinct impression that Stone and Parker are actually SERIOUS about it, when the fact is, it's pretty moronic as actual sociological analysis. <br /> <br />Still, the positives of this film outweigh the negatives by a great deal.  We could all use a laff or two in these dark times, and Team America provides them in spades. <br /> <br />
B00008BXJG|5.0|til the 90s? the 90s certaintly killed the majority of the bands i love. yea anyways this is an excellent cd. it shows that even though they had 2 different singers, the band remained just as good. i like all their cds from the debut to razors edge. the 2 newer ones just dont have that certain shine. you know the one that can grab the listeners attention <br /> <br />great cd <br />
B0002WYS6S|4.0|My title says it all.  I loved the other DVD releases for Dream Theater, have watched each a good amount, and have listened to all the songs enough times.  The setlist was not to my full preference, but I still liked at least half the songs on the DVD, so that was not a problem as eveyrone has their own song preferences.  I just felt that the songs lacked a certain energy.  Obviously studio recordings are better, but Endless Sacrifice is one of my favorite songs and it seemed both rushed and flat to me.  In the past, the live dvds ive seen contained a lot of live energy, which I did not feel/see on this new dvd.  Also, I have heard complaints about the sound quality, which I agree with.  It is not really that bad, but it could be better.  Overall, buy this DVD still, (got it for 10$ at best buy).  It is worth it, and being the fan that I am, I would have bought it anyways for collecting purposes.  One song I wish they would have had though was The Glass Prison.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Save yourself the cash! <br />This is a massive disappointment. <br />I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time before it was released - I should mention it didn't REALLY get released theatrically in Australia...and obviously for good reason. <br />This is ART at it's most obscure. <br /> <br />Avoid it at all costs.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I read all of the 4 star reviews and raves for this film but was still a little leary of Jim Carrey's ability to pull this off. Well, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind main star may be billed as Jim Carrey, but it's true star is Michael Gondry, the director. This film is best described as an acid trip, a bad case of deja vu and a nightmare rolled into one. The story centers around the relationship between an introverted, lonely man Joel (Jim Carrey) and a spontaneous, vivacious extrovert named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They meet by chance and fall in love and then hit some hard times which leads the impulsive Clementine to have her memories of Joel erased by a company called Lacuna. Once Joel realizes this, he decides to have his memories of Clementine erased from his memory. Much of the duration of the film is spent as the doctor tries to erase Joel's memories of Clementine, while Joel realizes (as the process is going on) that he's made a big mistake. Joel and Clementine try to escape to a part of Joel's brain where they can't be detected so that Joel can keep his precious memories of her. Carrey gives a fantastic understated performance, while Winslet continues to impress with every role she takes. Eternal Sunshine does shine brightly because of the impeccable, flawless direction of Michael Gondry. Simply put, you have never seen another movie like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and you never will after it. This movie will resonate in your brain and haunt you...in a good way. A monumental achievement. Highest Recommendation.
B000003RCY|5.0|The great Teutonic goth/industrial/heavy metal band Rammstein announced themselves loudly to the world with the release of their first studio album \\"Herzeleid\\" (\\"Heartbreak\\").  What an announcement it was, and continues to be.  The band, and their worldwide legions of fans, have not looked back since.<br /><br />The first track, \\"Wollt Ihr das Bett in flammen sehen\\" (\\"Would you like to see the bed in flames\\") not only kicks the album into high gear from the outset, but also vividly stamps Rammstein's inimitable style into the psyche: like hip-hop, it consists largely of simple electronic ostinati laced with sound-effects samples (in this case, lifted from the original Doom game); the lyrics are often not sung so much as forcefully recited.  Unlike most hip-hop, though, the melodies are driven by some (at times, extremely) heavy guitars, drums, and keyboards.  This is solid Industrial Rock, but it's also remarkably street-wise in its use of catchy, danceable grooves, and is even playful in a dark sort of way.  Not that there isn't some anger in there - the song ends with chants of \\"Rammstein!\\", which not only serves to announce the band's name, but also as a rallying cry, as it refers to a tragic plane crash during an air show at the Rammstein U.S. Air Force Base that killed a good many onlookers.  I don't know if the anger is justified, but the music certainly is: it kicks some serious ASS.<br /><br />Barely pausing for breath, the album cranks it up a notch with \\"Der Meister\\" (\\"The Master\\"), which features anarchic lyrics about destruction.  It's faster, grittier, and harder.  The escalation continues with \\"Weisses Fleisch\\" (\\"White Flesh\\") - a combination that prompted many a reactionary critic to assume the band was Fascist.  These people obviously don't listen to much rock-n-roll, and/or have a tin ear for Artistic Irony.  All three songs - especially \\"Der Meister\\" - are works of pure exuberance.  They are dripping with cheerful sarcasm, much as Pink Floyd's thematically similar tracks from \\"The Wall\\" (\\"In The Flesh (reprise)\\", \\"You Better Run\\", and \\"Waiting for the Worms\\").<br /><br />Just when you think it couldn't get more energetic, \\"Asche zu Asche\\" (\\"Ashes to Ashes\\") slips the album into overdrive with its speed-metal revenge fantasy that sounds like it could have come right from the Quake sound track (I've blasted a lot of virtual monsters to this song).<br /><br />The fifth track finally allows the album to relax and breathe with \\"Seeman\\" (\\"Sailor\\") - a remarkably spare and gentle ballad about positive change in the wake of shattering experiences.  It's in this song, with its urgent plea for sanity in the midst of chaos, that one gets a glimpse of Rammstein's motives.  They want to shake things up, yes, but to make life better.  Or at least more fun.  From where I stand, that's pretty much rock-n-roll in a nutshell.<br /><br />The next three songs continue the trend of diversification with a variety of styles that are all, nonetheless, infused with Rammsteiny goodness: \\"Du Riechst so gut\\" (\\"You Smell so Good\\"), another speed-metal tune about obsession; the bluesy \\"Das Alte Leid\\" (\\"The Old Pain\\"); and the black-as-pitch gothic horror-cum-dance tune \\"Heirate Mich\\" (\\"Marry Me\\"), which borrows heavily from Edgar Allen Poe's fixation with dead lovers. But for the German lyrics, it could be a Nine Inch Nails cut. No doubt this is the one Gomez and Morticia Addams play on their anniversary.  As an aside, this particular song, along with the final track, \\"Rammstein\\", was featured prominently (and to deeply chilling effect) in David Lynch's classic film Lost Highway.<br /><br />The title track \\"Herzeleid\\" rips along next, followed by the catchy \\"Laichzeit\\" (\\"Spawning Time\\"), forming a trio of unorthodox love songs bred from an odd mix of wary realism and dark romanticism.<br /><br />The last cut, \\"Rammstein\\", exemplifies another trait of the band's music - a kind of Spartan, poetic obliqueness in the lyrics that mostly leavesthematically similar tracks from \\"The Wall\\" (\\"In The Flesh (reprise)\\", \\"You Better Run\\", and \\"Waiting for the Worms\\"). <br /> <br />Just when you think it couldn't get more energetic, \\"Asche zu Asche\\" (\\"Ashes to Ashes\\") slips the album into overdrive with its speed-metal revenge fantasy that sounds like it could have come right from the Quake sound track (I've blasted a lot of virtual monsters to this song). <br /> <br />The fifth track finally allows the album to relax and breathe with \\"Seeman\\" (\\"Sailor\\") - a remarkably spare and gentle ballad about positive change in the wake of shattering experiences.

As an aside, this particular song, along with the final track, \\"Rammstein\\", was featured prominently (and to deeply chilling effect) in David Lynch's classic film Lost Highway. <br /> <br />The title track \\"Herzeleid\\" rips along next, followed by the catchy \\"Laichzeit\\" (\\"Spawning Time\\"), forming a trio of unorthodox love songs bred from an odd mix of wary realism and dark romanticism.   <br /> <br />The last cut, \\"Rammstein\\", exemplifies another trait of the band's music - a kind of Spartan, poetic obliqueness in the lyrics that mostly leaves them open to interpretation.  Lyricist Till Lindemann has said Rammstein's lyrics often work on three or four levels.  Quite.  On top there is the literal meaning of the words, which dutifully echo the heavy-metal nihilism we expect of a rock band from the former East Germany.  Below is a more philosophical (and, I suspect, politically Libertarian) subtext that speaks a sociological or political message.  Below that is an emotional cross-current of dark irony.  Finally, there is that tongue-in-cheek playfulness I've always sensed in the band's music - the shocking, sophomoric kind of playfulness that has occasionally landed Rammstein in trouble for performing such stunts as the simulated anal sex act during the performance of \\"Bch Dich\\" (\\"Bend Down\\") during the \\"Mutter\\" tour (and which got them arrested in the U.S. for \\"indecency\\").  <br /> <br />All told, a terrific album, let alone first album, for any rock band.
B000286SCO|5.0|I loved this double dvd set.  I felt the approach they took to do the videos, with some bits of them walking around and doing other things was really good.  I liked the Derek Sherinian studio interludes, as well as the Kevin Moore quotes.  The in disc commentary was just hilarious.  When you listen to the actual background commentary done later, its even mroe hilarious to listen to.  The song selections were good as well.  This is a must have for and Dream Theater fan, the Images in Tokyo dvd I feel is worth the 15$ asking price.
0780622553|5.0|It's the rare sci-fi movie that stays with you, years after you first saw it. Most are forgotten within an hour or two. I can't remember a single scene from \\"Independence Day\\", for example, and the Star Wars movies have sort of blurred into each other over time, so they're hard to tell apart. But other movies are still clear in my mind, like \\"Blade Runner\\", or the first \\"Alien\\". \\"Dark City\\" definitely belongs to this second category.    The movie is an odd mix of sci-fi elements and film noir from the 40's. The movie is a visual delight. Like its name suggests, it is dark and atmospheric. It's the kind of movie that draws you in, lets you experience its world on a very physical level. The kind of movie where you want to turn the lights off, pump up the volume, and lose yourself in that little TV screen. The level of detail that director Alex Proyas packed into each scene is stunning. Proyas is known for his attention to visual detail. His more famous (though not half as good) movie \\"The Crow\\" was another example of fanatic attention to detail. Sometimes you just want to hit the pause button for no better reason than to soak in a scene.    Every atmospheric movie requires a good soundtrack, because disconcerting or jarring elements ruin your immersion in the movie. Fortunately, \\"Dark City\\" has an excellent soundtrack. Anita Kelsey's smoky voice is perfect for that noir feel. You may want to buy the movie soundtrack after you have seen this movie. Don't fast-forward through the end credits - there's a longer version of her singing \\"Sway\\" there.    Rufus Sewell is excellent as Jack Murdoch, the amnesiac who wanders through the dark city, trying to figure it out. William Hurt is the perfect 40's style detective. Everything is slightly exaggerated, almost hyper-realistic, like a vision of film noir seen through alien eyes. Which it might be; I'm not going to disclose the plot here. Kiefer Sutherland is the asthmatic psychiatrist who leads Murdoch through the movie. Somepeople have said that he \\"over-acted\\", but I think that's exactly what his role called for. Jennifer Connelly plays Emma, Murdoch's wife. I can't say anything better about her than to plagiarize an earlier reviewer - yummmmm.    If you like science fiction, or if you like immersive, atmospheric movies, buy this one. You will not be disappointed.
B00005UDFZ|5.0|\\"West Side Story\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest musicals of the 20th century! It is also one of my favorite musicals, so much so that I own several different versions of this great work!<br /><br />When I bought Bernstein's own recording (the one this DVD is all about) I was surprised with the sheer beauty and amazing drama that Bernstein is able to extract from his own score several years after he wrote it! The orchestral parts are conducted and played with a mesmerizing authority!<br /><br />This DVD narrates what happened during the recording sessions! It is really interesting to see Bernstein dealing with the orchestra and soloists in order to elicit their best to create this wonderful recording of his very own masterpiece! This DVD eloquently shows the labour required to perform such a deed, and it is a fantastic testimony of the excellence of Bernstein's musicianship and immense talent!<br /><br />If you like Bernstein, this is a document not to be missed! An amazing document indeed!!!

068987474X|4.0|this book is very funny--and very true, so it is like taking a dose of reality with a spoonful of sugar. Women tend to 'love too much', refuse to believe the worst and give the benefit of the doubt, to a potential suitor--or pseudo suitor. He's Just Not that Into You, is like a talk with your worldly wise grandmother, it helps to take an honest look at motive. If a man or a woman likes you, they may come around or allow you to chase them and build up their ego...but if they LOVE you, they do the work TOO--pick up the phone..etc.    It is a good, simple book--simple is good too.

B0002BO0AS|5.0|This album is a great example of what metalcore should sound like. Shredding guitar work by Buz McGrath and Ken Susi. Brutal breakdowns that just make you want to punch something. Mike Justain is an incredible drummer and his skills just blend perfectly with the album. Trevor Phipps voice has improved by a bit and places him on my list of top hardore vocalists. Standout tracks: The great dividers, Black hearts now reign, this lying world, and zombie autopilot.

We do have alot of the fresh meats listed in her recipes year round here in Kentucky.  I fixed one of the venison dishes.  It didn't take me hours in the kitchen and was an incredible recipe.  I admire her taking such great time to share her favorite recipes with us.  There are lots of great holiday recipes that I want to try!
0671027387|3.0|After thoroughly enjoying DaVinci Code, I was anxious to read more of this author's work.  There are interesting twists and turns, with conspiracy after conspiracy. None the less, this book was disappointing. Tedious repetition of the boy and girl adventure theme. Unrealistic predictmant after unrealistic predicament,love triumphing over intelligence and logic. It did not hold my atention and beg me to keep reading. I was relieved when it was finally over.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Having first seen the film I right away fell in love with the music in this Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece: Kill Bill Volume 1. Songs are very carefully chosen and match perfectly the atmosphere of the movie. Don't miss this soundtrack; it's worth listening even if you don't like the film so much.
1573228737|5.0|I've read tons of books over the years, but the only time I ever read anything that had  to do with homosexuality was always over done and unrealistic. This however I could not put down I think i was trying to read this rather than sleep! Although the beginning is a bit slower then usual it grips onto you and you feel it impossible to even put down. Not only was i completely into this book, the ending had such a twist that i was takin completely back by it. Great book all around. Im sure you will love it as well!
068987474X|5.0|Like many out there, I was a bit embarrassed to buy this book and mark myself as one of the legions of desperate single chicks in New York. But hoping for a quick fix, I picked it up anyway, and an hour later, was even more embarrassed. This slim collection of flimsy anecdotes, Cosmo-like quizzes and snarky quips is pretty painless to get through, but won't tell you anything you don't already know unless you're fresh out of a convent or have the self-esteem of a sea slug. And knowing how much my fellow single women were willing to put up with to have male company was just plain depressing. The book did serve a very useful purpose in the end, however. It is the last 'relationship' book I will ever buy. The fact is that there is no white knight out there for a lot of us, and we just have to get over it and get on with life. I put this book down, mailed in that long-delayed donation to the food bank and called to volunteer in city schools later that day. I'm sick of wasting time and energy on a \\"man hunt.\\"  No more chick lit/flix, fashion magazines, craigslist/Nerve personals trolling and \\"Sex in the City\\" reruns.  <br />Congrats, Greg and Liz, you've created a spinster.
0131177052|5.0|This is pragmatic guide to safely dealing with past expediencies, present challenges, and creating a better future in your programs. The catalog of techniques to break dependencies and add unit tests applies whether the legacy code is 10 years old or 10 minutes old. I found many gems I could use immediately in a 15-year old app of over 600K lines of C++.  <br /> <br />The basic ideas and perspectives apply on multiple scales. (method, class, component, and system.) I'd bet that developers who acquire these skills to tease apart legacy code would have great odds of writing new code that doesn't quickly turn into legacy code. I'm humbled by the depth of Michael's insight and fluency with these important issues. While it would be ideal to get mentoring by Michael, in your particular code base, this book is a life perserver while waiting for the budget approval.

She probably didn't evn know that ray charles was blind!! Saying Good Charlotte were the makers of punk, ha, sorry i believe that was The Sex Pistols, ever heard of them, probly not, Sence \\"all the stuff before this sucked\\", and good charlotte isn't even punk, its like poser pop punk, but its ok if u like them, but i mean don't compare them to the good old clasics. And not All not well-known bands are bad, Nirvanna wasn' well known for atleast three years, good charlotte is just one of those bands that are baught, and brag about how they wrote three whole songs on the album. I personally see no possible comparison.   <br /> <br />Now for an actual review of the cd, personally i think its great. I really enjoy Smells Like.. but all their stuff is great. i Really think you should pick it up.
B00006RINF|3.0|The CD starts out great, but rolls downhill from there, because the songs sound too much like the next - structually. I can only listen to sooo many \\"dreamy\\" songs in a row before I'm slamming my head on the desk. I have a 301 disk jukebox player that I usually listen to on \\"random play\\". This is the best way to enjoy Comalies. Each song is strong on its own, but not the entire CD in succession.

B000065VA1|5.0|The album that the querulous at the time saw as Gabriel's \\"sellout\\" has turned out to be amongst his best. Four years after \\"Security\\" Gabriel drastically changed direction and suddenly found himself a household name. If he was competing with his old Genesis bandmate Phil Collins then Gabriel won. \\"So\\" epitomizes quality 1980's pop and still stands up solid today. That and it sold in droves. \\"Sledgehammer\\" clogged the pop airwaves almost as much as its video clogged the then young MTV's playlist. Many new listeners (like myself) had no idea that Gabriel had already notched up almost twenty years in the business. We all told each other \\"Hey! This new guy Gabriel's great!\\"<br /><br />As everyone now knows, \\"So\\" is anything but a blatant grope for success. True, it's more accessible than anything Gabriel previously recorded. But no album containing \\"Red Rain\\", \\"Mercy Street\\", \\"Excellent Birds\\", and \\"We Do What We're Told\\" could ever get subsumed as a mere \\"sellout\\". These songs sit aside some of Gabriel's best ever, particularly \\"Mercy Street\\" (which is probably the closest that \\"So\\" came to \\"Security\\").<br /><br />The hits just kept pouring out of this album. After \\"Sledgehammer\\" conquered pop music \\"Big Time\\" (Gabriel's jab at over confidence and maybe a slam on himself) followed along with \\"In Your Eyes\\" (it was re-released a few times, but the extended live version far outshines the version here), \\"Don't Give Up\\" (even with this big hit people in the States still don't know who Kate Bush is; Poor Kate), and \\"Red Rain\\". One wonders if Gabriel himself was as surprised as anyone by this level of success. The man who once dressed up as a bat for concerts now stood on the pinnacle of the pop scene. It must have felt strange.<br /><br />Once the hype and attention to \\"So\\" petered out (as every big thing does) Gabriel did what any sane person would. He hid. Almost three years later he released a mostly instrumental masterpiece called \\"Passion\\" (the re-worked soundtrack for Scorcese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\"). Fans of \\"So\\" probably didn't know what to think of this one. Longtime Gabriel fans probably recognized the same old Gabriel in this move.<br /><br />The only complaint about the CD reissue is the song order. Why put \\"In Your Eyes\\" after \\"Excellent Birds\\"? Originally it came after \\"That Voice Again\\" and before \\"Mercy Street\\". It sounded good there. This new order also ruins the effect of \\"We Do What We're Told\\", Gabriel's ode to the fascinatingly controversial psychologist Stanley Milgram. What a closer for a pop album. (\\"Excellent Birds\\" was originally listed as a \\"bonus song\\"; it's a re-working of a song co-written for Laurie Anderson's 1984 album \\"Mister Heartbreak\\"). The original song order made more sense. Put it back!<br /><br />Gabriel's popularity still remains strong, but it has never reached the dizzying heights of the \\"So\\" years. Gabriel probably prefers this. He's never been one to hamster fame. Instead, he uses his fame and money to promote music from all over the world (on his \\"Real World \\" label that started not long after \\"So\\"; it features artists rarely heard in the West). What better way to celebrate success than to share it?rack for Scorcese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\"). Fans of \\"So\\" probably didn't know what to think of this one.

B00006JDVV|2.0|\\"Reign of Fire\\" is the worst kind of movie.  It doesn't have the decency to be bad, just mediocre.  You don't leave the theatre discussing how bad it is, you just leave stupefied like you just had a meal from McDonalds.  A recent example of this type of film is \\"King Arthur\\".  The film basically concerns a recent future where a plague of dragons has laid waste to England and a group of survivors led by Christian Bale.  A band of American commandoes led by Matthew McConaughey arrives to assist in the dragonslaying.  No pun intended, sparks fly between the Brits and these interloping Yanks.  This movie is not so much directed but filmed.  The actors here don't embarrass themselves but they don't really distinguish themeselves either.  Ho-hum, the special effects are adequate.  To make matters worse they didn't even bother to obtain the rights to the Johnny Cash song that the title of the movie derives from.  Um...never mind.

B0002234LS|3.0|Johnny Depp and John Turturro are in the filmed version of Stephen King novella, directed by prolific screenwriter David Koepp ('Panic Room' and many, many others).  The unexpected combination of them delivers to a certain degree -- like 3.5 points out of 5 -- but can never really deceive the eye of the viewers who have seen this type of thriller before. <br /> <br />In fact, the greatest part of 'Secret Window' is Johnny Depp's skilled acting as popular writer named Rainey.  One day, while he is living in a remote woodland cabin, trying to write something, a spooky-looking guy with a heavy accent knocks the door, claiming 'You stole my story.'  When this guy, a Mr. Shooter, is played by excellent John Turturro, you know this guy can be very creepy.  And to us avid movie fans, his mannerism is very interesting to see. <br /> <br />But things get worse when Rainey doesn't take him seriously, for apparently this creepy guy's intention seems more than you can take care of, acting like a stalker.  And Rainey has another thing to take care of, like the divorce with his  wife (Maria Bello), or still-ongoing enmity with her new boy-friend (Timothy Hutton).  And the private detective (Charles S. Dutton) is not helpful very much. <br /> <br />The film tries to make the story more and more intense as it goes on, driving the character of Rainey into the metally confusing zone.  But what is most regrettable is, like I said before, everything looks utterly signposted for the viewers accustomed to this genre.  In the first place, the script lacks the central theme that should attract us -- if someone claims you stole a story, all you should do is easy: call your laywer, or disprove the claim by showing the proof, while Rainey is very, very slow to do this.  Moreover, the ending (which is not pleasant to see, I am afraid) wants to be a big surprise while WE KNOW there's gonna be a big surprise, which means, it is not.  In fact, the opening camera that quietly introduces us to theprotagonist lying on the couch (and the camera moves into the reflection of the mirror, and stays in there) is more impressive than the flat ending itself. <br /> <br />Still Johnny Depp is an actor not to be missed, and Turturro too, and Depp's quirky performance (with many detailed small actions) is very entertaining in its own way.  Though Philip Glass's name gives 'class' to this Stephen King film, it is Depp who virtually raised the production a few notches higher than other films based on King. <br /> <br />Enjoy the film as it is; it's a so-so thriller and nothing but that.  But as to Depp's acting, it's another matter.
B00005V9HH|4.0|There is much to recommend \\"The Usual Suspects\\" for.  The film is surehandedly directed by first-timer Bryan Singer.  The cast is uniformly excellent.  The script, that won an Oscar, keeps you guessing until the very end.  What I'm not certain of is whether this film meets the status as a modern day classic.  It is certainly one of the more ambitious films in recent memory.  In my mind, though, it may be a little to slick for it's own good and it wraps things up a little too tidy.  That said, this film has a rabid partisan following that is understandable and I recommend this film to those who haven't seen it and let them judge it for themselves.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|One of the most incredible musical recordings in history.  I've always liked the Beatles, but I would never consider myself a rabid fan like some people.  But when you hear an album like this, you understand why they are musical genius', not just pop artists from the past.
B000059HB7|4.0|There are two types of John Wayne westerns.  There are those in which he plays a complex character(\\"The Searchers\\",\\"Red River\\") and those where he slips comfortably into his Duke persona, the swaggering, confident, righteous western type who wears the white hat(most of the product he put out in the sixties).  This film falls into the category of a \\"Duke\\" film.  That is not to say that this film is not vastly entertaining.  It just doesn't rank, in my mind, as a classic John Wayne film.  The basic plot involves a planned jailbreak of a murderer and Sheriff Wayne's lone support is an alcoholic deputy(Dean Martin), a gabby old coot(Walter Brennan) and a cocky sharpshooter(Ricky Nelson).  Through the course of the film Dino gets the DTs and Ricky sings a song.  Also, we have potential love interest between Duke and a woman with a past played by Angie Dickinson.  There is never a doubt how things are going to turn out here but it is a fun film nevertheless.  Interestingly, director Howard Hawks remade this film in 1967 with Wayne and Robert Mitchum as \\"El Dorado\\" which I think is better but does not negate \\"Rio Bravo\\".  On a note of trivia, director Martin Scorsese has long been on record as being a fan of the westerns of John Wayne, John Ford, and Howard Hawks.  In his feature debut, \\"Who's That Knocking On My Door\\" he prominently features a poster of \\"Rio Bravo\\".
1401300901|3.0|i bought this book on impulse bec just by looking at the title i kind of like it already... and to my utter disbelief it did not prove me wrong.. i really like it and and it was so funny that i could not help but laugh visibly i really did not care at that time if others would see me bec. i want them to ask me about the book so that i could recommend it... but towards the end i am not quite impressed w/it bec. it did not matched w/the way the story goes.. i would have been perfectly happy if the story started w/gerry still alive i would be the first one to absolutely accept the ending but the story started w/gerry already out of the picture so, i was really not so attached w/gerry in the first place that is why i thought the ending would be quite different...but all in all the book was really good and i would love to recommend it to someone.. especially that people do have a different view of things so it would be different for them as it is for me...
0767840135|3.0|The lighting was very strong and good. The costumes were great. The music was great. John Gilkey is very annoying and far from funny. He plays the character in the blue coat and jacket with the bald head called \\"John.\\" He is just goofy and makes annoying faces. In one of the scenes where you're just getting into the music, John screams like a maniac. I hated that scene. The girl's (Zoe's) voice is nice, but the lyrics are just made of a bunch of annoying \\"Sooo\\" and \\"scoo\\" and \\"voo\\" and koo\\" sounds, unlike other shows, like Mystere, which have haunting lyrics. There are a lot of acts in this show, which makes it go by very slowly. Each act makes the show look like it's going to end, but it isn't. I felt very bored after the first couple of acts. The clowns are not funny at all. They just run around and say \\"Hey \\" \\"Woah\\" and \\"Bravo.\\"
0671027387|4.0|In this sci-fi/action thriller, Deception Point, the main storyline revolves around an upcoming presidential election, in which two candidates are neck-and-neck in the polls.  One candidate is President Zach Herney, who is hoping for a second term in the Oval Office.  His main rival is Sentor Sedgewick Sexton, who has been pulling slightly ahead of Herney because of his very effective attack against the president's distibution of money to government organizations.  Sexton attacks NASA, in particular, and it has the people questioning the views of Zach Herney, and that organization happens to be NASA.  As the Senator continues his attack, his daughter, Rachel Sexton, has been invited to have a private talk with the president himself.  What she learns from this experience is something that could easily secure another four years for Herney, though, once she learns the truth, Rachel finds herself fighting to survive.<br /><br />I found this story to be very clever and rather convincing.  Dan Brown does a great job of making the story fly by quickly, but does so without sacrificing the storyline.  When something scientific or technological is being explained, Brown converts what would be a complicated explination into a shorter, yet detailed, description.  I am glad he did this because, not only does it keep the story moving at a decent pace, but it allows those of us who aren't science buffs to still understand the basics of the issue being discussed.  I would also like to congratulate Brown for his means of keeping a secret from the reader.  He would often only write enough of a conversation to make the reader wonder, though, sometimes it can be a somewhat simple task to guess the truth.  I don't want to spoil it for you, but I found the ending to be a little corny.  Other than that, this is a great book for people who like political scandal, trying to survive against unbeatable odds, or multiple plot twists.  I suggest that if you haven't read this book already, you should check it out.should check it out.
B00008EY7H|5.0|All of the acts are in the DVD, except for \\"Handbalancing\\" which was not in the show very often back in 2001. This show is the best Cirque du Soleil touring show. Francesca Gagnon, the singer on the AlegriA CD, is in the DVD too. This makes it even better. The show is filled with beautiful emotion, from laughter, to moments that bring you an inch away from tears. After seeing the show, you feel a beautiful sense of loving life and you feel very inspired.
B0000YWKHC|1.0|Before coming online to see if anyone else agreed, my first reaction when this movie ended (along with my desire for a coffee jolt) - was that this felt like &quot;Indie For Dummies&quot; It was a nice starter film for those who don't get out much. <br />I've heard people say it changed their lives, it inspired them, it moved them in ways they had never been moved...<br />Hopefully it changed your life by proving there is more out there than regular big-budget fare, it inspired you by making you want to go see better movies (or even writing one!), and it moved you off the couch as you just realized that watching paint, that has been dry for years, just sit there on the wall is more enthralling than the film you just sat through.<br />I kid... I kid... <br />But really - I've never seen so many people so moved by watching boredom ensue on screen in my life. Are you all the same zombies I see on the subway each morning? This is starting to make some sense now... (Get out! live a little! Life doesn't have to be this mundane! yeesh)
B00005OOQ5|4.0|You have to remember that this was not filmed for DVD. This show was filmed for VHS and was released first on VHS in 1991. So that's why it looks kind of dark and has not that many angles. The show is excellent. An earlier review mentioned there being a \\"high bar\\" act in this show, but there isn't. This DVD is great to have because this show is no longer performed live. All of the music from the great CD is in this live recording. I had seen \\"Nouvelle Experience\\" live, three times and this is the best version of it.  <br />

Now  I am 26 and have have children We watch this movie at least once a year and it does not have to be Christmas. Even my 2 year old sits and watches this movie for a while and that says alot since 2 year olds do not have a long attention spans. It is so good that I have been looking for it to add to our collection! I was so excited when I found this movie. A wonderfully done magical movie to watch for years to come!
B00005JNEI|4.0|`Propaganda film' isn't meant as an insult. It just acknowledges that this film neither attempts nor pretends to be even handed. Given the preponderant ideological direction of much mainstream, especially US, media, that's no bad thing. But it is indeed hit and miss. I found it hard to work out much outrage about the cosiness of the Bushes with the Saudis being a matter of concern, not just in the general way cosiness of American leaders with plenty regimes around the place with shocking human rights records is, but specifically because many of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudis. Without further argument, that seems beside the point, given that we know Al Qaeda would love nothing more than to overthrow the Saudi government. And we're far from above Moore's often irritating love of silly gimmicks. Reading the Patriot Act to Congress from a megaphone on a van outside didn't really get us very far. Nor did the silly asking congressmen to enlist their kids gimmick. (I think the US is still enough of a free country that it's left up to kids to enlist themselves and their parents can't do it for them.)  <br /> <br />So much for the prosecution. If that was the stuff to dislike there was plenty to like. Lila Lipscombe's account of her soldier son's death was extremely moving. Footage of a US soldier describing how they went into battle to the strains of Bloodhound Gang's `Fire Water Burn'  was intensely disturbing. Britney Spears was, oh dear, well, as the credits might say, herself. And Bush. Well, here there's really no answer to Moore's case. When Senator Kerry tells you Bush is costing you respect overseas, my dear American friends, do please believe him. Over in Europe we are scratching our heads trying to figure out how such a great country ever came to elect (well, ok, in a manner of speaking, elect) such an outrageous moral and intellectual pygmy as its leader. Please do us all - and yourselves - a huge favour come 2nd November and kick this sorry embarrassment out ofoffice.  <br />
B000006FH5|5.0|I loved this movie; it was excellent in every way. I also really enjoyed the second one -- it was very, very good. (I never saw the next two sequels, but from what I understand they weren't too good.) <br /> <br />I have not seen either movie since seeing them in the movie theatre when they first came out. I thought of them when I heard Mr. Reeve died. He fought the good fight, and I thought his great attitude in the face of such adversity was very, very inspiring. You truly were a superman, Mr. Reeve, and you will be remembered for a long, long time.
B0002TT0NW|2.0|Dear dear me so Azkaban while still a major success is not doing as well as the two Chis Columbus movies. Surprise!surprise! The public loved the first two movies so what does the Brothers Warner do but give them a re-imagined third movie. What is wrong with a sequel that actually looks like it belongs to the same universe as the previous movies? My thoughts on Azkaban the movie. Well the beginning was fine with Harry and the Dursleys and Aunt Marge. Unfortunately after that it went down hill. Here I was looking forward to seeing the Knight Bus and having streetlights jumping out of the way and then back again, what I got was one good scene when the bus squeezes between two London Double-deckers and a really stupid an unfunny talking shrunken head. What a missed opportunity. Then behold the Leaky Cauldron shows up with yet another Cuaron re-imagining, the ancient Inn has just now decided to get itself a new sign and Tom the Innkeeper looks like a victim of a very bad Wand backfiring accident. I kept on expecting him to say \\"the bells the bells!\\" Then we got to a good bit with the first appearance of a Dementor on the Hogwarts Express, this I did like. Oh dear then we get to Hogwarts, people have the nerve to criticize Chris Columbus for not being realistic, but see nothing wrong with Alfonso Cuaron turning Hogwarts into a dark colourless parody of itself, this is more like Durmstrang that Hogwarts. Why have the school grounds been rearranged, where did the bridge and clock tower come from? Why is Hagrid's Hut in a new location, who moved the Whomping Willow, why has the Whomping Willow been changed? What happened to the Gryffindor Tower entrance and the Fat Lady? Where did professor Flitwick go who is this small young looking guy? Even a magic school could not have changed so much in only a few months. The Hogwarts school uniforms have been re-imagined as have the Quidditch uniform. Cuaron must have thought that having the same uniform for three movies in a row would be too much for people's short attention span. Not only that but everyone has become sloppy and scruffy, no neat tidy students from an old-fashioned school for Cuaron but scruffy thugs from a nice modern school. Yes pupils even from posh schools will have their shirts hanging out and ties undone in their free time but not during classes. You lose any sense of history and any class, Hogwarts becomes Dumbwarts. I did like the DADA class and the actor who played Lupin, when I first heard of the casting I was against the actor but I have to admit he was superb. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of Sir Michael Gambon the new Dumbledore, I know this is one change that was not Cuaron's fault but did they have to make him a hippy? I can't fault Buckbeak he was wonderful, one of the few movie highlights. Now we get to the modern clothing, take a good look at all the students going off to Hogsmeade. They all look completely normal, just regular teenagers visiting their regular town shopping centre, I almost expected to see some of them smoking or drinking alcohol secretly behind corners. the problem is they are not normal teenagers and they are not visiting a normal shopping centre. Previous movies had everyone dressed in cloaks, robes and other eccentric clothing when visiting Diagon Alley thus giving the movies their charm but Cuaron seems to have ignored this. Then we get to the big action scene when Harry produces his Patronus, what a let down, where is the glowing Stag attacking Dementors? What we get is an obscure stag shape and some sort of stupid energy field driving them away, awful. Then the final scene between Harry and Lupin, which failed to explain anything, no explanation of the Marauders or the reason why Harry's Patronus is a stag. Five more minutes added to a movie that was already shorter than the previous movies, Cuaron couldn't give us five more minutes. I watched the first movie 7 times at the cinema and the second 6 times with POA I could only manage 2 times. I really hope Newell is better.  <br />  <br />
B00005JMXX|1.0|I was really looking forward to see the extras that the label promises.  The label indicates that there is over an hour of \\"making of\\" featurettes.  Do not believe it.  What it has is a bunch of links to featurettes that take hours to download.  Until we have multi-gigabit-per-second pipes to the home (which means Internet connections over 1000 times faster than DSL or cable), the so-called DVD-ROM extras are useless.
B0002SROT0|5.0|As a solid fan of Elliot Smith's music, I am both happy and sad that this recording has been released. I'm glad that there is more of his music available to enjoy, but I'm also saddened that such a sensitive soul has moved on from this world and the beauty of this most recent release is a new reminder of that. There are a few places on the disk that are reminiscent of previous tunes, but by and large, previous fans will be pleased with the new approaches. I'm relieved that this posthumous release is NOT your typical patchwork of unfinished mixes, so common in the Hendrix releases. Instead it is another example of the high standard and consistency of his creativity and is a fitting farewell offering from one of the best songwriters of our time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This was the second CD I bought from Linkin Park. I was only a so so fan after owning the first CD, but after I saw the music video for numb I really wanted to get that song. So I bought this just for that song, but was really surprised by the rest of the songs, this is definately a great mix of styles. <br /> <br />Dont Stay is a great song to start this off, I really liked the music and beat. I think this is one of the better ones. \\"Forget our memories, forget our possibilities!\\" <br /> <br />Faint is a great song, one of my top three favorites. The rap session is this is awesome. The chorus is one of the best, definately cool to listen to on a rainy day! Gives it even more of a cool setting. <br /> <br />Breaking the Habbit is one of the top two on this, really soft at the beginning with a cool techno, rap type music to it. Really nice how only one guy is singing in this one, not that I dont like the others.  <br /> <br />Numb - my opinion, the best there is on here, just my own opinion. I like how the music just seemed to capture me into it. \\"I've become so numb, I cant feel you there!\\" Really catchy lyrics in here that are hard to get tired of. Believe me, after all the times i listened to it, and I still like it as much as the first time I heard it. <br /> <br />The other songs are great, but I just didn't list them because I liked these a little better than them. You might find one of them to be your favorite. <br /> <br />This is a great CD, and it caused me to be an even bigger fan of Linkin Park after purchasing it. And to think i bought it just for one song at first!
0739313118|1.0|What worries me most about this book is that there are kids out there reading it whose minds are not yet able to distinguish between a good yarn and the truth. Brown takes a whole page at the beginning to state that the book is based on historical facts yet he makes no effort to credit documentation of these &quot;facts&quot;.  All in all, this book promotes anger and potential hatred towards the church and its Bible while ignoring the fact that the Bible itself is an historical document as well as a story about Christ's love for mankind.  History is full of blunders perpetrated by man - the Crusades are a testament to this - yet the Bible should not take a beating because of the capability of man to make disastrous errors in judgement.  Brown's book is a work of fiction designed to appeal to a growing feminist movement. There is danger in being too open-minded - believe me it is your right to choose what to be close-minded about.  Anyone who takes this book seriously has a weak faith (if any) to begin with and will be even more confused the next time a book of this nature comes out with a new take on history.
B000002KIE|5.0|Ok. There's a lot of misinformation here so I'll try to help. First of all, about the Sex Pistols. People, the Sex Pistols aren't the grandfathers of Punk. The world and people will tell you that they are until the day you die but still. The Sex Pistols aren't the grandfathers of Punk. Punk was created before the Sex Pistols. The band was assembled to make a big hit. How do you explain that back in the day they were so popular? Punk bands aren't that popular. The Sex Pistols were. People think they couldn't play their instruments but that's not true either. The drummer did just fine. The guitarist Jones was ok (And he also played the bass in most of the recording).  <br />Now don't get me wrong. This guys were crazy for real. Sid Vicious (Who DIDN'T play in most of the songs you have in this CD)was indeed a crazy guy and he wasn't fake. This guys acted like morons in public. The label hired them because of that. This guy called Malcom McLaren was trying to create a fashion (He had a bondage store) and he hired a bunch of crazy guys (The Sex Pistols) to help him out. He told them to write a song. The thing is, the crazy guys he hired happened to be really talented writing songs. They were told to write a song about submission and well, they wrote \\"Submission\\" (duh). Everything got out of control and the Sex Pistols ended as icons instead of helpers of a bondage store. This guys were a commercial band. Yes, they were crazy as hell and they wrote their stuff (Except some lyrics) but they weren't the creators of Punk. <br /> You always hear \\"Good Charlotte is fake man, The Sex Pistols are the real deal\\". That's true but The Sex Pistols aren't the \\"grandfathers\\" of Punk. Neither is \\"The Clash\\" that were a really good band too but that had only 1 Punk album. The rest are albums in which they incorporated different types of music. So I think is good to set the record straight about the Sex Pistols and The Clash.  <br /> <br />Now, the music of this album is actually slow.Punk Rock is supposed to be faster. This music is slower. That's not actually a bad thing anyway. I mean, like it or not, this is a great album. The fact that this band was \\"manufactured\\" doesn't mean the album is bad. Is really good. Creative as hell. 5 star album. No doubt about it. <br />This is  great album but if you really want to hear good Punk Rock, I suggest you to get some Ramones and Bad Religion albums (You probably have them anyway).Not the creators, but still great.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a simply incredible movie- the acting by Justin Theroux and especially Naomi Watts is perfect, the music by Angelo Badalamenti is beautiful, and the direction by David Lynch is haunting. I can't recommend this film enough for fans of well-made film noir. However, the dvd itself is crappy. The 'extras' are a joke and you can't even skip through the movie unless you fast forward the 'old-fashioned way.' Why Lynch or the studio even bothered to release this film on dvd is beyond me, they may as well have just stuck to the VHS format if they weren't going to take advantage of all that dvd has to offer. This rating applies to the dvd format ONLY, not to the film itself.
B00005LB9O|5.0|This has got to be one one of the best albums I own...period.  I think it's the best Travis album also-although all of them are excellent.  Get this and see why Coldplay is second fiddle to Travis.
B000001GQT|5.0|While the fill-ups---TILL EULENSPIEGEL'S MERRY PRANKS, DON JUAN, and the \\"Dance of the Seven Veils\\" from the opera SALOME---are well done (TILL, especially, leads up to an electrifying climax), this disc is worth hearing simply for this classic 1974 recording of ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA. This work, with its famous opening Introduction, might not be Strauss at his most substantial (its supposedly Nitzschean inspiration doesn't really mean anything in the long run), but it is still music of great beauty, and the Berlin Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan masterfully bring out its lushness, with its creamy strings and powerful brass. Karajan also binds the disparate sections of this work together like few others with the kind of structural shrewdness that he was known for. ALSO SPRACH ZARATHUSTRA might not be great Strauss, but this ZARATHUSTRA is surely a great performance. Those who think that the awesome \\"Sunrise\\" introduction to the piece---made famous by film director Stanley Kubrick's use of it in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY---is the only real highlight of this work will certainly rethink that assessment after hearing it, so powerfully played and authoritatively conducted it is here. Recommended.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Well, best of the decade SO FAR, but my point still stands. This album is magnificent. It managed to do EVERYTHING so effortlessly, and yet not make any of it gimicky. It all feels genuine. It's pure genius indie rock. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels): 9/10. A nice lead in to the record. It sets the mood for the record. The piano is used to puntuate the stead drum and base line, while the guitars subtly push the song forward from the backround. A brilliant little art-dance rock medley, that ALSO manages to be epic. I know that definition sounds bizarre but you'll see what I mean when you hear it. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #2 (Laika): 10/10. Following the style of the first song, this song gets a little more intense and guitar oriented, and is even more enthralling to listen to. The singer is capable of expressing such sorrow and hope together in a single way that really expresses the strue strength of this song. it sounds pathetic and sad despite it being uptempo, and when it cuts off, it feels like you've lost something. Brilliant, and possibly my favorite on the album. <br /> <br />Une Annee Sans Lumiere: 9/10. Used as a break for the four neighborhood songs. It uses a slightly different, more airy pop styled rock. The guitars aren't as distorted as much as usual, and the keyboarding makes it very pretty. This song probably wouldn't be so astounding were it not for it's placement. Remember how I said the previous song made you feel empty? Well this one makes you feel better again. It's still sorrowful, but it sounds more hopeful as well. And the end turns into pure rock, because.... <br /> <br />Neighborhood #3 (Power Out): 9/10. An all-out rocker. Again though, it's not abrasive. It's carried with airy pop like the rest of the songs, but the guitars, the vocals, the bassline, and the steady drums give it TONS of punch and energy. It's possilby the most uptempo song on the album, and it's a lot of fun to listen to without getting over-the-top. It's still very deep and emotionally powerful. This is what makes the band brilliant. <br /> <br />Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles): 9/10. This is a weird one, mainly because it sounds like the end of the album, but it's really just the end of the first act of the album. Rhythm moves this song forward.... Until it gains some more momentum near the end. Still this song is based on a very simple rhythm that's only set off every once in a while. This makes it, IMO, the weakest song on the album, but notice my rating, this song is still way better than a lot of songs that other bands make. The beautiful movement in the song remains. This song develops nicely with the ending feeling like an ending. It moves on to even better things though.... <br /> <br />Crown of Love: 10/10. Holy ****. This is the song that got me into the band. It almost sounds like something off a movie soundtrack or something. Sorrowful and regretful, but with gorgeous instumentation, vocals, and progression with a very wise decision to lead it off rather than end it. <br /> <br />Wake Up: 10/10. Whoa.... This is probably the most impressive song on the album. Laika is probably my favorite, but this one's so good in every way. The orchatral instruments don't even take dominance in this song, they play in the backround. Heavy, metallic guitars predominate, but the song still manages to be downright beautiful and moving. It's also ever changing, even when you don't notice the new arrangements, they're coming in. This song is just plainly a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Haiti: 9/10. The woman vocalist takes over here, and does a really good job. Just as good as the guy, I think. She sounds like some bizarre mixture of Kim Deal and Bjrk. This song is very poppy-like. Still emotional and dynamic, but it almost sounds like some kind of alternative pop-rock song from the 80s.... Only, y'know.... Not as shallow as a puddle. <br /> <br />Rebellion (Lies): 10/10. Damn, this one's cool. Very catchy, nice use of TWO piano notes. I'mnot even sure how the band does it somtimes. Listen to the piano.... Two notes.... Drums.... Three beats.... Simple chords.... And yet, it's SO dynamic, deep, and emotional. This song's just a whole lotta fun to listen to. <br /> <br />In The Backseat: 10/10. The female vocalist again takes lead in this erethral, lovely ending song. You can  clearly see how her voice is like Bjrk's in this song. This is another masterpiece; a triouphant piece of music. It's the perfect closer for the perfect album. <br /> <br />When it ends, if feels like you've just finished some incredible experiance.... And yet, unlike some others this is a fully accessable and enjoyable album to a great many people. I get the feeling this is what Death Cab for Cutie strives for but can't quite achieve. (Note, that's not a shot at Death Cab. like Death Cab a lot, but nothing they've done can compete with this, IMO.) <br /> <br />I don't use the word masterpiece very often.... Hell, I wouldn't call my favorite album ever, The Lonesome Crowded West a masterpiece. I reserve \\"masterpiece\\" for the grand albums like Closer, OK Computer, Kid A, Homogenic, LOVELESS (gorgeous, gorgeous album if you don't know of it), or.... Uh.... THIS! <br /> <br />That's right. I'm putting The Arcade Fire on the same level as My Bloody Valentine. You're looking at a future classic. One that will be loved for generations to come. <br /> <br />If The Arcade Fire can ever top this, or match it.... Or even come close to it again, I'll be beyond impressed. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what they can do in the future.
0800177177|4.0|\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" or, more properly, \\"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula\\"?  The assumption was that the title was chosen to stake a claim to being the film adaptation closest to Bram Stoker's original gothic novel, but the reason was more mundane.  Another studio had the rights to the title \\"Dracula,\\" so a qualification was necessary.  Since this 1992 horror film would have the same characters along with the same general plotline as the novel, this seemed reasonable enough.  But screenwriter James V. Hart added a significant element to Stoker's novel that justified the movie's potent tagline, \\"Love Never Dies.\\"  As director, Francis Ford Coppola provides the stylistic flourishes, which are this movie's best parts, but Hart is the one who is responsible for the derivations.<br /><br />In the novel Count Dracula only makes vague reference to the historical Vlad the Impaler, son of the prince known as Dracul (the Dragon), hence the name Dracula (son of the Dragon), when he tells his guest Jonathan Harker of the history of his family.  Hart takes advantage of what we know about the historical figure to craft the film's prologue.  Vlad (Gary Oldman) is fighting the Turkish invaders, not simply as a prince of Wallachia, but rather as more of a true Christian knight.  He succeeds, but the exaggerated rumor of his death reaches his beloved Elisabeta (Winona Ryder), who throws herself to her death from the castle walls.  As a suicide she cannot be buried on consecrated ground, and an outraged Vlad renounces God and is somehow transmorgraphies into a vampire as a result of his blasphemy.  Then we get to the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />Harker (Keanu Reeves) is traveling to Transylvania to Dracula's castle to complete a series of real estate transactions that will allow the Count to come to London and live in style.  Something not very nice happened to the previous member of Harker's firm to make this trip (can you say Renfield?), but the old Count only seems eccentric.  However, when he sees a picture of Harker's fianc&eacute;e, Mina Harker (Ryder), the Count knows that she is the reincarnation of his beloved Elisabeta.  Now Dracula has reason to not only travel to London, but to make himself young again so that he can woo his woman.<br /><br />Once we move from Transylvania to London, we meet the rest of our cast of characters.  Mina's best friend, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), is being courted by Dr. Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant), who runs his own little asylum, Lord Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes), a handsome nobleman, and Quincey P. Morris (Bill Campbell), who hails from the American West.  However, before Lucy can choose from amongst her beaus, she becomes the new bride of Dracula instead.  Fortunately, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) knows more about medicine than what is found in science books and knows what is to be done in this situation.  Meanwhile, Count Dracula manages to run into Miss Mina, and the seduction is on.<br /><br />The production design on this film is fantastic.  When it first came out on DVD I would use it as a prime example of what could be down with sets and decor: Thomas E. Sanders and Garrett Lewis were nominated for an Oscar.  The film won Oscars for Eiko Ishioka's Costume Design, and the Makeup of Greg Cannom, Mich&egrave;le Burke and Matthew W. Mungle, as well as the Sound Effects Editing by Tom C. McCarthy and David E. Stone.  Cinematographer  Michael Ballhaus deserves to be mentioned despite similar notice.  The bottom line is that this is a great looking film, which is one of the things we come to expect in Coppola's work.<br /><br />Oldman's performance as Dracula is interesting.  Given all the actors who have come before from Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi to Christopher Lee and Frank Langella, it is hard to stake out new ground in the role.  But Oldman bases his characterization on not only the romantic but also the tragic elements of this particular Dracula.  Unfortunately, the performances of the cast are the weakest part of the film.  Reeves is far and away the most wooden, but Ryder does not create a woman worth waiting for as far as I am concerned, which is the true weakest point of the film.  Hopkins follows Laurence Olivier in the Van Helsing role and in a similar vein creates an eccentric ethnic know-it-all who spends a lot of time basically telling the gang of fearful vampire slayers to shut up and do what he says.<br /><br />When \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is over you will be struck by how gorgeous the film is from start to finish.  That will make up for so many of the actors being as wooden as the stakes used to dispatch the vampires.  Hart's twist on the tale helps improve Stoker's original ending, which was basically a race to kill Dracula before the sun sets.  The tragic element established by the prologue is adequately played out in the ending.  This film might be another example of the triumph of style over substance, but given the depths that some vampire movies can reach, it is nice to have one that aspires to such artistic pretensions.erformances of the cast are the weakest part of the film.

B0002KVUKM|1.0|Van Helsing, staring Hugh Jackman, has lots of potential. It's just a shame that it choses to ignore all that it has to offer in favor of CG gone wild.<br /><br />Van Helsing is the hunter of all of that is evil. Employed by the Vatican to rid the world of malicious and deviant creatures of the night and day, he is now faced with a menace that far exceeds anything he has ever faced...Dracula. Along the way, our hero meets a cast of characters. Some who are out to help him, and some who are trying to kill him.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman really helps to save this movie from being a pitiful dreg of film making. He always seems to have this humorous expression on his face, even when he is faced with great peril. Yet, not even the Aussie God can help this movie with what it lacks.<br /><br />A thin plot consisting of ridiculous twist and turns, and way too many CG effects. You would be better off renting this movie.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Do NOT buy this if you enjoyd the original StarWars.  <br /> <br />It's dissapointing to say the least.
B000099T2L|5.0|R&B is not just boring music, it is a culture. R&B stands for Rythym and Blues and it has its root from Jazz which has its roots from slave music. R&B singers aren't just \\"showing off\\" their voices, they are telling a story. The way they sings adds emphasis to their story. Beyonce has a beautiful voice and her \\"showing it off\\" on songs such as 'Dangerously in Love' helps the listener to get the same feeling that she's feeling in the song. I don't know about you but I've been dangerously in love like that before. Perhaps she had just met Jay-Z when she recorded it???:)
B00005T5VE|5.0|In terms of compilation albums, this is the one that's buzzing in my CD player more than other ones (even the Immaculate Collection!).  And I stand by the statement that this album is perfectly sublime JUST THE WAY IT IS.  To me, each track is in itself a definitive Madonna masterpiece WITHOUT QUESTION.  I think the best way to truly express how great this compilation really is is to write something about each track . . . <br /> <br />DEEPER AND DEEPER <br />I have to dance every SINGLE time I hear this song!  This song NEEDED to be included on GHV2. <br /> <br />EROTICA <br />my personal favorite- a haunting expression of some of the darkest and most primal of sexual fantasies (S&M, for example).  anyone who is familiar with this song and the album can appreciate the name i put on this review, then.  the modern sounding hiphop beat and house-inspired, aloof background music make this a musical experience TRULY like no other.  again, GHV2 did justice. <br /> <br />HUMAN NATURE <br />ultimately not a big hit on the charts, but a message that got everyone's attention- \\"i do what i do and if you don't like it, i won't stop, i could care less what you think.\\"  GHV2 met this one halfway by including it but as a dumbed down version with no profanity <br /> <br />SECRET <br />Madonna's hippest R&B tune ever.  i think that when she released this along with the album Bedtime stories back in '94, she effectively communicated that she could still get down with the getdown. <br /> <br />DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA <br />Who doesn't know this song, or at least the fact that Madonna sings it?  If this song had not made it into the collection, then that would have been the worst-case scenario! <br /> <br />BEDTIME STORY  <br />i love this song, it is just so mindblowing and ethereal with its trance-house themed sound. <br /> <br />THE POWER OF GOODBYE <br />A beautiful ballad from the Ray of Light album.  'Nuff said. <br /> <br />BEAUTIFUL STRANGER <br />Madonna closed the door onthe nineties with this unusually rich-sounding dance track from the second Austin Powers movie.  An excellent note to end the nineties on. <br /> <br />FROZEN <br />The most beautiful ballad on the Ray of Light album and one of her best by far.   <br /> <br />TAKE A BOW <br />Madonna's biggest hit ever, this also was a necessity for inclusion on GHV2.  It's from Bedtime Stories, and it was written by Babyface, and he never goes wrong, as vividly proven in how beautiful this R&B song sounds. <br /> <br />RAY OF LIGHT <br />I love the video for this song, which made me love the song itself even more.  I love how it was Madonna's return to the pop world, back in top form again! <br /> <br />DON'T TELL ME <br />A kickin' track from 2000's Music album which is characterized with unbeatable pop lyrics and a catchy hiphop sounding backbeat (check out this video too, which features M's turn as a dust covered cowgirl). <br /> <br />WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL <br />Madonna's second best vocal work in a song (top billing goes to Don't Cry For me Argentina).  It is a beautiful ballad from Music that goes against society's construct of the ideal female. <br /> <br />DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE <br />I thought this one was some kind of slowed-down, rock-and-roll ballad, and then watching the video opened my eyes to what message Madonna was really sending about herself and the stress of celebrity.  Not released in the United States, but still deserving of its GHV2 slot (you'll really think so if you watch the video). <br /> <br />MUSIC <br />Madonna did it AGAIN with this electronica-laden dance track extraordinaire.  She opened a new decade, a new century, and a new millenium with a pulsating, high-energy dance single that was her first to go #1 in years.  Yes, she does still got it. <br /> <br /> <br />Now you can see why these songs are most deserving of making up Madonna's second Greatest Hits compilation.  Some may point out that such #1's as \\"I'll Remember\\" and \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\" are not up there and say they should have been put up there.  But those two songs, while they did chart extremely well, are just not ones that automatically come to mind with 1990s and 21st century Madonna.  And another thing: this album just rocks on the weight of the featured songs.  Therefore there didn't need to be any new material featured on the album; people bought it so that they would be able to listen to classic Madonna whenever they wanted, not listen to new material. <br /> <br />
B0002O7XVI|3.0|Roman Polanski's film of Tess finally makes it to DVD but in such a poor transfer that it hardly seems worthwhile. This is a film of rare beauty in so many ways and long awaited so why have Columbia given it such a cheap and nasty transfer to DVD. <br /> <br />The print is not new and not restored. The colours are bright and true but there are loads of artifacts, scratches, dots, jumps, speckles etc throughout the film.This is a 3 hour film and there are very good extras, 72 minutes worth, taking the  running time to over 4 hours. Columbia decides to cram all this information onto a single disc and naturally the picture and sound quality suffer. If they had gone to a second disc this would be improved but the print used is still far from perfect. <br /> <br />Important also; this copy is not the 'roadshow' version that played the major cities on its initial release with the intermission and musical overtures, however they have left the exit music at the end but cut off the final few chords!!!  <br /> <br />Even worse is the sound quality. This was one of the first major features to use 'Dolby Stereo'. On its initial release the sound was flawless with a very lively surround track and great depth that particularly showed off the luscious score by Phillipe Sarde. The print used here has not been enhanced for 5:1 and doesnt even seem to have been remastered for DVD. Throughout the film there are wierd low frequency rumblings and distortions, and more irritatingly 'hiss'. These episodes come and go but generally the sound balance is all wrong. When the surround does come to life it leaps into life but with strange sounds coming from strange places in the sound stage.During the Stonehenge sequence at the end of the film when there is supposed to be spiritual activity coming from the surround channel, on this DVD version sounds like a party going on nearby. Very disturbing at the climax of the film. The sound levels are inconsistent throughout - sometimes very loud followed by too quiet and I found myself consistently reaching for the remote. <br /> <br />This is yet another blunder by Columbia as it is sold as an overpriced SE. Which means that we are unlikely to see a decent transfer in the next 10 years.This is a shabby way to treat such a special and beautiful film after so many years of neglect. Buyer beware!
B00000IPAX|1.0|Well, a friend of mine left this CD at my house and I was amazed at the lack of musical skill these guys have. In my  mind, a horrible band. They seem like great and pretty funny guys but I didn't see any compensation in it for the music. Just my opinion. Call me an overanalytic music freak, but its void of any real well-thought out compositions. If they were my friends in high school, I'd support them, but now that they make lots of money, they've gotten all the money they need, don't buy it.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Okay, i'm writing this review in regards to the people that will not purchase this album or who don't like this album based on political reasons. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but regardless of who youre voting for, this is an awesome album. green day's best to date, and like many i grew up with the guys and dookie was one of the first albums i owned. If there's one thing I've always loved about Green Day, it's that theyre brutally honest. And keep in mind, this is rock. If youre looking for some more conservative issues in music, you're looking in the wrong place to begin with. Whoever youre voting for, I don't think listening to Green Day is necesarilly going to sway your vote one way or the other, and if it is... maybe youre the one that is immature, not green day. Not only is it rock, but it's punk, and it's art... when you add those together it doesnt equal conservative. I don't think the band should be discredited for their opinions either. Eddie Vedder, Michael Stipe, Bruce Springsteen and Dave Matthews are in my mind some of the best lyracists to ever grace the planet, and theyre all on the Vote for Change tour right now. It's to be expected; it doesn't mean they're ignorant or purposely trying to be rebels to sell a few more albums. They're standing up for what they believe in, and I can respect that no matter what the issue if they have something solid to base it on. If anything would sway my views it's someone making an ignorant statement like, \\"George Bush will win this election, whether Green Day or any punk rock band will face it.\\" I mean no disprespect, but people need to think things through before they say them. When someone reads something like that they automatically assume all Bush voters fall in to that same category. Politically, I'm pretty much the middle of the road. I'm a surfer/artist/university student from a christian background, i have views from every end of the spectrum. So if youre writing a review trying to get the youth of america to vote one way or another I propose making some good points other than picking out one line in american idiot, and then saying,\\"BUSH CHENEY 2004!\\" because i don't know if you realize it, but that song is aimed right at you.
B000003CKH|4.0|Yes yes a musically inclined band with a hint of oddness and humor. These guys are just really great. I never get tired of this album and it just makes me happy. Well, thats pretty much it. A good album by a good band.
B00006879E|5.0|Ok way back in the beginning of this year Maroon 5 brought out 'Harder to breathe' and I thought the song was awesome! <br />The same with she will be love and this love, and they're latest single yet to be released 'Sunday Morning'. <br />This album is amazing, its very rare for me that I find a good album and that I like all the songs on it, but with Maroon 5's cd every track that played on would amaze me in some way. With Adam's (the lead singer) voice and the music behind him all works no-matter which way you look at it, this is a very talented band who in my opinion will go far. Be sure to pick up a copy of this album it will not be a waste of money I assure you. <br />
B00067BBQE|5.0|YES!! Finally a band with talent gets noticed!! I am sick of the Hilary Duff live in concert DVD I was hearing about!! She lip sung well suposedly \\"DUBBED\\" yeah right. Same for Briteny whats the point of releasing a LIVE dvd on them? Not much of a point. And then there is Evanescence! A band with so much talent!! If you are not big on Evanescence and are worried about it not being live then worry no more because I can tell you 100% that this DVD WILL be live.  <br /> <br />What can I say about Evanescence? Well for one Amy Lee writes her own lyrics, sings live, has the ability to jump about and sing at the same time and still sound great!!! There is so much more to be said but so little time. Thats what this DVD is for!! Also the band can't forget them. Everybody was really nervus when Ben Moody left (co finder of Evanescence) Would they still sound good, will they all spilt, whats gonna happen? Well not much had to change, Ben left durning a tour in Europ I think and the band needed a lead guitalest. So what did they do, they trained a guy (I think he was from Cold Play or something) and didn't miss a concert and I actully think they sound better now. Their concerts sound more rockish now!! Amazing uh? This little bit right here proves why Evanescence should be #1 and why all of you need to buy this DVD!!!  <br /> <br />Support talent and not over rated pop stars!!!! <br /> <br />Thanks, btw I hope I didn't offend anyone on the Duff and Briteny thing but it's true just think about it!
0452282152|4.0|The entire novel is short and can be a very quick read, but if you take the time to appreciate the flow of the story, it will seem although you are reading poetry or prose set to music. <br />It is quite amazing how much information can be derived in so little words. I am a big fan of more verbose writers like Umberto Eco, Neal Stephenson, Philippa Gregory - and don't usually expect to become captivated by short novels. <br />The writer posseses a gift in being able to convey the characters' thoughts and essenses without have to go into detail about everything. <br />The day to day life that unfolds of young Griet, from her thoughts to her experiences gives the reader a glimpse into society and culture of that time period - which is truly, once again, mostly due to the author's writing style, quite enlightening.
B00009V7P8|5.0|It is scary how good this album is...listen to it loud, and without distractions.  Having seen him live I can only say that Damien Rice is a genius.<BR>This is the best cd I have ever heard -from Coldplay to The Long Winters to Radiohead to Neutral Milk Hotel to U2 to Wilco to Hayden to Joseph Arthur to The Rheostatics-simply the best.
B000002JSN|4.0|This double album by Led Zeppelin is very good.  In fact, it has some great songs on it.  But it also has a few songs that seem like \\"filler\\" to me, although they were surely not intended that way.  Maybe it's just me.  I know that a lot of people love every song on this album, and perhaps you will, too.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Don't be put off by the title, The Flaming Lips, bring 60's pop psychedelia to the new millennium. More Moody Blues than Pink Floyd, maple syrup vocals merge with soaring keyboards to create textured warm melodies which remind you of summers of love.There are tempo changes as the tracks build, but no heavy demand is placed upon the listener. Multiple harmonies and the occasional surprise effect manage to stay the right side of over produced. Much less urgent and raw than their previous albums and yet more commercial. Immagine the beach boys jamming with Caravan or The Doors. I play it alongside The Olivia Tremor Control. Could this be Pop music for ageing hippies.

B00005JMUA|1.0|I didn't think movies could get much worse then Van Helsing...I was wrong. I kept hearing people talk about Kill Bill 1 and 2 so finnally I went out and rented them thinking they must be half way decent right, I mean they got all kinds of rave reviews? WRONG. They are both some of the worst movies put to film in a long long time. <br />If you only like action and blood and don't want any real story, acting, dialouge, character development, or intelligence then this is the movie for you. If you like any of those things though in a movie avoid this like you'd avoid a rampaging bull. <br />The plot is one that has been used 1000's of time before, someone close to someone gets killed and now that someone is out for revenge...wow...so original Now had the action been better or the acting or anything at all for that matter I could have overlooked this, but nothing is good here. <br />The action looks more like a saturday cartoon (just with more blood), and the blood, I can actually see the hoses that are used to shoot it out of the peoples limbs when they are cut off...sad, so sad.  <br />And last...the soundtrack (you can't really call it a score0 it's horrible. Pure crap. Just like the movie, avoid this movie people, don't even bother.
B00064ADR0|5.0|This is Johnny on top of his game. An innovative 3-sided lp becomes a brilliant cd. Progressive blues at its finest, 'Second Winter' sits right alongside 'Electric Ladyland', 'Led Zeppelin'  & 'Wheels of Fire' as the finest blues-rock ever created. A Desert Island Disc fer sure! <br /> <br />The two additional studio cuts are excellent (one is a Ray Charles tune) and the 1970 Royal Albert Hall concert is a treasure. Saw this band many times back in the day, and this is truly representative of what they were. Tommy Shannon (SRV) played bass, Uncle John Turner drums, and Edgar played everything else. How they held this back for all these years is beyond me. Blues playing doesn't get any better than this.
B000002UAX|4.0|first of all i think the beatles rock and are the best rock group EVER. ok got that? I also am 19 years old and love pink floyd,rush,metalica,AC/DC,the rolling stones,the doors,and van halen to name a few. That means i am not some hippy wierdo who says \\"if you don't think the beatles are the best i will curse you like what my dad did with the red sox...\\" has ANYone ever said that? ok i don't think it is very smart for you to come here say this album(which is not their best but my fav.)sucks because they were playing 40 years ago...if you say that you must be the drugged up hippy...but if you say the beatles suck because they were not that good with their instuments(exept paul).well that doesn't matter. They already showed the world what you can do with 2guitars,a bass, and a drumset...(and some mis. other stuff that is)If you say that you should be happy that you know which of the beatles play guitar and bass...anyway this cd is highly experimetal is some parts but is still a great cd. If you have pepper than get revolver. After that this cd is a great and must have For any collection.(GET REVOLVER!!!)
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is an amazing little album. I have been a fan for years, but I think this is Mark's best solo effort so far. This album just grooves, with those rich guitar riffs and a sound that echos in your head long after the song has finished. The song \\"Boom Like That\\" about Ray Kroc (yep - of McDonalds fame) is pure genius...Elvis, and many others get their own special Knopfler tributes. Some of the best work that DS did was not the heavy handed stuff, but mesmerizing songs like \\"Telegraph Road.\\" That is where this album wants to take you...to a spiritual sort of place. GREAT STUFF!
B000003TA4|3.0|IMO your choice of music SUCKS!!!sorry had to get that out of my system anyway...i like most types of rock that there are. thats right and guess how many \\"good\\"cds(your good cds)do i have?none thats right NONE i love led zeppelins cds most of the beatles cds and tons of others which worst songs are better than anything you say you like...oh yeah btw the reason that noone plays clapton and those other guitar gods(JIMI HENDRIX!!!) is because modern music(i amj not calling it rock)smothered and killed rock. Nirvanna tried to resurrect it but it was too late rock has died and now kids everywhere are going to grow up likeing that crap...oh well...oh yeah and this cds sucks as it is missing a lot of great songs...IMO anyway
B00005JMX6|4.0|This DVD the girl next door was different than I thought it was going to be.  The acting was good and it was a interesting plot.  I have always wondered what people do after porn. ;-). It's a good teenage teaser flick with many good performances by character actors you always see but don't remember their names.  <br /> <br />The extras are pretty good on here too. The part I liked the best was the Eli experience it had me rolling.
B0002SROT0|4.0|I'm really not prone to entertaining myself with 2nd guessing what Elliott Smith's eventual intentions were for these songs. I'm also not interested in analyzing the production. What I can tell you is that BASEMENT has exceeded my expectations. Like all his best work, I'm finding it a real chore getting it out of my cd player.<br /><br />\\"Coast To Coast\\" starts off with this distorted orchestra & then bursts into a wall of sound. Starting things off on an uncharacteristically, aggressive note. I think the heart of this album can best be summed up in what I find to be it's most addictive track, \\"King's Crossing\\". \\"This is the place where time reverses/and where dead men talk to all the pretty nurses\\". Or more simply, \\"cos' I took my own insides out\\". For a night on the town, presumably? Good one, Elliott.<br /><br />There's not much for real fans to be upset about here. Let alone disgusted (as I've read in some other reviews). The aching fragility of \\"Twilight\\". The perverse jauntiness of \\"Memory Lane\\". \\"Let's Get Lost\\" is an aptly beautiful place to do so. & \\"Last Hour\\" sounds like it quietly tip-toed off one of his early albums.<br /><br />BASEMENT is by no means perfect. No posthumous album is going to be. But to these ears, it doesn't excactly sound all dressed up for an open casket funeral. All I can say is, the end results are a lot darker & somewhat more diverse than FIGURE 8. I've been listening to this guy ever since ROMAN CANDLE came out. EITHER/OR is one of my favorite albums of the 90's. Those catchy Beatle-sque hooks. Lonesome fingerpicking. Scathing lyrical insights. That uncanny knack for stumbling upon a universal truth & then shrugging it off. I'm sure most fans can agree on where his real strengths lie. Well, inbetween all the gushing odes of blind devotion & self-righteous outcries of disappointment, it's here waiting for you. When you get around to it. Excuse me, gotta go hit the PLAY button again.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I think that this movie is a powerful wake up call for repentance.  A call that is overdue.  In the first gospel (Matthew), the first thing that Jesus says after starting His mission is \\"Repent\\" (Matthew 4:17):  \\"From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, \\"Repent, for the kingdom of haven is at hand.\\"  Why so many Christians in the world neglect His call?  The call for repentance comes even earlier. And the killing of Jesus is not the first killing of this kind. Remember Salome? (Matthew 14:6-12):  \\"But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother she said, \\"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\\" And the king was sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given; he sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. And his disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and told Jesus.\\"  What was John striving for?  Again Matthew (3:1-3):  \\"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, \\"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\\".   People can spend hours talking about Jesus, the movie, about Christianity, but they somehow forget (avoid?) the centerpiece of Jesus'message: \\"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\\".
B00005JMH2|5.0|Go ahead and give me unhelpful votes if you disagree with my opinion, but I enjoyed this movie. I left the movie theatre with a lump in my throat and a good feeling inside, and I was entertained, and isn't that what watching movies is about? At least I felt that way. Maybe the movie is different from the original, but not seeing the original and just seeing this one, I can say I liked this movie. A good cast, including Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. I enjoy Lopez's movies but on this movie she plays more of a supporting role, and her acting style in this movie is much more restrained than in movies in the past. I won't give away plot but if you want a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and just feel good, then SHALL WE DANCE? is for you. The music in the movie is great as well!
0385335482|5.0|I have read few books in my life that have made me laugh outloud as Confessions of a Shopaholic did.  With funny situation on top of funny situation- this book was a non-stop joyride!<br /><br />Becky Bloomwood is the girl next door, the one who is a bit silly, a bit unlucky, but she tries hard.  She's like many of us, in a job we may not enjoy, but she has her hobbies to keep her going- shopping!  We enter her life in the stage of the mid-twenties, and like most of us, she's just finding her way, one mistake at a time.  And in a universal subject- shopping and debt, this story is one I think many people can relate to.  However, under the humor and the spending, the story of an average girl, a nice girl, is one we're all rooting for.<br /><br />I have to say, I LOVED this book!  I loved all of the characters as well.  In fact, I think I loved every single situation in this book, not once was I bored.  I do a lot of reading, and of course I do consider this book a bit of \\"candy\\", however, I'm so happy I gave this series a chance!  I can't wait to see if there's a movie on the horizon.
B0004Z33G4|5.0|Rambo rox my sox off!  The first episode kicks it with some jerk wad police dude who's tryin to give Rambo a hard time.  He arrests Rambo eventually and is mean to him....mean like NAM.  And when you're mean like NAM to Rambo...bad things happen!  Anyhoo, Rambo flips out and escapes jail and the jerk police follow and one dies by mistake and he shows em who's boss in the forest and it eventually leads to him ruining the town with the beloved weapon..the M-60.  Anyhoo...episode 2 ensues him being talked into a photography job that eventually leads him to kill massive numbers of communistic charlie!  That rox0r!  They kill his woman and that makes him mad so he kill a bunch more.  He eventually gets back to the army place that gave him the job and killed all the computers because computers suck.  Episode 3 is where the colonel finds Rambo in some monk tribe and he's fighting in some \\"Blood Sport\\" like competition.  This one wasn't as good as the others.   <br />       But all in all...the Rambo trilogy is totally amazing and you should buy it and watch it and revel in the greatness that is Rambo.  God is to Lamb as Satan is to Bush.
B00005JN4O|5.0|This is the best movie of the year so far! I went to the premiere of it in London last week, and it was incredible! Im not going to give anything away but its definately worth watching! Trust me, this WILL get an oscar!! Im sure of it! Johnny Depp's scottish accent is perfect (i should know cos im scottish!!) and his acting is too! (like always!)  <br />This film is too good to miss!! <br />
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radioheads music has never ceased to amaze, their music is so relaxing, just what you need to relieve yourself from all that stress. A few good songs I would recommend are There There, Go to sleep, 2+2=5, Punch up at a wedding and Myxamatosis.  <br />
B00020HEG6|5.0|When I bought this soundtrack, I was already thinking it would be just another bland cd filled with orchestra music.  How wrong was I?  Well, I listened to this cd about four times the first day I bought it.  I absolutely love it, and now I can't stop listening to it!  Track no.1, \\"Lumos\\", gets you in the Harry Potter mood, as it is a staple sound in the HP movies.  \\"Aunt Marge's Waltz\\" is breezy, bouncy, and you can just picture mean Aunt Marge flying out the doorway!  \\"Knight Bus\\" -- riveting... the list goes on and on!  However, my favorites would be \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" and \\"Quidditch Third Year\\".  This soundtrack mixes dark, creepy melodies with light, airy tones.  It is sure to please even the pickiest purveyer of music.
B00005JNEI|2.0|So, I watch this \\"film\\" and watch it all the way through, about to fall asleep tell you the truth.  The movie is put together in a slow \\"Insomniac's Medication\\" way.  If I don't snore I'll be happy.  But lets get to the content.  Honestly, people need to stop thinking of Michael Moore as a political figure, all he is is a person with an opinion.  I'm sick of hearing \\"you gotta see this movie before you vote\\"  all it is is some guy's over-emphasized BS.  Bush is a human being too, stop treating him like junk.   <br /> <br />Like the \\"clip\\" of what Bush was thinking about when he was in the classroom and heard the news.  That was plain stupid.  Don't put words in his mind.  You don't know what he was thinking, and all you were reading about was public record and from news sources with their own agendas.   <br /> <br />That being said, I hated the film.  I watched it once and that was enough.  I was expecting something just a little more than what Fahrenheit 9/11 had to offer.  I'm not a Bush supporter, but you need to stop blaming a tragedy on one man, ONE MAN!  We all make mistakes, and it's people like Michael Moore who has nothing better to do than to exploit those mistakes.  He needs to learn to grow-up.  This \\"film\\" is not a documentary, just a waste of two hours and some guy's mis-informed mind. <br /> <br />This isn't the bible people, this is just a movie.  Don't believe the hype.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I love this cd. It is definitely their best. My favorite songs on this cd are Re-Arranged, Nookie, and N 2 Gether Now
B00006AG5N|5.0|How can you go wrong with Elvis? My beef is that I noticed one reviewer stated that even with two different CDs, his copies would not play on a DVD player.  The reason I bring this up is that my copy won't show up on my computer for transfer to an Ipod. Whats going on?  Be nice to know.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is one of blink 182's better cds. Great songs, I would recommend it.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|There is not much more I can add to what all the other reviewers have already said. This DVD is trully a work of art! It captures the essence of musicianship at it's maximum capacity; five incredibly talented and gifted musicians playing their masterpieces! Audio and video are not only outstanding (5.1 especially), but the lyrics as subtitles are a really nice touch that helps the newer fans get aquainted faster, and the older ones (like me), take a trip down memory lane.<br /><br />All I could do after watching the more than two hours concert..... was indeed to shed a tear or two!
B00004Z459|1.0|C'mon! Whiny vocals, inaudible bass, pathetic \\"screaming\\", rapping? Linkin Park SUCKS!<br /><br />Forget about LP, listen to Body Count or Rage Against the Machine to hear rap-metal done the right way, or better yet, listen to real metal like Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Sepultura, Deicide, Pantera, Black sabbath, old Metallica, Led Zeppelin, and Iced Earth.
B000065VA1|5.0|While many may mourn Peter Gabriel's departure from Genesis, I have to say that it's the best move he ever made.  Not that Genesis wasn't great, but with his solo career, he achieved a level of maturity and artistic vision that far eclipses anything he did with that band. And, while \\"So\\" may be a bit more pop oriented than his previous releases, it's no less great.<br /><br />\\"So\\" is quite simply a timeless classic.  While there may be little bit of 80's cheese here and there, it doesn't hold it back a bit.  This album is very eclectic, and full of excellent musicianship.  Tony Levin, the bassmaster himself, is featured on 6 of the 9 songs here, and his playing is just killer.  There are tons of other great musicians here, including guest appearances from Stewart Copeland and Kate Bush, and everyone here contributes something really special.<br /><br />This album will take you on a roller coaster of various moods and textures.  \\"Red Rain\\" is a beautiful opener, with a soothing synth melody, and techno-influenced drumming.  \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\" are fun, catchy, funk-flavored tunes, both featuring horns and some pretty wacky lyrics.  \\"Don't Give Up\\" is an amazing duet, on which Gabriel and Bush both shine.  \\"Mercy Street\\" is soft and moody, with very touching lyrics.  \\"This Is the Picture\\" is the oddest track here, sounding a bit like a groovier Thinking Plague (there's a female singer on this one also, but I forget who).  \\"In Your Eyes\\", the closer, is quite simply one of the best love songs ever.  The tribal percussion and native chants give it an amazing, ethnic atmosphere, and Gabriel's vocals are just powerful.  This album is almost worth buying for this song alone.<br /><br />Overall, this is a mighty fine album.  The only song I don't really care for is \\"We Do What We're Told\\", which just sounds like pointless filler (it's too bad they couldn't have used Copeland for a better track).  It doesn't really drag the album down, but it's a definite low-point.  Other than that, this is great stuff.  Peter Gabriel has a definite knack for creative pop, and everyone who appreciates such things should own this.is great stuff.

Linkin Park SUCKS! <br />Forget about LP, listen to Body Count or Rage Against the Machine to hear rap-metal done the right way, or better yet, listen to real metal like Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Sepultura, Deicide, Pantera, Black sabbath, old Metallica, Led Zeppelin, and Iced Earth.
B0000E64ZB|3.0|This album is pleasant enough when heard in small doses. Ms Bruni has a reasonable pop voice and she doesn't do anything annoying - nor does she do anything terribly adventurous!<br /><br />I've heard this album around ten times in my workplace and I would be quite happy if I never heard it again. It is okay as background music but I don't think I'd ever bother buying this album now.<br /><br />I think Paris Combo are making the best French pop I've heard recently (not that I've heard a lot!).<br /><br />I should also add that some of Ms Bruni's songs never seem to go anywhere - the verse/chorus/verse/chorus thing seems to be 'on auto-pilot' a lot of the time. She also seems to be content to simply sound cute and/or French in some of the songs. This just ain't enough for me! I am too old, too jaded and too cynical to get excited by a woman with a sexy accent alone.
B00005QDW5|5.0|When it comes to a Pink Floyd compilation, everyone starts picturing \\"Another brick in the wall\\", the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and few others. This compilation brings both, but it has a touch of personification given by its producers. And it's not just any personification: it's the same mixing techniques once used by Floyd. I definitively recommend this double CD, for fans and average listeners of Pink Floyd.
0679428895|5.0|Harris chose an engineer as the hero for this story, and I applaud that choice for several reasons. Through his choice of a working man as his hero, Harris avoided many cliches about Roman people. Of course ancient Rome had some crazy emperors,greedy and unscrupulous businessmen, prostitutes, and lazy and worthless children of rich parents; Harris worked a number of these types of characters into his narrative, as well. But Rome must also have had people with courage and integrity who worked hard for a living. Roman acqueducts are recognized as one of the greatest engineering accomplishments of the ancient world, and they could not have existed without the intelligence, hard work, and technical knowledge of people similar to the fictional Marcus Attilius. Because the main character was an engineer, Harris was able to incorporate considerable information about Roman engineering into the story in a natural way. The appearance of Pliny the Elder also provided a way to comment on the natural science of the times. Harris's understanding of volcanic eruptions enabled him to write an incredibly vivid and horrifying account of the experience that residents of Pompeii must have endured in the last few hours and days of the eruption.<br /><br />This book engendered considerable discussion in my book reading group. How close are the parallels between ancient Rome and contemporary USA? What degree of control can people hope to achieve over forces of nature, even using modern technologies? How do people behave in the face of disaster and panic?  In what ways were Romans \\"people just like us\\"?<br /><br />The only element of the story I found somewhat unsatisfying was the love interest; this did not seem well developed. Apart from that, I found this novel engrossing and suspenseful - and quite historically accurate. (I've done considerable research for my own writing about Pompeii, and that background helped me to appreciate that Harris made excellent use of a wide range of historical sources to supply the details that bring the ancient world to life).  All in all, an excellent reading experience.historical sources to supply the details that bring the ancient world to life).  All in all, an excellent reading experience.
B000002U9W|5.0|This masterpiece can be truly defined as the one and only \\"democratic\\" experience of Pink Floyd as a band.

I still can't recall of a Floyd song any better than the \\"Atom heart mother suite\\".
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This beautifully produced DVD is stunning on all levels. More than just a film of an exceptional concert, it perfectly captures George Harrison's life & music and, above all, the love that he gave and received from his friends and family.    The evening itself builds from a wonderful opening sequence of Indian music into a quite superb rock concert featuring just about everyone George played with over the years. Packed full of stand-out numbers too many to list, their renditions of \\"If I Needed Someone\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Horse To The Water\\" are quite breathtaking. And, with virtually no \\"I knew George...\\" speeches, and with none of the \\"stellar\\" names seeking to steal the limelight, it's a brilliantly sequenced and perfectly played celebration of one man's music.    By the end, and with no less than four drummers, nine guitarists and four organists now on stage, the final number - \\"Wah Wah\\" - could/should have been a musical nightmare. But, through the sheer quality of musicianship and Eric Clapton's outstanding musical production it is, in fact, the complete opposite... a thundering celebration of everything that's good about rock music which, aided by superb film editing (including several amazing shots of the huge percussion section in full, perfectly synchronised swing), is quite simply the most exciting live performance I've ever seen. And for the encore... Joe Brown's simple, ukulele backed rendition of \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\" is a deeply poignant and wholly apt closing to a night totally devoid of \\"rock star\\" ego & excess.     And there's more, for the interviews and rehearsal sequences on DVD Two are not only entertaining in themselves, but re-inforce the over-riding impressions of friendship and admiration from all those involved. Not just a bunch of interesting \\"out-takes\\" but an integral part of capturing the background to, and reasons for, such a unique event.       Eric Clapton's body language while standing behind Joe Brown's heart-rending encore sums it all up - respect, love, sadness, and... quite rightly, dignified pride for a job well done in giving a dear friend the best possible send-off.
B000002AP1|5.0|Cheers to Sony Legacy for giving Iggy Pop the ultimatum, \\"Either you re-mix it or we will!\\"  No matter what Iggy did with the Raw Power master tapes, it would have been inarguably legitimate.  He's the man, and this is it -- the way it should have been.  But first, let's be thankful for the way it was. <br /> <br />One day it appeared in all its magnificence...the elusive artifact, the holy grail, the Raw Power album.  When Raw Power was mixed by David Bowie and released in 1973, it became history -- fast.  Admittedly, the original mix was done on old equipment, which further distorted (or enhanced) an already chaotic, unconventional and rebellious sound.  The vocals and guitar were so prominent that the low end was barely audible.  This razor sharp edge secured the album's place in history.  To me, (as a pre-teen) it sounded like a bunch of angry guys attacking some kind of machinery with razor blades.  A fresh sonic abomination, re-defining music altogether.  It was a dazzling mess, only because of the tight, powerful band behind the metallic wall of sound -- the Stooges.  It highly repelled my parents and friends, so I knew I had discovered a real treasure.  Then it became critically acclaimed, proving there were other people in the world with good taste. <br /> <br />Apparently, Iggy's original nave attempt at mixing in 1974 had all the instruments on one channel and the vocals on the other, just as EMI had done to simulate stereo on the Beatles' back catalogue.  Bowie, whose production Iggy does not discredit under the circumstances, was called upon to rectify the situation. <br /> <br />Iggy's violent 90's mix doesn't rattle and hiss.  It thumps, roars and pounces like a wildcat.  The venom may be diluted, but that cheetah's heart is still full of napalm.  It's been transformed from Raw Power to Roar Power.  You can't play this mix at low volume.  It's already loud at volume level one, and distortion already sets in at level two.  You actually can't crank itup without destroying your speakers.  The cranking is already done for you.  How considerate! <br /> <br />This may be the greatest archaeological project of the ages...polishing a huge rough diamond \\"using technology,\\" defining and clarifying its shape and glory.  We're hearing the bass and drums for the first time. Scott Asheton wasn't tapping on Tinker Toys after all, and brother Ron Asheton's bass comes alive, vibrating and pulsating, giving the music its heart.  Now the guitar work of James Williamson actually has, dare I say it, warmth.  Anarchy is revered, censorship is defied and the music remains wild and alive.  <br /> <br />Iggy's production works especially well on the \\"ballads.\\"  On \\"Gimme Danger\\" and \\"Penetration\\" the acoustic guitar's hollow sound increases the aural intimacy tenfold.  The mix of \\"I Need Somebody\\" blows the dust off the bluesy guitar and bass and lets them shine. <br /> <br />Iggy treated his own bitchin' vocals with utmost respect.  The prehistoric transistor AM radio sound has been upgraded to FM stereo!  An added treat is the extra fifteen-second endings on some tracks, instead of the original fade-outs.  Check out the ending of \\"Death Trip!\\"  Finally, Iggy's long-lost \\"burp\\" launches \\"Raw Power\\" as it well should.  There's a long interview with Iggy in the CD booklet, and Mick Rock's original cover art is intact. This thing on the cover called Iggy was a charismatic monstrosity -- androgynous black-lipped, sinuous. A hieroglyphic etched in celluloid, eternal, historic.  Raw. Power.  Although the cover was grandiose, the music inside was something entirely deviant.  Its aberrant sounds gashed the skin of reason.  <br /> <br />I'm far from shelving the original mix.  It will always be a part of my own personal history, having lived with it for over twenty years.  Even today it out-sexes the Pistols, out nerves Nirvana and smashes the Pumpkins to bits.   Iggy's new mix is for the musician's ear, and for kids who were reared on professional sounding recordings.  Twenty years on, they'll be saying, \\"I hear there's an original mix that kicks ass!\\"  Let's hope they'll be able to track it down as well.    <br /> <br />The Raw Power album has impacted and permeated three decades and generations...so far.  \\"Search & Destroy\\" was featured in a Nike commercial.  What does this mean?  A Stooges fan obtained a high position in Nike's ad department, and the Stooges music is now considered cool.  Now I'd be really impressed if Revlon used \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell\\" to sell their age-defying makeup!
B0002KVUL6|5.0|I just watched Van Helsing. After reading about twenty or more reviews of the movie from all over the Internet I was a bit apprehensive that I would like it, but I like the genre and thought I would give it a try. Well let me tell you I thought it was a GREAT MOVIE! Many of the reviews I read spoke about how campy the movie was and how bad the acting was especially by the actor that played Dracula... Well my take on this is it was meant to be campy.  The movie starts out in black and white just like the old movies from yesteryear (this should have been a red flag to everyone but I guess a lot missed it) and then we are introduced to Dracula and he is way over the top with his acting ... but just in the beginning of the film... to set it up as campy. It's a wink and nod to the past. Many also complained that the story line just never could happen... that Dracula could never be lead man of both Wolfman and Frankenstein and that Van Helsing could never be a Missionary from the Vatican. With that said, It's called poetic license... those that trash the movie because they don't like the set up I think went into the movie with preconceived ideas on what they were going to see. When they were not rewarded, they trashed the movie. Sorry to say, I think this has happened a lot to this movie. The reason I am writing this review is so that those that may be interested in possibly purchasing the movie but are scared away with all the negative reviews... Don't listen to them... The movie is intended to be watched with popcorn with the lights out and sound up... lots of action, monsters, and a little love... but this is not a horror movie as some I think thought it was, its just pure fun not to be taken seriously... the film doesn't take itself seriously ... why should you?
B00005RHF8|1.0|<br />I was excited to find this \\"Jane Eyre,\\" as I had fond memories of this 1971 version being my first encounter with the Jane Eyre story.  What story?  It's abbreviated to the point of being nearly unrecognizable.  (Read the book first.  I've yet to see ANY production translate some of the beautiful moments in the text to the screen.)  This is either a DVD of a very bad print -- with cuts so huge one wonders if parts of the film were lost and some genius decided to sell it \\"as is\\" -- or simply a terrible television adaptation.  This is surprising because the credits of those involved are estimable: Jack Pulman (who adapted \\"I Claudius\\" for the television!) did the teleplay; John Williams wrote the score (and revamped it into the score for \\"Dracula\\" some 8 years later); George C. Scott plays Rochester (good casting) and Suzanna York, as good an actress as she may be, is completely miscast in the role.  Not only is she too \\"mature,\\" but far too pretty.  Don't waste your time or energy on this.  What a disappointment.
B000066I6N|4.0|I've purchased a couple Plant CDs since the dissolution of Led Zeppelin upon Jon Bonham's death and to tell the truth it didn't take very long before I tired of them.  This CD is entirely different and is easily the best thing he's done since the days of Zeppelin.  It's also the bluesiest Zeppelin and/or Plant album since The BBC Sessions.    Looking at some of the specifics, the first song is entitled \\"Funny In My Mind (I Believe I'm Fixin' to Die).\\"  It definitely signals that it's a blues song.  We aren't disappointed.  Here are some of the lyrics:    \\"Funny in my mind Lord, I believe I'm fixin' to die.  I don't mind dying, but I sure hate to leave my children cryin'.  Now look ov'r yonder, to that buryin' ground.  Look ov'r yonder, to that buryin' ground.  Sure seems lonesome Lord, where the sun goes down.\\"    The rest of the lyrics are classic blues lyrics and the melody has a mournful yet exotic sound with an up-tempo that makes it a good road tunes cut.    The third song on the disc is a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"One More Cup of Coffee\\" and it has more of a pop feel to it than most of the songs on the disc or the Dylan original.  This is one song that I could picture getting some radio airplay on rock stations.    Skipping ahead to the sixth track, \\"Win My Train Fare Home (If I Ever Get Lucky),\\" we find a medley of classic blues tune elements from Arthur Crudup's \\"If I Ever Get Lucky\\" and \\"That's Alright Mama,\\" Robert Johnson's \\"Milk Cow's Calf Blues\\" and John Lee Hooker's \\"Crawlin' King Snake.\\"  It's a stripped-down slower tune, in the style we would expect any of these songs to be played in the original renditions but with Plant's distinctive vocals.  They certainly don't sound like a medley of four separate tunes but rather a smoothly integrated whole.    Easily the most evocative song on the disc is an extraordinary cover of \\"Hey Joe.\\"  The sound is bare, emotional and graphic.  If I had to categorize the song I would consider it serial killer blues.  \\"Hey Joe\\" is one of the most recognizable tunes Jimi Hendrix ever performed.  This version is radically different and in my opinion more in-your-face.  The emphasis is on Plant's vocals punctuated by guitar riffs that build in intensity as the song progresses.  At about 70% of the way through the song, the instruments reach a cacophonous crescendo reminiscent of Hendrix's feedback sound.      If I had to describe the overall feel of the CD, I would describe it as most similar to Led Zeppelin III because of the mystical, eerie, world-music sound.  As for whether you should rush out and buy it, I can only say that for Zeppelin fans, you won't be disappointed.  It is head and shoulders better than anything Plant (or Plant/Page) has done.  For people that don't hold Zeppelin in such high regard, perhaps you should pony up a few bucks and download just a few of the tracks mentioned here.

B00000DHRZ|5.0|1. Welcome- it's just a short intro. Not speacial or anything. NA <br /> <br />2. Have you Ever- I like the chourous much better than the slower other parts in the song. Not one of the best on the album. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. Staring at the Sun- Very catchy rythm and close to a ten. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Pretty Fly For a White Guy- Overall a very funny, catchy, and good song. I like the different voices like \\"give it to me baby\\" and \\"unos, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco cinco, ceis.\\" I've heard it a bit too much though. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. The Kids Aren't Alright- GREAT instrmentals, deep meaning, and catchy. Never is there a bad part in this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Feelings- EVERYONE HATES THIS SONG. I don't know why, but I think it has a lot of energy. Not really good lyrics, okay instrumentalists, but the rythm and energy keeps it alive. Good ending, I think. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. She's Got Issues- Great song. A head bopping beat that's easyto remember, and I often catch myself humming it. Not nearly best on album but there are sooooo many good songs, so this still gets a really good score. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Walla Walla- Such a fast song, alright chouros. This song is really good especially after the say \\"-rehabilitate with all the others,\\" and get into the fast paced guitar. A bit better than She's Got Issues. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. The End of the Line- Pretty bad song. I doesn't stick in my mind like the others. Kinda boring. 5/10 <br /> <br />10. No Brakes- THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. SO fast and has soo much energy. Everyone out there might like this song better if the saw the cartoon on SFDT.com called \\"Blue X\\" or \\"The Drop\\" which have this song. Don't watch them if you are faint-hearted. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Why Don't You Get a Job- Probably the poppiest song on the album with a \\"campfire type\\" guitar. Ironic theme to the instruments I think. Still a GREAT SONG and one of the best on this album. Easy to listen too, and easy to like. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. Americana- I don't think it's as good as everyone thinks. Good begining though. Okay, it's not that bad, it's an 8/10 <br /> <br />13. Pay the Man- This song's mid-eastern beginning is way too long, and i think it ruins the song. It so copies the end of the song on \\"Smash,\\" \\"Smash.\\" Middle is okay, but not really memorable. The beggining really messes it up. 4/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this album has more 9/10s or 10/10s than anything lower. Buy it if you like a diverse and different style from \\"regular\\" music. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|2.0|I believe you should always be open to  listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to help you make your own personal decisions. Anyone who watches this movie should follow it up by watching FahrenHype 9/11 to hear the other side and see the liberties taken by an obviously biased Michael Moore who's purpose for making the movie is to discredit Bush, not just find the truth wherever it may lead.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Out of all the current crop of pop singers, nobody has the soul, depth, & just plain talent that Christina Aguilera has. How she dresses & looks shouldn't matter. She can look & dress however she wants to, she's 23 years old. She's a grown woman! This album shows Christina moving away from her teen pop style & in to R&b/soul terrain which is perfect for her. She's probably the most talented singer out there right now & she's quite a song writer, she co-wrote 14 of the 16 tracks on the album & the results are nothing short of amazing. She's a legend in the making!
B00005JMXX|2.0|The special effects were great and the movie was ejoyable to watch.  The story left a lot to be desired. I couldn't even count the number of times I was thinking \\"you couldn't do that!\\" This was obviously a politically motivated film with the emphasis on signing the Kyoto Treaty.
B000002UB3|4.0|The production is second to none. The performances, given the  state of the group, are excellent. So let's just enjoy the music.    George Martin deserves the 5th star for bringing all this together. Remember, this was done 35 years ago.
B000083C49|4.0|This film, for the sake of tidiness, may be regarded as the second installment of Spock's cinematic resurrection after his noble end in \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" (of course, had that film tanked at the box office Spock would likely have stayed dead, just like Tasha Yar and Jadzia Dax in TNG and DSN, instead of coming back to life). Rather than turning into space fugitives, Kirk, Scott, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and McCoy unanimously decide to return and face judgment for their not-by-the-book set of actions, like the sabotage of U.S.S. Enterprise.  <br /> <br />Being something of a contrarian, this reviewer does not consider the film to be some sort of cinematic comedy, as has been said by some/many. True, it is arguably lighter in overall tone when compared to its immediate predecessor. Still,it in fact illustrates the destructive and even evil aspect of humanity, albeit in a mildly humorous circumstance and context.  <br /> <br />To a degree, this \\"Voyage\\" is an homage to the first season episode \\"Tomorrow is Yesterday\\", with the same trek to Earth's past via the sling-shot route. Of course, in the episode the crew makes the trip accidentally and in the original starship whereas in the film the crew does it intentionally and in \\"a Klingon fleatrap\\". Another point of contrast is that while the crew's task in the episode is to not bring a 20th-century lifeform (Captain Christopher) back to the present (23rd century) in order to preserve that era from obliteration, the crew's task in the film is to bring back a lifeform (two humpback whales, in fact) back to the present in order achieve same. And, yes, the advance in cinematic technology made it feasible for the filmakers to present the sling-shot time travel to and from the \\"latter half of the 20th century\\" in style, something that was not done in the episode. <br /> <br />On balance, this reviewer regards the film as one of cinematic Star Trek's better endeavours, although, as an acknowledged contrarian, ranking it not quiteas high as \\"The Undiscovered Country\\"(#6;1991) or \\"First Contact\\"(#8;1996). <br /> <br />Was this review helpful to you?
0671027387|3.0|A fast paced, exciting novel,  A blend of science, science fiction and political corruption.  A good read during the election year.  The story itself is hard to believe, but it doesn't seem to matter, it is an exciting read from cover to cover.  Not entirely predictable and with what seems to be the Dan Brown trademark interestingly amusing ending. ** September 2004
B00006G8HX|4.0|This film continues the storyline that began with \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" (which itself is a follow-up of the original series episode \\"Space Seed\\"). Whereas the previous film presents the notion of \\"the good of the many outweighs the good of the few, or the one\\" this film showcases the premise of \\"the good of the one outweighs the good of the many\\".  <br /> <br />Some pointed observations need to be made pertaining to this generally satisfactory film. The most glaring note for this film is the inexplicable omission of Doctor Carol Marcus. Where is she supposed to be / what role is she supposed to play while her son David is first assigned to the science vessel Grissom and then later murdered by the renegade(?) Klingon contingent led by Kruge? It is as if she in fact passed on before David reached adulthood and hence became a non-entity by the time all these events are taking place. The flipside of this point is the equally inexplicable inclusion of Lieutenant Savvik. Firstly, the switch from Kirsty Alley to Robin Curtis seemingly makes no more sense than, say, changing the actor playing Spock from Leonard Nimoy to someone else (though this was done in the case of Captain Christopher Pike in \\"The Cage\\" by Jeff Hunter and in \\"The Menagerie\\" by someone aside from Hunter). Moreover, the Savvik character just did not seem all that integral to the plotline of either this or next film (of course if Alley re-prised the role in both \\"Search\\" and \\"Voyage\\" then at least the continuity would have been preserved). As for Robin Curtis, she is a fine actor in her own right/terms, as amply demonstrated by her portrayal of a Vulcan separatist in ST:TNG \\"Gambit I and II\\" episodes. Nevertheless, since the Savvik character has already been established by Alley, not Curtis, in \\"Wrath of Khan\\", it seemed inapropriate for anyone other than Alley to be portraying her, if at all. <br /> <br />On balance, this reviewer finds the film better than several Star Trek films, such as \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" with its egregious continuity discrepancy - Khan having met - and thus remembering - Chekov when in fact he never saw Chekov prior to the meeting at Ceti Alpha V in the film (Khan did not meet Sulu, either), or his reference to having been awakened in the year 1996! The main problem for this film seems to be a lack of clear and distinct identity. In short, this film in practical terms serves as a filler, a conduit between II and IIII, as perhaps intentionally symbolised by not having a main musical theme of its own (the film merely commandeers the one in \\"Wrath of Khan\\", something that is not true of \\"The Voyage Home\\").  <br /> <br />Was this review helpful to you?
0312995423|2.0|A somewhat entertaining book, yet it doesn't rise to the standard set in Dan Brown's other novels.

B0001AVZA8|4.0|I just saw this movie last week and I gotta say I rather enjoyed it. It isn't perfect but I think the message it tries to send is wonderful. While I agree with other's assessments that Keanu Reeves character was unneccesary and a bit to desperate for a man who is attractive, a doctor and has a house in the Hamptons! But this was still a good film despite that. I also agree that Francis  Mcdermont's role was way too small because she is fabulous. And lastly sometimes Diane Keaton can be over the top. <br />But despite it's imperfections this was a funny intellegent movie. I will watch it again. I loved  Jack and Diane's chemistry it carries the movie.... <br />All and all the message is you can find love again and sometimes you can change the bad boy. (Hey it's fantasy)

She loves The Clash! Oh My God they're the bestest band ever. Beatles Shmeatles! She loves self mythologising music like blues and punk (whatever the hell that means) Oh and look at Aerosmith they've gone so friggin' POP! They epitomise everything wrong with music today, and probably the world. They are the ANTI- MUSIC. They're' not self mythologising music! The Clash are though. They RULE, no if's or buts. Well how can you slam one band for going *somewhat* mainstream while still retaining most of their original sound (Aerosmith) and praise another band who virtually ignoree their roots and produced an album even poppier than Aerosmith?  <br /> <br />But it's a triple album, it's got political lyics and it's by the CLASH gawddammit so it has to be great! Wrong. In all fairness I like  The Clash but this album is mainly rubbish. And I don't care for double standards and hopefully an elephant with diarrhea will go to the toilet all over Mary Blaneys arrogant head.
B000005HLV|1.0|Im sorry but i just cannot get into this dull genre known as blackmetal... All these bands to me sound terrible \\"mayhem\\" , \\"emperor\\" , \\"burzum\\" , \\"god-dethrone\\" , \\"dark funeral\\" , \\"dark throned\\"  and i've given all those guys a chance and i got nothing out of doing  it. Basically, blackmetal all sounds the same...Satanic lirycs are not scary nor is dressing up in all black leather, because it makes you look like  a retard. Anyways, mayhem's \\"de mysteriis dom sathanas\\" has like all of the other blackmetal bands a very BAD PRODUCTION and same idiotic satanic lirycs and  its boring. I do hope all you guys that love blackmetal have fun with satan in hell and let him poke his fork in you a-holes! Not recommended.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Many people are disappointed with eternal sunshine because it's not a hilarious Jim Carrey film like they want it to be and think that if Jim Carrey isn't the craziest man in every movie he's in, that it's a load of crap. People still think this way even after The Truman Show and especially The Majestic which had their own humorous moments, but were not completely hilarious as they are not comedies. Yet, they are still brilliant films. Eternal sunshine is a movie that makes you think about all the things in your life that wouldn't be if you completely forget someone. Many have attempted to tackle this subject, hell, even That Seventies Show did an episode in that subject. But the movie has good acting, a mellow soundtrack, and a good story. If you liked Being John Malkovich, you'll love this movie. Watch it if you like movies that fall together in the end.
B00000JG41|5.0|The music of mr bungle is like nothing you've ever heard before and for some? That's quite hard to get used to or even enjoy it but if your mind is ready for the most weird,spychotic,morbid yet beautifull form of art ? Then buy all of mr bungle's work specialy \\"california\\" its also very haunting too. I recommend!
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I hear there was a new Green Day album coming out I couln't wait to buy it. And unlike only two or three people I know, I wasn't disappointed with it. The few people I know that ended up not liking it didn't like it because they're hard rockers and didn't like some of the mellower tracks (mellow for Green Day anyway) not because of some of Green Day's obvious political views. They don't give a damn about politics. But everyone else I know that does like it doesn't care about politics either. They like it because it is good music. I'd tell you which tracks I like best, but I like it all. And don't dismiss the songs that are roughly ten minutes long. They aren't the same song over ten minutes. They're just a compilation of songs run together in a very precise way that they still sound great because they all have similar themes or meanings. Don't just shut it out because it expresses political views (sometimes). They're not even all against Bush, but about how lying, cheating, and corrupt politics is and how the public is ilinformed. Freedom of Speech dammit! If I dismissed everything that didn't agree with me politically I'd lose many of my friends. Anyway I think this album is one of Green Day's greatest with really good music. If you like Green Day, buy American Idiot.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was all excited and thrilled to go see movie 3 thinking it would be like the first two, drama and excitement. Howver, the movie SUCKED! This new director left ou way too many movie-crucial parts and Harry's Firebol seemed to be an \\"Oh no, we forgot it so lets put it at the end of the movie!\\" sort of deal. It was crap-tastical and I expect the next movie to be much better.
0156027321|2.0|The idea for this story is interesting--a boy and a tiger share a life raft together and try to survive. Yet I never found the main character's voice to be strong and original. Instead, there was just the author, calmly relating events. I did not feel emotionally engaged with the character, so I never got pulled into his story.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Yet again, Lucas has seen fit to disembowel the memories of those of us who watched the originals in the theaters. <br /> <br />Lucas is the only filmmaker out there who doesn't seem to realize that alienating a fanbase is a terrible thing...especially one as loyal as the Star Wars fanbase. <br /> <br />I find it difficult to believe some of these changes...such as changing the ghost of Anakin?  The acting was bad enough in Episodes 1 and 2, we didn't need to see those same wooden actors in movies that are beloved for their unexpectedly *good* acting. <br /> <br />I also found the dialogue changes to be...unexpected.  Why, after all these years, does dialogue need to be re-written?  The fanservice to the modern \\"glitz and glamour\\" set has ruined the charm of the originals.  The joy of those original movies was the witty dialogue and believability of the characters, even in such an \\"out there\\" setting.  The newer movies (Episodes 1 and 2) reek of commercialism and glitter-with-no-substance filmmaking.  It is a sad thing that Lucas had to go back and wreck such wonderful films. <br /> <br />Mister Lucas, release the trilogy I saw in the theatres, and maybe I will consider purchasing this set.  I only saw these because a friend of mine forced me to watch them, so that he didn't feel alone in wasting his money and his time on them.  (even though I think he was able to manage a refund anyways, since so many people didn't realize that the movies were going to change...AGAIN) <br /> <br />Why do we bother purchasing anything, if it's going to be different than what we expected?  In other industries, this is called deceptive advertising...Lucas just calls it \\"art\\". <br /> <br />Save your money, and show Lucas where the REAL money is...not in his wallet.
0060512806|4.0|This book jumps around among multiple characters and multiple times, focusing on crytography during WW2 and the late 1990s. Even so, it is easy to follow. The characters are engaging, the history is interesting, and the book is often hilarious. There is lots of math and computer geekiana, but this doesn't serve as an impediment, even to a reader, like me, with only superficial knowledge of and interest in these things. It's a physically huge book, even in its smallest, mass-market version, but it's still a quick read. At the end, I had trouble summing up the plot, then decided I didn't care. It was a wild ride, and one with a much more satisfying ending than Stephenson's previous novels Snow Crash and The Diamond Age.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I am not a political person, but I do enjoy the occasional commentary on things when truthful.  This film is an obvious piece of propaganda with no distinguishing values at all.  I will say the same for its counter part FarenHype 9/11 (or whatever) also.  To get a glimpse of what is true one must watch both films and look past all the partisan lies.  Why watch either of these when a good view of anything you want historically speaking can easily be found in many other places that has no political motivations or ties that make you have to work at finding the truth.
B000683VI4|5.0|I saw this movie with 2 friends, I knew about the plot, and was intriuged. When I sat down in the movie theater I wasn;t expecting what I saw. The acting was tremendous, the story was hearwrenching. I started crying 20 minutes into the movie and didn't stop until 1 hour after the movie was over.I read the book and it was wonderful but the movie captured the essence of the story, and the characters. It was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen, and I would watch it a thousand times again.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino triumphantly returned to directing after a 6 year absence with the exhilarating \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1.\\"  Uma Thurman stars as \\"The Bride,\\" a deadly assassin who has been betrayed and left for dead by her cronies.  When she recovers, she seeks vengeance on them in a most spectacular manner.  The film is perfectly cast, with Uma in particular giving one of her best performances ever.<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" is as stylized a movie as you're likely to see - it seems to exist in a world never before seen.  The fight scenes are clearly the heart of the action-packed \\"Volume 1,\\" and each mêl&eacute;e is highly distinct, making the sections of the movie highly memorable.  The film is truly a mish-mash of styles - with elements of karate movies, spaghetti westerns, anime, and 70s exploitation films.  However, even though Tarantino swipes from so many genres, the result is his own peculiar blend.<br /><br />The film is told in an episodic manner, replete with title cards announcing each \\"chapter.\\"  In addition, each \\"chapter\\" has been conceptualized and filmed in a different style.  As always, Tarantino has found the perfect music to accompany scenes, with the help of rapper RZA.  Perhaps his greatest strength as a director is matching a cool visual to the right music, even employing music from pan-flute player Zamfir!  I'm not always a fan of action films, but I was genuinely blown away by this movie.  Most highly recommended.<br /><br />DVD extras: Trailers of Tarantino films and a brief, 22-minute \\"making of\\" documentary.
B00007CVSH|5.0|There has never been, and probably never will be, an Il Trovatore better than this one. Superb singing, acting, and staging on the production side, and superb video and audio quality on the recording side.  Get this one!!!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is easily the most refreshing release that I've had the privilege of listening to since Kill 'Em All/Ride the Lightning.  <br /> <br />Synyster Gates is breathtaking; all of his solos fit the songs perfectly and aren't just thoughtlessly shoved in to make it fit into the metal mold. His solo in \\"I Won't See You Tomorrow, Pt. 2\\" [circa 2:40] is incredible--I almost want to cry everytime I hear it [it's like a great Kerry King solo except it actually fits the song perfectly]! <br /> <br />I definitely hear the Pantera, Iron Maiden and  [old] Metallica in this band!
0393035158|3.0|Harris is way too timid in his attacks on religion. There is so much he doesn't even touch. For example, he doesn't say a word about the abject absurdities of Mormonism (one of the fastest growing religions in the world). He hardly says a word about the absurdities of Buddhism and Hinduistic nonsense. And Sikhs. He doesn't lambast Bush enough -- the praying idiot. He doesn't say nearly enough about the Jewish fanatics in occupied Palestine -- like the one who opened fire on praying Muslims in a mosque a few years back, killing over 30 was it? He even accepts that Jesus truly existed, which any objective scholar knows is a lie (see Earl Doherty and Robert Price's latest for starters). he doesn't adequately explore that slavery was justified by religion, as well as most of colonialism's bloody record. He does make a lot of great points and I am really glad he wrote this book. Unfortunately, religion is based on the irrational, so rational arguments --such as those that fill Harris's book -- don't work. Oh well. Still, there's always hope. After all, much of Europe - especially enlightened Scandinavia -- has learned to discard religion's absurdities and replace them with humane social policy and excellent education.
B000001FMX|5.0|Before this cd,I had never heard any song from the New York Dolls.I heard that they were bad,heard that they were good.Well being at the store one night,not finding any other cd I wanted,I got the New York Dolls. <br />From the moment I put this cd in,I did not regret it.It was wonderful,slow paced punk rock at it's best.Buy this cd,especially if you are into early punk (i.e.,Iggy Pop and the Stooges)
B00005JNH0|5.0|Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster perfectly explains the hectic lifestyle of America's most successful heavy-metal band ever. This film, even if you are not a fan of Metallica,really makes you understand what it takes to dominate the musical world. From laughs to cries, this movie touches anyones heart, and people see why these 4 guys have it so good, but not so good at the same time. Metallica: Some Kind of Monster is an exeptional documentory and I recommend it for anyone.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I just bought and watched this film for the first time last night. I have been wanting to see it for years because I'm a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, but just never got around to it. This movie plays as both a drama and a dark comedy, mixing these elements together really work in this movie and it will have you seriously focused on a scene one second and grinning the next. This is one of Johnny Depp's earlier roles and it shows that even over 10 years ago this guy was and still is something special. Every movie I have seen him in he completely changes his look, accent, and mannerisms. There is already Oscar buzz for his role in Finding Neverland which will be out in early November (Go Johnny!). Martin Landau is equal to Depp in the acting department here. Many of Ed Wood's closest friends said that Depp nailed the part, but Landau got most of the attention and even an Oscar win for his part as Bela Lugosi. Everything in this movie from the music to the acting is pitch perfect. Who would have thought a film about a terrible director would become a gifted director's work of art?
B00000JCOV|1.0|Man when I was young lad I was trying to find my niche in music taste starting off with thrash metal bands so of course I decided to give nu metal a try so I had to listen to some friends of mine who were raving that slipknot was one of the best bands out there so I went out and bought this album which was like 4 years ago I listened to it a great deal then I started getting my head outta my A** and went back to listening to thrash and in the process also started digging deep into the underground metal scene and found out that slipknot was nothing but crap with rapping vocals diguised as thos of death metal, downtuned guitars, and all 9 members playing crap totally killing what they thought was death metal and corey sux ass at singing in the fact that first he has this wanna-be death metal growl and then he switches to a (...)hard/metalcore voice then his lyrical theme is simply pathetic you want a good vocalist/guitarist/lyric writer check out Chuck Schuldiner(R.I.P) of Death. joey is probably the only alright thing to happen to this band he's not the best i've heard but he's got talent. I'll admit mick has some pretty decent guitar riffs here and there and trust me i saw some slipknot tabs online and boy it just took a quick glimps to get surfacing and wait and bleed down on guitar even my little would-be guitarist brother can get slipknot song down in an hour but all in all it's crap in comparison to the likes of real metal bands like Entombed, Death, Cannibal Corpse, Hypocrisy, Carcass, Obituary, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Sepultura, Death Angel and Morbid Angel so forget buying this B.S. and stuff from any other nu metal band it's all poser(...)
0784011680|5.0|This is one of my fav flicks. Downey at his best, great score by John Barry which i listen to more than just once in a blue moon. i still can't get over Downey not winning the oscar, i was utterly depressed when Al took it home. Life isn't fair i suppose :) <br />Oh well but i totally recommend this movie. Watch it and get ready to fall in love with Robert and his portrayal of Chaplin.
0156012197|4.0|The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery is a wonderful story that relates to all ages. On the superficial level it is a great children's book that makes kids interested in reading and the great illustrations allow everyone to visualize what the author intended. For the adults a deeper meaning is found below the interesting level that reveals facts of \\"weird adults.\\" <br />  <br />The way in which the characters are portrayed add so much to the story. Each of the many characters are described in great detail and the cute pictures just make you want to read on and on. The story is so true to life readers end with an uplifted view of life or an idea that a change to make their life more simple is needed. I recommend that everyone read this great little story to either themselves, their children, or their grandchildren. Everyone will appreciate The Little Prince.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I think when I say that Led Zeppelin is the best band to ever have existed, most people would agree. If not, then buying this DVD would prove it. DVD one contains the best old Zeppelin, including one of my favorites, \\"How Many More Times\\" and also John Bonham's drum solo, \\"Moby Dick\\". But DVD two is AMAZING, with great song after great song. It starts off with \\"Immigrant Song\\", which wasn't recorded as well as the rest of the DVD...once \\"Black Dog\\" opens and you see Robert Plant and the gang on stage, it is unbelievable. This DVD looks like it was literally shot yesterday. I have never seen anything like it before. And, it has my favorite Led Zeppelin song ever, \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". The on-stage performance that Zeppelin gives is absolutely amazing. \\"Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp\\" is perhaps the most catchy song on the DVD, which sounds much better live than on the records. I honestly can say that they should charge more for this DVD, because if I knew how good it would be, I would have paid at least 50 dollars for it. Way to go, Page.
0634021869|5.0|When you've got Eric Clapton and B. B. King handing off songs to each other, you've got twice the value of most normal blues songs.  And this book puts out double the value that way.  Just flip this one open to DAYS OF OLD and watch these two six-string storytellers weave the tapestry tight on this shuffle.  If you'd like to \\"see how it's done\\", then pick up this book. <br /> <br />To me, the only thing that could make this any better would for the album to have included my two favorite guitarists - Carlos Santana and Henry Garza of Los Lonely Boys - in a four way demonstration of skill; and, of course, for this book to then have the four-way view of the action on stage! <br /> <br />Pick up a copy - this is a good one.
B0002SROT0|5.0|I must say that I am extremely annoyed with everyone who is picking this album apart mainly because they don't think it is EXACTLY what Elliot would have wanted. I say focus on the music itself, because that is what truly expresses the real Elliot Smith, and this music is absolutely beautiful. I have heard a decent amount of criticism for this album because it was released post humously, so I did not have high expectations when I picked it up. I'm glad I didn't, because I was completely blown away. This music is amazing, and you can feel Elliot slowly falling apart through his music, which is very depressing, but makes for some amazing tracks. I recommend this album to EVERYONE to support the memory of Elliot Smith and as an AMAZING album.    R.I.P Elliot Smith- one of the best song writers of our age
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I'm torn. On one hand, this is an outstanding album and why even make an attempt to analyze it - just enjoy!  And I do. On the other hand, I can't help but be a little puzzled, a little cynical. Norah Jones, Joss Stone, Diana Krall, Madeleine Peyroux. The great white hopes of soul, jazz and blues? Or just very talented earnest singers who should not be faulted for the fact that most record byers are white, because, well, the majority of the US population is white. But there are tons of black singers out there who could do the same thing, yet they wouldn't get the same attention.  By the way: it's not a \\"color thing\\", it's a culture thing. If you take a white kid and expose her/him to soul/blues/jazz, you'll probably end up with someone who can play and sing like the best of 'em in those genres. Leave her/him at the Lutheran church stiffly singing hymns every Sunday and you'll end up with someone who can sing: hymns. Is it reverse racism? After all, thankfully, we no longer find it unusual to hear a black opera singer, decades after Paul Robeson and Marion Anderson paved the way, so why do I always squirm a little when another white singer comes along who can sing \\"black\\" music? Yes, I know black music took from white country and vice versa and it's all one big hodge podge after all. So then maybe it's the pretense or the clever marketing that bugs me. As when Joss Stone's face was \\"hidden\\" on the cover photo Soul Sessions, making us think that she was black maybe? Why not just come out and say it like it is - here's a white girl who loves to sing soul music and let's cut the b.s.?  I liked Soul Sessions at first by the way, but tired of it very quickly. (Why do I never tire of Aretha?)     This is not a personal vendetta: I have heard and read interviews with Krall, Jones, Stone, and Peyroux and they are all truly nice people who do the music because they love it. It's the label people and the marketing sharks that ruin it.    I also have to add: if Peyroux and her producer Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell's ex) didn't want her to sound like Billie Holiday, then why produce the record to make it sound like it was recorded in the 1930s/1940s/1950s?  Again: why the pretense? Why not just say: here's a singer who sound almost exactly like Holiday and we wanted to take full advantage of that?     Having said all that, I can't help but give this five stars because it is a gorgeous album, a goosebump kind of album and they don't come along very often. My favorite track is the last one on the record: \\"This is heaven to me\\", incorporating a Nino Rota composition. Very fitting, since this record is kind of surreal, kind of Fellini like.     NOTE: It's now December of 2006 and I want to add that I heard M.P. live on KCRW last year and was sorely disappointed. She actually sang off key several times, I was shocked. Hope she's not that bad at her concerts!
0375805613|5.0|It's hard to trace one's love of reading to any one book, but The Monster at the End of This Book is at least, in my case, the prime suspect. It was my favorite bedtime story when I was five, a fact only partly attributable to my father's hysterical impression of Grover. It's definitely the kind of book that makes you want to have children just so you can read it to them.
B000050XEI|1.0|This album is for the weak. The main audience compromises of people with mid life crisis. Its just boring and not uplifting. Also, as someone else pointed out, seems like every song uses the same formula. There is no variety in this one. Only Time is one of the most depressing songs, that could seriously drive a person to suicide.
B0000062GE|5.0|First things first...Stabbing did release a self-titled album and it was their last. It is part of my collection and it is a good CD, but the style is totally different. They went a whole lot softer. <br />   Anyways, this CD...This CD owns! It has a very dark and gothic feel to it, the mood of the whole album is a depressing one, but not in a bad way. The sound is very varied throughout the entire album, no one song sounds like another. If I had to pick favorite songs on this CD, would go with \\"Darkest Days\\" (short but sweet), \\"Save Yourself\\", and \\"Desperate Now\\". That's not to say that EVERY song isn't great, because when I play this CD, i press play and let it go without skipping a single track. All in all this CD is probably Stabbing Westward's best CD in my opinion. If you don't have it, at least give it a try because its well worthy of any rocker's collection.
B0001AP12G|1.0|OVER HYPED! Kanye West is being heavily promoted only because MTV is trying to push in a more 'serious' rapper with a pretentious name (I am sure his real name is either Tyrone or Jamal) like Kanye West. If you want rap, real rap, listen to Eminem, Vanilla Ice, Marky Mark, Beastie Boys, Kid Rock or Limp Bizkit. Those are real rap bands not LOSERS like Kanye West.    Highlight: MTV uses this loser as a tool to show everyone that they care abou underground \\"real\\" rappers. BS.

B00003CX95|5.0|BRAVEHEART is like a gigantic, beautifully ornamented chocolate eclair, beautiful and delicious looking, but once you bite in to it, you realize how little there really is inside.<br /><br />In a recent poll of critics, BRAVEHEART was listed as one of Oscar's \\"embarrassments\\"---a film that should not have won the Best Picture Oscar.  I tend to agree, although I do not dismiss the fact that Mel Gibson has mounted a sumptuous, rousing, extremely visceral adventure about a man and his quest for freedom.  The battle scenes are some of the best of this nature ever put on film.  Gibson does overuse slomo; he does paint William Wallace as a Christ-like martyr, and as he would do years later in his controversial \\"Passion,\\" Gibson subjects his hero to an extended torture scene, with his fellow soldiers hiding out ala the apostles while Wallace is tortured.  Accused of making Passion his ego piece, I would venture to say that BRAVEHEART is a far bigger ego trip than Passion.  Gibson stars, directs and commandeers the movie in his image and likeness.  Mel is a smart and shrewed showman; his performance is average.  Some of the supporting actors are outstanding:  Angus McFadyen as the self-centered, self-tortured Robert of Bruce, who both befriends and betrays Wallace; Patrick McGoohan as the evil King Edward deLongshanks, a man whose own cruelty is matched by his lack of mercy and compassion; Catherine McCormack as Mel's doomed wife, whose quiet peasant beauty belies an earthly intelligence; Sophie Marceau as Prince Edward's wife, whose longing for love is captured in the glance of her gorgeous eyes; Brendan Gleeson, always dependable, this time as Gibson's big, boisterous sidekick, and Ian Bannen as the leprosy-ridden father of Robert, whose display of unimpassioned coldness both alienates and commands his son.<br /><br />Yes, an eclair; maybe shouldn't be a Best Picture Oscar winner, but one can't deny Gibson has mounted a rousing, if vacuous, entertainment.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I got the album last year, and listened to it almost every week ever since. The songs are very well chosen. I LOVE Any Road, P2 Vatican Blues and Brainwashed. This is a must-have for anyone who loves George and his music. Besides, this I also recommend getting \\"Concert For George\\" either the CD or DVD. Both of them are great masterpieces made in memmory of George.  <br /> <br />~And if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there.
B00005B36H|3.0|ok so the album begins. You're expecting alot. But YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT MET. Honestly, this album drags on and drags on, and then when it's over you're feeling pretty depressed. The instrumentals go nowhere, and sound like a band who wants to be Pink floyd, but desperately, desperately fails. They're just sound that they probably made just to take up time; not that they needed to do that because the album is long enough. The songs are long. And not for a reason; they drag on for minutes upon minutes, building you up with expectancy, then they end. The whole album leaves you hanging in the dark corners of space hoping a ship comes to get you. Why be lost when you don't need to be. A pointless 80 minutes of weird, dark, pointlessness.
068987474X|1.0|I'M A GUY AND I THINK IT'S A PIECE OF TRASH.
B000025XKM|5.0|Never has music this beautiful been made. This is a precise peice of art, and you only wish he had made 20 or so albums. IT is very bare and to the point, but it is also inspiring. On a warm Fall day, or a cool night, put this on and sit back and relax, and let the music flow over you. It's pretty amazing, and i don't know why anyone would deny that. Hope no one does. Beck's \\"Sea Change,\\" and THe Sundays must have been made with this album in mind. So if you like them you'll love this, or vice versa. Besides the first song it is just Nick Drake and his guitar in a very stripped down personal setting, that sounds so fresh it feels like he's in the room. If it is possible to cry over an album of music then this is the one you'll be crying over. IT is that beautiful.
B00005JMJG|3.0|Well, to start, I did appreciate the intellectual effort that was required to watch this movie. It was not at all predictable, with more to learn and more to wonder every moment.<br /><br />However, for all the hype that went out about this being an \\"amazing love story,\\" I found it hopeless and tiring. Though the characters are interesting and not at all flat or one-sided, the extremities of their qualities and the ongoing like/bitter hate relationship keeps you wondering who you want to \\"route\\" for and what you even want for the characters making it difficult to get any closer than the spectator in the situation (I say \\"like/bitter hate\\" because the 'love story' was poorly built up among bitter memories of verbal abuse and cheating).<br /><br />Perhaps it is all too true to life in that respect, but that's not why I sit down and watch a movie - to become overwhelmed with the same day-to-day struggles of real life. I reserve the label \\"amazing love story\\" for stories of hope or at least inspiration, not of settling time and time again knowing you'll be miserable, refusing to learn and change after all that's happened, but at least being \\"in love.\\" A sad kind of love indeed.
B000068OSK|4.0|Jack White is a powerful guitarist, singer, and a fantastic songwriter, with lyrics that unfold like a puzzle;at first you may not get it, but it is revealed to you in good time. That's what's great about the Stripes; it'll take you time to digest all they have to offer at once. IT is a process you'll want to relieve. ANd believe me this isn't just 'noise rock,' this is music with meaning, and texture. I admit meg White's drumming is ordinary; even simple. But that's what makes the White Stripes the White Stripes. It distinguishes them, and makes you take notice.<br /><br />  You may also like this album because it is extremely raw. If there is a college course in \\"Raw as Raw can be Rock\\" then this should be the album to learn about. IT is so raw you can often hear the guitar bouncing off the snare drum. I Love IT!!<br /><br />  this album is great, even amazing for a debut. The White Stripes are My favorite band because every album they become a little better, a little more mature in every aspect of the music. They have evolved into Classic. Jack and Meg White make a fantastic band.
B00005JMXX|3.0|You can pretty much depend on anything Dennis Quaid is in to be very lame.  The story is OK, the plot sort of dumb, and it takes it's time to get going.  If you buy it, just go to the scene selections and skip to the destruction scenes.  That's about all this movie has to offer.  After popping it in and struggling through the first 30 boring muinutes of it, I realized all this disc has, is great effects, which are probably worth the price of the disc, but don't buy it with hopes of it being any more than that.  Big production...Great effects...boring acting and slow starts make for a pretty lame ride.
B000002KB8|5.0|I was 15 years old when this album came out in 1970.  Unless you were present in 1970, it's probably hard to fully comprehend the significance of this album, as well as Paranoid, released in the same year, in relation to what was happening cultural wise.  Let me try to put things in context by describing the music scene in 1970. I lived on the outskirts of  Chicago. AM Radio (WLS) ruled the airwaves.  Bubblegum music (cruel jokes like the Archies passed off as music) had stubbornly carried over from the Sixties like a pesky virus. The Beatles had broken up, and very little airtime was being given to groups like Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Pink Floyd.  I was taking refuge in my bedroom in the basement one evening, painted black, replete with blacklight and strobelight, listening to an underground FM station called Triad, when suddenly Black Sabbath's Paranoid burst over the speakers.  It was as if aliens from another planet had landed. I was totally mesmerized, while at the same time deeply disturbed.  NO MUSIC....I repeat....NO MUSIC....up to this point had ever sounded this HEAVY and EVIL. And that included hard rockers like Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Hendrix.  The next day I ran out and bought this album and the Paranoid album, pestered my parents into buying  a fuzz box for my Teisco Del Rey electric guitar, and have been hooked on metal ever since.  If you are into metal, and want to know its history, you  MUST start here, in order to understand where it all began. The first five Black Sabbath albums serve as the foundation from which the heavy metal genre, and subsequent subgenres, evolved.  All the great memories I have of Ozzy, Geezer, Iommi, and Ward are on these early discs.  LONG LIVE SABBATH!
B0002KVUL6|5.0|I never had a chance to view this flick in the theatre, but I bought it the day it was released.  I knew what this film contained and could not wait for it's release.  It is obviously a product of someone who appreciates the original horror classics.  As for the people who anylize every movie they see, it might not be a favorite, but for ones like me who enjoy a great horror movie filled w/ action, suspense, and great effects, go out and pick this one up.  This disc also contains the Universal Studios classic films...Dracula,Frankenstien, and The Wolfman.  In a word - KILLER!
6300248178|5.0|This film is highly entertaining and suspenseful, with excellent cinematography and score. Arnold Schwartznegger is perfectly cast as the hero, and despite his limited acting range, he delivers a faultless performance, as he does in the Terminator trilogy. For me, as in any film I really enjoy, it is the music which makes this a 5 star production. Alan Silvestre, also responsible for the Back To The Future trilogy score provides an exceptional score that enhances the movie to a substancial degree. The strong orchestral rhythmic stabs and crescendos have you on the edge of your seat with the clues that danger is lurking round every corner. Complete with a classic stereotypical cast and script, this film delivers everything you want in a kick-ass testosterone action movie.
B00004BZ0N|1.0|Wow. The Clash were  the last \\"big\\" band I tried to get into. After hearing London Calling and Sandinista I realise I wasn't missing ANYTHING. A vocalist who cannot sing to save himself, non descript riffs, weak melodies, silly Kajagoogoo worthy backup vocals. And  none of the members rise above competent when it comes to playing their instruments. How this album managed to attain it's status is a mystery to me. I'm  not averse to punk...but this isn't punk. It's guitar pop. And not very good pop at that.  It's like The Sugarcubes, only withtout Bjorks wonderful voice you're left with that talentless moron Einar singing. Amazon hates low reviews because it means potentially less money for them so for their sake I could reccomend that you buy the \\"Garden Gnome Catching Butterflies\\" in the  Kitchen & Housewares section for your auntie as a Christmas present. All in all it seems much better value than this tripe!
B00000K31V|1.0|I bought this movie because it starred Jude Law, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Willem Dafoe.  Willem Dafoe delivers a GREAT performance--unfortunately it only lasts 10 minutes.  I knew the plot twists were coming before they got twisted and both me and my family could not get over the visual of the game pods-with their nipple-like protuberances and umbilical cord connectors.  The fact that the bioports look a bit like anusses really killed the film for my family.  I kept thinking that no real game desiger would use pods that looked like that and the minute that thought was finished I had the clue to the entire movie.  Too bad I had that thought about 0.2 seconds after seeing the pods for the first time.  The production values are good and if you are a fan of the moviemaker's then watch this film.  If you are a sci-fi fan, Jude Law or other star of this film fan don't bother.  You will be left wondering what bill needed to be paid that your fave star bothered to make this turkey of a flick.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was lucky to attend the festival in Dallas this summer.  While the songs selected for the DVD aren't always the ones I would have picked (Buddy Guy blew everyone else away, but he is conspicuously absent except for the ensemble numbers), this is nontheless sure to be a great DVD.  Clapton was brilliant as usual, Santana was fantastic and ZZ Top were their usual eccentric selves.<br /><br />John Mayer, Jonny Lang and Robert Randolph were all excellent newcomers in the mostly over-50 lineup.  Jimmie Vaughan and his Tilt-a-whirl band served as a fantastic houseband, backing up the many blues legends on hand.<br /><br />Some disappointing omissions ... Robert Randolph's \\"I Need More Love\\" ,a surprising show-stealer on the second day of the festival is not listed.  Same with John Mayer's \\"Come Back To Bed\\".  Styx put on a surprisingly good set of cover tunes, from the Beatles' \\"I Am The Walrus\\" to BB King's \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\".  Also, Eric Clapton's set on the third day included a nice selection of songs from his new album of Robert Johnson covers that are omitted here.<br /><br />That said, I still pre-ordered my copy as soon as I saw it announced.  They could have made it a four disc set with more material and doubled the price and I still would have bought it.
B0006213WG|1.0|I'll start off by saying that I dont hate these guys as much as I hate Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, but they still suck! Oh...so...tired...falling...asleep...(snore)...(snore)........................................................................................................................................ <br />Oh huh! Okay, I took a nap because of how boring this album was in the backround, I thought I'd play it while I was writing this review so I could write exactly how I felt about it and what do you know! I fell asleep! Thats how boring and cheesy this is. JUST DONT BUY THIS, PLEASE!

B00008CLOA|5.0|This album can only be matched by Led Zeppelins 'Physical Graffiti' ('75), Metallicas 'Master of Puppets' ('86), AC\DC's 'Back in Black' ('80) and Nirvanas 'In Utero' ('93). Other than those four albums this stands as one of the most important masterpieces ever created! The music? Lets just say that this album was able to stay on the charts for about a year, not good enough? Well then I have to say that before this album became huge almost nobody knew of using the keyboard in a rock band. Still not enough? Pink Floyd are one of the most influencial bands of all time, if it wasn't for them then many great bands would never have even come to the verge of being created. These guys took the guitar-driven rock of Led Zep and slowed it down a bit, thus becoming amazing at something that people would never think was possible at being good at. If that isn't reason enough then you are a retard, oh yeah and basically every song on this album is amazing! I own 2 copies of this (The 30th anniversery and the original) and both of them rock! Pink Floyd IS the greatest band that ever used a keyboard and thats still around! ...
B00000J2PH|5.0|Wow! It has been 33 years since songwriter Carole King released her debut album TAPESTRY. King co-wrote with Gerry Goffin WILL YOU LOVE ME TOMORROW? for the Shirelles in or around 1960. She was eighteen years old then. King's recording of the hit song is on this album with other #1 hits I FEEL THE EARTH MOVE,SO FAR AWAY,IT'S TOO LATE and YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND,later covered by James Taylor. Taylor is a guest on this album. Minor hits include BEAUTIFUL,WHERE YOU LEAD and a cover of (YOU MAKE ME FEEL)LIKE A NATURAL WOMAN. The latter was a hit for Aretha Franklin in 1967. In 1996,the various artists album TAPESTRY REVISITED was released commemorating the 25th anniversary of this album's release. One hit from TR was Rod Stewart's cover of SO FAR AWAY. Gloria Estefan recorded IT'S TOO LATE for her 1994 album HOLD ME,THRILL ME,KISS ME. Amy Grant's cover of that song is on TR. SO FAR AWAY also appears on Stewart's 1996 album,IF WE FALL IN LOVE TONIGHT. Unfortunately,King had no subsequent megahit albums and some of them are out of print and never were re-issued on CD. King's post-TAPESTRY hits include SWEET SEASONS,CORAZON,BEEN TO CANAAN and JAZZMAN. Other female solo artists with smash debut albums include Whitney Houston(her '85 self-titled album),Alanis Morrisette(95's JAGGED LITTLE PILL),Mariah Carey(her '90 self-titled album) and Sheryl Crow(93's TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB). In addition to King,all aforementioned artists have won a multitude of Grammys.
B000006TRV|5.0|All I can say is that this is, while not as good as DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, is still a very awesome album. I own this and all I can say is that every song here is amazing. Hell you should buy this just because 'Another Brick in the Wall, part 2' is on this, which is probably Pink Floyds most famous song. That loser Sunburnt Albino (aka Henry McPruter) will burn in hell for insulting Pink Floyd! Unless he's joking then he doesn't deserve to live, well maybe not that bad, but he is still a retard. Pink Floyd is the best band that uses a keyboard and thats still around. Other bands like Metallica and AC\DC have died in the past few years but Pink Floyd still has it!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This movie employs unique film-making techniques to tell the tale of four lives careening towards utter destruction.  Does this sound like dark material?  Well yes it is.  Is it finely done?  Well yes it is that too.<br /><br />You end up getting sucked into these people's lives which start off fairly innocuous enough.  All four main characters are played extremely believingly.  Jared Leto is the son to Ellen Burstyn's diet-pill addiction mother.  Marlon Wayans is the oh so cool buddy to Leto while Jennifer Connelly (bewitchingly beautiful) is the girlfriend that will go to demeaning ends to get a fix.<br /><br />The message is loud and clear.  Innocent addictions start with baby steps and can lead to utter despair and destruction.  You only need to watch once to get that message but once you watch you'll be thinking twice before drinking too much coffee, venturing to the seamier sides of life, or being lured into other addictions.  I'm sure that wasn't necessarily the movie's or director Darren Aronofsky's intent but that's what spoke loud and clear to me.<br /><br />The pacing and perspective are intensely neurotic and visually portray an addiction so enticing and powerful that it can wipe out the humaneness of four lives right off the map.  It's hard to watch but worth watching once.<br /><br />--MMW
B000000OSG|4.0|1. Civil War: One of the best songs on, here with 3(?) solos. This song pick up at, and after the chouruses, but the slow parts are equally good. 10/10 <br />2. 14 Years: Avarage, but it is kinda cathcy so...8/10 <br />3. Yesterdays: It's a good song, but fo some reason I never really liked this one. Plus, the video is pretty gay. 6/10 <br />4.Knockin' On Heaven's Door: Personally, I don't care if the cover is \\"off-taget,\\" or \\"misinterpreted,\\" it's definitely one of the better pieces on here. 8.5/10 <br />5. Get In The Ring: If this track would've been left off the album it would have have made a huge difference. The chanting at the end, and the un-necessary speeches, plus the obscene lyrics make this song a low point for this album. The music isn't bad, but overall, it's just 4.5/10 <br />6. Shotgun Blues: Again...just an avarege song, but it's still pretty good. 8/10 <br />7. Breakdown: A very good song, and it makes up for \\"Get In The Ring,\\" but the chorus is, well...it's just a little out of place. 9/10 <br />8. Pretty Tied Up: An Izzy song, with a great chorus, although most of it is forgetable. Anyway...8.5/10 <br />9. Locomitve (Complicity): A speedy, funk-esque rocker, and it's pretty lengthy too. Some say it overstays its welcome,and even though it could've used a trimming, it's still listenable, sice the last minute and a half, is completely different that the rest. 9.5/10 <br />10. So Fine: Easily the worst song of the entire set. Why is Duff singing? Why are the lyrics so bad? The band has hit rock bottom here. 1/10 <br />11. Estranged: Ahh, this song almost makes me forget how awful \\"So FIne\\" is. It's the longest piece, the best piece, and the one with the most changes. at about 4 minutes in the song changes completely, with a scetion of only bass and piano. Then, it intruduces an entirely new chorus, and 2 solos from Slash. What about the first 4 minutes? Well, it starts out a ballad, then with a strong strum, kicks into a very catchy guitar-driven section. An excellent song. In fact, this is the best song on the set. 700/10 <br />12. You Could Be Mine: A rocker that never slows down, and doesn't go out of style. It has great choruses, great verses, and as is required: a blistering solo. 10/10 <br />13. Don't Cry (alt. lyrics): If you like the original, you'd like this one too. I personally think the choruses brings down the song, but it's still not bad. 6.5/10 <br />14. My World: Some kind of industrial techno rap. I find this song, enjoyable, and it's something you'd never expect from GnR. A good/interesting closer. 9/10 <br />  A few weak songs hurt the album, but it's still worth your money. I'm tempted to say that this is the better of the two, but of course, everyone has their own thoughts on that...
0446310786|4.0|The book, To Kill a Mocking Bird by Harper Lee, had primarily involved a lesson in racism and society reaction towards it. The book surrounds itself towards a society that has different opinions concerns people of different classes and races maybe because the story surrounds itself in the south.  The novel describes a family named Finch, which is lead by a father Atticus who tries to teach his children the right way to think. The daughter and son, Scout and Jem, are basically children born to learn through a society that doesn't seem too kindly towards African Americans. It shows the life of Scout from her friends like Boo Radley, which describes his home almost as a Haunted House, to her days in school with a teacher who has a negative attitude towards her. The teacher basically believes that she is almost like a showoff and that her learning is a sort of a distraction towards the class. This sense leads to a trial that deals with a case involving Atticus Finch. It basically shows a black man named Tom Robinson who was accused of raping a girl named Mayaella Ewell. Even though in some parts of the trial where Mr. Robinson was known to be innocent, the white panel named the man guilty. The ending shows a situation where even under certain situations; a black man cannot be victories under white power. <br /> <br />I believe this book a gives a good piece of information on just how the lifestyle is in the south or a white dominated society. The people seem to be lacking equality and don't really tend to have a sense of pity towards Africans. The people avoid interpersonal communication, which is necessary in a development of a society. This communication basically gives equality to all classes by providing conversations to each person.  If every is talked to and involved equality then racism and class difference wouldn't need to be a major problem in the southern society. Some of my favorite parts would have to be when they imagine the Radley's house as mysterious andfrightening. Especially when the children were spying on the Radley's and they arrived at there house in fear while Jem forgot that he left his pants on the fence. Another scene which is more touching than funny is when they execute Tom Robinson. A person could almost feel the pain of Atticus Finch when he feels that he has died and all the work he has done to help the man went to waste. This book touches a person in many levels and explores many different controversial subjects by describing it in a situation of a Lawyer and his family. I believe people who are interested in a book who like adventures, drama, and comedy while being told a lesson on racism should read it. <br />
B0002KVULG|2.0|Wonderful movie but the color transfer is pathetic, and don't say that's the way it was, I saw it on screen when released and have the VHS and the color was/is vibrant and bright, hell even the ads at the time read \\"In Full Color\\". This 2004 DVD version is an injustice to the movie and it's loyal fans. Shame on you Badham if you made Universal do a new color palette and shame on you Universal for releasing such a vapid copy of a wonderful genre film. I'll stick with my pan and scan VHS copy until someone releases this puppy the way it was first born!
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Its Parsons, the King of Electronics. An album like this was inevitable.  From The Avenue, it seemed obvious that this album would be unlike any of his others and it is.  Don't expect anything that you've heard before by him.  The vocals are near non-existent and the sound is alot more in your face.  After only a few listens, the album sounds very well produced, as usual.  The bass is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br />This album would be interesting to hear on 5.1 when it comes out.  Make no mistake, this is more electronica than classic Parsons.  It certainly is worth listening to.
B000002H97|5.0|I still like this album.  Metallica showed more of their true colors on this album.  The writing as well as the powerful big sound of the music are still dynamic.  Enter Sandman is no contest to songs like Wherever I May Roam, The Struggle Within, Sad But True ( and Lars Ulrich's funky beats on the drumming), and others. The ballads are all solid, yet still rock and have loud guitars within them.  I've played The Unforgiven and its acoustic guitar sections a lot.  Nothing Else Matters is like the twin brother to Unforgiven in the power ballad sense.  But my favorite song here is My Friend of Misery, where everything clicks, from the quiet dramatic break around the fourth minute,t to the guitar solo exploding after it.  I wonder why that wasn't a single from the album.  But the writing of James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich are superb, the production of Bob Rock is top notch and Jason Newsted and Kirk Hammett's inclusions on the album were what made this album win numerous awards, even some Grammy awards too!  Nothing they've put out afterwards has come close to this effort!
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is one of my all time favorite movies. ( If you've never seen this you might not want to read this.  I give away the ending. )  From the first shot of a suburbian street in the fall, which is also the last thing we see, to the look on Kevin Spacy's face after he was shot.  The look is such a look of contentment, a look of peace.   <br />    <br />Lester Burnham as he puts it \\" have been living in a coma for 20 +/- years.\\"  From an outsiders perspective he, his wife Carolyn and their daughter Jane live the perfect suburian life.  They have the nice house with the white picket fence, a well manicured lawn, and beautiful roses.  At a closer look we see that their life is  far from perfect.  Lester and his wife don't talk, Carolyn is bitter and cold towards him and a little towards her daughter.  \\" Janie honey are you trying to look unattractive.\\" \\" Yes\\" \\"Congragulations you've suceeded admirably.\\"  Carolyn is very wrapped up in her career and is very hard on herself when she doesn't meet her goals. Jane is like any other teenager, angry and confused.  She is saving up money for a breast augmentation, we see her breasts later in the movie and they are pleanty big.  She hangs out with a girl named Angela Hayes who is a \\"model\\" or so she likes to think, who says she has done something with a lot of guys we find out later that that isn't true.  <br /> <br /> Move next door to the Fitz's house.  The father Col. Frank Fitz rules his house with an iron fist.  His wife is spaced out throughout the entire movie.  It took me awhile to recognize her as Allison Janney.  The actions of her are in no doubt a reaction to the likely abuse she suffered from her husband.  Their son Ricky has recently been released from a mental hospital.  He sells pot behind his father's back and makes quite a lot of money doing it.  He covers for this by having a job as a cater waiter.  Ricky is required to give his father a urine sample every 6 months to make sure he stays clean.  Onenight Ricky smokes with Lester at a realator dinner, and that night his father asks him for a urine sample.  Never fear, Ricky is very crafty.  One of his clients is a nurse in a piediatrics office and she gives him clean urine samples.   <br /> <br />Lester and Carolyn go to Jane's school to watch her performance on the dance team and that is where Lester meets Angela Hayes.  She does something to captivate him and make him feel more alive than he has in years. He falls in lust with her.  She too thinks he is rather cute and wouldn't mind screwing him, if he worked out a little.   Lester hears this and immeadiatly starts to work out.  Life at Lester's work is no bed of roses either.  He is required to write up a report as to why he is a valuable member of the team and he writes up one saying how much he hates his job.  He is of course fired, but he was happy because he wanted to get a job with the least amount of responsibilty possible.  He sells his car and buys his dream car a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  He now speands his days working out, smoking pot, and working at a fast food place.  This really pisses off Carolyn and she finds comfort in her buisness competition Buddy Kane , \\" The Real Estate King.\\"  She finds he has all the same buisness ideas and policies that she does and begins to have an affair with him.  This makes Carolyn become  more alive than she seems to have been any other time.  It's funny that in order for this husband and wife to feel more alive they had to cheat on their spouse or dream of cheating on their spouse. <br /> <br />Lets go back next door and see what is up with the Fitz's.  Ricky and Jane have started to become an item and Ricky shows her the \\" most beautiful thing I have ever filmed\\" a plastic bag was caught in a windstorm with a bunch of leaves.  I will say that the video was pretty amazing.  One night Lester beeps Ricky because he ran out of pot. Ricky says he is going over to give Jane her geometry book.  Col.Frank suspects thatsomething is up and goes to the window that looks into the Burnhams garage.  He sees Lester and Ricky in there and it looks like Ricky is doing something to Lester when actually he is rolling a joint for him.  This enrages Frank and when Ricky gets home he yells at him and tells him to get out.  \\" I'd rather you be dead than a f****** faggot\\"  Ricky leaves without a problem he has gained quite a substansial income from all the drug dealing. Frank is upset and goes to Lester's garage and kisses him.  You can see here that Frank had some underlying homosexual tendancies.  Ricky goes to Jane and asks her to go to New York with him.  Angela is at Jane's house at the time and they have a fight about her dad and Jane leaving with Ricky.  Angela goes downstairs and cries, Lester comes in and talks to her.  Angela says she wants to sleep with him and they almost do until Angela admits that she is a virgin.  Lester stops and makes her a sandwhich and asks her if Jane is happy. <br /> <br />Angela leaves to go to the bathroom, and Lester sits down at table and looks at a picture of Carolyn at a carnival.  We then see a gun barral pointed at the back of Lester's head the camera moves to the wall and we hear a shot and see blood spattered on a wall.  We hear a monolouge by Lester and find out that Frank Fitz killed him, because he didn't want him to tell anyone that he had kissed him. <br /> <br />This was an amazing movie.  The feeling that I got from the movie was that we have to look closer at things because they aren't always what they seem.  We also need to relax, breathe, and take a look around at all the beauty that is in the world.  \\" I guess I should be pretty pissed off at what happend to me, but it is hard to stay mad when there is so much beauty in the world.\\"
B000002H97|2.0|I bought this album after listening to and loving the two albums Mater Of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All. I went to HMV with this CD in mind, because I had heard Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and Nothing Else Matters on the radio and liking them. I bought this album despite the fact i had heard that this was the album Metallica sold out. Well, let me tell you, they did sell out. I preffered Metallica when they played 8 minute masterpieces, not 4 minutes of mainstream crap that ANYONE can say they like. I hate it when people say they like Metallica when all they have ever heard are the Black Album, St. Anger, or anything off the Load albums. If you want REAL Metallica, then buy anything before the Black Album. The first four albums are incredible. Don't buy this one.  <br />GOOD MUSIC: Mushroomhead, In Flames, Lamb Of God, Meshuggah, Pre-Black Album Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Killswitch Engage, Fear Factory... the list goes on. <br />Keep Shredding<br />Jack Metal
B000003TA4|4.0|Hey man, all the music you listen to is pathetic...really....its really amazing...in 4 lines you just insulted some of the BEST MUSICIANS EVER...man...limp bizkit created metal...haha limp bizkit is one of the worst bands I've ever heard...and Avril Lavigne...messiah...haha im sure you havent listen Janis Joplin...Beetohven and Mozart (and all the others bands and musicians you named), were/are more than what you are going to be in your whole life...Its really sad that guys like you consider themselves Nirvana fans...and man...Kurt is one of my heroes...but hey, he wasnt the best guitarist ever...Lavigne plays guitar?...oh, then everyone can play guitar...well...all the bands you dont like are some of the bests...and the ones you like are crap (excepting Nirvana of course)... <br />PD: I give Nevermind 4 stars 'cause its good...but a little overrated....In Utero is better
B00005JMH2|4.0|I saw the Japanese version of this movie about one year ago.  It was enjoyable but not in any way was it equal to the performance by Richard Gere.  This movie had a good story line, was easy to follow and quite pleasant.  The only drawback in the entire movie was the use of the F word one time about twenty minutes before the end of the show.  There was absolutely no reason to inject the word and I found that dissapointing.  All in all it was a great movie and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends.
B000003TAR|5.0|Well...I think this is the Best Nirvana Studio Album...Hey!, Nevermind is excelletn, but its a bit overrated (only a bit)all the songs form In Utero are good or excellent... I think its a Must Have...
B00013F38K|5.0|I liked this series so much when it first came out that when TV Land was created with Nickelodeon, I have repeatedly told them that this series was \\"Made for TV Land\\".  --  Like others that have written reviews for this, I'm waiting anxiously for the next season to come out. <br />
B00067BBQE|5.0|To see a band with the talent this one does live is like entering total Nirvana.  The vocal talents, and musical stylings of the band are angelic, unrelenting, and almost to good to be real.  Almost!  But with this EvLive DVD release, there is no reason why you shouldnt be able to see this display of uncalibrated talent firsthand.  Their CD Fallen is just one sample of this bands uncompromising poise.  The voice of Amy Lee is just as good (if not better) live as it is on cd.  A band full of talented musicians is hard to come by these days.   <br />So do yourself a favor! Buy the movie (and cd if you dont already have it) and DON'T miss out on one of the greatest concert experiences of your life.  If your not a huge fan of the band now, after watching them Live, or listening to their cd, I Promise you will be an avid fan after.  GO Ev!
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is the first time it's ever been released in its original, classically framed, gorgeously black-and-white filmed, Panavision widescreen format. Aside from that, it is one of the best films ever. You are a true MONSTER if this film does not move you to tears. This one reaches DEEP into one's heart, and asks - demands, really - you to empathize with another's person's tortured soul. THIS is Anthony Hopkins finest performance EVER. When you watch a film as emotionally involving, you come away feeling grateful to be healthy, lucky even. This is a true testament to the psychology of cruelty, how ingrained it is. From the night watchman to the kids in the train station: man's unkindness, disrespect, and cruelty to one another is something people will always have to struggle against. Credit to Freddie Francis also for a superb envisioning of Olde Industrial London.    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL DVD BOX ART?! This looks much worse.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Most Yes fans will try to sell you facts about 'how long this song is' or 'how non-commercial this is'. I don't care if an album is comercial or not. I am not a progsnob. I don't like Frank Zappa or 'Discipline'. Simply enough, I like music, and this album is impressive musically. While retaining normal, earpleasing forms of songwriting, Yes creates an intelligent, deep, reflective album. Chris Squire's bass still kicks serious butt while not being too wiierd. Jon Anderson's vocals are strong, he doesn't sound like elf man yet, and original drummer Bill Bruford has not left yet, because Anderson's lyrics are not that trippy yet. Songs like 'Roundabout', 'South Side of the Sky', 'Mood For A Day', and 'The Fish' still remain among my favorites. If you like the lighter forms of prog, but this album.
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is the best one yet! Even though seeing and hearing &quot; She Will Be Loved&quot; like million times, I still like it. Especially &quot; Harder to Breathe&quot;. That song is awesome! Even though it is like a Stevie Wonder thing, it still sounds good. It's like, who isn't gonna use different artist's ideas? People who are thinking about buying this cd, do because if you like &quot; This Love&quot;, &quot; She Will Be Loved,&quot; and &quot; Harder to Breathe&quot;, this cd is meant for you!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I first saw this the weekend it opened in Melbourne,Florida.  When I returned home to Oregon I started looking for a copy of this to share with family and friends.  I found a copy outside the US months before this went on sale here.  I guess I should feel bad about that, but I don't.  Might even have broken some law but I STILL do not feel bad.  I have let people borrow this; passed it around to friends and their friends.  Oregon has lost so much and is still not back on her feet.  If George Bush has his way he will sell this state out to the highest bidder.  I started the journey to finding out the truth about Mr. Bush after realizing that what I was seeing on Fox News was NOT news!  I began to watch, read, dig, study and learn.  I am not interested in editorial opinion from those that stand to lose nothing.  I would rather read what is written by those that really have something to say and are willing to put their money where their mouth (or pen) is.  Enter Michael Moore.  I always thought I would like this guy.  Roger Smith should have passed on what he learned from Mr. Moore.  NEVER stand in the way of an honest man with a mission!
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Being a big fan of prog, learning about a new Alan Parsons release caught my attention. While not a bad album (some artists simply cannot release a bad production), this album sounds more like Robert Miles than your classic Alan Parsons. It's got more ambient beats and a EuroPop feel than anything else, which is not wrong: it just makes comparisons to Pink Floyd, ELO or Jethro Tull more inappropriate than, say, comparing his current work to today's Tears for Fears.
0393035158|5.0|James Thurber was the Aesop of  \\"The New Yorker\\". In a series of wry tales he called \\"Fables for Our Time\\" and \\"Further Fables for Our Time\\" he encoded the lessons of the board room and the back room for his children and ours. Reading these tales, no one could ever forget the strategic deterrent, \\"Don't count your boobies before they are hatched.\\" <br /> <br />Now Sam Harris has offered up a ball-busting account of the mechanisms which have wound too tightly the puppet show of contemporary cultural and political affairs. In the spirit of the moral fabulists, I will summarize his central argument by way of a bed time story, which I call \\"The Assassins at the Feast\\". <br /> <br />Once upon a time, there were two cities. The residents of one city began every statement with the phrase, \\"I believe....\\" The denizens of the other city began all of their communications with \\"Why?....\\" <br /> <br />The Believers felt very secure because they were sure of what they knew, and that was that. They built huge, ornate buildings to memorialize Most Absolute Truth. When the time came to act, they acted, and woe unto anyone who got in their way. <br /> <br />The Questioners were always finding something that didn't quite fit with what they thought. What they were sure of today, might seem totally wrong tomorrow. They knew of no ultimate authority, and could deal with uncertainty only by asking \\"Why?\\" <br /> <br />The Believers dealt with uncertainty by declaring it the work of an Evil Genius, an unseen presence whose followers were legion. Whenever they encountered anyone who questioned their Most Absolute Truth, they killed him, which is what their Most Absolute Truth commanded. <br /> <br />It is perhaps ironic that while the earthly lot of the Questioners grew more bountiful, the earthly lot of the Believers grew harsher and harsher. The Questioners, who questioned everything, even their own questioning, began to question their Bounty. The Believers were slow to understand why theQuestioners had it so good. But at last it was revealed to them. The Questioners were in league with the Evil Genius. In fact, it was BECAUSE the Questioners EXISTED that the Believers were in dire straits. There was only one way for the Believers to save themselves from the Questioners. So they began to kill them. <br /> <br />Let's suppose that, in reading this tale, you identify yourself as a Questioner. Do you need to be afraid, and if so, how afraid? <br /> <br />We cannot even artfully guess at the answers to these questions until we can ascertain, \\"Is the tale true?\\"  Let's see if we can answer this truth-question by entering more deeply into the book. <br /> <br />Throughout Harris' account, there are a number of forks in the road, and he does not back away from warning us that the kind of future we shall find will be determined by which branch of the labyrinth's path we choose. <br /> <br />On my map, the first fork has the following signpost: <br /> <br />Hard Core: This way if you think most Muslims will kill you if they have the chance. <br /> <br />Soft Core: This way if you think that only a fanatical minority of Muslims will kill you if they have the chance. <br /> <br />Harris gives short shrift to the Soft Core path by quoting, then dismissing, the following commentary: <br /> <br /> \\"The truth is that little is to be gained by searching the Quran for <br /> clues to Islam's true nature.... The trouble with thundering  declarations about \\"Islam's Nature\\" is that Islam, like any religion, is  not what books make it but what people make it. Forget the rantings  of fundamentalists, who are a minority. Most Muslims' daily lives do  not confirm the idea of a faith that is intrinsically anti-Western or anti- modern.\\" <br /> <br />In a later chapter, Harris reviews the bloodthirsty history of Christendom, with its own Book of sadistic imputations for killing and torturing, and he  finds that various forces of modernity have moved Christian culture towarda more liberal, civil society. But Harris will not allow for any effect <br />of these forces (now ubiquitous through broadcast and internet)  on contemporary Islamic culture. <br /> <br />Surely if Quranic strict constructionism had such overweening hegemony as Harris claims, then the millions of Muslims in Britain, France and the United States would be sending waves of suicide bombers into the streets of London, Paris and New York. This is not the case. Why not? <br /> <br />But now we come to a second fork. Harris is sour on religion, but he is sweet on mysticism. He intends to demonstrate that no one needs religion in order to live an ethical life. He tries to do this by hypothesizing a realistic and naturalistic ethics, realistic in the sense that Newtonian physics is realistic, and naturalistic in the sense that biology is naturalistic. There are universal ethical principles bound to happiness and suffering, and a concern for these experiences both for ourselves and for others. These principles are discoverable, and the most refined techniques available are those which have been used by mystics of all persuasions. In other words, revelatory mystical experience grounds ethics. <br /> <br />But surely there must be more to it than that. Otherwise, how could it be that Theresa of Avila, authoress of sublime accounts of her journeys in the High Mountains of mystical rapture, concurrently counseled death to the Lutherans? <br /> <br />And also, Harris does not consider the strongest counter-argument to the ethics he propounds, that of Barbarian Logic. Barbarian Logic is compelling and historically much in evidence. It goes like this: 1) I want what you have. 2) I am going to take it from you. 3) Stop me if you can. I submit that Barbarian Logic, rather than Religious Belief, powers much current war and suffering. <br /> <br />And...and...and. Damn that 1000 word limit. I was so busy critiquing this book, I forgot to say how much I like it. It is thoughtful and articulate. It insistently questions. Sam Harris deserves the Nietzsche Award for 2004. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B00006AW2J|4.0|I absolutely love \\"Beggars Banquet\\"--probably the greatest rock 'n roll album of the Sixties, if not ever--(arguably, \\"Exile on Main St.\\" tops my list)--despite what lame brains at a certain major magazine think. <br /> <br />But, I picked up this remastered CD--and listened in headphones--and YES--the clarity is astonishing. However, I am deeply disturbed that there are 71 reviews here---and no one has mentioned the nasty tape drop-out in \\"Stray Cat Blues!\\" <br /> <br />I do not remember this being on the vinyl nor the first CD issue. <br /> <br />Am I wrong? Was it *always* there and can't be fixed?

B00000AFHM|5.0|I heard Dirty Dream #2 at a friends house and just got this album. This is a classic that everyone should listen to at least once. I can't believe I missed this band until now. The rumors are not true. They are not wimps. They possess an inner strength and a complexity that is over the head of the screamers and the -I am mad as hell- musicians.
B0002XNSY0|4.0|A byproduct of the cold war is that it provided Hollywood with enough fodder to celebrate espionage in a string of political thrillers. Some took the threat of Russian invasion quite seriously. Others chose a less credible, but wholly more satisfying route into pure farcical escapist entertainment. Of particular interest in this latter category is Stanley Kubrick's intense black comedy about the nuclear age; \\"Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb.\\" \\"The film, frequently adorning \\"all-time best\\" lists, is a vapid spoof that teeters on political insanity and military incredulity.  The story begins as homage to the Cubin Missile Crisis, with General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), an obsessed relic, launching his own personal assault on Communism. Ripper commissions a squadron of B-52s to bomb the USSR. Naturally, the big bad Russians launch their own counter offensive - the so- called \\"Doomsday Device.\\" While the world holds its excess gas, U.S. President (Peter Sellers) enters into riotous hot-line negotiations with his Commi-counterpart. Always fascinating to watch, Sellers also interjects his own inimitable brand of craziness into two more roles; a British military attach with a humorous tick and the psychotic bomb-maker, Dr. Strangelove. This trio of psychotics is fleshed out by Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants loose canon whose military advice boils down into two parts mass hysteria and one part factoid meaningless statistics.  <br /> <br />This is the third outing for \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" on DVD. As with its predecessors, this disc exhibits a stunningly rich and textured visual presentation. The B&W image has a marvelously balanced and remarkably solid gray scale. Blacks are velvety deep and smooth. There is some minor edge enhancement and a hint of pixelization but nothing that will distract you from enjoying this classic. Multiple aspect ratios are in keeping with the film's original theatricalpresentation. The movie also boasts 5.1 DTS. This 40th anniversary edition also embellishes its extras made previously available with two more short subjects. Overall, there's little reason to run out and re-buy this title, although die hard fans will ultimately want the very latest from the military board room in the cockpit of their own libraries. Either way, brace yourself - its blast off time for the neurotic age! <br />
B0000508U6|5.0|I am sick of people comparing Coldplay to U2 or radiohead.  Coldplay has a very unique sound unlike any other band and it emanates from evey song they play.  I have heard reviewers say that Coldplay has tried to emulate radiohead, but they clearly do not come anywhere close to the psychedelics of Kid A or Ok Computer. Their focus, in my mind, is creating melodies that flawlessly mesh with the vocals, not trying to hypnotize you while you're tripping.  The songs on this album are good for any mood, sad or happy, high or normal, and they magnify emotions like crazy.  The lyrics in these songs are fantastic, and they really make you think about your life. <br /> <br /> <br />I am a college student, and every time i go to the library to study, i bring Parachutes along with me.  Sometimes i will put the whole album on repeat and listen to it several times over and over again.  The amazing thing is that i have never felt this way about a band.  I get tired of great music because i play it too often, but this cd just gets better every time i listen to it.  I only have one real problem with the album... they should have put careful where you stand on this album in addition, or else instead of high speed.  That would have made this album earthshaking.   <br /> <br />As far Parachutes' significance as a debut, I could argue that this is the best debut in history.  The maturation process of many bands carries them to their best music 2 or 3 LPs after their debut, but Coldplay has set their fans up for disappointment.  If they truly have not reached their peak yet, i can't wait till their next album comes out.  However, I listen to Parachutes and ask myself how could Coldplay make a better album.  Unfortunately, A Rush of Blood does not come close; yes, there are some amazing songs in it, but song for song Parachutes is just plain better. <br /> <br />Every song on Parachutes is good, im not even going to bother trying to rate them.  Buy it. You wont be disappointed.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all, allow me to put a little preface on this review. I always loved Green Day. However, the only album I ever purchased of theirs was Dookie. But everyone and their Grandma had that album, so it doesn't really count. Suffice it to say I always enjoyed their music, but never felt the drive or need to own any more of their music. That is, until I heard the American Idiot single. It stuck in my head, so of course I logged on to the net, went to amazon and started listening to sound samples. It's the best thing that ever happened to my ears, and that's no joke. After just five minutes of checking out song segments, I grabbed my car keys, ran out of my dorm, and went straight to the nearest cd store. With that out of the way, let me just say that this is not only Green Day's best album EVER, it is also one of the best albums I've heard this whole year. Right up there with Interpol-Antics and The Sleepy Jackson's debut. From the politically charged single to the absolutely stunning, epic, nine minute long Jesus of Suburbia, and all the way to the slow, melodic Wake Me When September Ends, Green Day has proven that they know exactly how to change with the times and still retain their catchy brand of hooks and irreverent attitude. This is an epic rock masterpiece. Buy it, listen to it, love it. If you think you like it the first time you hear it, just keep listening. Your love and appreciation will only grow. This could very well be the album we've all been waiting for to take us into the new millenium of music. Green Day has become the new Messiah of my music collection the way the Strokes, White Stripes, and Flaming Lips promised me they would but failed to follow up and deliver. Green Day has come back and showed the new kids out there what it means to rock. Let's hope they perk their ears up and listen.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Those of us who enjoy Mystery Science Theatre 3000 have already had the chance to \\"enjoy\\" two of Ed Wood's films, one of which, Bride of the Monster, forms a large part of this film.  The scene here where Lugosi explains that he was \\"Hunted, despised...\\" is word for word from Wood's film. <br /> <br />It's clear that Ed Wood was a very odd, very nice, utterly incompetent director.  His life story makes for a very funny film, and a look into how the worst of the worst made it to the screen in the old days (regretabbly, no explanation is offered for how it happens now). <br /> <br />For what it's worth, the screen name I use here (and everywhere) comes from Ed Wood.  Ed's psychic friend is named Griswel (\\"I am Griswel, I know all\\").  Of course, reviewing the credits it turns out that it's \\"Criswell\\". <br /> <br />It's too late for me, but not for you.  Save yourself!  Buy this film!  My next review will be better!
B00005JMH2|5.0|Being a big lover of the original Japanese movie. I was quite skeptical that the American remake would just be a copycat rip off for the people who hasn't seen the original. However, the final product was well done and faithful.<br /><br />Shall We Dance was an adaptation of the Japanese movie with the same name about a middle age man found life again in the ballroom dancing class that he started off with an interesting motive. John being a successful lawyer with a happy family (quite different from the Jap version in which the guy is a middle age man with a lovely family but a mortgage that is eating him up) didn't feel life is flourishing inside him. He repeated his day in day out monotonously until he accidentally stepped into a dance shcool because of a woman looking out of the window everynight. The result was it changed the lives of all the people who got involved in John's sudden passion of dancing: his wife, his colleague, the dance teacher and his classmates.<br /><br />The movie has a good touch on the style of the original and it managed to tell a story of not only the leads but also the supporting cast. We have a bunch of really interesting supporting cast played by very outstanding actors which made the movie full of joy and keep the movie interesting. Richard Gere as John gave a superb performance as the lost middle age man who rejuvenated himself through ballroom dancing. His lack of confidence in himself, but at the same time full of urge to want more from his newly found reactional activity had made him happy but at the same time on guard: he want to be closeted from his family and colleagues. However, it is because of this that brought his wife into the whole thing: employed two detectives to check on her husband. The scene in which Richard Gere explained to Susan Saradon the reason he closeted himself about the whole dancing thing was very well done and touching. Richard Gere had found a spot that he could relate himself with and Susan Saradon is very proficient  as a career-wise successful wife. There are sure chemistry in the acting between them. The husband and wife actually didn't have heaps of scenes together but every scene was a good portrayal of a changing and growing relationship. Jennifer Lopez as the dance teacher comparatively has a less impact on the movie. It is not because of her acting but more of her role as a self-redeeming dance teacher who lost faith in dancing because of a failure in a competition. Nonetheless, she did have her time in the movie. Especially the scene between her and Richard Gere in the street and her couching on Richard Gere before his first ever competition in life.<br /><br />Basically, Shall We Dance is more of an ensemble movie in a way that the movie would not look so good without the supporting class. The hard working mum who wants to be a professional dancer, the dance teacher who had her moments in life, the big guy who wants to lose weight from dancing, the spunk who came to pick up girls but end up finding something else, the closeted dancing colleague (by Stanley Tucci!) are all superb and enriched the movie in such a way that you would feel missing them when they are not around. This is a good actualisation of ensemble performance. The great part is the leads didn't attempt to outshine others as celebrity performers but work with them on the same level and gave the sparks and chemistry for a good ensemble performance.<br /><br />Shall We Dance is a very refreshing piece of work that hasn't exploited the originally unfairly. It is a movie that you could move your feet and dance with its rhythm. A movie could be judged by the audience response in the theatre and it is a movie that the audience did applause when the credits rolled.n is very proficient  as a career-wise successful wife.

B00008EY65|5.0|I really do not know why I bought this DVD. I mean, I've never followed the Hellboy comics, nor did I think that the trailer looked all that interesting, yet something made me go ahead and buy it. I am so glad that I did. The only reason I gave this film five stars is that I could not give it more. It easily ties as the best thing I've seen this year- it may even be the best.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, this film has everything- constantly witty and clever dialog, believable acting, first class sets, great special effects- and most importantly for me, mythological power. What does make a Man? If you raise up a demon from the deepest pit of hell to know the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, does that make him a man? Yes, if you teach him that he has the power to choose his own path- and he takes it. It is even more impressive when the subject has no hope of salvation, yet he chooses light and good for their own sake. And it doesn't hurt to teach him the meaning and power of love....<br /><br />I'm sure the extra features on the second DVD are first rate, but before I look at them I'm going to watch the entire film on the first disk over again.
0062502182|3.0|Think `Who Moved by Cheese' and \\"Chicken's Soup for the Soul'. `The Alchemist' is yet another feel-good, inspirational story, albeit with a different setting. A boy sets off from Spain to the Egyptian pyramids in search of treasure, his Personal Legend. Armed with nuggets of advice from the King of Salem, and further help from the alchemist, the boy embarked on a journey of self-discovery, which was occasionally fraught with danger. The message the novel is trying to convey is simple - have the heart to dream and the perseverance to achieve one's dreams. <br /> <br />Written in a straightforward, easy-to-understand style, `The Alchemist' is small in its scale but big in its essence. It may resonate well with kids and youngsters. But will the simple storyline have a lasting effect on more mature, and probably more cynical, readers? Judging from the success of bestseller, `Who Moved by Cheese', I might be proven wrong. <br />
0345440900|4.0|I read this book and found it very helpful.  I think the reason why some people rated this book so low is because they took all the advice too literally.  Every baby is different and needs to be dealt with accordingly.  The author even acknowledges this in the first chapter.  The book is very useful in setting basic guidelines for new parents to follow, and see what works for them.  I ended up getting a lot more sleep by using the advice for getting my baby to bed at night, but found the feeding section to be a waste of time.  The take-home message of this book... treat your little one with respect.
B000003TA4|3.0|If it weren't for his mammothly-popular hit \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\\" Kurt would probably still be alive today. The popularity of \\"Teen Spirit\\" was what drove Kurt to hate his existence. He refused to live up to the expectations of his new bandwagon-jumping fans, and yet they still wanted more from him. Sure, I respect \\"Teen Spirit,\\" and love it as much as I do all his other songs. But I will admit; Nevermind his so much bubblegum pop slickness that it's almost sickening. My faves on Nevermind include \\"Breed,\\" \\"Lithium,\\" and \\"Stay Away.\\" The rest don't have any of the crunchiness or stop/start jerkiness that Bleach had. And remember, if it doesn't make your ears bleed and ache, it ain't worth listening to.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Before I start, let me just say that this is a negative review, and it seems to me that a majority of people do not find negative reviews helpful for some reason...maybe they only want to read positive reviews, as they've basically made up their minds to buy the movie or book. <br /> <br />To start, save your money and rent this if you haven't seen it.  There were some good scenes and special effects, but the movie goes wrong with its focus on Sam and his dad. <br /> <br />Sam's dad starts out from Washington, in a blizzard, to go to New York to save Sam, and ends up walking the last 40 miles to get there.  Yep, only Sam's dad can save him, not the cops, not the army, only superhero dad... <br /> <br />And, did Sam's dad bring an extra snowsuit for Sam to make the trip back in?  No. <br /> <br />And why should we care about Sam anyway?  People are dying in New York left, right, and centre, but as long as Sam makes it back you are supposed to feel good. <br /> <br />As for the reviewer who watched this 4 times already, you must be kidding.  Once is enough. <br />
B000002UY5|2.0|I don't know why Blind Melon's debut is getting so much praise. Even when \\"No Rain\\" was popular in early '93, there still wasn't as much hubbub about the band as there is now...  but I have a feeling Shannon Hoon's untimely death has something to do with it. I hate it when bands are catapulted to a mythical status once their lead singer gets stupid and either OD's, blows his brains out, or both. Sorry if I sound critical; it's just that this album isn't worth buying for one fantastic song alone. All the songs except for the Alt-sounding \\"No Rain\\" sound like they're from a band that desperately wants to play country music, but is afraid to. Blind Melon's second album, Soup, definitely sounds more like modern rock, but it's so faceless and generic. Blind Melon should've stayed true to their grassroots, country-style music... even if they would've been even more unpopular because of it. Anybody else aware of the fact that Green Day ripped the vocal melody from \\"No Rain\\", and used it in their biggest hit \\"Basket Case\\"? Just thought I'd bring it up.
B0001I561E|5.0|LITTERELY,THE BEST DISNEY PLATINUM EDITION DVD EVER!I LOVE THE MUSIC VIDIO,\\"A WHOLE NEW WORLD\\",PERFORMED BY NICK LACHEY AND SINGING SENSATION JESSICA SIMPSON!I ALSO LIKE,\\"PROUD OF YOUR BOY\\",BY AMERICAN IDOL CLAY AIKEN!THIS MOVIE IS GREAT,FUNNY,AND ACTION-PACKED!I RECCOMEND IT FOR ANY DISNEY FAN IF THEY HAVENT ALREADY SEEN IT!IT HAS THE NEW DISNEY ENHANCED HOME THEATER MIX THAT MAKES IT EVEN BETTER!IT ALSO HAS TWO DELETED SCENES,AND MUCH MORE!
B0000035E7|4.0|Nirvana's debut has something Nevermind lacked: musical honesty. The rawness and lack of financial assets really made Kurt prove himself to be a guy that could thrash his guitar with the best of 'em. And as for his bandmates... well, they really were just background musicians. Sure, it might sound harsh, but it's the harsh truth for Krist that Kurt wrote over 90% of the band's music. Kurt had to teach Krist and the easily-disposable line of drummers how he wanted their instruments to sound for his songs. Speaking of Mr. Cobain's songs, the songs on Bleach are very good. They do have a sameness to them, but at least they're not as repetitive as the pop overkill on Nevermind. My faves are such plodding masterpieces as \\"Scoff,\\" \\"Sifting,\\" \\"Negative Creep,\\" and \\"Floyd the Barber.\\" Soooo... if you're looking for a record to put on to fit a rainy, dreary day, Bleach will suit it perfectly.
B0002UOK04|5.0|This cd is truly a masterpiece. Since Eternal Tears of Sorrow is no more I'll venture to say this is the best band coming out of finland right now. I've always been a fan of jari's work in ensiferum but never would I have expected him to pull something like this off. It almost seems that him playing in ensiferum actually held him back somewhat. The first thing that really caught my attention was the guitar playing. The rhythm guitars are as solid as I've ever heard with tons of melody. Lead guitars are all over the place with  plenty of neo-classical runs and sweeps at rediculous speeds. This is probably the best release of 2004. This isn't another children of bodom, norther, or kalmah copy as many finnish bands seem to fall in line with. Do yourself a favor and buy this.
068484267X|5.0|I love Frank McCourt's writing style. He does not use quotations, just tells it like it is.....I could hardly put this one down! Excellent reading! Some parts were hilarious, and at other times very depressing, but the book is unforgettable. It will definitely leave you with more compassion for those who suffer through poverty and lack of hope.
B000002UUX|5.0|I must admit I'm not a big fan of thrash,well maybe some early metallica and of course megadeth,but that's it.Of all the thrash acts out there,these guys have got to be the most aggressive and loudest band there is.But as fast as the songs may be,there still is a sense of melody and the songs are well crafted by Mustaine.The solos are pure face melters and the one thing i love is that dave actually sings,he doesn't try to sing in a scary voice or anything like that.this definitely tops anything metallica ever put out and is just an amazing record with brilliant musicianship. <br /> <br />Standout tracks: <br /> <br />Holy War,Hangar 18,Take No Prisoners,Five Magics,Poison is the cure,Rust In Peace
B000001ELL|3.0|After the release of \\"Dynasty\\" in May of '79 KISS became the biggest band on the planet! KISS was EVERYWHERE! From Mego figures to the Bally Pinball Machine to Lunchboxes. It was MASSIVE.  <br /> <br />The stand-out tracks on Dynasty are:  <br /> <br />Sure Know Something, Dirty Livin' & Charisma.  <br /> <br />Dynasty is my least favorite KISS album from the 70's. But if you don't own it, your KISS catalog isn't complete.
0767811070|5.0|The critically acclaimed Oscar nominated 1991 release \\"Boyz 'N the Hood\\" wonderfully desplicts the harsh realities of living in South Central Los Angeles.  It stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Ice Cube, Morris Chestnut, Lawrence Fishburne, and Angela Bassett.  This wonderfully written plot explores the lives of three young men strugging with everyday living.  Two of them, while struggling to stay lawful citizens, hold high hopes of leaving that neighborhood and pursue higher dreams.  Little do they know that their actions affect the community and their families.  This film never holds back on the harshness of the violence and the environment.  Each character holds their own persona that makes this film more powerful.  The actors perform their characters beautifully, especially Gooding and Fishburne.  All express wonderfully the individual everyday struggles.  Such tremendous film quality makes \\"Boyz 'N the Hood\\" worth watching.  Other films with similar theme followed shortly after this release (\\"Menace II Society\\", \\"New Jack City\\"), but none surpass this one.  Many audiences will feel its powerful message after viewing.
B00000I07Q|5.0|In my opinion, this album is a little bit different to \\"Slipery when wet\\" as that and the other earlier albums were party albums. This album has quite a couple of ballads, it still has lots of catchy rocky tracks.  <br /> <br />1. Lay your hands on me - The stadium intro is quite cool. It sounds like it's live. Catchy and hard rocking, with heavy guitars. 5/5 <br />2. Bad medicine - The fastest song on the album. Really fun lyrics and it's good song if we you wanna dance around. 5/5 <br />3. Born to be my baby - Most definately the best song on the album. It's not a slow song, but it isn't a fast hard one. Love the slow-to-fast solo. 5+/5 <br />4. Living in sin - The first ballad on the disc. I actually really like it. Nice singing and a slow but catchy chorus. 4/5 <br />5. Bllod on blood - Another fast track that's all about Jon's chidhood. Very catchy again, and great singing. 5/5 <br />6. Homebound train - The worst song. Incredibly boring, as it sounds the same all the way through. It's just to dry and boring. 2/5 <br />7. Wild is the wind - Again, another slow song, but it's still quite a catchy tune. I haven't listened to it enough though. 3.5/5 <br />8. Ride cowboy ride - ???? I don't really see the need for this track, it's just a minute-long acoustic song recorded in mono. 2/5 <br />9. Stick to your guns - Another favourite. It's a mix of acoustic and electric guitar. Soft in the verses, but it gets heavier as the electric guitar comes in. 5/5 <br />10. I'll be there for you - A ballad again. This is a really nice one actually. Firery guitars, great harmonies, and it's just a nice soft song. 5/5 <br />11. 99 in the shade - One of the more poppy songs, and a catchy tune. The lyrics aren't the best, but it's an alright song. 4/5 <br />12. Love for sale - A very country-like song, with acoustics, harmonicas, very fast-paced and filled with some humour. Very enbjoyable end to the album. 5/5 <br /> <br />I would reccomend this if you like Bon Jovi's earlier albums. Really, just their other al;bums from the 80s. It's a bit different from them, but still it's a fun album.
B000053V7O|4.0|This film is important.  The time in history where Black artists, not just Jazz Musicians, evoked a self-exiled existance in Europe where they could have some resemblance of appreciation in their life, can never be forgotten.  In some ways its still going on today.  James Baldwin is another example of an artist who chose to live in Europe where he was treated like what his passport stated \\"American\\". <br /> <br />Another important happening that this movie brought about was a deep seated regret in Film-Maker/Actor/Jazz afficianado Clint Eastwood.  Who admits that this film should have been produced by Americans first.  Mr. Eastwood lost no time in producing \\"Bird\\" shortly afterwards.  Which is also a fabulous film that celebrated the music and appropriately chronicled the demons (Alcohol,Drugs)that drove these musicians.  As an American Black I am very thankful to Clint Eastwood and my respect for him instantly mulitiplied upon hearing this.  As Clint and so many others remind us all the time, \\"Jazz is an original American art form\\"  Yes its sad that Europe beat us to the punch, but on the other hand, there are so many more beautiful \\"Jazz\\" stories out there yet to be written. <br /> <br />If you love Jazz and are interested in witnessing some of the true life stories surrounding it, make this a part of your collection. <br /> <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|Any posthumous work arrives heavily freighted with expectations.  People are prepared, before ever hearing a single track, to love or loathe depending on their relationship to Elliott Smith's past work, how they discovered his music, how familiar they are with the players in his life, etc.  No one comes to it clean and clear. <br />That said, this record is clearly at home in Elliott's opus.  I don't hear the \\"subtle sabotage\\" some would like to find in the prductions.  Most of the productions will sound very familiar to anyone who has listened to Elliott Smith's other recordings and seen his live performances. The songs are beautiful and  cutting and sad and joyous.  These qualities are the hallmark of his song writing.  The sometimes lush and beguiling, sometimes stark and tender production qualities are also Elliott Smith hallmarks.   <br />The direction for this album feels very clear, and yet I suspect that the final version would have been different had Elliott Smith lived.  Most artists continue to re-work and \\"tinker\\" long after the album is cut and the die cast...look at Dylan.  I prefer not to worry the \\"what if\\" bone when I could just listen and enjoy knowing that all involved in the posthumous production work did their very best to honor Elliott Smith's intention as they understood it.  I suspect people like Jon Brion have a FAR better understanding of Elliott Smith's musical vocabulary and cadences and intentions than do most of the people squawking about the ruination of the \\"true version\\" of this record.
B0001AP12G|5.0|every song i hear is produced by kanye west and i love them all. when i 1st heared kanye west it was on the David Letterman show(witch is a great show). i heard all falls down i didnt really care for it (which i regret). i went a second time to listen to it and fell in love with it. i was intreged and listen to other songs like. i will list my 5 favourite songs: <br /> <br />All falls down- of cource slynna jhonsen has such a pretty voice. <br /> <br />Never let me down-jay-z raps like mad on this. <br /> <br />through the wire- some rap these days has such meningless lyrics but this. <br /> <br />Family Business- i love it. <br /> <br />spaceship- should i buy conquences album? <br /> <br />inconclusion i love this because it is meaningful and insperational! 5 stars from me.
B000024D4R|5.0|I will admit this is not a cd for early pink floyd fans. When I first listened to it i didn't like it. I listened to the wall, dark side of the moon, and wish u were here for a while, then I gave this one another chance. The second i heard the key board intro to \\"pigs\\", pigs became my favorite song. This has an amazing concept to it. The only people who wouldn't like this cd are people who think the songs are too long. I love that the songs are long. It shows the band cared more about the music, then cutting the songs down to enough time to be played on the radio. And have you ever tried to write and impressive guitar solo that lasts for moer then 5 min? its very hard to keep a rythem and to keep the intrest of the listener. I think that dave gilmore is amazing and writing extened solos. This cd is amazing.
B0002OERI0|5.0|All I have to say is wow! Of course I just bought the album a week ago, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say this is the best material Green Day have ever released as far as maturity and songwriting are concerned. This is definately up there with \\"Houses of the Mole\\" from Ministry for the years best release. Yes, Green Day have long ago crossed into the mainstream, but what I really appreciate about this album (and this is not uncommon for any Green Day release) is that they still manage to incorporate enough abrasive languauge into their music as not to make it \\"too\\" radio friendly, and maintain somewhat their true punk image. Make sure you listen to the title track, and, in my opinion the masterpeice of the entire album, Jesus of Suburbia. Highly Recommended! A true punk rock symphony.
B00005JNEI|5.0|O.k.--so Michael Moore is a conservative's worst nightmare.  Liberal and honest.  But come on---you know some of it is true and that should be enough for anyone to see where we are headed with this corrupt administration.  Let's say, just for argument's sake, that you only believe that a tiny bit of what is in this film is true.  That should be enough for any sane person who loves this country to demand these morons be kicked out of office.  Personally, I think that most of this film is probably right on target---I mean the facts are there to back up all of the claims Mr. Moore makes.  Thank God he has the courage to make a movie like this.  I am terrified for our country if Bush and his cronies are given another four years to destroy this country.  Even if you are the most closed-minded conservative Bush lover you MUST see this movie.  I have a feeling most of the reviewers who are critizing it haven't even bothered to watch it.  Open your eyes and see what is really going on.  It made me sick to my stomach to see innocent women and children slaughtered in Iraq and for what?  The undeniable truth is that no weapons were have been found or will ever be found.  Do you know why?  Because they don't exist--even Bush has admitted that.  Face the facts people---get him out of office.
0446310786|5.0|<br /> <br /> <br /> I thought this book was a really good book, considering this is the second book that I ever finished reading in my life.  This book talks about how strong people feel about racism back in the days, and it is still strong today, but the only difference is that back then people was racist to African Americans, but nowadays there's racism toward Whites, Blacks, Asians, Arabs, etc.  That's what I like about this book, it is talking about something that existed back then that is still existing today, so we can see how Jem and Scout is feeling when an innocent man is pleaded guilty and guilty man is free.  This also shows how 2 kids perspective on African American people could change in one event.  I could relate to this because I use to think African American people were bad since the movies and shows portrayed them as bad people, but when I met my first black friend in middle school my whole perspective on African American people changed. <br /> I recommend this book to anybody who is interested in seeing how 2 kids could change their whole perspective about racism in one event.  They knew that other humans are treating a human being the wrong way just because of their skin color.  I think this book could relate to anybody because everybody meets another person who is not their own race before and probably treated them the wrong way because they were different, but after a while their attitude towards them changed because they were able to get to know them, and realize that they are not really that different from each other. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I knew absolutley nothing about this flick when my 14 year old red-headed math whiz son said Dad let's go see this movie. From the opening credits I was entertained. This movie, is essentially a \\"day in the life of an Idaho high school nerd as he moves through various life cycle events and characters.\\"  Though the word \\"nerd\\" hardly seems to do justice to the timeless nature of title character Napoleon Dynamite. With little or no plot, Napoleon turned out to be more than part nostalgia. It was a stroll down memory lane. If I did not know that the writers in fact lived in Idaho, I would have sworn they had gone to my High School in South Florda in the late 70's. Our Senior Class Vice-President was in fact PEDRO from Mexico, our class Secretary, Melanie a blonde buxom cheerleader incarnate of this films' fictional \\"Summer\\" character and our Treasurer sported a huge Afro and all were clad in their finest disco outfits.  <br /> <br />I guess this is why this sleeper film has gained such popularity. Forty-something dads and their teen kids can both see this movie together and come out repeating its hysterical dialogue.  The current crop of teen viewers are living these absurd stereotypes and situations (dating, class elections, high school dances, the cafeteria). The oldsters in the audience either were, or knew one or more of this film's quirky characters.  <br /> <br />The acting and dialogue are pure genius in their simplicity and absurdity. As other reviewers have mentioned, lines from this flick will become folklore. I found myself sitting around our family dinner table spouting off Napoleonisms reminiscent of the best of Monty Python.  <br /> <br />Definitely go see this movie without any pre-conceptions, or expectations, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Ever since I heard the first track (The Great Dividers) I was so hooked on this album. Every song on this album is unbeleivebly awesome. I would have to say this even rivals the almighty Alive or Just Breathing album from KsE. I first heard Unearth when I bought \\"Strings of Conscience\\". I didn't have any interest in their debut album at all and was an extremely boring album. The only song that appealed to me was \\"My Desire\\", other than that everything sounded the same. \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" really appealed to me because it is almost like a mix between my to favorite types of music. I love metalcore and swedish melodic metal. \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" combined the brutality of metalcore with the melody of In Flames and other swedish metal bands. Also there are many insanely unforgetable breakdowns and solos. I don't know how ANYONE can't like this album, so if you read this, BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|only slipknot cd i have ever really liked. They have changed their style a little. One song is acoustic. Dont remember which one. No songs really disapoint. Check  it out if your a fan
B00024BHTC|5.0|Finally, this Nightwish album is within my hands. First of all, for the ones who placed a one star to this album, I think you failed and you don't know your taste. Second of all, I appreciate Nightwish's effort for creating this masterpiece and I think this is one of the great releases of 2004. <br /> <br />The album kicks in with Dark Chest Of Wonder by a small whispery dialodue \\"Once I had a dream... and this is it\\" and BOOM with an amazing heavy guitar riff. From the look of things, Nightwish has changed in this album with the heaviness and more orchestral. As you can tell from this song, this album will be a one hell of a ride. The song is great and well constructed. <br /> <br />Next is Wish I Had An Angel and it's a duet song between Marco and Tarja and it is somehow similar to Dead To The World in CC. This is an amazing song and the drumming is funny, but it's an awesome track and things are great so far in the album. <br /> <br />Then Nemo and it's a radio friendly and it's the first single of the album. By now, you might had heard this song and the short guitar solo is imoressive, but the best part is the last instrumental part. <br /> <br />Planet Hell starts with a great orchesral piece with some \\"ha's\\". It's another song that is featured in the Nemo CD-single. Here also, Marco and Tarja exchange the vocal parts. The keyboard solo is great in the middle. <br /> <br />Creek Mary's Blood is the first lengthy track clocks at 8:30, and the theme is about the killing of the Native Americans. The acoustic parts are fantastic and Tarja's voice is great here and touchy. Wait until you reach to Emppu's great solo. The screams with the music excites the mood. In the end, there is a small poetry said in the Native American language. <br /> <br />The Siren has a great Arabian vibe and Tarja's voice in the beginning is quiet eerie. Marco sings the chorus and sounds good. Then a long instrumental part and ends with Marco repeating the chorus. It's good. <br /> <br />Dead Gardens is a very heavy track and as you can tell Tarja dropped her operatic voice in this track, but I don't blame her because it fits the song. The only down part here is the ending riff that gets repeated on and on and on and on. <br /> <br />Romanticide is the heaviest song on the record that is connected from Dead Gardens. This makes up for DG and there is a killer guitar solo performed by Emppu and I think he's a great guitarist. It ends similar to Slaying The Dreamer were Marco and Tarja sings the last part quickly. <br /> <br />Ladies and gentleman put your hands together for Nightwish's best epic song. Ghost Love Score!!! I'm not the only who said this but THIS SONG IS SO DAMN AMAZING FROM BEGINNING TILL END THAT CLOCKS AT TEN GODDAMN MINUTES!!! This is the best song on the record and the best orchestral part in all of metal. Total perfection and you can tell Toumas is a musical genius!!! A big album highlight. It has the BEST.CHORUS.EVER!!! <br /> <br />Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan is a beautiful ballad sung in Finnish. It's has a cool mood and atmospheric. <br /> <br />Higher Than Hope is the last track and it is a good way to close the album. Marco composed this entire song and sounds good. The only problem is the middle part where there is this ambulence talking part. It's okay. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great record and Nightwish had did a great job on this album. Thanks to the London Session Orchestra that made a great empact on this album. It is an improvement from Century Child and it is a must buy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000025L8|5.0|First off, this album is amazing. It's just presented in a bad way. It comes off as being too jumbled and because of that your average music fan won't take the time to really listen to it (not just HEAR it, really LISTEN to it). Sure, what The Clash could have done was selected the best 1/3 of the songs and made the album with only those songs, and it would have been presented as a much better album. But this was an experimental album. The Clash were interested in so many different music styles and this was the album where they were going to try them all. Some are hits, some are misses, I will admit. Things like children singing \\"Career Opportunities\\" just isn't worth my time, but this album is more than just about music, it's about being creative. I can easily understand why people would not like this album, and if you're not ready to do more than just simply hear this album, it may not be worth your time.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This show is amazing. No, it is not a reality series (Thank God). It also does not contain special effects, vulgarities, or explicit sexual content. However, it still manages to be one of the smartest, funniest, most sarcastic, and yet, ironically, the warmest shows on television. It has the quick banter of the 30s, but it still mangages to reference what's going on in pop culture right now. You must buy this DVD!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Like water in a desert. That's how I feel about this film. The director, actors and everyone else involved poured so much love (not to mention fear) into this little movie that it just shines.  It made me remember why I love film, right in my gut, plot complexity be damned.    For all those people who (like me) had heard of Donnie Darko and casually added it to their to-do list based on the buzz, see it as soon as you can. I thought it would be just another witty teen film, above average, but nothing special. This movie is so special it hurts.    I can't believe I missed this in the theatres. I'm still chewing on it a week after first seeing it. It's breathtakingly original and ambitious; I was awed that someone had the guts to even try to make a movie like this. It's not exactly philosophy, and it's not perfect, but it's enormously bighearted, earnest, clever, and moving.    How Richard Kelly hit the 1988 nail so perfectly on the head is just beyond me. I bet you'll find the movie especially compelling if you were born between 1968 and 1980 - approximately the window for the births of the three Darko children in the film.
0156027321|5.0|His self-proclaimed nickname was Pi. His full name was Pisine Molitor Patel, and his story will challenge the limits of your imagination. His story will make you wonder about the greatness of God. You will learn to love this boy's passion for life. You will learn to admire his frugality, ingenuity, adaptability, and his will to never let go.<br /><br />This is the story of a coming to age Indian boy in the most improbable circumstances. Pi's struggle for survival is staged in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, stranded in a lifeboat with a few supplies, a vicious fully-grown Bengali tiger, and with an unquestionable faith in God.<br /><br />Pi's name is a metaphor for his perpetual struggle. His thoughts about faith are like a breath of fresh air in a world filled with religious intolerance. Pi's philosophical monologue in defense of all zoo and based on empirical evidence, will make even the fiercest zoo opponents reconsider. And all the people that will have the pleasure to read this book, will never look at a wild animal the same way as before, whether it is on a TV, on a zoo or circus, or God-forbid in real life.<br /><br />I am a firm believer that what holds this story together, and keeps you glued to the book, is the language used by the author. Yan Martel gently handles and massages every word with only the finest literary lotion out there. Then, he flirts with the sentences, teasing the reader into wanting more.  Finally he makes love, sweet passionate long-lasting love, to each and every paragraph in this book. Trust me when I say that your intellectual senses are going to climax over and over when reading this book.<br /><br />This 20th century castaway story, I would like to recommend to everybody expanding their collection of modern day classics. \\"Life of Pi\\" has the charisma of Robinson Crusoe combined with the endurance of Santiago from \\"The Old Man And The Sea\\", and draws Biblical resemblance to Noah's Ark story.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I never saw this in a theatre, but I bought the DVD right away because I enjoy this type of film. Well, I was more than entertained! The Special Effects are outstanding, sets and atmosphere are solid. Perhaps this is better seen at home...I don't know. I DO know that I was very entertained. Those who analyze stuff will not like it. To me, this was a composite of all the dumb stuff I enjoy watching to escape the drudgeries, etc. I'm glad to have this in my collection. It's so silly, and so much fun!
B000003S09|5.0|I did this injustice with my first review. It was something akin to first impressions, not the best review I have ever written. Basically, I said that It was good, but the moonchild thing was too long, and that the title track was stupidly repetitive.     I now recind all of that.    This is almost perfect, which is hard enough to pull off, but then add that to the fact that this was revolutionary in its time, there was hardly anything like it, someone said it was music that should be played during the end of the world when it came out, and this is simply godly. It seems cliche at first when you listen to it. Well, what could you expect, this album was the first full blown prog album, and every prog band copied it, uhhm excuse me, was \\"inspired by it\\", calling this cliche is like calling charlie parker cliche, or calling the beatles a beatles rip off, it just doesn't count. When you listen to this for the first time, imagine that you'd only heard beatles, elvis, the beach boys, and bands like that for your whole life, and you then put this one, with a good enough volume to hear the sounds at the beginning (which is a cheap little trick to get you to turn it up), and imagine how blown away you would be if you really only had heard bands like the beatles all of your life. That might help with your appreciation.    The first track is quite amazing. It starts with a glorius trumpet line, and then proceeds to switch between a loud jazzy sound and a verse of yelling dismal words with an almost industrial percussion beat and then it breaks into a totally wicked solo section, which is the best part on the entire album. The title \\"21st century schizoid man\\" is suggesting a war torn future (this is made in 1969, the twentieth century) where poets starve, and many such dire images evoked by minimal words. The next track is a soft flute dominated ballad, that is absolutly beautiful, which is talking about how no one hears what others say, and due to the nature of the album, I'dguess that this is in the future also.     Then there is epitaph. This is the center of the album, and is rooted in the present. The melody is familiar, or just the general sound to the melody is, I don't know what it is based on, but something classical musicish. The lyrics talk about our cold war, with lyrics that are short but full of meaning. In general on this album, you have to think about these lyrics, because they are really subtle. \\"Silence drowns the screams\\" is a good example. Think about that, and you realize what he is talking about. If you can't figure it out, then mabye this album isn't for you.    The second side starts with the evocative song, moonchild, and now the music is rooted in the past. They start talking about magical and mystical things on this side, Moonchild is a beautiful song, until you get to the extroadinarily long noodling section. It isn't random and pointless, but most everyone thinks so. Everyone hates this, but I love it. It is very atmospheric, and if you just start visualizing at this point, it gets very intresting. This is what is really happenning, while the other part of the song is what the observer was feeling and thinking. You hear the musical equivelent of a scamper of feet, and the other part of the song talks about her playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn. The whole thing is very atmospheric and subtle. Most people just don't get it. And finally, it ends with the title track. This is very good, and medieval sounding. The lyrics are symbolic, an allegory of sorts. I won't interpret them here, because I've already done that to the other songs, just look at them and think it through.    So in closing, I now proclaim this to be one of the best purchases I ever made. If I had to only take ten cds with me to a deserted island, this would be one of them.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|I agree with a previous reviewer that the DVD transfer is not as stunning as it could have been.  \\"Tess\\" features gorgeous cinematography, but the DVD looks like nobody cleaned up the dirt from the film's negatives.  The film looks good in daylight scenes but any scenes set at night or with grey skies looks grainy and specs of dirt are evident throughout.   <br /> <br />It's great to have \\"Tess\\" on DVD, and the featurettes are a nice bonus since there is not a lot of information about the making of \\"Tess\\", but if this is supposed to be a \\"Special Edition\\" a two-disc set would have been more appopriate.   <br /> <br />Even the cover of the DVD makes Nastassja Kinski look anorexic.   <br /> <br />Talk about a DVD sacrificing quality for $$$$.   <br /> <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|I have been listening to this album non-stop for about 3 days.  My first listen was one of slight dissapointment but I gave it a chance since I had the same reaction with Figure 8.  Man was I wrong to think this Cd wasn't up to par with the rest.  It has the experimental creativity and newfangled essence of Figure 8 but also has the sincerity and catchy chorus/note changes of Either/or.  This creates quite a sound.  A few beatle-esque songs \\"little one\\" is the most obvious one and some beautiful vocals and lyrics, sad yet so beautiful. \\"twilight\\", \\"strung out and thin\\" and \\"last hour\\" are amongst my favorites.  If you don't like it, give it a little more time.
0393035158|5.0|Like Natalie Angier, who reviewed this first offering by this young philosopher/neuroscientist in the New York Review of Books,I was stunned by the wonderful, passionate, sharp edged, and unapologic rhetoric of the author. He presents rational discourse as a contact sport and ethics as a surgical subspeciality.  He presents secular humanism with attitude.  This is an endlessly quotable book.  Let me quote:
0316168815|4.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is one of the most unique, touching and satisfying novels I have ever read.  It's uniqueness stems from its unusual narrative perspective:  that of a murdered fourteen-year-old watching recounting events from her point of view.  Sebold creates a soft of first-person omniscient narrator-not completely new, but a rarity to be sure.  This style of narration adds to the story's emotional impact on the reader.  Susie, the narrator, watches from heaven her family and friends cope with her disappearance and apparent murder over the course of almost a decade.  Helpless, Susie watches the unit of her family fragment, while the individuals within the family grow, change, weaken, and adapt in each their own way.  Her close friends follow a similar route as the family, each dealing with the loss in their own ways-each moving, not necessarily forward, but in a random ricochet initiated by the sudden impact of Susie's murder.  In addition to friends and family, Susie watches her murderer as he eventually leaves town, alternating between trying to control himself and prowling for more victims.  The most satisfying but initially frustrating aspect of the novel is its seeming lack of closure:  nothing wraps up tidily at the end and justice, for many readers, may not have necessarily been served.  But it is interesting to note the progression of the characters through the stages of grief; and the sense of satisfaction comes from their movement toward hope and recovery.
0156027321|3.0|The meat of this book is the rather compelling Robinson Crusoe--Moby Dick-type adventure story, where sixteen-year old Pondicherry native Piscine (Pi) Patel is lost in a lifeboat on the high seas with a microcosmic slice of the food chain that gets boiled down pretty quickly to himself and a Royal Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. No, this is not a treacly little fantasy where the animals talk, and the oceanlife swirls around singing melancholic songs about shipwrecks and Exxon-Vandez. Yes, maybe Richard Parker utters a few words, but that is in the midst of a scary, feverish downward-spiral hallucination, and I do appreciate the author's attempts to abandon his cutesy undertones and show the ugliness and brutality of survival stripped down to its barest essence. <br /> <br />However, the book isn't connected to anything more substantial than that, and my problem with it is that it continually seems to be hinting at a higher purpose, some sort of a celestial calling, if you will. At the first sincere, hard glance within its text, I feel like the book would fold in on itself, and run away.  <br /> <br />Yann Mantel's prose is forcefully simplistic as if he's Hemingway writing a sequel to \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" While stylistically, the book is easy and enjoyable to read, it has none of the deeper meaning, imagery, and grit that you would find reading any of the classics this book seems to want to be; its attempts (mostly at the end) at satirical wit are weak, and when the book's tone switches gears to dark, blustery action sequences, Mantel's writing shows its superficialities the most, as the prose becomes muddled and obtuse.  <br /> <br />I found the hundred or so pages that precede the ship disaster utterly supercilious, and a bit tedious. I liked reading about Pi's father's job as a zookeeper, and the dangers of all wild animals when they feel cornered and try to protect their young (in case you don't get the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet where you live). Pi's religious confusion I found perplexing and dull, as if Milan Kundara at his worst had taken over the writing duties, and none of the book's themes afterward ever connected back to this dilemma in a stong enough way to justify its inclusion in the novel at all. As allegory, the book fails too, because its set-up doesn't support whatever mirrors Mantel was trying to shine back at us, and none of his characters are ever developed deeply enough to symbolize ANYTHING.  <br /> <br />You can tell that Mantel was patting himself on the back a great deal, knowing his fans would cite a literary tour-de-force, particularly at creating such a vivid and unstable character in the form of Richard Parker, a tiger. But actually not. Mantel vehemently sticks to the conventions he so tries to break free from, and all we see is an opportunity lost. But as cloying as the book can be, it isn't boring, and ultimately is worth a read. Pi's relationship to the tiger and his attempts at taming the beast are well-executed and interesting to read. The surreal, truly imaginative chunk of the adventure where Pi lands on a peaceful, utopian island that isn't quite what it seems, is close to brilliant, and my favorite part of the book. <br /> <br />Pi could have been a better-developed protagonist, but that didn't bother me as much as the astoundingly sophisticated ecological treatises this sheltered sixteen year old was able to form once he hit the water. I mean, wow. The predictable, hapless, infantile closing chapters unfortunately sour whatever illusions Mantel was able to create about his writing talent during the middle part of the book, and like Pi in many ways, we end up right where we started from.

0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill is a masterpiece of interwoven tragedies, ongoing dangers, social injustice, racism, all set to a central theme of one of the most heartbreaking dramas imaginable: an innocent child is viciously raped and left for dead. The crime itself was perpetrated by white men, upon a little black girl living in a racist town. Although racism is a powerful force in the plot, the most compelling conflict enacted in this human drama, is that of the heartwrenching dilema the father of this child finds himself in when the court system fails him and his wounded family. It becomes 'A Time to Kill'.<br /><br />  Although this was one of Grisholm's earlier books, I feel it is his best, simply because of the rawness of human emotion revealed in his writing. A Time to Kill is human drama at its finest.
B0002I831S|5.0|<br />Amazing that after 40 years Star Trek is just as fresh and interesting as if it were made yesterday.  Most shows from that era look silly now because they portrayed people unrealistically.  I love the way Captain Kirk snaps orders confidently and how Spock assesses situations and advises.   When faced with my own problems through life, I have often imagined what advice Spock would be giving me.  In the special features, much discussion exists about how tight the budget was.  A low budget actually turned out to be a blessing, because instead of expensive and boring special effects, the stories and acting had to be strong, giving the series a high degree of replay ability.  The scarcity and simple appearance of the furnishings and equipment aboard the Enterprise effectively add futuristic aura.  Future man has no need for clutter or complex appearing machinery.   <br /> <br />While trying to read objective reviews of this new and exciting DVD set, I came upon endless irrelevant and erroneous complaints.  Pay no attention to the whiners who have complained about the packaging or the order in which the episodes appear.  The packaging is unique, and not the problem some here has said it is.  The presentation order is the same as the airing order, or as Spock would say, the logical order.  The episodes are also numbered for the anal folks who are bothered by some personnel switches and want to watch them in their production order.  Others have unjustly opined that the pilot episode, \\"The Cage,\\" was not included.  These folks need to check their facts.  This odd non-episode was crude and never aired.  Instead it was incorporated into the 2-hour episode called \\"The Menagerie\\", which is included in this set, greatly improving the pilot and worked it into what we know as \\"Star Trek\\".  Also disregard the fools who complain about the special features.  Remember the show is 40 years old and had a tight budget to begin with.  Nobody is going to spend millions of bucks creating a bunch of worthless featurettes now that the cast and crew have been spread to the four winds.  For me, the purpose of owning this set is to be able to watch the 29 episodes without commercials and in uncut form, as often as I like.  The studio additionally has provided Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, which sounds nice, and a clear picture, making the series even better.  The human-interest feature about Shatner and his horses is precious.  I may not be as interested in some other special feature articles, but I can ignore them and won't complain that I don't like them.  The DVD set would not be cheaper without them.  <br /> <br />I look forward to season two! <br />
B0002DB52M|1.0|I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Dogville so I was excited to rent it. Then it started. I hadn't heard *anything* about it being a movie about a play. That in itself is disappointing. I wanted a movie, not a play. Then there was the \\"Master Of The Obvious\\" narration. I thought it too distracting, and annoying because I was trying to concentrate on the characters and the story. Especially the excellent interactions between Grace and Tom. The narration kept butting in telling you what you obviously could tell what was going on. I also did not enjoy the camera work. The shakiness was a little dizzying. Because of all these factors, I couldn't last more than half an hour.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I can't believe that so many performers would waste their talents in this, from stars Will Farrell and Christina Applegate to numerous cameos, from Ben Stiller to Tim Robbins. This is absolutely the worst I've ever seen from any of those folks I mentioned, with the possible exception of Ben Stiller's dismal character in DODGEBALL. The main setting harks back to one of the most better left forgotten eras in American history, when Helen Reddy was more than ready to give us hell, stirring up the cesspools of meaningless dissent, singing \\"I am woman, hear me roar\\", when the \\"sitcom\\" was born as a means of dubious entertainment, and men were portrayed as feeble-minded, and women were portrayed as poeple who like to assault the feeble-minded. It was an era that could have gladly come to an end (which it still hasn't completely yet) but this movie is a striking example of something determined to dredge it up and make us live it all over again. The male lead (I won't say hero), in  trying to court the female lead (I won't say heroine), utters a line so stupid it challenges how stupid something can be and still succeed, even in a farce. He says that \\"San Diego\\" is German for \\"whale's vagina\\". I am very much up for irreverent humor and certainly no nice Nelly. But when I heard that, I couldn't laugh. I just felt embarrassed to be of the same species that created such an inane attempt at humor. And that was in the relatively reality-grounded part of the movie! From there it shoots off in all different directions of screwball comedy, none of them really working or failing to clash with one another. There's a scene where anchormen from competing stations slash it out medieval-style with a motley assortment of weapons that they pull out of nowhere. That's where most of the cameos come in. We're supposed to find it funny when one guy gets an arm cut off in the brawl! This movie hasn't earned the right to tack on an ending that it would wish to make us care about. It would be better left seething in its own quagmire of manifold impertinancies. But, you guessed it. It puts a cliff-hanger ending on the end like we were supposed to care about its main characters as heroes. During that ending we're supposed to find it funny when the same guy who previously got an arm cut off gets his other arm cut off. Man, is this movie a desperately unfunny kind of \\"one-upmanship\\" or what? The cliffhanger ending has people falling into a bear pit at a zoo -- people the movie never made us care about before, but we're expected to go along, radically shifting gears into caring about them now. Could one more disparate clashing category of dumb humor be dragged into this mess? Yes! The way the ending is resolved is by a lost dog showing up and having an ability to engage in dialogue with bears! Best thing about the ending -- well, it IS the ending finally.
B00006879E|5.0|I usually don't listen to rock/pop bands since im into rap and r&b but my cousin had this cd and i absolutely cant stop listening to this. The lyrics are great, it's amazing how they capture relationships and love through their songs. The music is wonderful, some of the songs are worth blasting \\"Harder to Breathe\\" \\"Shiver\\" and \\"Tangled\\". Or relaxing to \\"The Sun\\" \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Secret\\". I love all the songs, they're great, need i say more, this is the best cd i ever bought this whole entire year and i dont just like only 5 songs but all!
B00020HEG6|5.0|If you have seen the movies then I am sure that the music impressed you. If it did then buy this. I love it!
B000002KBU|4.0|My mom used to play this record all the time when I was a kid.  My response always used to be, \\"Oh Mom, puhleeze!\\"  But I decided to get it on CD recently and I'm surprized by how much I like it.  Mom wasn't so wrong after all.  Songs from the heart, music that reaches into the depths of the soul. It's timeless.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I look around at the growing popularity of this band, and it amazes me that only a few years ago people would have rolled their eyes at a band like this, but now, everyone seems to listen to them, and they all listen to ( ). Agaetis byrjun, I think is the same, if not better than ( ), with all the beautiful tones and sounds, its an all around great album. If you like ( ), pick up this, it is a little bit slower, but very very worth it. the song Svefn g englar alone makes it worth your time, followed by Ny Batteri, and Staralfur. I don't know what these guys were thinking, but whatever it was, its become the majestic music Sigur Ros stands for today
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|With a famous contraversial rapper like Eminem to lead the way, what can you expect but an album with heart-felt emotions, expert lyricism, and the promise of a hilarious smash single. Yes D12 got that smash single in the hit, My Band, but everything else just falls short of Eminem standard. I also have to add that Eminem is not even in every song. The rest of D12 are great rappers no doubt, but they are stuck on one topic throughout most of the album, Sex. It's okay to rap about sex on a couple of songs but D12 over did it. If you like thier hits My Band, 40 oz, and How Come then that'll probably be the only thing you'll like from the D12 album. But if those songs are enough for you to get D12 world, go ahead, otherwise stay as far away as possible and just wait for Eminem new album, Encore.
B000000W5L|4.0|This is the pure rock and roll album that laid the foundation for all other rock albums to come.  The Stones created a muddled sound that really makes this album work all together.  It's not that it has great singles but it has great rock songs. \\"Sweet Virginia\\" is my favorite but really the whole album needs to be listened to.  This is one of their best along with all the other albums from 1968 to 1973.  They would never meet that creative period again and \\"Exile\\" was their best.  Also, see \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and \\"Let it Bleed.\\"
B0001AP12G|5.0|He's known for his beats, but in this album you'll get blown away by his words. Kanye has some of the most ill lyrical wordplay ever. He rhymes words using words that don't even rhyme. Not to mention he has some real big names in his album to accompany him like Ludacris, GLC, and even Jay-Z.  <br /> <br />The beats in this album are works of wonder that really make the lyrics shine. Some of the beats here are better than the ones he produced for other famous artist. If you didn't know, he produced Ludacris smash hit \\"Stand Up\\" and Alicia Keys's \\"You Don't Know My Name.\\" <br /> <br />Of all the CD's I own this has to be the most complete. It covers everything from racism, to religion, and an inspirational song saying that the drug dealers sell drugs to kids cause they think they'll die young, but the kids survive and live on to see that others don't make the same mistake. Or as Kanye would put it, \\"Drug Dealin, just to get by. Stack of money til it get sky high. We weren't suppose to make it past 25 the jokes on you, we still alive.\\" <br /> <br />                       A Masterpiece for Hip-Hop. <br />                              Pick It Up.
B00008AY3L|2.0|Around two years ago, I heard my first Ben Harper song, _Waiting on an Angel_, and quickly devoured his catalogue.  I loved nearly every song that he recorded before this album.  Almost everything he wrote bustled with virtuoso song writing and musicianship.  After I got through his older songs I read on the Internet that he had another album in the making.  I had very high hopes for his latest output and figured that he couldn't do much wrong.  I found all of his four previous albums remarkable after all.  But then he released this. <br /> <br />This album does not resonant with me very well; after listening to it several times, its fault become very apparent: the lyrics.  The lyrics do not have anything to them.  This disappointed me greatly because I really loved Ben in the past for his words and the delivery of his words.  On _Diamonds on the Inside_ though he seems to have a machine like writing method.  His verses follow a simple format:  \\"I want/need/feel something, but cannot because the opposite is true.\\"  He favors an obvious juxtaposition of opposites.  This technique does not make the lyrics bad in themselves, he used it to great effect on previous albums, but, when used in nearly every song, it becomes profusely apparent how much creativity and genuine feeling the words lack from such repetition.  At other times, the lyrics come up empty and vacuous, sometimes recycling his older lyrics.   <br /> <br />Take for example _When It's Good_,--already with a horrible chorus--, where he sings, \\"They say time will/Kill the pain/I say pain is gonna kill my time,\\" which has obvious similarities to a lyric in _Walk Away_ (\\"They say time will/Make all this go away/But it's time that's taken my tomorrows/And turned them into yesterdays\\").  The title track opens with the notably bad lyric of, \\"I knew a girl/Her name was truth/She was a horrible liar/\\"  Oh, come on Ben.  How can you sing that with a straight face after writing songs like _Roses From My Friends_ or _Give a Man a Home_, songs with introspection and soul.  He carries on in a similar vein of thoughtlessness in songs like _Bring the Funk_(\\"When you're down and out/There ain't no doubt/You need the Funk/\\"  Why would you write a lyric like that in your 30s?), _Temporary Remedy_(a notably awful song with notably awful screaming/singing), and _So High So Low_(\\"Now if I was strong/And you were male/You'd be dead/And I would be in jail/\\" A nice violent domestic-abuse threat from a political activist). <br /> <br />For fairness sake, not all the songs are bad.  The music actually sounds very good, but, even on a better song like _Amen Omen_ the chorus lyrics, (\\"Amen Omen/Will I see your face again\\") have a strong resemblance to a certain cover Ben does called _The Drugs Don't Work_ (\\"The drugs don't work/They just make you worse/But I know I'll see your face again\\").  The faults of this album make it very difficult to listen to and, now, when he plays live, he stands up, uses keyboards and has an additional guitarist, further distancing himself from a formula that worked so well on his previous albums and going for a more orchestrated sound while sacrificing depth and genuine sentiment.  It seems like he can still come up with nice progressions and melodies but has nothing to really write about except for a few trite statements about god, so he cranks out nonsense lyrics very quickly to complete a song and continue his career.  Maybe this album represents a brief transition in Ben's career to push him up to further greatness, but...maybe not.
B0002VKZL6|3.0|There's a lot of people out there who will not admit that they're waiting, album after album, for Knopfler to light up the afterburner on his guitar and kick ass again. But no, they say, we can't go back to the senior prom again. \\"An' further,\\" they huff, \\"Mark is more sophsticated now.\\" Yea, yea, yea. Mark may be more sophisticated but he's also a bore. <br /> <br />Trouble is, the man could fire it up if he wanted. But instead we get a collection of techically tight but overall rambling and mediocre tunes. It's indicative of this that most people point to \\"Boom Like That\\" as their favorite track. The reason is obvious. This is the closest Knopfler somes to catching fire again. <br /> <br />Like Ragpicker's Dream before it, Shangri-La is alright. But it's limp.  <br /> <br />Want a few good licks of old-style Knopfler guitar? Try John Fogerty's \\"Deju Vu.\\" Track 6, \\"Nobody's Here Anymore.\\" The guitar work sounds so much like \\"Sultans of Swing\\" that you'll swear it is Mark Knopfler... and it is.  <br /> <br />Bring it back Mark. Cut loose. For us. -- Tim Yoder
0679745653|4.0|Easy to finish  short novel is less romantic<br /><br />than the movie version, but still a quick and memorable read... You will picture Audrey Hepburn a lot when you see Holly in print, except maybe when she rifles off a few swear words. Almost the same as the film with a few rougher edges removed in movie form, like Hollywood usually does. Compare both examples. Decide which one you like more. Capote's style is elegant and a bit flamboyant in spots. Sort of like he was in interviews...

0380789035|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Neil Gaiman's ultra-literate Sandman series won't be surprised at the Beat-Poet-ish (Allen Ginsberg, perhaps) riffs, and the Biblical sweep of the Bhagavad-Gita soulful-meditation-on-truth Wagner-like operatic arias of prose in American Gods.<br /><br />To sum up the plot does the book an injustice. It is an apocalyptic fantasy pitting the old gods against the gods of the Digital Age. It is a tale of redemption (or is it?) for the Everyman hero, Shadow, as well as for America. It takes us through many mythologies such as Native American (Don't know Wisakedjak? You will!), Norse (The villain, Mr. Wednesday, is purportedly Wotan, as in Odin, a favorite in Gaiman's Sandman odysseys), and modern pseudo-mythologies such as media, Internet and television.<br /><br />And although you may be wondering at page 400 where it's going, just let yourself get lost in Gaiman's playful, emotional prose and his American Gods.

B000002HEM|4.0|Yes - a great concert with great songs and performances.  It is a bit disappointing that an outfit with as much cash as MTV could not have placed the mics a bit better and geared up the production quality a bit.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the best movies/series about WW2 that I personally feel is out in stores nowadays. Though the entire collection is some 90 bucks, keep in mind that this is definately worth it for just the battle scenes alone. <br /> <br />Now I personally like to see the relationships between the soldiers rather than seeing guys getting shot or wounded in battle. It makes me miss the guys even more if they are shot because I sort of feel like they are someone I know who lives across the street from me or is my best friend. <br /> <br />The main story focusses on men of Easy Company, who are paratroopers of the 101st airborne who fight in Germany during World War 2. While most of the disks are taken place during the war, I found myself liking the first and second disks the best, as the men trained for months before the war and then actually got to jump right before D-Day.  <br /> <br />David Schwimmer also makes an appearance as their drill sergant, who seemed to relish the fact that he could make their lives a living miserable hell if he really wanted to. One scene is that the cafeterias serve spaghetti one day, only to have a heavy duty run up several hills right after. A lot of guys lost their lunches in the following scenes. <br /> <br />Anyway, each disk has their own storylines in them. From the first at bootcamp, to the sixth or seventh when they were entrenched in snow and forests outside several german occupied towns.  <br /> <br />Now some of the camera scenes may be a little hard to follow [the camera angles go up down, back and forth] but I soon got used to it and actually found it to add more to the suspense because the men were probably too distracted by the bombing to focus on the surrounding trees in detail. <br /> <br />Now I really liked the acting, I thought the guys from New York were great, lots of talk about respect and earning it was in here, and i really respected what these guys did for each other, and for others. I really got to liking these guys more and more. <br /> <br />All in all, this is probably the best story about bonding and wartime. The Men of Easy Company, in real life, even tell their experiences in war right before each episode starts, so it was cool to see them in real life. <br /> <br />I would definately reccommend this, and if you don't have the money, well Christmas and Hanukah are in a few weeks, get my point?
0316168815|1.0|Oy.  Just read up to about page 75, skip the next 200 pages and then read the rest.   <br /> <br />What a cliche this book is.  It reminds me of Summer Sisters by Judy Blume (a WAY better read, by the way).  The mother who leaves her family because of her dissatisfaction with her life.  The baby born and named after the beloved deceased.  Was Susie's body ever found???  I don't know, because I scanned the last 1/3 of the book.  I don't think it was.  I don't really care anymore, either.

6305807930|5.0|In my review for Suspiria I put that it was my 4th film of Argento's I watched but it was my 5th...just wanted to fix that first. <BR>  Inferno is one hot movie. I cannot believe how scary this movie is. It is very dark, gothic. This is one erie story fimilar to Suspiria. This time, there is less time to get to know the characters because they don't stay alive long. What I am trying to say is..there seems to be a huge difference between this and Suspiria. Suspiria had a less complex story, you got to know the characters well, it made sense. Inferno, the story is far more bizarre, you don't really see the witch often (more in 1st person views during murders..seeing gloves). This film leaves me with an uneasy feeling. It sort of makes you wonder about life. I'm not saying I believe in witches, but this opens up your mind and makes you wonder about things. The hot dog vendor was freaky. I heard about this part before I saw this movie so when I saw him running..I knew what he was going to do. This film is one of the scariest I have ever viewed. It is so dark that I am left with unsetteling feelings.
B000002I99|5.0|Being an Alice Cooper fan I have EVERY album including the imports the man has ever put out. And up until Recently Love it to Death was by far my favorite. And as for the Alice Cooper Group Love it to Death still is my favorite. But Welcome to my Nightmare was and still is Alice's BEST solo Album, if you have the chance buy this album but also purchase the Welcome To My Nightmare DVD , the concert is by far one of the best I have ever seen, live or on DVD.  I saw Alice in concert Sept of 2004 and he is still the best I have ever seen, even with age knocking at his back door, he still seems to have the stage magic we all learned to love with Alice. This album not only rocks, but tells a twisted story, which helps tie all tracks together and make it a gem to any collection. No matter what you pay , you will see that your money is well spent. Even if you arent an Alice fan , if you have blood in your veins and have a pulse you will enjoy the music and creativity of this album. A Halloween must , but dont mothball it for the rest of the year, because once you listen to it , it will be stuck in your head, and you will want to hear it again and again , top hats off to Mr. Cooper on this amazing album.
B00005ASOI|4.0|Becoming more and more fimilar with the world of Dario Argento, I decided to watch Suspiria. The opening scene was brilliant. Music composed by Goblin suited this film well. Some of the drums sounds got a bit annoying after a while though. My only complant with this movie is the ending. The whole time I was watching the movie..I kept imagining all the witches chassing Suzy through the school. I thought the ending would be a lot different. There are so many questions I wanted answered but never got them. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this movie very much and think it is great but for some reason during Argento's movies..I come up with great ideas for endings but they are always different..for the worse. That one lady, the mean one with grey hair creeps me out. This is a great film...even though the ending was not what I expected.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm snooty. Musically, very snooty. I don't like bands that dress weird. Music that 13 year olds like, rub me the wrong way. I'm a total highbrowed music snob, and it shows. Just browse my cd collection and you'd see; Seventy-five percent of it is comprised of artists that don't know how to read proper music, play a maximum of seven chords, and are afflicted by some sort of mental retardation.      *adjusts glasses*    That being said, I picked up this album one day while being completely whacked out of my mind. I Just figured what the heck, I've heard a ten second loop on MTV2 (the newest worst channel on earth) of one songs from the album about 30 times, and it sounds really cool, I'll try it.     After listening to this album once, I realized there were some grood songs on it. Then somewhere between my second listen and (make up a number) listen, I began to like this album enough that it would warrant me placing it inbetween Wesley Willis and The Singing Kolenda Family. Not quite as great as Fingerman or anything, but up there.    The songs are pretty dark and catchy ..catchy in an endless droning sort of way. The band locks into these grooves and just starts picking away at it; with the weirdo singing over top of all of that like he's either going to kill himself or implode.      By this point I'm supposed to be ranting on and on about how simular or dissimular these guys are to Joy Division or whoever, but I really don't care to get into the whole speculative chaos of which band is supposedly the only band in the universe licensed to pout like sissys over top of cloudy goth music.     It's a pretty good album, slightly boring as hell. If you're in the mood to pout like a little sissy baby for an hour, it gets the job done nicely.     Just as of lately, I've found that this record is perhaps the best record I've found yet to make toast to. Try it. Press play, then begin the process of tanning your bread. Keep pressing down on the toaster each time the bread popsup. Don't stop this process until the record is over. Then unplugged the toaster, turn it upside down, and pour the burnt crumbs into your @#$%. Then light yourself on fire while spinning around seventeen times in a counter-clockwise motion while shouting \\"light-bulbs! light-bulbs!\\".    I write these for free so what do you want from me? Go read Rolling Stone.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I've been listening to Fiona Apple for a long time now, and I figure it's only right that I come to Amazon.com and write a babbling review for this record.     Fiona Apple is amazing.     I've nothing interesting to say about the record, which is why I'm writing this review. It's great, but if you're new to her material and wondering whether Fiona Apple is typical mtv stuff, or more quality; she's more quality. A hermit that sits at home all day, drinking, and passing the time by submersing different fisher-price electronic toys in water just to hear what dying sound each one emitts would probably enjoy this record much more then your average Mike Johnson poogily bear, cook-out loving basketball playing skin-head weasle.     See what I'm saying? ^ Therefore it must be brilliant.        Thanks for your time.
0930289455|5.0|We all know that Frank Miller's classic Dark Knight Returns is the definitive Batman story, but it's also known that the Killing Joke is just as essential.  Written by the masterful Alan Moore (Watchmen, V For Vendetta, From Hell, you know the rest...), we are given a re-imagination of the origin of the Joker, and we witness him pointlessly and brutally shoot Barbara Gordon, permanently crippling her.  This is followed by her father, Commissioner Gordon, being pushed to the brink of his sanity with the Dark Knight in hot pursuit.  Moore's look into the absurdity and cynicism of fate make the Joker more terrifying than he had ever been, and Brian Bolland's art became the defining look of the character.  All in all, this is a must for everyone's collection, whether you are a Bat-fan or Moore fan.
0792110188|4.0|The third of Howard Hawks four westerns starring John Wayne, \\"El Dorado\\" lacks some of the emotional impact, and even some of the excitement and foreboding, of \\"Rio Bravo,\\" their previous work together. It is, for better and worse, a rehash of \\"Rio Bravo.\\" For worse, it features the not-as-good Robert Mitchum portraying a character similar to Dean Martin's Dude, which was a powerful character in the earlier film. Also, the story is predictable for the most part. For good, though, James Caan does a better job as Mississippi in this film than Ricky Nelson did as Colorado in \\"Rio Bravo.\\" The gunfights are also well-done. And, last but not least, it IS a John Wayne film, and no film Wayne did was bad, in my opinion.<br />Overall, a fine film that lacks the impact of \\"Rio Bravo,\\" but is still an exciting John Wayne adventure! Grade: B+
B00004ZAV3|2.0|The Beatles are by far the best band known to man, but this CD does not have the best music by the Beatles. In fact, it gives me a head ache. Now don't get me wrong, they're good songs, and i highly recommend it if you're just starting to listen to the Beatles, but if you're looking for the best Beatles music, buy The White Album.
B0002SROT0|4.0|This has been one of the most anticipated music releases in recent years, certainly for me. I was a latecomer to Elliott's music, basically working backwards through his catalogue (which I actually think is a pretty good way to get into his music) from Figure 8. First of all, it's clear that songs on this new album were pretty much finished. Whether there were other songs floating around that could have made this into a double album I don't really know. What I do know is that this is certainly no collection of half-baked ideas and sketchy demos. It's a nice footnote to his catalogue, not as great as any of his other albums, but with flashes of what made him the greatest singer/songwriter of his generation. The standout gem here is \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\", a brilliant and heartfelt song which has immediately become one of my all-time favourite Elliott songs - it holds its own with such songs as \\"Sweet Adeline\\", \\"Condor Avenue\\", \\"Alameda\\", \\"Son of Sam\\" and \\"Color Bars\\" - that's pretty exalted company. Unfortunately this album just isn't as consistent as I had hoped - any fan will tell you that over his previous 5 albums, he really didn't record a sub-standard track. That's almost true here too, but unfortunately there are a couple of songs here that have me reaching for the skip button - \\"King's Crossing\\" just doesn't work at all, \\"Ostrich and Chirping\\" is pointless and \\"Shooting Star\\" just doesn't do anything for me. \\"Don't Go Down\\" threatens to bury a great melody underneath a wall of distortion but it sort of works regardless (though it would have been better without the noise)....actually, the opener, \\"Coast To Coast\\" is the one instance where Elliott's desire to rev up the guitars really pays off. Elsewhere, there are some great songs that come close to classic status - \\"Let's Get Lost\\", \\"A Fond Farewell\\", \\"Twilight\\", \\"A Passing Feeling\\", \\"The Last Hour\\" and \\"Memory Lane\\"....these songs are all terrific but they come off as being slightly weak simply because \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\" is so good. \\"Strung Out Again\\" and \\"Little One\\" are the second and third best songs on the album - they are both wonderful. So overall, this is a very good collection - sure, it could have been better, but there's plenty of great music here. Elliott was such a great talent, and I'll be listening to this for a long time, along with his other albums.....like everyone else, I wish this wasn't the end but it almost seems greedy to ask for anything more. After all, I can't think of any other artist who has left us with 6 albums of such consistent and lasting quality. That's something we should all be grateful for.
1594200106|1.0|Sincethe majority of the \\"reviewers\\" on this page say this book is the best novel they have ever read, that only confirms my belief that americans are naive, superficila and provincial. Ruiz Zafon, the author, has found a formula to delight american readers by providing them with unlikely stories, tortuous plots, cheap suspense and soap gothic drama.<br /><br />I think The shadow..... is an insult to human intelligence and an abuse of our time, time that we could be investing somewhere else, like in Eric Ambler perhaps?
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is another classic from my childhood, it was scary then, and so it is now. Perfect actors were cast for this movie, in fact I doubt the movie Jaws would have been as good as it actually is if it hadn't been for the \\"dreamtheme\\" Spielberg, Shaw, Scheider and the wonderful Dreyfuss. I adore these three actors in Jaws, and Spielbergs' directions is the early work of a genious in progress, you know, I find Jaws among Spielbergs' best work ever - the best before Schindlers' List (though very uncomparable) - and the hard work he and his collegues had to put themselves through making the movie (see \\"The making of...\\" : Special feautures) was definetively worth all their frustrations until the movie were finally ready for the theatres back in 1975, and in the years after on vcr and then finally on dvd.  <br /> <br />Jaws is a movie with soul. Unless it would have been old-fashioned long ago. But the action-adventure-thriller-elements behind the story captured on screen are so facinating and impressive and unlike anything else ever made, the effects are \\"simple\\" (like the barrels) but function extremely well, and still today - now that we have got all sorts of computer-animated-effect-monsters (call it whatever you want) - what I mean is that \\"Deep blue sea\\" (the movie) could never be compared to \\"Jaws\\". In my opinion it is too simple, though perhaps twice as expensive as Jaws ever was. And that probably because is a movie much more than just a horror movie about a great white shark. It is more \\"realistic\\" - and about a small Island-society turned upside dow and against eachother when the tragedy strikes their usually tourist-season-based beaches, and how the tragedy splits the towns' inhabitans in two sides when the question lingers on wether they should close their beaches and risk their tourist-reputations, or keep them open just for the sake of earning money. Anyway, the movie is still impressive, just as entertaining and loveable.  <br /> <br />I think Robert Shawearned an Academy Award for his role in this project, a great actor. <br /> <br />
B00005JMH2|2.0|My expectations of this movie were low - I expected something cute and fun and forgettable like \\"The Wedding Planner.\\"  Well, this movie fell below even my low expectations. <br />JLo is awful.  She never could really act, but in her previous movie there was always a kind of sweetness and flakiness to her, and a sense that she was trying really hard, that made you forgive the bad acting and enjoy the movie anyhow. <br />But obviously her fame has gone to her head; here she comes across as arrogant and condescending to the audience - like she knows she's so important, she just can't be bothered to act.   <br />Gere was okay - he comes across as a nice, kind of exhausted man. <br />Sarandon was good but why she would waste her phenomenal talent in this was beyond me.  The other supporting actors were much better and more fun. <br />For the reasons the other reviewers cite, the main premise of the movie just doesn't work in Chicago - there are plenty of professionals who take ballroom dancing, and its no big deal.  The idea of Gere keeping it hidden seemed completely contrived and fake, while I've heard it works beautifully in the original Japanese film, where the culture would require keeping the dancing hidden.  The fact that there was zero chemistry between Gene and Lopez didn't help. <br />If you see this, get it on video for $2.50 - or wait for its tv appearance.

B000089QEN|5.0|Most of us period drama aficionados have been brought up on a fairly one-sided menu of Austen, and as a consequence some will be shocked by \\"Vanity Fair\\", which is a whole different ball-game. Austen may deal out the occasional pin-prick, but her social comedy remains well-mannered and has a basic sweetness. Thackeray provides a far more brutal kind of satire; \\"Vanity Fair\\", though nearly 200 years old, is a startlingly modern novel still. Rarely can a reader have been so hard put to find a single sympathetic character in a book. George Osborne is a heartless, vain opportunist; Jos Sedley a ridiculous coward; Amelia Sedley an insipid dreamer forever betting on the wrong horse; Dobbin on the other hand is just too good to be true and infuriatingly servile - et cetera. Only amidst such a cast are we tempted to feel a modicum of sympathy for viciously predatory Becky Sharp, who by modern standards would no doubt qualify as a psychopath. The tables only turn on her when she meets her equal in the vile lord Stayne (what's in a name), who warns her: \\"Don't overplay your hand, Mrs. Crawley - you're in very deep now...\\". She does overplay her hand, and her astonishing social climb is mercilessly reversed. It's all very Darwinian avant-la-lettre: survival of the fittest.<br /><br />Andrew Davies perfectly caught on to this in his gritty, highly original adaptation of Vanity Fair for TV. Apart from Becky Sharp (Natasha Little) the cast includes no pleasant beauties of either sex to please the eye. Murkiness and squalor are not eschewed and find their peak at Queen's Crawley, where maggots indeed crawl on Lady Crawley's dinner plate, and Sir Pitt senior devours his tripe with relish. Though not all viewers may be pleased, the fact is that the conditions shown in this series are far more realistic depictions of actual living conditions in late 18th and early 19th century England than the glossed-over prettiness presented in most Austen-films. And still many of the actors have much better teeth than they would have had in those days...<br /><br />The acting is quite excellent throughout, and the intensity of it is heightened by frequent use of close-ups. At other times camera movements are deliberately unsteady, lending a documentary feel to Amelia's visit of George's grave, and making the viewer share in the drunkenness when Osborne senior waxes sentimental over young George at his dinner table. In dialog, the camera may well very slowly pan across the room, taking in all the little trinkets and ornaments it meets underway before finally arriving at the face of the other character. Instead of the perfectly choreographed quadrilles of Pride and Prejudice, you may find a dance at a ball depicted by a mere quick succession of close-ups of feet and whirling skirts. It is all rather unconventional and extremely effective. So is the music - the score is dominated by several deliciously raucous wind-band themes that tell us we are, indeed, in a fairground.<br /><br />The DVD comes without any extra's. I'm unsure to judge the picture quality, as I am playing the disc to a PAL TV and don't know if this causes distortions. Still it looked more than acceptable, except that pale faces tended to go slightly blue in outdoor scenes, and that dark images looked a bit as if filmed through a slightly sooty lens, and sometimes had unsteady backgrounds.<br /><br />Though in the final reckoning this series may not quite aspire to the perfection of the latest BBC Pride & Prejudice, it is at least as worthwhile and involving to watch, and makes a very refreshing change from the usual period drama routines.etter teeth than they would have had in those days... <br />The acting is quite excellent throughout, and the intensity of it is heightened by frequent use of close-ups.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|I never read the novels this film is based on so I can't say I'm really a fan of the genre.  That said, I enjoyed \\"Master and Commander\\" immensely.  I thought that director Peter Weir captured the claustrophobia of being aboard a warship circa 1800 and the feeling of being embattled at sea.  The construction of the ships, from every creaking plank and rusting nail, is flawless.  The sound and cinematography here is superb.  As far as the story, it's slow going at first but as the film progresses and the characters become more fleshed out it picks up momentum.  As far as the performances, what can you say about Russell Crowe, probably one of the most versatile actors working today.  He can add another memorable character in Jack Aubrey, the cocksure and determined captain of the H.M.S. Surprise.  He is equalled by Paul Bettany, the ship's surgeon and naturalist, Stephen Maturon.  These two are as much confidantes as adversaries.  Whereas Aubrey obsesses over attacking a state of the art French ship, the Acheron, Maturon lobbies Aubrey about taking a more cautious approach.  One could almost draw an obvious parallel in modern pop culture(dare I say it? Kirk and McCoy).  Anybody looking for a well told story that takes it's time this is the film for you.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is an album that takes getting used to. Most people won't immediately \\"buy\\" this album. This is music to be listened to with your eyes closed late at night, with an open mind. Especially if you are used to Pablo Honey and Bends-age radiohead. But nevertheless, this album haunts you from the very first breathtakingly weird track. (It also kicks off the film \\"Vanilla Sky\\") If you are an open-minded Radiohead fan, BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I went into watching \\"The Hulk\\" with some trepidition.  I was well aware of it's reputation as being a disappointing rendering of the popular comic book.  I went away feeling that it was not that bad.  On the flip side, this film is the biggest botch of a potential franchise film since the screen version of \\"The Avengers\\".  To be blunt, this movie is just a bummer.  How else are you going to feel about a film where the title character is turned into a genetic mutant by his psychotic scientist father who also murders his mother?  The film does have alot going for it, though.  The performance of Eric Bana as Bruce Banner is excellent.  Bana is an actor to watch for, particularly after having seen him play Hector in \\"Troy\\".  Solid work is also delivered, as usual, by Jennifer Connelly as Betty Ross,  Banner's girlfriend, as well as Sam Elliott as Betty's colonel father.  The effects work is top-notch, particularly the Hulk transformation scenes.  On the minus side, the villains created for this film are unbelievably bad, I mean terrible.  Nick Nolte looks like his police mug shot as Banner's psycho father.  Josh Lucas as another evil scientist, normally a good actor, gives a performance straight out of the Snidely Whiplash school of screen villainy.  All he needed was a twirly mustache and the picture would have been complete.  Basically, why this film ultimately fails as a potential franchise film is through the choices made by director and scripter Ang Lee.  He chose to make this melancholic and dare I say it, arty, instead of something fun.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Before I begin, there are alot of people who don't understand punk music (or pop-punk, to a lesser degree), and therefore have no business writing a review about music in the genre. Also, for the love of god, if you're going to admit to being an old man who wrecks his daughter's things because they confuse you, please make sure that your command of english is, at the very least, equal to your \\"understanding\\" of punk music (\\"insatiable\\" is an adjective, the transitional verb is \\"sated\\").    Continuing on, I found the album to be a deeply thought out and mature criticism of contemporary America. The title track in particular is a cutting statement that sets the atmosphere for the rest of the album. I was impressed with their creative integrity and bravery in making the statements that they wanted, without fear of political reprisals, specifically: conservative, white, suburban Americans refusing to buy the album. It isn't every band who is willing to risk being called unpatriotic, or commieterroristreddevils or whatever the hell it is that \\"patriotic\\" red necks are scared of.     Punk music at its' best is politically charged (the clash), and anyone who criticizes Green Day for growing up and no longer writing apathetic songs about [wancking] doesn't understand the genre and, most likely, never will. (good)Punk music is about a break from tradition and conservative values, so it is ridiculous to citicize Green Day for aligning with liberals. I cant stress this enough: anyone who thinks otherwise will NEVER understand punk music and should stop listening to it and writing reviews about it immediately.    The storyline aside, the ideas in American Idiot are powerful and proof that as long as there are people who don't sit complacently by and let events unfold before them, there is still hope for America and for every Jesus and Jimmy living there.
B000063DFQ|5.0|I love it. But, like many others, when i first got i foud it to be meek and pale. I only knew trooper from before, so as the other albums from Maidens Golden age had 2-3 legendery songs, this seem to have one(the trooper). But slowly, listening after listenig, i began to love it. Arguably it's the best maiden album, but without any doubt the best played. Great riffs, catchy tunes,good base playing and solid drums make it an epic. Soo buy it  and give it some time and songs like trooper,flight of icarus,die with your boots on will become earworms. <br /> <br />P.S In an interview that Dickinson gave when maiden was here in Croatia, he mentioned this too be his fav. album. Mr.Dickinson doesn't fire blanks.
0385512104|5.0|As someone with experience with autism, I found this book insightful, humane, and frankly quite funny.  Christopher is clearly functioning at a reasonably high level (given the wide spectrum of those with autism), which allows the story to even take place.  The author remarkably depicts his mind and thoughts in an unsentimental but provocatively sympathetic voice.  The story is a good one and I would highly recommend this book to anyone tired of genre mysteries, which I think this book indirectly, but effectively critiques by ignoring the tired old formulas that have made most of these other mysteries boring beyond belief.
B000002KIT|5.0|Having been fortunate enough to having seen Thin Lizzy on their home turf in Dublin in 1977 and 1980, this vinyl/CD does hardly do the band justice.

B0001HAHXW|3.0|Listening to this album is like listening to a glass of water. It exudes about as much passion for its material as the corporate executives who've been cashing in on Clapton's deplorable laurel-resting for decades. This is \\"blues\\" for people who think Blink 182 is \\"punk.\\" It has been a long time since Clapton was a no-name strapping on his guitar for another session with the Yardbirds, and his recent recordings prove that he has forgotten what it was that brought him to pick up a guitar as a kid. He fails to understand that mere competence does not constitute \\"Blues\\" music. Blues comes from within, from a depth in the gut that's been hollowed out by the kind of real-life suffering that brought the original blues masters -- whose genius was not rewarded by millions of dollars in royalties, but by an occasional burst of applause by the roadside -- to their chosen craft. Take Robert Johnson, for example: he grew up in squalid poverty and worked as a sharecropper as a boy, his first child was stillborn and his first wife died during labor, his next wife suffered a breakdown and also died young, he suffered from terrible eyesight and, finally, he was poisoned to death at the age of 27. The idea behind Blues music upon its birth was that the artist had to HAVE the blues to sing the Blues. Clapton's lackluster performance here as on so many past records further demonstrates that he is too far removed from that state of the soul to make real music. My feelings about Clapton's latest album have nothing to do with \\"purism\\" or a lack of grittiness. I'll take a clean sound if it's got soul. I'm talking about modern blues masters like Charlie Musslewhite, RL Burnside, John Hammond or even Tom Waits. Clapton, by contrast, has compounded weak performances with vocal deliveries that sound as though the man is slipping into a coma as he sings. I'm sorry, but a guy who puts out albums with liner notes that include catalogs of his own merchandise is the last guy on earth who ought to be cutting blues records. Clapton has made it clear that the tremendous celebrity status he engendered as a young man was so unappealing to him that he is willing to release decades worth of diluted, subpar blues/rock, which he has done. He has proven to be a rather powerful enemy of his own reputation, and has subsequently forgotten how to bring his soul to the microphone. If anybody ought to be keeping his hands off those Robert Johnson records, it's Eric Clapton. If you want to know what Johnson sounded like, stick with the original tunes as well as those of his comrades: Son House, Robert Nighthawk, Elmore James, Mephis Slim, Honeyboy Edwards, Howlin' Wolf, Hacksaw Harney, Johnny Shines and other blues pioneers.be cutting blues records.

B00023BLXK|2.0|Patrick Swayze makes little more than a guest appearance in \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,\\" the misbegotten \\"sequel\\" to the 1987 box office smash that turned the actor into a bona fide movie star.<br /><br />This time around the focus is on Katey Miller (Romola Garai), a high school senior who moves with her family to Cuba in 1958, right on the eve of the Castro revolution.  While there, she goes from being a white-bread, college-bound bookworm to a hot-blooded Latin dancer under the tutelage of a young Cuban (\\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\"'s Diego Luna) who works poolside at the hotel where she and many other Americans live. Naturally, her cavorting around with a dark-skinned native raises a whole host of hackles among the snooty foreigners who live only to feed off the sweat and hard work of the indigenous population.<br /><br />Naturally, it is the dancing that is the key element in a film of this type, but even the choreography, which isn`t really all that impressive to begin with, can't overcome the film's humdrum storyline, shallow characterizations and infantile view of international politics.  The complexities of the Cuban revolution are glossed over in favor of soap opera mechanics and corny melodramatics.  As \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" proved long ago (only better), there's nothing like a governmental overthrow to put a little sizzle into your love life.<br /><br />As noted earlier, Swayze stops by briefly to reprise his role as Johnny Castle, providing Katie with a few words of wisdom and encouragement and showing her a few nifty dance moves before sending her on her way.  I hope Swayze was paid well for his efforts, but it seems a bit demeaning for a star of Swayze's caliber to be treated in so ungrateful and cavalier a fashion.  The irony is that the film would have been far more interesting had it focused on Castle instead of Katie, but it's obvious that the studio executives who green lighted this project weren't about to bankroll a dance film with a middle-aged actor in the lead role.  That \\"Shall We Dance?\\" will wind up doing far better at the box office than \\"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\\" may provide some sweet vindication not only for Swayze but for all the fans of the original film for which this sequel was allegedly made.middle-aged actor in the lead role.

6304711875|2.0|When I first saw the movie I was totally in love with it. But that was in like what? 1997. Anyways, I still think its a really good movie, but not scary at all. The first time I saw it i did think it was, but after that I was like &quot; and why did I think this was scary?&quot; But the plot in the movie is really good and original. I also like how they make fun of other horror movies. This is one of the best teen/slasher flicks though. The Sequals are pretty good. I read someone else's review and I totally agree with them on how the third one probably wasnt the way Kevin wanted it to be. I would have like to see what he came up with as the last installment. But whatever, the guy who wrote it still came up with a good idea.
B00004T0UT|5.0|A classic Elvis Presley album, and indeed one of his all-time greatest, \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\" presents the harvest of two recording marathons in early 1969 at Chips Moman's American Studios in Memphis. Following hot on the heels of the '68 Comeback Special, the Memphis sessions produced a string of hits and sterling cuts, which helped to reestablish Elvis as one of the leading figures in rock culture. Even now, some 35 years after date, there isn't a weak number on this disc, with Elvis returning to his roots of blues, rhythm 'n' blues, country and gospel, and blending it all into his charateristically eclectic mix, as only he could, yet with a force and conviction which hadn't been heard for years. The way he turns the old Eddy Arnold country hit-tune \\"I'll Hold You In My Heart\\" into a powerful blues cut which doesn't let go, is just one example. The opening \\"Wearin' That Loved on Look\\", \\"Long Black Limousine\\", \\"Power Of My Love\\", and \\"Any Day Now\\" are by any standards magnificent achievements.  For the current CD release six more songs from the Memphis sessions (the hits \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Kentucky Rain\\", \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\", among others) were added.   Highly recommended.
B000002I2I|5.0|After a couple of albums that were more noted for hit singles that smacked too much of pop music for their fans, namely 1968's \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" with \\"Hello, I Love You\\" and 1969's \\"The Soft Parade\\" with \\"Touch Me,\\" the Doors got back to their roots with \\"Morrison Hotel.\\"  This is clear from the opening track on this 1970 album, the rock 'n' booze anthem \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" which blasts this album into the stratosphere.  Robbie Krieger's opening riff sets the tone and Ray Manzarek pounds away on the piano to establish the mood, with the whole thing capped off by Jim Morrison's vocalized howls.  You can hear live versions of \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" but unfortunately none of them were ever performed in the perfect locale, which would have been a bar.  But you can imagine how great it would sound to hear this one blasting the top off of some juke joint.<br /><br />There are not any hit singles on the group's fifth studio album, which is undoubtedly why it went over better with the fans of the Doors, even if it only made it to #4 on the Billboard album charts.  To help validate the blues the Doors brought in the great sessions jazz guitarist Ray Neopolitan, albeit as a bass player (the Doors never really bothered with one).  The requisite touch of the exotic can be found in songs like \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" \\"Queen of the Highway,\\" and \\"Indian Summer.\\"  Morrison, who was noticeably disengaged in terms of both his lyrics and his singing on previous albums, is back to waxing poetic big time, as evidenced by \\"Ship of Fools,\\" which mixes nihilistic imagery with prospects for hope.  Again, Morrison is found commenting on the counterculture, singing about how \\"Everyone was hanging out/Hanging up and hanging down/Hanging in and holding fast.\\"  Musically the instrumental break is where the group gets to indulge in some showmanship where the emphasis is decidedly on jazz and no longer on pop.<br /><br />The other great track is \\"Peace Frog,\\" which comments on the \\"Blood in the streets,\\" but is more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death\\") and poetic (e.g., \\"Blood is the rose of mysterious union\\").  Again, Krieger and Manzarek provide the appropriate musical accompaniment to the verbal images of cultural unrest as the end of the turbulent Sixties being thrown out by Morrison.  The Doors often commented on what was happening in the streets without ever offering a solution, and this song is one of their best efforts in that regard.  One final track of note remains, and that would be the slow blues tune \\"The Spy,\\" simply because its music, if not its lyrics (e.g., \\"I know the word that you long to hear/I know your deepest, secret fear\\"), anticipates the last great Doors song to come on their final album, \\"L.A. Woman.\\"s more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., \\"Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death\\") and poetic (e.g., \\"Blood is the rose of mysterious union\\").

B00002E224|4.0|Viewers are going to consider \\"Before Sunrise\\" to be either refreshing or tedious.  On a train from Budapest to Vienna a German couple are having an argument that gets loud enough and uncomfortable enough that it forces Celine (Julie Delpy) to move to another part of the railroad car.  When the Germans continue their argument in the aisle and walk by, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) the young man now sitting across from Celine, leans over and asks the obvious question: What are those two fighting about?  Unfortunately Celine's German is not up to the task so we never know what exactly was the catalyst for what is to happen, but Celine and Jesse find other things to talk about.<br /><br />Jesse and Celine move their conversation to the diner car and keep on talking until they get to Vienna.  He has to get off to catch a plane the next morning, while she is heading on to Paris.  Then, on an impulse, he asks her to join him.  He does not have enough money for a hotel (which keeps this film from becoming predictable), and plans to stay up all night until it is time to go.  They can see what there is to see in Vienna at night as they enjoy each other's company and keep on talking.  However, the film refuses to become the predictable male fantasy, articulated by Celine, of an American boy meeting a French girl on a train, having sex with her, and then never seeing her again.  This road not usually taken may disappoint those who share such fantasies, but Hollywood has told that other story often enough for them go to the video store and find a similar tale that is rated R for more than language.<br /><br />I was not surprised that the script for \\"Before Sunrise\\" was written by a man, director Richard Linklater (\\"Slacker,\\" \\"Dazed and Confused), and a woman, actress and literature professor Kim Krizan (Master's thesis: \\"Anais Nin and The Psychology of Creativity\\").  What would surprise me if if the first drafts of this screenplay were not created using a tape recorder rather than a word processor as Linklater and Krizan worked out the dialogue by sitting around and talking it out.. Then again, I would not really have been surprised if Delpy and Hawke were making everything up as they go along, because there is also a sense in which \\"Before Sunrise\\" is Louie Malle's \\"My Dinner With Andre\\" with a better looking set of main characters and more locales.<br /><br />It is easy to think that \\"Before Sunrise\\" is a simple love story, a sort of post-modern version of the first half of \\"An Affair to Remember,\\" but the film is going for a different type of magic.  The moral to this particular romance is given by Celine, who tells Jesse: \\"If there's any kind of magic in this world, it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something. I know, it's almost impossible to succeed, but... who cares, really? The answer must be in the attempt.\\"word processor as Linklater and Krizan worked out the dialogue by sitting around and talking it out..

6301620208|5.0|The political controversy over \\"The Day After\\" when it was first broadcast in 1983 had to do with the idea that a television movie about a nuclear war was an indictment of the policies of the Reagan Administration. Of course \\"The Day After\\" was not an attack on a particular president, but rather it represented the liberal nightmare of the worst of all possible futures, with a full out nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. Four years later the ultimate conservative nightmare was aired with the mini-series \\"Amerika,\\" in which the United States has been taken over by the Communists. Both were predicated on questionable assumptions, the former on an escalation of a conflict over Berlin and the later on the effects of an electro-magnetic pulse, but those were both simply excuses to tell the story that wanted to be told.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"The Day After\\" is not so much a story as it is a depiction of what a nuclear war would be like that comes under the heading of \\"seeing is believing.\\" Prior to the airing of this television film Hollywood showed what it was like to live in the world after a nuclear war in films from \\"On the Beach\\" to \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,\\" suggested that a nuclear war would be so horrible that a president would drop nuclear bombs on New York City rather than go to war in \\"Fail Safe,\\" and ended the Cold War satire of \\"Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" with a series of atom bomb's exploding set to the popular song \\"We'll Meet Again.\\" But what they did not show was what that nuclear war would be like. Even the \\"Star Wars\\" universe assumed there would be a nuclear war some day, as did I, but depicting the horrors of such a war was never really done until \\"The Day After.\\"<br /><br />However, exploding mushroom clouds and the victims of radiation poison were not what was most memorable about \\"The Day After.\\" The cover of this video tape captures the iconic image from the film of the missiles taking off, with the people of Lawrence, Kansas looking up into the sky at the ICBMs headed towards the Soviet Union knowing that their missiles were heading for us. Suddenly it became clear that the true moment of horror would be when you saw those missiles because chances were you would never see the mushroom cloud that took your life. In fact, given the choice between being incinerated and surviving long enough to watch your loved ones suffer horribly, I think most people would hope for the quick death. This film turned those last few minutes of life from the old joke about how you need to bend over, put your head between your knees and kiss you ass goodbye into an enduring image of outright terror.<br /><br />The worst moments of this film are the painful period between the missiles taking off and the nukes exploding. One of the silos is right next to the Dahlberg farm, and the emotion nadir of the film is Denise Dahlberg (Lori Lethin) comes down the stairs holding the wedding dress she will never get to wear and her father tells her to get into the storm cellar. Then Jim Dahlberg (John Cullum) has to go upstairs and drag his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) screaming and crying away from the bed she is making in a desperate attempt to pretend that the world is not coming to an end.<br /><br />Jason Robards is Dr. Russell Oakes, who along with Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams) has to deal with the casualties following the detonations at a besieged hospital, and Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) is the guy who takes refuge with the Dahlbergs. Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) is the college professor who gets to supply most of the relatively small amount of exposition the story requires: a student thinks they are safe because Kansas is in the middle of nowhere, but the professor is the one who points out \\"There's no 'nowhere' anymore\\" since there is an Air Force base and 150 Minutemen Missile silos spread halfway down Missouri, all constituting \\"an awful lot of bullseyes.\\" When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.<br /><br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen. To say that this was a sobering idea to give an audience that was already depressed by what they had seen, would be an understatement. Sagan, of course, was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons and condemned the arms race. Speaking on the other side, which is to say in favor of the concept of nuclear deterrence, was William F. Buckley, Jr., and what we got to see in that debate (which is still available on video) was that both were right.<br /><br />It is rather amazing, given the history of humanity, that it has been almost sixty years since nuclear weapons have been used in war. Ironically, we now live in a world where we still believe that those weapons are going to be used, although now we assume it will be the work of terrorists (or an attempt to stop terrorists) and not a war between East and West. I would not be surprised if right now Hollywood is kicking around ideas of what it would be like the day after that sort of nuclear detonation, going beyond what we saw in \\"The Sum of All Fears.\\" Hopefully it would be as successful at forestalling our worst nightmares as \\"The Day After\\" has been these many years.llseyes.\\" When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.  <br /> <br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen.

I really loved this album first sight (first heard?), but I had my concerns about the quality of the the sound of the LP pressing made by the local Polydor (well, I didn't like the quality of sound records printed by the local Polydor until 1985). I bought this record once and again from international sources, even in tape (cassette) and time after time I thought that the sound quality wasn't satisfactory for me...<br /><br />Then, as a last chance, I bought in 2003 the new CD issue, Digitally Re-mastered 96 Khz - 24 bit technology issued by 2000 year... Just to hear this disk, I bought a totally new digital audio system... And then my ears heard the sound I expected to hear since I had 14 years old. This disk is one of my very favorites, together with Magnetic Fields, Equinoxe and Zoolook (in that order), although the rest of the Jarre work is exceptional too.<br /><br />I am a music lover, specifically Rock oriented. But only Jean Michel Jarre and Tomita had moved my attention to electronic sound, and they're my favorites in this arena. Oxigene puts a milestone in my life, and I think that would be done with yours if you listen to it carefully, lights off, eyes closed, well tempered sound and putting your mind in white. The sound will draw enough images in your mind to blow you away. Definitely, one of my best choices in music.
B0001I561E|5.0|Get ready for this new two-disc DVD set which is going to teach you a whole bunch of stuff about \\"Aladdin\\" you never knew, as well as present you with an aweseome version of the original film.<br /><br />The film itself is a masterpiece. It won two Academy Awards for its music and features a touching story and compelling cast of characters. The humor throughout the movie is spot-on, from the antics of Aladdin and the Genie (Robin Williams), to the cleverness of Princess Jasmine, and most definitely the bitingly witty remarks from the main villain Jafar and his sidekick parrot Iago (Gilbert Gottfried.) The entire movie has been remastered digitally with enhanced sound and is presented in widescreen. It is also close-captioned, or you can choose subtitles if you like.<br /><br />One of the most talked about special features of the DVD set is \\"Proud of Your Boy\\" --- a song deleted from the movie after it was decided to remove Aladdin's Mother from the story. With the DVD version, you get the awesome music video of this song by Clay Aiken. However, you also get a bunch more interesting material including the original storyboards from the scene, a behind-the-scenes view, commentary from the people involved with the music, and the original recording of the song by Alan Menken. (Which in my opinion is as at least as good as Clay's, if not better.)<br /><br />You'll also get three other deleted songs from the movie, as well as a new music video of \\"A Whole New World\\" and another bonus music video of it from 1992.<br /><br />There's much more to explore also. You'll get to see \\"A Diamond in the Rough: The Making of Aladdin,\\" which takes you inside the special effects, the music, the cast and casting and much more. There are several games and fun features, some more interesting than others: Aladdin's Magic Carpet Adventure, Inside the Genie's Lamp, The Genie World Tour and 3 Wishes Game.<br /><br />You'll also get movie stills, Pop-Up Fun Facts, and many other features.

B00005JMAH|5.0|Why is everyone bitching and moaning about how dark and depressing this movie is? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE!  And, I hate to break it to you, but things only get worse from here. People die in the next couple of books and it looks like Harry is not long for this world. I personally thought that the use of the clock to deal with the continuing theme of time was quite clever. I also thought that the Chris Colombus movies were plodding and they were too caught up in too many tiny details. If you want to deal with all the little detail, just read the damned book! Sometimes you can't translate everything over. Cuaron, in interviews, did deal with the issue of the stag patronus, saying it would be covered in a later movie. It's not like you don't know what it means anyway. About the uniforms, I don't know if anyone noticed during their dozen trips to the theater, Tom Riddle's uniform is different than Harry's. It is concievable that possibly Hogwarts decided to change uniforms over the summer and JK Rowling didn't think it was important enought to mention. The whole point of this tirade is that you cannot put directors or screenwriters in straight jackets and prevent them from adapting a book to a movie because it is just that: an adaptation. Gone With the Wind, when you factor in inflation, is the most successful movie of all time, and it is not religiously adapted from the book. I don't think anyone is quibbling about it. I don't think most people have even read the whole damn thing.  I just hope if JKR kills Harry you don't all get pissy at the director when he makes the movie scary.
B0002SROT0|5.0|This CD was my introduction to Elliott Smith and his work and I'm so glad I learned of him! His lyrics are not just sad; they are refreshingly honest lyrics about the deep pain we all feel when a cherished relationship goes sour or someone leaves our lives for good. It is indeed a touching tribute to Elliott that his two friends put together this collection of songs for his posthumous CD.<br /><br />The CD opens with a strong song called \\"Coast to Coast.\\" The music sometimes reminded me of The Beatles' style; Elliott plays the guitar masterfully. Although the songs are all very beautiful (and very sad), I would say that my personal favorite is \\"A Fond Farewell;\\" it seems so appropriate since his fans have been grieving over his unexpected early death. \\"Ostrich and Chirping\\" is a short and somewhat experimental type of instrumental that is thoughtfully done. \\"Let's Get Lost\\" is another excellent song.<br /><br />The liner notes include some of the lyrics along with some poetry and great photos of Elliott. The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers who write that perhaps it's a good idea not to fuss about what Elliott \\"would have wanted\\" if he had lived to see this to fruition. It stands very strong as is, a work of art for its beautiful songs and incredibly honest lyrics.<br /><br />I recommend this CD not just for Elliott fans but also for fans of any type of thoughtful, powerful alternative rock. We lost a great talent when he passed; perhaps this CD is one way we can enjoy his talents as well as celebrate his life.

And though the community is told that the old, the sick, and the disabled are \\"released\\" to another community, in reality, they are euthanized - many of them by Jonas' father. Meet the results of equality taken to an extreme. Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" contains elements of Plato's Republic, as well as Thomas More's \\"Utopia.\\" This book is an essential read for any intelligent child, and an intriguing read for any adult. It's been several years since I first read \\"The Giver\\", and though I've read a bit of Plato and of More, I am still entertained and enlightened by this fantastic utopian novel.
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is practically an instant classic; it's a charming tale for the whole family about a nervous father who must go after his son after the son strays and gets taken hostage in a dentist's office. The twist (as you may already know): it's underwater! The father and son are clown fishes; the father (voiced by Albert Brooks) gets help from a blue tang fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Although Dory suffers from short term memory loss, she proves to be helpful--mostly--to Marlin, the father, as he swims to Sydney Australia to find his son Nemo. Along the way there's plenty of action as Marlin and Dory encounter sharks that have gone on a vegetarian diet in a 12 step mode, surfing sea turtles and dangerous jellyfish! Of course, this is Disney and Pixar, so Marlin finds Nemo safely in the end and they all go back to the coral reef together. However, so as not to spoil too much of the plot, I won't tell you how Marlin and Nemo become reunited.<br /><br />The color, animation, and sound are all excellent. I did have to turn up the volume on my remote, however. On one DVD disc there is the full frame version of the movie; on the other DVD disc there is the widescreen version. The discs played well without any problems in my player; and the set is nicely packaged.<br /><br />The two DVD set is loaded-and I mean loaded--with extras, making this truly a collector's edition! There are commentaries along with deleted scenes, a documentary called Making Nemo about the production and preparation for the final film, virtual aquariums for your TV set, a game called \\"Fisharades,\\" a very well done semi-documentary called Exploring the Reef with Jean-Michel Cousteau and a short film (both with commentary and without) by Pixar called Knick Knack made in 1989, six years before Toy Story! There is more as well; it's truly awesome and guaranteed to keep all ages entertained.<br /><br />I would recommend this highly if you are looking for a family type of movie entertainment. It richly deserves more than the maximum five stars Amazon allows me to give! The movie and especially some of the extras about the making of the film are great for fans of computer animation. Seek this movie out and enjoy for years to come! GRINertainment. It richly deserves more than the maximum five stars Amazon allows me to give!

B000021YQV|4.0|Back in 2001,  when I first bought 'Toxicity', I listened to it alot. It was an addictive hard rock album that lasted for a few months. After that period of time though, while its still a good, enjoyable album, it gets kind of old, and the songs are just too overplayed everywhere. This album also marked a good time in my life as well, so it means alot to me. If you are in for a good mainstream hard rock, head banging, mosh pitting time, then get this. If you want a classic that you can listen to twenty years from now, maybe you should look else where, but this is just too good of a cd to actually miss, so I would suggest that you check it out. Now, I'll tell you more about the album. 'Toxicity' starts with the loud and heavy 'Prison Song', and throughout the album its like being in a tornado of rock. Limited edition versions of this album are also available (The covers are red and blue) if you can find them. They were fairly easy to obtain three years ago, but they can prove to be hard to get today.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles shaped popular music in many different ways. For a start, they wrote all their own hits and most of their other recordings. Their early albums contained covers but their later ones did not. In the pre-Beatles age, specialist songwriters normally wrote the songs, it being assumed that performers didn't have time. While the Beatles were not the first to write their own songs (Hank Williams and Buddy Holly are earlier examples that spring immediately to mind), the level of their success made it much easier for those that followed. The Beatles were so good at writing songs that they had too many to release as singles, allowing others to have hits with their songs though this compilation is, of course, limited to their own hits.<br /><br />The Beatles had so many number one hits in Britain and America that some were left out, the main omission being Strawberry fields forever. It was on the same single as Penny Lane but both sides were credited as A-sides. The coupling only made number two in Britain but made number one in America. Another omission is Please please me, which made number one in three British charts but not the one most commonly used these days, in which it peaked at number two. The omission of these tracks is less controversial than the alternative - editing other tracks to make room for them. Imagine the furore if that had been done.<br /><br />So we are left with twenty-seven of the best Beatles songs that made number one in Britain or America, often both. Some of the differences are fascinating. Love me do, their first UK single, barely made the UK top twenty and wasn't released in America until a year and a half later, following the success of other singles. Eight days a week and Yesterday were not released as UK singles at the time. Yesterday became a UK top ten hit for Matt Monro. The Beatles' version eventually made the UK top ten in the seventies. Eight days a week was given to Alma Cogan who made a brilliant recording of it but it didn't chart for her or anybody else in the UK.<br /><br />As an introduction to Beatles music, this is outstanding but it should leave you wanting more - much more.didn't chart for her or anybody else in the UK. <br /> <br />As an introduction to Beatles music, this is outstanding but it should leave you wanting more - much more.
B00029LNHS|3.0|i like rap/hip-hop. i really like Lets Get It Started, but the rest of the cd is just ok. I listen to it, but I have better cds. The best songs are prolly Hands Up, and Lets Get It Started. Okay cd, not great
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|If I could give three and a half stars I would. The band did well in having \\"Take Me Out\\" as their first single but the second-\\"This Fire\\" sort of surprised me.  I happen to think it inferior to the rest of the album with the exception of \\"Cheating\\".  Overall the CD is fairly enjoyable.
0606311777|5.0|The good news is that Elvis is still alive and flipping burgers at a Des Moines 'Burger Lord'. The bad news is that he's going to die right along with all of the rest of us when Doomsday rolls around next Saturday.<br /><br />By the way, there is no Rapture so don't think you're going to be able to settle down with a bowl of popcorn and watch the rest of us descend to Everlasting Torment.<br /><br />What are some of the signs that Armageddon is almost upon us?<br /><br />-Agnes Nutter predicted it<br /><br />-An Archangel (technically he's a Principality) and a rather famous snake band together to prevent it<br /><br />-Someone misplaced the Anti-Christ (technically the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Great Beast that is called Dragon, Prince of This World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness)<br /><br />-Atlantis rises out of the ocean and strands a cruise ship on its main plaza<br /><br />\\"Good Omens\\" is an extremely funny look at the End of the World--not in the gut-busting, laugh-out-loud style of a Dave Barry (at least not for me)--but in the best dead-pan, Monty Pythonesque 'take a normal object and rotate it into the wrong dimension' tradition. All of the main characters are loveable, earnest, and in some cases bumbling-- even the Witch-finder Sargeant. There are a couple of despicable (but bumbling) demons, and the Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are flat-out evil.

B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I love this cd. If you are a hold-out from Marillion's Fish era, buy this cd. This is better than ANYTHING they've ever done. This is Pink Floyd, meets Beatles, meets Marillion meets...? Solid music, solid lyrics, solid cd from start to finish. Buy the 2 cd version if possible. The extra cash you lay out will be justified by one song alone, Ocean Cloud. You may have to go to Marillion.com or ebay to get the 2 cd version. Do what you have to do to get it! I cannot say enough about this cd.
B00005JMAH|3.0|As an adult who loves these so-called children's books, I was a little disappointed with this movie.  I have read all the books and I felt that there was a lot of important background left out of this movie.  The first two movies were longer even though the books were shorter than Prisoner of Azkaban.  I think they could have tacked on another 30 min and stayed true to the book.  My six and eight year old had no problem sitting through the first two, I know it wouldn't have bothered them to sit through a little more in this one.  I also didn't like that he changed the appearance of hogwarts.  I know each director has his own style, but I think he could have left the appearance the same and still left his own imprint on the movie.  I did think, however, that he did a better job at accurately portraying Snape's attitude toward Harry, but he didn't give him enough screen time.  The same holds true with Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  All-in-all, the movie wasn't bad, but that is an adult's perspective.  My children enjoyed it just as much as the first two.  I will be buying the dvd for me as well as my kids.
0671027387|4.0|To start, I would like to say, this is a great book. I kinda started out in the wrong order of reading Dan Brown's books. I started with De Vinci Code, and went back from there. You can really tell in this book he was still fine tuning his skill for storytelling, I think he did a fantastic job on explaining and giving the historical back ground to all aspects of the plot. It was a real page turner, but you kinda figure things out about 3/4 of the way into the book, unlike Angels & deamons and De Vinci Code. I love Dan Brown's Books and can't wait for his new book coming next summer. I will be the first in line for it!!! If you are looking for a good conspiracy this is the book for you!!!
B000000OAH|2.0|Well, this is where Queen sold-out. Freddie got bored and ran out of Ideas after News of the World. The albums before this album have much more Flavour. If you look at the albums after this  - 'The Game' - Funk, 'Hot Space' - Munich Disco, 'The Works' - Weaker Song writing, 'A Kind fo Magic' - Better songwriting, very commericalised though, 'Miracle' - Very late eighties , 'Innuendo' - Better ...... You can see a turning point here. The band, writing to order just churn out another album, titled 'Jazz' for no reason. Freddie and Brians Avant -Garde , Bohemian , exploritory flavours ebb away to a commercial lift music album.<br /><br />Not that good.
B00002MZ12|5.0|That's not my first review about this album.  I don't use to listen to others' opinions so much, but I really do listen to this album, and it's important. People use to say many idiot things about their unfavorite songs, songwriters and singers, but I have seen so many mistakes about this album.  The first one says that she wanted to cash in with this, only. He is wrong. She cashed but if it was her real wish, she would have done this with other kind of music. She could have released an album like Under Rug Swept (the next after this) as soon as possible. Unplugged albums are important projects for the modern pop/rock music, but it's so far from being a secure way of getting money. So many albums from so many famous artists have not been aclaimed albums. So many good songs don't sound well in an Unplugged Versions, everyone knows it.  Other detail: in general, who chooses the artist to go unplugged and decides if it's a good project or it is going to fail is MTV Networks. Artists don't use to \\"order\\" an MTV Unplugged in their carreers. And about Alanis, so many little time of carrer, so much sucesses and singles that could figure in this album...  Other things I have seen as wrong are about how some people talk about the songs and make comments that are deeply mistaken. One, specially, talks about No Pressure Over Cappucino as a new song. It is one of the oldest ones from this album! It's the first time Maverick releases it but it's far from being a new song.  I have been listening continuingly this album since 1999. This is a project that has gone right, not wrong. I listen to Alanis Unplugged's songs on the radio (I live in the middle of Brazil) until today, and You Learn and That I Would Be Good (tracks #1 and #4) are big hits, concurring with hits of the moment in popular preferences.  (Unauthorized) Computer stores used to sell computers with this album (song files of it), I bought one copy of it some time. This kind of wrong thing just happens with successes.If this album weren't a successful one, people wouldn't want to make copies of it. This is completely obvious.  And nowadays, so much sucess, not oblivion. Her sucessful albums after it is an important clue to get this argumentation.
