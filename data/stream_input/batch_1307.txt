0060873027|1.0|I was given the book as a gift and with Crichton's name so large, missed the second \\"author\\".  At about page 20 when it became clear the character development and pace were not typically Crichton, I flipped back to the front cover and there it was: Second author.  I hate it when they do that! James Rollin's effusive review above is simply whorish.  Finished it because I started it.  Big disapointment.
0446573019|3.0|Like so many reviewers before me, I agree Zero Day is a Jack Reacher knockoff.<br /><br />- Decorated, respected military investigator on his own. Check.<br />- Small town. Check.<br />- Female sheriff. Will they or won't they? Check.<br />- Stranger-hating locals. Check.<br />- Hitchhiking from town to town. Nope. Puller drives a Chevy Malibu loaded with high-tech gear.<br />- Vagabond with only a toothbrush. Nope. Puller has an apartment and a cat named AWOL.<br /><br />I suppose one could make the argument the novels aren't EXACTLY the same. I did enjoy Zero Day but the obvious similarities to Lee Child's novels were distracting. Readers unfamiliar with the Jack Reacher series will likely enjoy this novel more (than Reacher fans) as they will be free from making constant comparisons between the two characters.

B004RFYEEC|5.0|Paul McCartney was present during the smile sessions.  His favorite song was God Only Knows and his favorite album was at the time Pet Sounds.  When he got back to England he wrote the majority of Sgt. Pepper for the Beatles because He knew what was coming.  When Brian heard Strawberry Fields Forever, he pulled over in his car and said, The Beatles got there first.  It was no accident.  Paul's writing was a direct decent of Brian Wilson's as Paul switched to writing on the Piano.  Paul had the rest of the Beatles, George Martin, and all the money EMI could invest in Sgt. Pepper.  The Beatles could do no wrong, but even EMI released SFF and Penny Lane  because they wanted a single too.  I believe without Pet Sounds and  Smile, the Beatles would have taken Revolver to another step and Sgt. Pepper might have been even greater because all may have contributed equally.  You might even say that Smile was what caused the friction in the Beatles since Paul became the guiding force in the studio and forever tried to motivate the others, and the Lennon/McCartney feud could be associated with the  Love/Parks/Wilson feud.  Don't forget, Even the Beatles stumbled when Brian Epstein died.  But for me, the Beatles never came close to Pet Sounds and could never achieve Smile because there was always multiple visions.  I love Pet Sounds but I'll cherish Smile.

B0067AC5KA|2.0|I thought it was odd how some reviews say oh the stilted language is the translator fault. I'm not sure the language would be any better in the original Swedish. Larsson' strengths aren't in wording anyway, they're in characters and plots. I liked the story but it devolves into porn way too much especially in the later books. Anyone with an imagination could've filled in the blanks. It didn't need to be spelled out page after page, time after time. If you don't mind, the story is okay.

B0026IUXO2|3.0|This film proves again that more deaths are caused by religion than any other cause. Philip, king of Spain, is Catholic. He is the most powerful ruler in Europe. Elizabeth, queen of England, a Protestant, is his nemesis. Elizabeth's advisers advise her to be careful of English Catholics. Elizabeth brushes away their fears, but they are right. She has imprisoned her sister Mary who is Catholic and who Philip wants to see enthroned in England. He sends an assassin to England to kill Elizabeth so that Mary could take the throne. Elizabeth is also advised that she should find a husband so that she can have a child; otherwise the people would prefer Mary who has had a child who could rule after her death. We watch Elizabeth falling in love with Walter Raleigh, a bandit who robs Spanish ships. We see the internal castle intrigue as Elizabeth's lady in waiting, her favorite, also falls for Raleigh. The film is interesting but it could have presented what it wants to say in in two thirds of the time. This shortening would have reduced the tediousness of parts of the film and increased the flow and intensity of the drama.

B004A8ZWXS|3.0|\\"War Horse\\" begins with the kind of sunlit bucolic scene one would expect from Steven Spielberg, followed by the inevitable bonding of a splendidly handsome horse named Joey with a splendidly handsome young man (Jeremy Irvine). Behind the sentiment is the portrayal of rural life in pre-WW I which hadn't changed much from the 17th century. Electricity and running water don't exist; plowing is still done gruelingly by hand behind a horse. All these harsh realities are complimented by evil landlords, callow heirs, weak, haunted fathers and sturdy, indomitable women, (especially Emily Watson, excellent as the only name actor in the film). The opening sequence of man and boy proving their mettle is clich&eacute;d but still packs emotional and visual power. The film, however, takes off as World War I erupts and the horse is sold to the British Army. This sequence begins much as the war did, with cheering crowds and beautifully uniformed soldiers riding off to an unimaginable hell. Spielberg's portrayal of that horror is perfectly nuanced and he wisely resists the urge to graphically replicate \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". There is no splattering blood or flying limbs. The hardest scenes to watch, judging from my audience's reaction, involve the brutality suffered by the horses as they are either shot to death by machine gun fire or worked to death hauling Krupp howitzers up endless, muddy ridges. The soldiers, once so enthusiastic, have been reduced by the filth, terror, and hopelessness of trench warfare. Although some have pegged \\"War Horse\\" as an anti-war film, it doesn't bludgeon the message as World War I is now universally viewed as one of the most wasteful and unnecessary wars in human history. The Germans and Brits are equally responsible for this carnage and equally the victims of it. The Germans are not so much evil (that will come with the next war) but methodical, executing deserters (two young brothers in one of the sadder scenes) and looting French farmers (one portrayed as a Jean Valjean look-alike) in a dispassionate, business-like manner. In fact, one of the most sympathetic characters in the film is a German horse wrangler trying futilely to protect his charges from destruction. World War I has always been overshadowed in films by its successor, but with the centennial coming up, maybe that will change. Spielberg's one vivid battle scene captures the horror emphatically. The most poignant scene in the film, of lone German and British soldiers cooperating in No Man's Land to free a barbed wire entangled Joey, makes the film worth the watch. Unfortunately, from there, Spielberg drops the ball, staging a sappy reunion with horse and boy followed by an embarrassing reunion with boy and family, lit by the most exaggerated sunset in film history. Still, this being Spielberg, even that cannot ruin what is a well-staged tale, with some of the most glorious cinematography available.as a Jean Valjean look-alike) in a dispassionate, business-like manner.

1607053888|3.0|I love the majority of the bags in this book, and was excited to give them a go myself. However, when I got to the pages with the patterns (which are attached in the back) my confusion began. They managed to cram the patterns for all the bags in this book onto two pages, front and back. The pattern pieces overlapped and when it came time to trace it took way more thought than I wanted to give to figure out which lines belonged to which pattern etc. So, if you're willing to invest some time into figuring out the method to their madness, go ahead and buy it. But if patterns confuse you, this probably isn't the book to start with.

B00005V9HH|4.0|I am not a fan of Stephen Baldwin and it is mainly through the acting of the other principles that this movie carries 4 stars, especially Kevin Spacey.  Although a bit more gratuitous violence than I like, I would consider the content to be tame by modern \\"Over The Top\\" action movies.  This is a movie that gets you to think and watch it again.  I actually quoted a line from the movie in a casual conversation (I do not want to spoil the plot ending) about Kaiser Sosze and got a good laugh.

I thoroughly enjoyed the first ten pages, but then it got old. There was no content, but just a bunch of pointless sentences with poor jokes sprinkled throughout. I can't even finish the book. I read probably 85% of it and I just can't bring myself to pick it back up. I really feel like Ellen is a great person but I was hoping for a book with some sort of glimpse into her life and some seriousness, but the whole thing was just silly. I do not suggest you buy this book. :/

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Just started watching this again on DVD, waiting for season 4 to resume and initiating our daughter into the show that my wife and I like so much. Had forgotten more than I realized. Wow, what a trip down memory lane! Back when you weren't certain of Massive Dynamic's motives or what shadowy things Peter was involved in. Or when Walter would suddenly stop everything to announce that he'd just peed his pants. Back when Fringe seemed more a knock off of X-Files, although I'd argue that Olivia & Peter are better than Scully & Mulder, and X-Files didn't have anything like Walter as a primary character. John Noble hams it up as Walter. His evolution over the course of the series is phenomenal and you'll only see that if you start here at Season 1. And when Walternate appears... Suffice to say that Noble deserves an Emmy nomination at least, and it's a crime that he's been overlooked.<br /><br />Not a show for the squeamish and it definitely goes all-out for the ick factor at times. Watch the pilot episode and you'll get a really good glimpse of what you're in store for, although not every episode is that gory. But the show is entertaining, and the acting is above par for science fiction shows. Dialogue is witty, much like the beloved Firefly. Even my wife and daughter watch, which is very unusual for science fiction shows. And it's got Leonard Nimoy!

B005KELS6Q|5.0|I got my wife a Kindle Touch for Christmas, but I was worried she'd break or scratch it by throwing it unprotected into her purse (where my old digital camera went to die).<br /><br />This is a pretty good solution to my worries. If the Touch is in the sleeve, it has a bit of drop protection and the keys jingling around in the purse won't scratch the screen.<br /><br />At the same time, it's thin enough that it doesn't take up too too much space, which is also nice.
1594202842|5.0|I recently purchased an iphone. As a practical person--I didn't see the need for one--since I have a ton of electronic devices in my life--all of which annoy  me and love at the same time. I was a tough one to drag into the cell phone in the first place--I believe a person have time in the day when they are un-reachable and not feel like they're upsetting someone in doing so. But--my husband insisted--as I was making long drives for work that made it a safety issue. We always get him the technology before I get it--and I sincerely didn't think this phone would be that diffferent than any other phone I had--and I have never been  totally impressed with it's impact on my life at all--it has only complicated it.   So I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled on an app that allowed me to use my phone to purchase and read books. I love books--but have never been a very good reader. My mom and my sister are avid readers and I've always envied their ability to read books with ease. I would always fight through sleepy eyes just a few pages into the book--put it down and never go back. I even asked my mother for tips on how she is able to read so fast--and stay awake. She'd chuckle and give me clues--but it never worked. So, the number of books I've read is embarrassing--as I know they are the key to knowledge I so yearn to have!   But-this crazy modern device has been the key I couldn't find--and I have been able to find some books I am soooo grateful kept me awake (some nights til the wee hours of the morning) reading--and the best part--with ease!   I attribute this to a few things but utmost to the authors and one of them is Amy Chua! I love the way she writes. I feel like I am in her head walking the paces of her life. I connected with the way she struggles to NOT do the things that she knows others don't approve of--but she is propelled to do it anyway--in preservation of who she is--which she takes pride in (another admirable quality) and for her children--that ruleher days, nights and sleep! She is the most dedicated mother I have read about--beyond my own mother. Who was not a Tiger Mother (I had a Tiger Dad instead) but who was as dedicated and passionate about helping us acheive more than she did! I use what she taught me everyday--and now that I am a Mom of a 4-year old--adopted from China in 2009--at 52 years old--her wisdom, strength, courage, compassion, protective and deep, deep sacrafice are all things I admire and try to emulate each day with my own daughter. I feel like I fail miserably some days--but, I always know I was lucky to have the parents I had.   With that said--highly recommend this book. I think most western parents if totally honest with themselves and others would find this book refreshing in it's ability to show us--that being a strict and controlling parent that has the highest expectations for our children (instead of accepting the easy effort route--or the get by and praise it as if it was the best they can do) will NOT as so many think result in children with suicidal tendencies, or with a lack of ambitiion or most western parents fear--they won't LIKE them.   I could write a book about the stories of my own parents techniques--and it would be as shocking I'm sure as this books seems to have had in the media. So, perhaps I'm biased, but I say, \\"Kudos to you Amy Chun\\" for writing your heart, your life and your passion in a way that's not easy--but educational and down right inspiring. You have confirmed what my heart was telling me was right--while the world was telling me was wrong. And I will be forever grateful--and changed by this book.   Thank you for being brave enough to write about it. For subjecting your family to the criticism you've endured--because you are Making a Difference. It seems your family (your main goal of course) has also benefited greatly from this work--which is a gift as well.   PS--if you read the Kindle version--it will show you passages highlighted by more than 3-4 people throughout the book. Those passages are NOT the ones you see \\"highlighted\\" I'd even say exploited for their own ratings in the media. It is my opinion--the media used your book for ratings and typical hype. But in the end--it's the reason I found your book--that and the fact that I am now the mother of an amazing, highly intelligent, compassionate, joyful, tough and courageous little girl from China. That I am proud of everyday--and fear I will not do what it takes to help her reach what is so obviously her highest level of achievement in all areas of her life -- professional, relationships, creative, and happiness! I only can promise I will give it all I have--she is rocks my world--and I am forever grateful.

1439192812|4.0|Richard Dawkins is one of the world's best known evolutionary biologists. He is also one of the great popularizers of science, especially biology, and has made an international reputation as a tireless advocate of evolution and atheism. It's safe to say he is a creationist's nightmare: intelligent, informed and articulate, and a fearsome debater. Those same skills have made him controversial and, as is demonstrated by the reviews and comments here, too often it's Dawkins that gets reviewed instead of the books he writes.<br /><br />But in [[ASIN:1439192812 The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True]] Dawkins strikes a more conciliatory note, only indirectly confronting religion. Instead, Dawkins describes a series of myths from a wide array of cultures, and then offers the scientific explanation as a counterpoint. Dave McKean's illustrations are always insightful in support of Dawkins' writing, and sometimes simply brilliant. An example is the discussion of earthquakes. Dawkins discusses the myths - including the Biblical claim that trumpets shook down the walls of Jericho - about the origins of earthquakes. The Japanese thought that the world wrote on the back of a gigantic catfish called Namazu, and when Namazu flipped his tail, there were earthquakes. The Maoris thought the earth was pregnant, and earthquakes were her the baby's kicking. Dawkins then talks about what earthquakes really are, discussing plate tectonics and why plate movement causes 'quakes. Dawkins marshals the scientific evidence. The contrast between the silly myths and the logical science is strong, effective and persuasive.<br /><br />Using the same technique, Dawkins demolishes myths that purport to explain the diversity of life, the sun, rainbows, origin of species and miracles. McKean's drawings, especially his drawings to illustrate the myths, are spot-on and add a lot to the pleasure of the book. It's a nice collaboration.<br /><br />One of Dawkins' key points, made very effectively, is that we used myths to explain things we didn't understand; when we have a real explanation, we no longer need the myth. The implications for the Biblical myths cherished by a significant percentage of Western culture, are obvious. As I said earlier, it's a less direct attack on religion. It's no less magical, but it is real instead of mythical. It's a point Dawkins made earlier in [[ASIN:0618056734 Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder]]. A rainbow is no less wonderful or beautiful because we know what causes them. And it's not a rainbow-colored snake drinking water.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is to ask, who is the intended audience? It's not precisely a children's book, although a bright kid would appreciate it. It's not really aimed at adults, although the concepts are challenging enough. It doesn't seem likely to change anyone's mind, except in the unlikely event they approach the book with an open mind. But as a tool for contrasting the supernatural magic of mythology with the magical delight of discovery, the book is unsurpassed.<br /><br />Recommended.explain things we didn't understand; when we have a real explanation, we no longer need the myth.

B005UT29Z0|4.0|Kudos to J.C. Chandor for writing and directing this remarkable film, which never patronizes its audience or demonizes its subjects -- the men (and a few women) who traded mortgage-backed securities in the days leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Chandor recognized that these traders and sales people and their colleagues provided legitimate human drama, and that their actions raised worthwhile questions about fairness, and how we should respond if asked to hurt others, or to make personal sacrifices for the survival of a company that would make no sacrifice for us.<br /><br />(Spoilers below)<br /><br />As the story unfurled and the immensity of the crisis became apparent to management, I expected a by-the-numbers thriller in which evil management tries to eliminate the nosy underlings who have discovered their dirty secrets.<br /><br />Nothing like that happens. Mid-level risk manager Zachary Quinto completes an analysis by his boss, Stanley Tucci, and realizes that the firm's survival is threatened by even a small drop in housing prices or increase in price volatility. He immediately calls in his boss, who doesn't at first understand but who is convinced. He escalates the problem. This cycle repeats itself until, with a few hours, the CEO and executive committee of the bank is involved and sets the strategy for the next day's trading.<br /><br />It's virtually all 100% believable, down to fine touches like the fact that the characters on screen never mention the kind of securities they trade until the problem has been escalated to the CEO's level. In real life they wouldn't need to, as they all worked in the same group and the assets would already have been assumed. The casual way in which the characters discuss money rings totally true. The relationship between the traders and risk managers and management felt right (I work on Wall Street and could tell who held which job on the basis of their behavior long before the script made it clear).<br /><br />I've only a few minor issues with the film -- first, in real life, if you hold an emergency meeting at 4:00am, not everybody shows up in a perfectly pressed suit, perfectly shaved and/or coiffed. Second, the moral qualms shown by Kevin Spacey weren't quite right. He knew that his traders were going to hurt their customers, and that many of them would be fired soon afterwards, but I can't imagine the real world equivalent of his character worrying that  his employees would be unemployable as a result. In reality, his desk produced results better than any of its competitors by selling earlier, and that track record would add enormous resume value to every member of his team. At one point Zachary Quinto learns how much the head of his trading desk made the year before, and he expresses surprise and populist objections. No part of that felt right.<br /><br />There was a problem with my copy of the DVD, with brightness levels changing discontinuously about half a dozen times. I don't know if that is a general problem with the mastering or not.<br /><br />Anyway, an excellent film. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could.real life, if you hold an emergency meeting at 4:00am, not everybody shows up in a perfectly pressed suit, perfectly shaved and/or coiffed.

There was a problem with my copy of the DVD, with brightness levels changing discontinuously about half a dozen times. I don't know if that is a general problem with the mastering or not.  Anyway, an excellent film. I'd give 4.5 stars if I could.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|just started playing...it seems ok so far.  my four year old loves it and it seems pretty easy to get enough points to unlock the new games.
B00063F8B2|5.0|This CD was very enjoyable to listen to. I especially loved Believe. I purchased it from Amazon which was less expensive than other sites including walmart. I think it is a Christmas classic.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The cover does exactly what it says it does. It works great. I have not had any problems with it.
0756686970|5.0|This book has EVERYONE you ever wanted to learn about.Each time we see a new person out comes the book to learn all about them. (This is a huge help to those of us that need reminders who characters are.)
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this is one of my favorit apps my little brother plays it non-stop toatlly awesome o and click on the sun at the home page with the levels for a golden egg
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The third in the much-acclaimed A Song of Ice and Fire series doesn't disappoint. Murders, scheming, battles, magic--it's all there, and I found myself at the end of nearly every chapter dying to know what happens next.<br />Another development I didn't expect: I found myself starting to root for the evil Lannisters, especially Jaime and Tyrion. Nicely done!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put the book down. I read all three books within a week. I am so excited that the first movie is coming out. I cannot wait to watch it. I would definately reccommend this series of books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game has me addicted... I'm playing everytime I get a break. the games are good quality and are def worth playing!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is so cool. I like all of the games. It was fun to play. Some of the controls were bad though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|okay you should not make people use point to buy more games but its okay however your trying to make people get points by giveing them apps that suck
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Omg this is so fun me my brother and my cousins love this app @_@ u should get this so easy its free and its fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far I like the game but since I don't have a stylus right now its a little difficult but all in all its a good fun game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got it for free and it has definitely given me a lot of entertainment. id even pay a dollar for it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok. some games are better than others. you cant beat the price!  addictive and fun.  enjoy fun fun fun
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is good when you are looking for something to help waste time. some of the games seem pretty stupid though
B005URRCUY|5.0|I remember when I first heard of The Black Keys. I was meeting up for a date, and I told the girl I was meeting to bring a CD with her favorite bands on it, and I'd reciprocate. The date was a disaster all but for the CD. I found some great stuff on that disc, namely The Black Keys and their song \\"Strange Times\\". I hadn't heard of them and when I heard the song, I'd felt ashamed.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years later, and their second release since then is on the shelves. I could go on with the metrics about how Danger Mouse returns and pretty much serves as the third member, or other useless details, but they don't matter. What you need to know is that this album is brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. I try to keep myself free of hyperbole, but I cannot help but gush about this disc. You throw it in, and you're greeted by the lead off single \\"Lonely Boy\\", but wait until you get to wrap your head around \\"Gold On The Ceiling\\". You'll be spinning. And just when you're settling down, you'll be hit by \\"Run RIght Back\\". As in, I'm going to run right back to iTunes and throw the album on repeat. If you don't like it, you hate good music.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is not bad but not good really not that good peoples it is not bad but it is good
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun time-killer. good free ap, for sure. I would recommend it but annoying ads make it somewhat less fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very good fame lots of fun.....graphics are great on my kindle fire... me and my husband can play for hours.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game once you start you can't stop! I recomend this near the top of mahjong games.  My 13 year loves it and has her friends hooked. you WON'T be sorry buying the full game.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I'm glad I didn't have to pay to find out how bad this is.  The mouse is confusing, the keyboard doesn't work at all, it resized my desktop resolution,  there's no apparent way to close the app and fix the desktop res. I'll stick with TeamViewer.
0316098329|5.0|The idea of a book about a woman, held hostage and repeatedly raped, while raising her son in a locked room...it's hard to take, particularly for anyone with children of their own.  This book was recommended to me by others in my book club, but we decided not to read it because it was only available in hard cover at that time (and we have a cost-conscious paperback only policy).  Still, based on what others said about it (even those who hadn't yet read the book, only heard about it), I felt I had to give it a try.  It was simply amazing and completely exceeded my expectations.  I am so impressed with Donaghoe's ability to capture the voice of a child so eloquently, yet so realistically.  Her completely mesmerizing capture of the mother's point of view, after all she's been through, is equally compelling.  I was on the edge of my seat as escapes were plotted, as events unfolded, as the child was forced to change.  I can't even guess how she's capable of thinking this way - from every perspective, in such detail - and then to have the skill to write it all down.  Just...wow.  Amazing book.  Highly recommend it.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|A great improvement over my previous Quad Core from the older Intel generation. System runs fast and rates as a 7.5 out of 7.9 in Windows 7. So far the multi-core setup and Turbo Boost have been working great and I have been able to do a lot of faster tasking on this new processor. The fan attached easily to my Z68 EVGA motherboard and has been sitting around 56-60 degrees C with stock fan most of the time.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I really love this album! She and the band did an amazing job. So many different dynamical levels and styles florence takes us with her talent. Her music is so mysterious, artsy, creative, emotional, dramatic, and fun. Florence is a music wizard, no I take that back she is a music fairy! :P
B004T32SOK|5.0|I like being able to access docs on my Kindle, Android phone and computer. This makes it really easy to access my data from anywhere. No more thumbdrives for me.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I'm a real John Grisham fan, and this book was great. I have read all of his book and this one will be a classic.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|i love this app.  it is easy to send notes to yourself and to post on facebook and twitter.  also very easy to get to different translations and the audio Bible.  frequent updates to software show that the company is always.looking for ways to improve.  i give it 4 out of 5 stars because i find it difficult at times to copy and select (highlight) text.  otherwise, great tool.
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|This is one of those films that should be studied in film class because it speaks to what is so difficult about making quality movies.  If you examine each of the components - the actors, the script, the locations, the cinematography, and the plot....well, not the plot.  And certainly not the direction or editing.  But if you look at each of those first four things I mentioned, they were good enough.<br /><br />But somewhere along the line, probably having to do with weak direction and editing, and perhaps a plot that has already been done several times (boy meets girl now and then over long period of time, and even though they are hot for each other they never get together until the end) \\"One Day\\" ended up completely lacking any real emotion, depth, or integrity.  I'm told its brought in $56 million world wide, which is a credit to the drawing power of the two young leads, I suppose.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: (If my review so far hasn't already spoiled this flick for you.) I realize that part of the plot was the transformation of the male lead from a person that basically has no character or integrity into a person who ...well, we don't really ever find out.  At the end we learn that the feels bad about losing the love of his life.  And he likes to take walks with his daughter.<br /><br />Perhaps its my lack of British sensibility.  The British love \\"cheeky\\" dialogue, fancy cars, angst-ridden, pathetic, wealthy male leads (see most of Hugh Grant's career), and my daughters tell me Jim Sturgess is attractive.  But he lacked all sense of value.  And even this would have been OK if that fact had been developed.  But basically the Sturgess character is unrelatable, goes nowhere, and that's not a good thing for one of the two leads in a movie.<br /><br />God, the worst moment in the movie had to be about 85% of the way through when Anne Hathaway gets on the bike in traffic.  At this point, my family had a pretty good sense of the lack of creativity in the plot/direction, so as the same motor cycle kept racing by her several times, from a variety of camera angles (no, not for effect, I assume just terrible editing), I turn to my wife and say, \\"Oh no.  They are going to kill her off in an accident.\\"  She says, \\"That wouldn't make sense, but I share your concern.\\"<br /><br />Literally 30 seconds, one turn, and one alley later (and the motor cycle is long gone), Anne Hathaway gets flattened by a medium sized, very fast moving truck.  I don't mean she got hit.  She got destroyed!  I haven't seen a collision this brutal (in a non-action flick) since Brad Pitt got nailed after the coffee shop scene in \\"Meet Joe Black.\\"  It was cheap, completely telegraphed, inappropriate, and terribly done.  Whatever shred of cred was left before that scene, was long gone.<br /><br />Hathaway the actress is very good at developing endearing personalities on screen.  She comes off as a young woman any young man would love to date.  But for some reason, she ends up with a guy who \\"...sits around playing games and farting in the apartment...\\"  The scenes in the Mexican restaurant were cute, but right out of \\"Princess Diaries.\\"  So as in real life, Anne Hathaway falls for the wrong man, and we have to watch her suffer for it for well over an hour, until it appears that he may have changed into a great guy. But \\"bloody heck,\\" that lorry takes her out before their new relationship can develop.<br /><br />Wow, this film was terrible!  Even my wife and daughters were heckling the television (about twenty minutes after I started) at the end.<br /><br />Two stars - one for Anne Hathaway's huge eyes, and one for the actress who had a minor role playing Sturgess's mother, dying from cancer, who even in her tiny role, stood out as the best of the cast.by her several times, from a variety of camera angles (no, not for effect, I assume just terrible editing), I turn to my wife and say, \\"Oh no.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have read many diet books,and most dictate what you will have for each meal,,this one is great gives you your options and great choices
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is very easy to use and a nice variety of devotionals. Nice to always have access to God's Word.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|This was a great movie!  There was so much drama and hardship for one movie it's surprising to say that even though I was tearing up at the end, it was a good thing!  Very emotional and touching.  A great underdog sports and family relationships movie.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|It only works when my Kindle Fire is on the same wireless network as the computer I would like to remote onto. Doesn't do me much good considering if I'm on the same wireless network, I probably don't need to remote onto my comp. If they fixed that, it would easily be worth five stars. Glad I got it as the FAOTD and didn't pay for it.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|It was my first app download and it is the coolest so far!  I have a moon phase app on my desktop computer, too.  Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well put together app. I like the options. Never any problems with it force closing or any of that lame stuff.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the product. Had it in my wife's iphone. Much better on the kindle. Use it for school also. Much easier than flipping through a paper Bible.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I jude this app every day. So far it has been pretty in sync with my local news. I like the ability to change  locations very easily, especially when I am going to be traveling. This app works for the unbeatable price....free.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell is challenging yet relaxing. The music isn't loud and obnoxious like so many games. Very fun and easy to find addicting!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This was a pretty interesting book.  It really showed Steve from a point of view that I have never really heard too much of before.  It does not paint an overly nice picture of Steve, but tells the truth based on interviews with the many people he had contact with throughout his life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun, with a few biggie controls but most games work fine, kind of a pain on how u unlock the other games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are alright, not the best, but good enough for wasting some time. Some are a bit difficult to play because of the controls, but most of them are fine.
B005FITIGO|5.0|The acting is superb- and the story-even if you have to watch the director's commentary to entirely \\"get it\\"- a wonderful indictment- to me, a leftist- of capitalism. ..certainly presented from the capitalists' point of view- the speech that the CEO- Jeremy Iron's character gives- on the history of capitalism? how many of you knew about the recurring collapses? The speech given in the car by the ? character-(the thin blond crew cutted trader)  about how the traders differ from normal people and how much of a scam they are running? fabulous- absolutely nailed it.<br /><br />How do I know that it is presented from the capitalists' point of view- one- there is no explanation of the hedge funds and bundlings etc that was the cause; 2, there is no explanation of how people get hurt other than these poor, debauched traders, and 3, there is no direction to how we migh change things-which we (perhaps not easily) could- i e- revolutionary, non-violent change to socialism!<br /><br />Did you know that nothing has changed?- the democratic and republican right in this country (i e- our \\"government\\" \\"for\\" the people?) bailed out their cronies- as they will continue to do- w force is necessary.<br /><br />The pathos of Kevin Spacy burying his dog on the lawn where he USED to, but can no longer, live? Priceless!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Since I got evernote I have been taking my kindle everywhere with me just on case some idea pops into my head that I want to save for later.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I just downloaded this to my kindle fire and it works great. I love that the download is super fast had my videos downloaded in seconds. I recommend it to anyone that uses youtube a lot.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this every day.  Beautiful colors, forecast, and the temperature stays on notification bar.  One of the best apps to have on phone.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I'm thankful for being able to use the Bible app n share with others. The Bible app helps me with my daily readings that I share on facebook.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app! Amazing on my Kindle Fire! Super awesome! I recommend  this to ALL the people. Nineteen. Twenty.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been using logmein for some time and have found it to work satisfactorily. But splashtop is now my choice. It's faster, more reliable, and easier to use. The ability to stream video with sound is a plus which I didn't even know I needed. Very easy to set up and works intuitively. So far, I can't find anything too criticize. 5 stars.
0316056863|4.0|Funny. I enjoyed learning about Tina's life. It was interesting hearing her side of the story, from SNL to 30 Rock to Sarah Palin. As a fan of 30 Rock, I especially liked that section about the writers for the show.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I totally recommend Evernote, in fact I kinda made my wife get it. I like to use it for jotting down notes and also for anything else like a blog. What can I say Evernote is awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this game. I felt beating the levels was really easyy! I really enjoy playing this game. so I say everyone should get it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty entertaining. I loved how it pushed me to my limit to do better. I'll recommend this to anyone, anytime.
B004G600A4|5.0|I got this movie and watched it with my husband and daughter on the 2nd day of Christmas. We, the girls enjoyed it so much. Even my husband styed through the whole story 'till the end. We had a great day together! And Amazon was quick in delivery.
B004132HZS|5.0|There's not much that can be added to the reviews here already, the casting, stories and production are all superb. The really good news is that series 2 has started in the UK, and it's definitely more of the same. The first episode, (A scandal in Belgravia), is excellent, but the second, (The Hounds of Baskerville), is simply stunning! No spoilers here, but suffice to say the reworking of what is probably many people's favourite Holmes story is a piece of genius, and more of a thriller than the original. Now awaiting episode 3.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|this app is sweet. it is a lot of fun no problems with it so far I recommend. to others
B00110K62U|4.0|I loved this dvd.  I owned the vcr cassette of it and wanted to have it again on dvd.  I am enjoying it as much as I did on my vcr.  Wonderful video and fantastic music.
0099413140|5.0|I have long adored this book, it is a delight for children age 3 to 8.  Irreverant without being disrespectful, it is an hilarious introduction to royal culture.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun.... I didn't think that I would play it as much as I do... highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|117 games and its free?! what else could make this any better? fun games and a great way to kill time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing you get a bunch of deiffrent apps in just one app and its free a Bunche apps for free!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works flawlessly.  I use it on my Thrive tablet.  Worth every penny.  Easy to set up and use.  I now do everything from my couch.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Think you liked the opening season; well, the 2nd season is even more fun! Great character development, ever darker comedy. Terrific cast members.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas who is a huge star wars fan. Its nice to have all six episodes in a set and the blu- ray is remarkable. You can't tell a difference between the original episodes and the newer ones. Amazon had this set at the best price around and shipping was free. I received it fast and in plenty of time for Christmas.
1402756399|5.0|Absolutely worth the money.  Very detailed.  Wonderfully illustrated.  Ordered one to read and one as a giftand.  Prompt delivery as promised.  Would recommend to everyone.
B005KJZDXK|4.0|I bought this after reading a review in the newspaper- it's a fun album and I sent copies to my family as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is really fun. You unlock games by completing other games. There are a ton of different types of games and it will always keep you entertained. Although, the ads get somewhat annoying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a working and prodded game that is fun for thee whole family. it is very good for everyone
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Some of the games are fun, but most suffer from sluggish controls or are just boring. The app is mostly fluff. You'll play a game until you finish it and then rejoice that you never have to play it again.
0307165485|5.0|Loved this book 30 years ago when I raised my children, and now am reading with my grandkids. The many stories and pictures in this book are wonderful. Richard Scarry always has many picutures on the pages, and it takes a long time to read a story because we look at so many things!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie, \\"The Straight Story,\\" directed by David Lynch and starring Sissy Spacek and the late Richard Farnsworth is a satisfyingly good story about a trip of several hundred miles that a man from Iowa made on a lawn mower to see his ill brother in an adjoining state.  It chronicles the trials and tribulation that he encountered on that trip as well as the good things that happened to him along the way.  It is an excellent movie that is suitable for the entire family that would appreciate a simple true story about perseverence and love.  I recommend it highly.  The actor Farnsworth, who has acted in many movies, died of cancer shortly after completing this movie.  It is said that he endured considerable pain during the making of the movie but continued on despite his discomfort.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|hours of entertainment! games are just as fun the second time around to gain points, and new games are increasingly challenging.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love love love love love this it is soooo much fun I play it all the time.I think you should get it to it is a great game.
0312641893|5.0|This review is spoiler free!   If after reading that summary you are shaking your head wondering what kind of crazy book this must be, and why would someone want to read something so strange, have no fear: I did the same thing. I got this book in the mail a few weeks ago, and when I read the back cover, I was skeptical that I would ever even read it.   I mean, a Cinderella Cyborg? Ummm...  I read about the first thirty pages and almost gave up. I was having flash backs of when I'd read Bumped earlier last year, and I was hesitant about the futuristic/dystopian/robot world Meyer was trying to create. I didn't want to try and get into a book that was only going to let me down, but I keep going. And guess what?   Marissa Meyer pulled it off.  Not only did she pull of a world with cyborgs and robots, but she added classic Cinderella plot threads to the story and made it into something that wasn't cheesy, buts something that was page turning, I-must-find-out-what-happens-next kind of good.  I can say with confidence that I have never read anything like Cinder. I'm not a huge fan of sci-fi stories, but this book grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. The plot flows so well, and Meyer did a great job of setting up the series. The way this book ends will BLOW YOUR MIND.  Seriously, I dare say that it was one of the best things I read last year.   I think this would be a good audiobook to listen to with all the robot voices and computers. It would be interesting to hear.   Who would have thought that a dystopian/ sci-fi novel with a Cinderella cyborg would have claimed a place among my favorite books?  In a way, I'm sad that I got to read this early because it means I have to wait an extra-long time for the next one...   (This review was orginally posted on my blog thebeeandbumble.com)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is fun you have to pass ten levels to unlock the rest. I reccomend it. the first ten game may be kine of hard though
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It has good games. I dislike the adds after finishing each game that ask you to install or download other apps
B00007GZR5|3.0|This movie is very saccharine. Some of the visuals are nice to look at.  This is a VERY, VERY comforting and totalizing view of life/death/morality.  Robin Williams dramas tend to be...heavy-handed.  But I went to sleep before the film ended the last time I watched it. I was woken up by my wife kissing and hugging me, asking me \\"are you my soul mate?\\"   \\"Yes!\\"  So it made for a nice moment between us. For that, I'll give the film three stars.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Loved the game until the evil movie trailor started showing up every few minutes then kicking me out of the game completely. Need to fix this problem asap! Will change review when fixed.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|because I am not having flashbacks about classic grindhouse movies. I think that I was too young when grindhouse was in its prime, so I don't have that to affect my critique of this movie. Quentin Tarantino makes really solid girl power movies (Jackie Brown), and this is one of them. I like his inconsistency , and I think this is just a tool in his movie-making toolbox. Kurt Russell and the ladies make this an entertaining movie.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I have loved watching this series from the 1st showing.  Now try to catch the old reruns on alternate channels.  I really enjoy being able to see the whole series at any time and immerse myself in the life of the old West.  This is good for any age group and so very entertaining.  Buy it!
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|What a great album! Cyndi sings beautifully, with lots of feeling, and her band is very accomplished. A quality contemporary blues album, well worth the purchase. We loved it!
0345529057|5.0|The books arrived on time, in good condition, and I would buy from them again. I was not left disappointed. I wish everyone was as quick to mail out items
B000007UTN|5.0|Best Radiohead album ever, I listened to it during freshman year of college, and it's still hot. I enjoy it even more now on vinyl. Excellent!
1450595847|1.0|How could they forget to include the famous Darwin's diagram?! Darwin refers to the diagram on many occasions, notably on page 75 of this edition, \\"The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding...,\\" except there is no diagram accompanying this edition, so our understanding of this great book is to remain unaided, against the author's wishes. I checked every single page in the book by hand - the diagram is nowhere to be found. The electronic search under the \\"Look inside!\\" tool also shows that the diagram is not included. This edition is simply a waste of ten bucks.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|I've never been a Foo Fighters fan, but I became one when this album came out. Unfortunately, the record was shipped broken. A small piece of vinyl fell off, hence I am not able to listen to first song on A and B side, so I was forced to return it :(<br />But, it has nothing to do with the quality of the album, I just love the fact that it is recorded on tape in Dave's garage, not using any computers, but only analog equipment. You just gotta love the old school way, just like my band used to record during the 90s.<br />My favorites are: Bridge Burning, Rope, Dear Rosemary, Arlandria, These Days, I Should Have Known... In fact, I just came to realize that the album as a whole is my favorite :)<br />I recommend this album before any Foo Fighters album.
B003E6K1VK|1.0|After charging for 5 hours initially, I plugged this E7 into my laptop via USB (DAC). No sound out of the right channel. Used another laptop, same thing. Another operating system, same thing.  Tried resetting the headphone jack using the pinhole at the top, nothing. Tried changing various settings like USB charging \\"off\\". Still no sound out of the right channel.  Using a LOD adapter to my iPhone did work. So I evaluated it that way. With my Shure inner ear monitors the sound seemed to taper off at setting 30 and not get any louder past that (it goes to 60). Not to mention the sound quality seemed worse than just using my iPhone headphone port. Music sounded cleaner just using the iPhone as well. Don't even think about using the EQ settings on the E7. It's garbage.  This item left me feeling like it is VERY flawed. I bought a FiiO E11 in place of it and I highly recommend that. The E11 is a quality product, the E7 has issues. I searched the Internet and the problems I faced with the E7 are prevalent. Stay away. Wait until there is a successor.  If FiiO released a successor to the E7 then I will likely buy that because I want a value USB DAC/Amp.
1419702238|4.0|Interesting book because it was hard to tell what what was was going to happen next like during the scene of the Green blotches of spray paint and the lie detector. Book number 5: The Ugly Truth is still my all time favorite. Hopefully there will be a book number 7 that can beat number 5 which to me is pretty hard.
B005PW3OS8|1.0|Whole film was dark, CGI wasn't believable, was a completely unbelievable rendition of what WWII was like with a whole lot of stupid.  Yeah, I get the whole 'the bad guys have super technology' crap, but reel it in a little, and I know it is a comic book character, but make it remotely believable or make me care the tiniest bit.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|First, for those who are braced to say that an entire second season cannot be judged by one episode, that is absolutely true.  But as of January 8, 2012 Downton Abbey Season 2 began with two episodes back to back lasting two hours.  If you're wondering if Season 2 is up to the high standards of Season 1, then rest assured the cast remains the same, the gorgeous photography remains the same, the writing is still Julian Fellowes, and the extraordinary study of the class system in England at the beginning of the last century is intact.<br /><br />As we were informed in the last episode of Season 1, World War I has begun and this adds a new set of circumstances to the Abbey upstairs and downstairs.  There is considerable dialogue about the desire vs. the fear of going to war, and the British military strips many of the Abbey's dwellers for the greed of the war.  Footman Thomas goes off as a medic, is unable to endure the stress, gets himself shot by the enemy, and moves back to the neighboring hospital to Downton Abbey as a nurse.  There he cares for a blinded victim - and the results of that situation will likely surface later.  Lady Sybil continues her feminist beliefs and trains to be a nurse, Lady Edith has all but given up on finding a husband and so learns to drive  a tractor for the farmer whose life was saved in the last season, Lady Mary still struggles with her on again/off again desire for solicitor Matthew, Carson still rules the roost, Bates' distant wife appears and causes Bates to leave Downton much to Anna's displeasure and the disappointment of the entire staff and owners, and the entire first episode continues to be influenced by the steady performance of Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess!<br /><br />There are new people to add to the Abbey and the openings for interesting new plots are tweaked.  It promises to be another very good year.  Grady Harp, January 12
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This \\"Moon Phase\\" app has a lot of nice features, showing the current phase of the moon in your location and has a calendar function to show the phase on any given day, forward or back in time. Besides making good \\"Wallpaper\\", this is great for planning star gazing nights since you can see if the moon is going to be bright. The \\"Cheese Mode\\" is fun, but I will not be using it regularly.<br /><br />The app installs and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO and Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0062082353|1.0|This author, to get free airtime to promote his book no doubt, has made a very dubious claim that he punched out Jesse Ventura.  Ventura is on Alex Jones saying the event never happened.  Ventura knows the bar owner.  Further, this would have been known a LONG time before if it had happened. I suggest people who got suckered in to buying this book to return it immediately.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|Just got Sector 2 which comprises my favorite Rush era.  The sound is a huge improvement from the old CD's - awesome!  Though it's  kind of baffling why only A Farewell to Kings is the only album that comes in surround (DVD-A).  I know Moving Pictures is available in surround but oddly not included here so you have to buy it separately...

B005IKZSYA|4.0|When I was watching this, I thought it was a true story, so I was confused who it was. It is a fiction, but it is not an impossible fiction.  *** Spoilers alert,  this review does contain spoilers.   The Cardinals come together to elect a new pope. I liked very much the scene where they came together to decide. It was clear that several did not want the job and as it happened the person they pick does not want to be pope. He goes through many emotional traumas, so they get a psychiatrist to help him, but their pope run away. The pope goes through some escapades, until the pope finally decides to refuse the job which he does publicly.  The story was good, but I think it could have been better. The psychiatrist interaction with the pope could have been much longer and more interesting. More could have been done with the Cardinals. As it was when the pope ran away much of it was a let down.   Still, the story was original with some good twists. I thought some of the characters were interesting but much more could have been done here.  Would I see it again, probably not as I know the story, but I would recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. It is a true family game. enjoyable of many ages. but it can get a little difficult to play at times
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I can't get enough of the fever series!  I just LOVE, LOVE , LOVE all the characters in the book.  This book open doors to a lot of the characters so the author could write spin off on each one of them.  I especially want to read more on Barrons' past with his group of friends.  How they survived and how each one cope with killing off each other's girl friend just to keep their secret. I still want to know what is Mac?  I'm also interested in reading more about the great ancient K'Vork too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a pretty good game! Although not ideal to spend a long period of time on it, any spare time or whatever is ok.

0307719774|1.0|I did read the previous reviews and knew that the book that I ordered would be small. It is about the size of my hand as seen in a previous person's review/picture.   However, I was very surprised to find that the book was printed upside down. Or bound upside down. If you hold the book up so the cover is facing you like a normal book, it's fine. You open it up, December 31st stares right at you upside down.  I love the concept of the book. I am very disappointed something like this wasn't caught in production. I haven't decided if it's worth is to send it back or not.

B006SV2LWA|1.0|Contagion is boring at best, and confusing if you can keep your eyes open long enough to search for the storyline.  My guess is that Soderbergh, Damon and Paltrow where betting on a really nasty flu season and planned to ride the wave of people's anxiety and discomfort to sell tickets.  With millions of good stories available, the only reason (aside from money) the Hollywood-Left makes a movie like this is to advance their fantasy that mere humans cannot exist without governments.  And, if you are a real far-Left One-World zealot, a single global government; NGOs as heroes is the top of their hot list.<br /><br />The United States has some wonderful people fighting and living heroic lives in Afghanistan, at the border with Mexico, and even inside America cities saving lives and property.  Is Soderbergh interested it their story -- nooooo.  Why?  Because people like Soderbergh hate real heroes, both past and present; and, they will be damned if there are any more American heroes in the future.<br /><br />In any case, Contagion stinks.  It is not interesting or entertainment and as a result the real nightmare scenario of viral epidemics will go without discussion.  I suggest Michael Crichton's \\"Andromeda Strain\\" (the movie is good, the book is excellent) or if you are into film noir, the 1950 film \\"Panic in the Streets\\" (and if you think I simply dislike left-leaning people, note that the director is Elia Kazan).
0385534639|5.0|I had wanted to read this book every since it came out but at my local library it was on hold for 20 people before me. I finally got it for a christmas present and was able to read it over the holidays. I'm not very picky about books, I'll read anything any suggests or puts in front of me. But it takes a lot for me to say a book is perfect and I haven't been able to stop dreaming about this book every since I read it.   I read this book slowly so I wouldn't miss a word or a phrase although I definitely couldn't put it down. The world in the pages of this book is described excellently. The author plays upon your senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, noise. This book is written to tell you a incredible story but it also written to give you an experience. You cannot help but imagine this book with the entirety of yourself and your imagination. I fell in love with this book because while you are reading about magic, illusion, and mystery, the words follow and express the themes with elegance and beauty.  This book is magical and it is beautiful. It is a dream written in ink you can explore and return back to. It may be cliche to say but it's a asset to it's art form, reminding me why it is that the written word exists - to write books such as this. There is nothing simple or plain or already written about this book. It is charmingly unique: the story and the writing. I have heard it compared to a lot of other things, but this book truly stands on it's own. Do not read it because you are hoping it is like something you once read, although it might be, read it because you want to visit and experience the Night Circus.   I'll leave you with two of my favorite quotes from the book...  \\"Someone needs to tell those tales. When the battles are fought and won and lost, when the pirates find their treasures and the dragons eat their foes for breakfast with a nice cup of Lapsang souchong, someone needs to tell their bits of overlapping narrative. There's magic in that. It's in thelistener, and for each and every ear it will be different, and it will affect them in ways they can never predict. From the mundane to the profound. You may tell a tale that takes up residence in someone's soul, becomes their blood and self and purpose. That tale will move them and drive them and who knows what they might do because of it, because of your words. That is your role, your gift. Your sister may be able to see the future, but you yourself can shape it, boy. Do not forget that...there are many kinds of magic, after all.\\"   \\"You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Reves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus. You are no longer quite certain which side of the fence is the dream.\\"
B00664AM5C|4.0|Even though the plot was choppy with the ensemble cast, the likihood of a unknown virus spreading the way it did with no vaccine is so real to me, I have no idea of what I'd do. I do not have a plan in place if something like this was to happen.  The movie was realistic and frightening. Character development was low, the important piece was to understand how a unknown virus could form and spread - how helpless people would feel if placed in this situation.  I did think towards the end the characters paths would collide.  Especially, Matt Damon's character since he was somehow immune to it.<br /><br />It only gave it 4 stars because I was not emotionally invested in what happened to the characters.<br /><br />I would recommend seeing it...but also wash your hands and don't touch anything in public!
0062073486|4.0|Mystery novels are one of the most popular types of fiction. Anyone who loves the genre is, at some point, going to run up to Agatha Christie and her most famous mystery, \\"And Then There Were None\\". Of the eighty books she wrote, this one is the most popular for a reason: it's unlike anything else you'll read.<br /><br />On a sunny August day, ten strangers are summoned to Indian Island. What begins as a holiday in an exciting locale turns deadly when, after dinner, a record is played that incriminates each of the eight guests, along with the butler and his wife, of murder. Each of them has killed another person (or people) in a way that makes them untouchable by the law - a drowning that seems \\"accidental\\", a car accident, a death on the operating table, etc. Shortly after the record is played, one of the guests is found dead. Initially, the others think that is must be suicide, but when the bodies start piling up, they realize that there is a killer in thier midst. And the murderer is using the verses of a nursery rhyme, Ten Little Indians, to determine how each victim dies.<br /><br />As the number of people on the island begins to dwindle, the tension increases. The strangers, who initially cling to each other, begin to turn against one another as they realize the killer is still hunting. But what will happen when there is no one left?<br /><br />This novel is quite different from most of Agatha Christie's work because it does not feature either one of her two most famous characters, Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple. It also has an ingenious way of dealing with the murders - and the murderer. My only beef with the book is that the killer's name is printed in large font on the final page. If you're like me, and you like to see exactly how many pages are in the book you're reading, try to skip it on this one. You don't want to be spoiled for the ending like I was.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|This show and its cast, writers, and crew deserve far more credit for this series and the film that came after it than was given them. The show was fresh and innovative, and yet bore a humble and lasting character reminiscent of old world values devoid in many of today's shows.<br /><br />These were characters refusing to live within the reign of a brilliant, yet repressive technocracy. They did all the things you might expect such outlaws to do, but with an underlying moral code that stood them out as unsung heroes rather than rag-tag hustlers.<br /><br />I am disappointed that no sequel appears to be in the works, but I for one applaud Nathan Fillion (Mal),Gina Torres (Zoë), Alan Tudyk (Wash), Morena Baccarin (Inara), Adam Baldwin (Jayne), Jewel Staite (Kaylee), Sean Maher (Simon), Summer Glau (River), Ron Glass (Shephard Book), and Joss Whedon (Writer & Director) for making a wonderful show that our entire family still watches. We have bought the movie and the series, and they hold a special place in our collection.<br /><br />While we are on the subject, allow me to offer a bit of viewer praise for several aspects that I thought stood out in both the series and the film.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion's performance as Mal served as an enigma to me from the beginning. He was capable of making the hard choices to keep the ship and its primary crew safe even when the options were all unsavory. That quick and brutal hatchet of leadership made me wonder at first why anyone would serve with such a man. That was because I did not trust him, but as the series moved further along we viewers began to see the world through his eyes. We sampled in small doses the poison of this vile space empire and started to ask ourselves how anyone could NOT see the galaxy through Mal's perspective. Mal was such a strong character because his human frailty threatened to overwhelm him at any moment. He forced down that weakness and demanded better of himself, all the while with a wry humor that made him truly endearing.<br /><br />And Nathan Fillion played him. I'm not sure there's a better compliment for an actor out there.<br /><br />Adam Baldwin's \\"Jayne\\" is a refreshing distance from his usual upstanding, hard-nosed, straight-laced military officer type roles. Even his portrayal of Commander Casey on NBC's \\"Chuck\\" is no where near as lively and heart-felt as the rude, untrustworthy, and conniving Jayne. He is the living personification of the term \\"mercenary\\" and yet Adam never lets any of his former roles slip in. Jayne is always just one step away from total corruption. Jayne would have made the perfect nemesis for Mal except for two things; opportunity and wit.<br /><br />Joss Whedon, sir, this was a thoughtful hybrid genre that I never found overpowering. There was enough tech to keep one's feet firmly planted on the deck of the Serenity, and enough gun-slinging and damsel rescuing to keep its spirit of adventure alive. There was so much more to do with this show, so many avenues to explore, that this show could have gone almost ANYWHERE and been great. The writing was thoughtful, the dialogue well chosen and yet entirely believable. This cast was endearing and their work inspiring. You could feel that they loved working together, and that translated into a great show.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the show. If I had a billion dollars, I would not only invest in Serenity 2, but I would back it 100%. Once again, excellent show.Fillion played him.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is truly a disturbing book.  However, war is supposed to be disturbing.  The life of any individual is tremendously precious.  Therefore to hear of someone who has killed, by official count, over 160 people should be disturbing.  In the light of our everyday life it is incomprehensible.  However, war is not our everyday life and is in itself incomprehensible. Chief Kyle did what he was trained to do: enter into a realm that is foreign from our lives and do the incomprehensible.  I do not want my warriors, the men and women who protect me and my children, to face down the enemy and give them a real severe tongue-lashing.  I want them to stop them, neutralize them, kill them.  I want the threat removed and prevented from ever surfacing again.  Chief Kyle did what he was supposed to do.  To study and make judgements on his method from our sanitized position is illogical and insane. It is inconsistent with reality, just as our Rules of Engagement have proved to be.  There are some areas in which some people will never agree with me.  First and foremost, I believe Chris Kyle is a patriot.  He is an American hero.  Call me what names you wish, judge me as being conservative, disillusioned, ignorant, short-sighted, immoral, unfeeling...whatever.  It does not change the fact that Chief Kyle saved lives.  If I were in danger and needed protection, I would only hope that it could be a Navy SEAL, preferably Chief Kyle, watching over me.  Now, that would make me feel safe.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|First off - Yes, the original music has been removed and replaced by standard generic themes.  No, it doesn't make the series worse in any appreciable way.  I watched it several times with the original music and once now with the new music and I barely noticed the difference.  It's just SUCH a minor thing that isn't worth complaining about at all.  Now, as for the series itself, well, it's brilliant.  If you're even looking at this page, you probably already know that.  I won't go into excessive detail about the characters and the settings and the dark humor and the real issues explored.  It's all there.  It's all amazing.  The DVD set is very simple, there are no extras really, except for the two movies Is It Fall Yet and Is It College Yet, which should really be considered part of the series proper rather than \\"extras.\\"  But well, what extras did you need anyway?  This set is simply packaged, just a bunch of DVDs with a bunch of episodes of Daria on them.  That's all you need for five stars in my book.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|\\"Contagion\\" focuses on what could happen in the event of an outbreak of a highly infectious and lethal disease.  It's not action and explosion driven.  It uses realistic situations (workers strikes, union strikes, lack of communication in and between governments and organizations), tension, and drama to progress the story-line to a believable, open-ended conclusion.  I wasn't wowed by any particular scene in the movie, but the overall experience was gripping and thought provoking.  What would I do in that situation?  How would our government actually react?  How many people on the Internet blow smoke to make cash, and how many would take advantage of that sort of situation to make money?  Once people started dying and public services started failing, would society collapse?  Or would some semblance of order remain?<br /><br />Overall, it was definitely worth the rental fee.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|More of the same.<br /><br />Immediately, die-hards will stop reading. But if you want an honest opinion from an Evanescence fan, or, more importantly, a music fan, that's what this self-titled CD is. It pains me to say that because I really do like them, and I really want to expect more from them, but I find it hard to do that.<br /><br />If you look back in my reviews you'll come across a review I wrote for Breaking Benjamin's Dear Agony in which I stated something along the lines of \\"they stick to what they know, but it works for them.\\" That's how I feel about Evanescence, yet, at the same time I think Amy Lee is talented enough to push herself further musically than what she has...therein lies my problem with this band as a whole.<br /><br />By itself, this CD is really good. Compared to their other two major releases, however, it's more or less a continuation of a sound they've had since their big break. Amy Lee has the lyrical ability and vocal talent to do so much more impressive things.<br /><br />Looking at just this CD though, there are some great tracks scattered throughout. Made Of Stone is probably my favorite of the bunch because of the powerful chorus (one that's become trademark Evanescence at this point). Other standouts include Lost In Paradise thanks to it's beautiful climax, the sing along worthiness of Sick, the great Oceans, and then Never Go Back. The rest just seem to fill space. That's not saying they're bad by any means, they just don't offer up anything noteable.<br /><br />I hope I'm not pegged as a hater now because I'm really not, I just wish Evanescence would do something more experimental...push themselves to do something new, something unexpected. There are bands that you expect to get the same music from CD after CD, I'm just not ready to lump Evanescence in that group yet. For everything their self-titled is though, it's not bad and easily lestenable.

B00466HN86|5.0|This movie, like the previous 3 from Sherwood, is real & absolutely life-changing.  We have watched tons of \\"Christian\\" movies from a Christian rental site.  Found the majority (99%)  of those movies to be very shallow, cheesy, slow to progress, and often choppy.  Some even had so many worldly attributes to them which, in our opinion, made them ineligible to be on a Christian rental site.  Nobody can watch this movie with an open heart & not be changed/effected.  Lives will be changed & have been changed already.  Sherwood does a wonderful job with balancing laughter & tears in their movies.  You will laugh & you will cry in these films.  They do an excellent job showing real-life, day-to-day Christianity...by presenting trials/challenges that most of us have or will face in our lives.  HIGHLY recommend adding this to your film library and sharing it with as many people as possible.  This is quite possibly the best movie EVER (followed by Fireproof & Facing the Giants!)  Please watch, you will not be sorry.  The only thing you will be sorry about is when you add up how many hours you've wasted watching other films (worldly or not) when each second of everyday is a gift, we need to steward it well.

B001HN6918|4.0|This review of the film, Kung Fu Panda 2, has a slight twist as it is a review from a self development point of view. In essence, Kung Fu Panda 2 has two main stories. The first is the fight against an evil peacock who wants to destroy Kung Fu. The second is about the Panda's roots, i.e., who he is, where he is from, his search for inner peace, his journey of self discovery, etc. The film has many messages at this deeper level and its self development lessons are very applicable to the human world.<br /><br />KUNG FU PANDA 2 - BACKGROUND<br /><br />Po (the Kung Fu Panda) and the Furious Five (Crane, Mantis, Monkey, Tigress and Viper) from the first Kung Fu Panda film now have to deal with a new villain (Lord Shen) who has turned up with a new weapon to take over the kingdom. In addition, Po now wants to find out the truth about his roots and embarks on a hunt for 'inner peace'. In the end, it is this that helps him to defeat Shen.<br /><br />There are many reviews on Kung Fu Panda 2 that cover the exciting action scenes, 3D animation, cinematography, lighting, art direction, writing, spectacular choreography, great sound track (Hans Zimmer), stunning visuals, beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, interesting characters, brilliant colours, etc. Then there is the first class casting of the A-list voices of Angelina Jolie, David Cross, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Oldman, Jack Black, Jackie Chan, James Hong, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Lucy Liu, Michelle Yeoh, Seth Rogen and others.<br /><br />In addition to all that, throughout the film are little gems of wisdom with some poignant messages covering ambition, family bonds, loyalty, friendship, moral values, etc. This particular review concentrates on the self development lessons that the film offers.<br /><br />KUNG FU PANDA 2 - SELF DEVELOPMENT LESSONS<br /><br />* What you search for may be closer than you think<br /><br />In Po's hunt for 'inner peace' he searches far and wide for it. In the end he finds that this is, and has always been, within himself.<br /><br />* Your past is not your present<br /><br />Po discovers the truth about his background which makes him question who he really is and what pathways his life is now going to take. He eventually realises that you simply become who you choose to be.<br /><br />* Confront fear to destroy it<br /><br />Po has several fears which he pushes aside.

B004A8ZX28|3.0|Why do directors feel they need to include chase scenes that are so rdiculous? EVEN THE LONGEST \\"PURSUITS\\" LIVE ON TV DON\\"T COME CLOSE.  i suppose it's the moviegoers who directors think want them? In real life 2 blocks plus maybe a longer freeway chase is plausible   -but block after block and they walk away? Please.  BTW January Jones part was was well done: underplayed and believable.   Ganz and Langella excellent though I don't understand why Ganz had to take cyanide. Anyone?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Game is what it is. Not a high end game,  but is fun and great for kids and adults. Great buy for the price.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game is among the best apps ever. No wonder it's the best-selling video game ever. Even though I've beaten all the levels, I still love Angry Birds, and all the other versions. Yes, this game has adds, but not like the free version. The free one constantly has a noticeable and somewhat distracting add in the corner, while this kind is has adds for the Angry Birds merchandise in the back of the game where there is no levels. This on is much less annoying than the free one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good.the only problem is that its kind of a scam to get u to fill out serveys
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I got my case several days ago, and I love it. The material is incredibly tough, and my Kindle Fire fits in there perfectly. It's real easy to remove it, and the case adds hardly any weight. I barely notice it on my Kindle. This case is great.  But the main reason I bought this case was because I wanted a stand for gaming, movies, and reading without having to hold my Kindle for so long. The cover flips around and can turn into a perfect stand for my Kindle to rest on. I couldn't looking at people with iPads and see the cover that turns into a stand without wanting to get one for my Kindle. But of course, that wouldn't work. So when I saw this case, and that it was $10 off, I just had to get it. It has worked out really well for my Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very fun. I enjoy beating games to earn new ones. Great long term time waster. Would recommend. for adults and kids.
0316056863|5.0|I am a long-time fan of Tina Fey's work - SNL, movies, 30 Rock, etc., and she does not disappoint with this book.  As always, her humor and wit make for some great entertainment.  This is a quick, fun read, and I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions throughout the entire book.
0316743003|4.0|This book is very, very interesting. It may be a biased opinion given that i fly, and i have a engineering background, but if you are on the fence about buying this, you should definitely get it. A great gift for someone even if they aren't a technical person, simple to read and a great story from start to finish
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This is a fun app but I wouldn't pay for it because I'm not that into the moon. I really like cheese mode though.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a usefully app for those who do their reading from bed and don't want to getup when they want to change something on the computer.  But in all seriousness, it's an easy to use app that turns your tablet or smart phone into a mobile touch monitor. It works great on my Kindle Fire, and while it is true that I've only used it with my local wireless network, I haven't noticed any lagging in responsiveness.  I'm very excited to now have a drawing tablet where I can see what I'm drawing without shelling out for an expensive drawing tablet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome app cool beast amazing addiciting fun hard narley beast I love this app its 117 games in one app that's pretty col
B0055V0HXO|4.0|Karmakanic continues to impress me.  This album has a slightly different feel than \\"Who's the Boss in the Factory\\"; it's a little catchier, and a little happier sounding in general.  It's a sound that works well, and the album was a bit more approachable than \\"Who's the Boss..\\".  This is taken a bit too far, however, with \\"Turn it Up\\", which just gets a little too overtly poppy for my ears.  Otherwise though, it's a very well-written and well-executed effort.    Recommended for all fans of the retro prog rock sound.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Spider Solitaire has long been a game I enjoy playing.  Having it available for Kindle makes it even better   Thanks, Amazon!  SMD
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I've owned a smile bootleg for almost 20 years.  Back in '67 I bought \\"Smiley Smile\\" thinking it would have been the much anticipated \\"Smile\\" album.  A diisappointment indeed.  I bought Brian Wilson Presents Smile the day it came out in 2004, followed by the DVD.   So, I gritted my teeth and bought the big box set.  So far I haven't had any buyer's remorse.  My wife hates it.  I think the sessions are quite interesting, eavesdropping in rehearsals.  This is not for the casual listener however.  All others (you know who you are), this is for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|perfect app for doctor waiting rooms or any other waiting situations. I like the selection of games and the ease of the games.
0446556750|2.0|I had a hard time deciding between one or two stars.  And this was primarily because I was so disappointed in the writing.  I have LOVED all the Harry Bosch books and enjoyed the Mickey Haller books, but The Reversal was a reversal for me as well.  What happened Michael???  I finally figured it out.....you decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and wrote the screenplay for the next Haller movie.  Too wordy, too shallow, too bad.
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|The app itself is well-rendered (pretty), quirky (cheese mode), and informative.<br /><br />The added bonus of a live wallpaper is awesome, except mine keeps disappearing - it  changes to a wallpaper that's not even in my phone (I can't find it anywhere).<br /><br />I have found it's one of the only moon wallpapers with a nice black background that's not bland.  It would be cool if the stars twinkled.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the description explains that you have to unlock the majority of the games. there is no reason for bad reviews based solely on that. games have instructions available, which helps quite a bit as they aren't all self explanatory. overall its a nice app. I certainly enjoy it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|At last Metallica delivers.This is the band I grew up with.  It has long ,brutal songs like in the old days.I like albums like Load and Reload but those albums I expected from other bands not from the kings of metal.  Money well spent.  4 stars out of 5 because they have better albums than this in the 80's.
1612130283|5.0|I have never enjoyed reading a book as much as I enjoyed this book. I loved everything about the book. The characters are fascinating and the story hooks you immiediately.  My favorite part of the book was the sexy banter between Christian and Ana. I stayed up until 3 in the morning 3 nights in a row because I couldnt put it down. I loved the second book equally as much. Cant wait for the 3rd book to come out!!!!!!! This is the best guilty pleasure!!!!!!! Thank You sooooo much E.L.James.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i love all the features and use this daily. the captcha addition as a dismiss method is awesome. couldnt ask for more.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this app for my kindle fire and I found out that you get more blades than the paid version! so get this one instead of the paid one.
B000003FIQ|5.0|How does one review perfection? Many protested that Heifetz played too perfectly! It was said one conductor told him to play some wrong notes to show he was human. Well, since no one has ever played as well before or after (yes, more emotionally perhaps) I would ask you to listen for yourself and see what perfect technique on an instrument sounds like!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good for keeping you busy, fun to play on long trips in your car. Glad I got the game, very pleased
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good overall games to kill time. Difficulty is different with each game. Fun my kids to play with. Really good for a free app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there's a lot to do. I enjoy the games. they're pretty easy to beat and gain the points. lots of fun.
B006J8990Y|1.0|I watch about 30 videos a week, that's a lot however being wheel chair bound, what else is there to do? This movie was with out a doubt the worst I have ever seen. Just when you think they isolated an actor, they switch to a different actor. Too much replay, example when you first see a chapter or two, some one thinks that you must see parts of what you just watched. No way to develop any kind of relationship to an actor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good and fun app. Definately a recommended app. only con is you have to buy the games with money that you earn by doing other games and you don't get to preveiw them.
B004FOA84A|2.0|really glad I got this as a free app...  I would be upset if I had paid ANYTHING for it.  Needs to have more to it..  take a lesson from angry birds
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has a good variety of mini games, they're very challenging and fun to play again and again. Good game for.sharing with family and friends.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|one of the best devotion/Bible apps out there &amp; free too! definitely recommend this one for daily reading and notes/highlights
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|This CD is excellent in every way.  I only recently discovered Jonas Kaufmann since seeing him in the Met Live in HD performance of Die Walkure. Now i listen and see all I can of his work - I own various Cds and DVDs and can't get enough of him.  What a spectacular voice and what sensitive, emotional interpretations of every role he sings.  He is the REAL DEAL!!!  At long last we have a deserving successor to Placido Domingo!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is kinda cool. Each game is fun in its own way and I cant wait to unlock more games.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|DVD and Blu-Ray are as we expect at this point in time. However, I was disappointed in the way I had to get my digital download. I was required to install Flixster Collections and download it from there. In the past I could get it for iTunes, which is where I keep everything, but now I can't and I confess myself disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because it has a lot of fun minigames. you can earn points by completing the mini. games. if you like.to play gamesthis is the best game
0525422943|4.0|This was a great follow up book and I know many have watied such as I.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading Adam's story. That interested me because normally the second book is just that, nothing serious changes.<br /><br />The only thing about this book was Adam's depression and anger he held onto from Mia leaving him. I was happy for the middle of the book. That relieved me and scarred me. Because he learned how it felt to finally have closure, so does that mean he can really live without Mia?<br /><br />I'm not spoiling ANYTHING, you just have to read for yourself. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My kids begged for this toy for Christmas.  I can't figure it out at all, but they sure can, and they love it!  It's so nice to see them playing with something that is good for their brain and not electronic.  It's a little big to carry around, and also kind of noisy, but that's ok.  The benefits far outweigh any inconvenience.  They are very happy with it.
0307593312|2.0|I hesitate to use big words like \\"colossal failure\\" or \\"the apex of mediocrity\\" when describing Murakami's self-proclaimed \\"magnum opus,\\" but this novel is, in every sense of the word, a failure. It fails to engage. It fails to delight. It fails to mystify. Murakami paints a picture of a great lake, as deep as it is blue and invites you to jump in, only, when you do actually make that plunge, you realize that the lake is frozen solid and it's depths non-existent.  Without spoiling anything concrete, the story primarily consists of chapters alternating between the point of view of the two main characters, Tengo and Aomame. Aomame is a flat, utterly one-dimensional heroine working for a mysterious dowager; their shared purpose is disposing of violent men who abuse women and children, a theme that Murakami expounds on in the first volume and then mostly kicks to the curb as the story progresses. Tengo, on the other hand, is a directionless superhuman content to languish in mediocrity. He's a math prodigy and a master of jiu jitsu whose talents have taken a back seat to his empty existence. Afraid to take chances, he questions himself at every turn despite the fact that every single person he runs into envies his latent genius and rock hard abs. He's convinced by another character (that Murakami abandons for a wide swath of the book) to rewrite Fuka-Eri's possibly auto-biographical account of her experiences in Sakigake's cult stronghold which in turn serves as the catalyst for a number of events that draw Tengo and Aomame towards the center of a slow-moving conspiracy that threatens to sever their extremely tenuous and ultimately unbelievable connection forever.  In the second volume, Murakami abruptly reveals that all that violence and abuse stuff isn't really all that important anymore, and in fact even retcons facts related to that violence through an arbiter that guest stars for perhaps two chapters and then abruptly exits stage left. This arbiter is the only character in the book whose wisdom extends past his pinky-toe, however Murakami fails to really seize the moment and instead this character rehashes events that have already transpired and then offers a few cryptic clues about the future that ultimately don't influence much of anything. The latter half of 1Q84 is dedicated to mundane descriptions of characters boiling water and making coffee while they wander around a small section of Tokyo and fail to run into each other time and time again. Eventually he adds a new character to the mix whose primary role is (I assume) to add tension to what is effectively a plot with the depth and breadth of a puddle of water, but ultimately this character serves only as a scapegoat to deus ex machina that paves the way towards the one and only possible conclusion.  Murakami contrasts the subtle surreality in the book with vivid descriptions of mundane repetition. As I mentioned before, characters repeatedly boil water, drink coffee, question their reality and experiences and compare themselves to characters in fiction novels, stare at the moon(s), and wander aimlessly through their respective neighborhoods while the sinister Sakigake cult twiddles its thumbs and claims time and again that \\"bad things\\" could happen if they could just decide to get it together. Long descriptions and analysis of extremely underwhelming events are presented from multiple reoccurring viewpoints in what at first appears to be chronological order, however one eventually realizes that a number of next chapters are essentially rehashes of unimportant events that occurred previously from alternate points of view that ultimately offer no new information or analysis. This soul-crushing mediocrity gets so repetitive and uninteresting that at one point towards the end of the book Murakami breaks out of the narrative, tears down the third wall, and speaks directly to the reader, idly wondering how events would have transpired if he had maintained any narrative momentum or injected even the slightest bit of hardship into the characters' idle existences.  The plot isn't the only thing that feels mechanical, however. Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel team up to translate this behemoth of a novel and I think, achieve what is perhaps the densest, most mechanical translation I've ever had the displeasure of slogging through. I know that I can't entirely blame them (Gabriel did an amazing job on Kafka on the shore, for instance) for what is essentially the most direct of translations and probably a joy for purists who want English that most closely matches Murakami's very \\"strange\\" Japanese, but having read the first third or so of the book in Japanese when it was released in Japan, I think that they should have perhaps hired their own Tengo Kawana to rework the translation into something more closely resembling natural English.  This novel is not without it's merit(s), however. The ending is effective and satisfying, perhaps because the journey there is so boring and convoluted. I can safely say that Murakami nailed it-- quite a surprise considering that he usually has trouble concluding his work effectively in his long-form writing. Additionally, this book shares a number of themes Murakami has explored throughout his career, namely the concept of parallel worlds, the idea that reality is relative, and the appearance of \\"little people\\" in some form or another so literature buffs will have something to discuss over tea at the next book club meeting. Murakami himself handily supplies a helpful study guide at the end of the book just in case you couldn't tell that he was trying to ride the coattails of far more successful works like 1984 and Infinite Jest. (Yes, he actually mentions Infinite Jest. Hah!)  If you've already exhausted Murakami's back catalog, rummaged through his short stories and autobiographical flings, and read Kafka on the Shore (by far his best work, in my humble opinion), then I suppose that 1Q84 is probably your next destination despite the fact that I'm going to tell you straight: it's not really worth your time. Boil some water, make some drip coffee, and let your eyes glaze over folks, it's \\"picaresque\\" and unfathomable, says Murakami. But really, it's just vanity.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The movie arrived in a timely manner and was as described, brand new in the package. It played just fine and is exactly the same as you would purchase in a retail store. Two thumbs up!
0439023521|5.0|I placed a multi book order with this company.  All three books arrived before the expected due date and in perfect order. I even wrote a package review that was also done well.    Thank you very much,  Laura
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has been a lot of fun for the whole family.  it is challenging but not to hard that u don't want to play it.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Please fix this otherwise it would be great! It's a fun game but definately needs an update. I love that there's lots of levels.
B003U4UNUU|5.0|Possibly THE best show EVER in television history and I am so glad that I was able to watch it and enjoy the ride. It made you really think as to what was really happening to these characters as they struggled with many unknown and unseen forces on the island. It was so much more than 'just' a weekly TV drama that starts, ends, and is neatly wrapped up in an hour. It made the viewer really think about all the different aspects of the show long after the hour was over and for months (okay 6 years!) and even resulted in many forums, websites & blogs dedicated to discussion of what everything meant or could mean.  It was not so much about 'the ending' (which I totally loved!), but more about the journey with this group of people, who like most, are naturally flawed and have made choices and mistakes in life.  I recently re-watched some episodes on my new Kindle Fire and it played beautifully with great sound, vibrant color and no streaming issues what so ever! Will most likely re-watch many more on it!!
1451627289|5.0|I've been a S.K fan for a while.  I will say if you are familiar with his work (especially if you enjoy the Dark Tower series) you will probably enjoy this one.  I read all 850 pages in three days.  It deals with time travel in a unique way and it is a fascinating and somewhat educational concept.  Like all of King's novels, he takes his time to get to the meat of things.  But every chapter had me on the edge of my seat.  I highly recommend this to SK fans.  For those of you who are not that familiar with King's writing be aware that he likes to bend reality.  Usually he is the \\"master of horror.\\" This book, though there are elements of horror, is more of a thriller/mystery.  It's written very well and though it's quite a hefty book, the read is easy (the cliff-hanger chapters are short).  I hope you enjoy the book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is great. I knew someone who had a similar app and I was blown away. Got this from FAOTD. Easy to use with little hassle. Just need to create a security code and that's it.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I used this app for a little on my Android Samsung Captivate before uninstalling.  While it was pretty cool, it was not that big of an upgrade from the mobile web interface.  So, I'll just continue using my mobile browser to buy Amazon products, and save that precious mb space for another app.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|works seamlessly with my kindle fire, laptop and desktop! great app for professionals using their Kindle fire in meetings. I recommend it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very fun, highly addictive puzzle game. The game is deceptively simple, and solving the puzzles is almost relaxing. I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a large variety of fun games so the app never gets old. there is also incentive to keep playing and earn points.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've read all of Stephen King's novels, and this is one of my favorites. It starts with an interesting concept; what would you change if you could go back in time and rewrite history? The story grips you from the very first chapter and never lets you go until the bittersweet last pages. I loved every part of it, and think it appeals to many genres of readers (romance, sci-fi, literature, history.) As with all of King's writing, there is a lot to take in and process as you read. It is a long book, but worth every page. Recommended!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|a beautiful ap filled with the best and most informative moon info I have yet to come across. Highly recommended. works flawlessly on my galaxy nexus.
1423140591|4.0|Percy's back! But he's not *really* Percy. For some reason, I couldn't adore this book like I have all the past Percy novels. I loved the last one even with all completely new characters. This one couldn't hold my attention; it took me over three weeks to finish it! Even with Percy back, it's a completely new world. Unlike the last Heroes of Olympus book which took place in the same world, but with new characters. This one just didn't have the mystery like the last one did.<br /><br />As always, Riordan had a ton of humor with great imbibed Roman myths. None of them stick in my memory, but Riordan still knows how to keep the action going, though I found some of the flashbacks really tedious, and the new characters just felt weird with Percy. If Percy was instead a new character, their trio would've felt more organic. Percy already has a trio of his own! I kind of missed the trio of Pippa, Leo, and Jason. They had a better chemistry I think.<br /><br />I did love the commentary about Roman vs. Greek thinking, and the amount of history Riordan puts into his novel without making it too obvious. The ending enthralled me, and kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved the return of some great characters, and their meeting the Romans. I also have to applaud Riordan for leaving some awesome cliffhangers. I'm curious how the next novel will go and what characters will hold the point-of-views.<br /><br />As always, Riordan wrote a solid fantasy that didn't get bogged down in too many details. He kept it fun and exciting with just a touch of history. I love all the characters he manages to create in such a small span of pages. I will definitely read the next, but this one wasn't my favorite of Riordan's.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|Was excited for these movies. I hadn't even seen the third one before I picked up this set. All three movies are great. The picture quality is top notch as well as the sound. What was disappointing was the packaging that the movies come in. At first it looks cute coming in a box that looks like Andy's toy chest but once you open it up you see there's nothing special about it. The discs are placed in slots in a styrofoam block. Would have much prefered a extra wide bluray case instead. Overall satisified with my purchase.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This is the dumbest book I have ever read.  I can't believe Stephen King wrote a story like this! I hope he does better with all of his newer novels.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This cover fits nice and snug. It is lightweight and compact. However, after just 2 weeks of light use, the rubber textured coating on the bottom of the cover is wearing off at the corners. Other than that, I like it. It works well and is not bulky. I haven't had any problems with it staying propped up, as some other reviewers have noted.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I've been listening to this record for 20 years now, so I was used to the classic stereo mix done back in 85. The latest mix (done in 2005 by Chuck Ainlay) is terrific, because it gives you a different perspective of the production. I know most  people will jump right into Money For Nothing, but the quieter ones are the most effective, cos they give you a chance to sit back and enjoy what these songs really are: brilliant songwriting. Chuck Ainlay has been working with Knopfler since the nineties, producing his solo records and his skills are truely amazing. Check out the Alchemy Blu Ray/DVD, altough the picture quality failed to deliver, the audio is one of the best ones that I've ever heard. Go buy it!!!
0061997811|5.0|I received this book in the exact great condition Amazon stated.  I was very excited to receive it prior to the delivery date. It was a gift to my brother and he said it was better then he expected.
B004ZGM76A|1.0|My expectations were wrong.  I thought I was getting a fantasy movie.  Its not.  The fantasy parts are not connected to each other.  In that sense, it contains some fantasy mini-scenes.  I've seen better story line coherence in video games.  The fantasy parts are linear and last about 5 minutes each.  Then its back to this weird hidden psycho-ward of no escape.  Its kind of like Sin City if you imaging that movie without a plot.  But then Sin City does not float between multiple realities like this does.  The worst part of it all is that no time is spent to explain the relationship between fantasy and real worlds.  Or why she has these fantasies.  Its kind of like playing a mini-game inside of a game, in order to accomplish some task.  But then there is no explanation about why the mini-game served to complete the task in the real world.  I strained to watch this.  I did not enjoy it.
B005GIS7GK|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  It has a lot of typical male humor like the American Pie series and Animal house.  It is about an alien that escapes from where the government has been holding him since he crashed here and picking his brain for ideas.  We recommend it.  My wife loves it, raunchy and all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very enjoyable app. many games to keep you interested. a lot of achievements to accomplish. should download.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I was looking for a simple and sleek cover for my Kindle Fire without adding bulk and weight- and this is perfect- no bulk and no extra weight.  The stand comes in handy when I'm watching videos; it is kinda awkward to use the stand when reading a book- for me it is just weird reading something that is oriented horizontally.  The pink hard plastic back protects the device's exterior and the softer pliable front shields the screen from keys, pens, and whatever else is floating around in my handbag.  In the time that I have had it, the elastic has slightly softened and may completely loose its elasticity over time, however, I am pretty rough with my things and it will be fine with for someone with normal wear and tear (I am constantly opening and closing it).  I do wish it came in a teal blue or purple, girls do like other colors besides pink- but the pink is still a fun bright pink.  I was so pleased with it, I purchased the black one for my dad for his Kindle Fire.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got it when it was the free app of the day, read the description and decided to try it. It's a lot of fun to mess around with, and I have a few pranks in mind to pull. It works pretty well on my HTC. I didn't think it would work, but it is. The controls are a bit hard at first, but after, it's easy to use.
0062082353|1.0|This sorry excuse for a Navy Seal is nothing but a liar and a psychopath.  He's being propped up by Fox and the MSM as some sort of a hero for supposedly killing hundreds of Iraqis - including women by his own admission.  In his rag of a book, he dehumanizes these poor, illiterate brown people as &#34;savages&#34;, but I wonder how most of us would react is the Russian came into our neighborhoods and started killing our family members.  These actions would be bad enough, but then he goes on Bill O'Reilly's show and fabricates a story about how he punched out Jessie Ventura. The event never happened.  Ventura has never met Kyle, and the whole story is a transparent hoax clearly designed as an attempt at character assassination given Ventura's recent battles with the federal government, in particular his fight with the TSA, and his vehement anti-war stance.  Ventura is planning legal action.  Clearly this patsy is also being used to gin up support for the war with Iran that they've been itching for as part of our remodeling of the Middle East.  Jessica Kyle is no Adelbert F. Waldron; he couldn't hold his scope.  And he's not a true hero like Ventura who loves the troops enough not to send them into harms way needlessly.  Don't waste your money on this garbage.  Get Ventura's new book instead and find out the truth you won't hear on Fox or MSNBC.
B0064W63D6|3.0|So what happens when Lucifer gives up the Key to Hell to the Dream Master?  Not as much as I thought would happen.  It was more of a counsel of who should get the Key now.  It was anticlimactic, I was expecting more from that or some kind of trick on Lucifer's part.  It wasn't one of my favorite Sandman's but it was still \\"nice\\". Even Nada let Morpheous off easy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun for everyone! we all love it and play it daily. lots of different game options for everyone. fast and easy to use on kindle fire.
6300214370|4.0|The product is up to the standards given by the seller. Its an older movie so I wasn't expecting it to be in perfect condition. Its lightly used and acceptable. I ordered it as a gift for my mom & she's more excited about the content than the condition of the case. Its a great buy !
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Great movie & great price! the product arrived days before the ETA & wasn't in bad shape either. Extremely hilarious movie! :)
B00631VJIC|5.0|This CD is amazing.  My husband and I love watching it.  Best show on TV in the last several years!!!  Love Katie Segal!!!  And Jax of course!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The product was reeived promptly and was exatly as advertised.  The product is well made, neat in appearance and fuctional.  Excedllent value for price paid.
B002TXB2TE|1.0|I had purchased the regular DVD as a gift and the Blu-ray version for myself.  The only Blu-ray ones listed of this movie had to come from Scotland.  I waited probably 3 weeks before I watched it. To my surprise it will not play in America.  Not anywhere on the website was this mentioned, if so I never would have ordered it.  The return policy was for only 14 days so I'm out of luck and stuck with something useless  in America. Fair warning to anyone who orders a DVD from overseas, they won't work here in USA.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i just  finished all three books... and i am buzzing... i really enjoyed reading it and i literaly couldnt put it down...(that actually botherd my mom but besides that...) i loved it because it wasnt like all the other books that @ the end, only the bad guys die and all the good guys live happily ever afte and all that stuff... it was more real, hence scarier and a bigger thriller... i really recomend this book to all those who loved harry potter... but its not the same. anyways- long story short- its worth every cent and i gecomend it to young adults :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is a wonderful time killer. My girlfriend and I really enjoy the variety of games we get to choose from.
B0063GORYU|5.0|awesome game! I enjoy playing it on my kindle fire. my son and daughter also like to play it. I am very glad this app was available for free.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Is a great app but a thing i am asking to much, it would be cool that this app can work with the computer off.
B005K17RU0|3.0|does its job, wish there was more of a one screen view vs having to switch between multiple. much better than the weather channel app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are great. The graphics are good.  Finally found games that my son could'nt beat within an hour. Wish you could earn coins faster though. Other than that it is an overall good game.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Got exactly what was described...  I dont watch bonus features on movies anyways... And was same price as wal mart was for DVD...
B00319ECGU|5.0|Product was received in a timely manner in for Christmas.  The movies were what we had expected--typical Dirty Harry and were enjoyed.
B00164EABE|4.0|This movie was a classic when it came out and it's even better now ! The casting director was a genius . LOVE IT !!!
B005VTGB0S|5.0|I needed a case for my Galaxy Tab 10.1, but all the other cases were either too expensive, or cheaply made. I was a little unsure that this would actually fit, as all the pictures show an iPad in the case (Galaxy tab is more rectangular than iPad). When it arrived, I was happy to see that it fit perfectly.  The corner straps are a little tight, but that keeps the tablet in place so it won't slide around or fall out.  The inside is a soft fabric that should protect the screen, and the construction is pretty strong.  The case does not block the buttons or speakers. Overall, I would recommend this case.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|[[ASIN:B004O3YGMC Splashtop Remote Desktop]]Very easy to install and setup. Will recommend to friend and family. Works great, works as advertised. So glad I installed it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really solid version of solitaire. has auto complete when you win, and has a number of different difficulty levels. Ads are minimal and unobtrusive.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|i'm not sure what the fuss is over the stand functionality.  it seems to work for me.<br /><br />the only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 stars is the elastic band; i'm not entirely sure how long it will last!  the website says there's a lifetime warranty though it's not clear if it covers the case in that regard.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is quick and works great on both phone and kindle fire. Your computer must be on for this to work, but if you don't want to haul your laptop around, this is an excellent alternative.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game is great. I could do with out the ads. Game play is smooth and graphics are good. Keep them coming MobilityWare!
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I previously had the X11 TB headphones and I have always enjoyed them since I play at night with the kid in the next room. My only real problem with the X11 was the mountain of cords that kept me tied to the TV and always undoing the mess of tangles. I really wanted to go to wireless and it brought me to the X31 and X41. The only real difference that I saw was the Dolby 7.1 sound VS stereo surround sound. I opted to spend the extra money. One thing to note is you need to use the Xbox AV cable to take advantage of the optical cord to get the 7.1 surround sound (I saw a few other reviewers point this out). If you use HDMI, it won't work. You still get good sound, but not what you should be experiencing.  Sound - Bass is good but I was disappointed on how loud I could turn it up. I like it to very loud, despite the health aspects..lol and I was disappointed that my X11's could be louder volume wise.  MIC - I like the feature that you can slightly hear yourself, but it didn't make me talk softer because I got the same amount of complaints from the wife. Also, when I had chat volume turned up higher, my team complained of feedback from my headphones.  Battery Life - I got about 6 hours on each set of AAA batteries. For even remotely serious gamers, that sucks. I changed batteries twice in less than a week! Even if I used re-chargeables, it would still be a disappointing battery-life.  Other issues - I experienced MAJOR interferance with these headphones. My Wi-Fi router was the main culprit. At one point, I had them about 15 feet away and it was still cutting in and out. My only solution was to un-plug my router and direct connect my Xbox to my modem..The likelihood of a gamer having their Wi-Fi access point in the same room as their Xbox and Headphone transmitter will likely be high so I am not surprised with seeing so many reviewers complain of this issue. Even when I did direct connect to modem and turned off my Wi-Fi, it seemed the baby monitor (digital signal) in the next room caused a few cut-outs.   Bottom Line - While the 7.1 surround sound is good, it is not $140 good; ESPECIALLY when you factor in the cons I've listed above. I'm returning these headphones. I've had such a bad taste with TB about these that I'm even considering just going back to my X11's. If you're a serious gamer, then opt for some better headphones and not these.
B005EVVESM|5.0|MAROON 5 continues to entertain with their varying styles.  No song is ever dull or boring.  Every song is a treat!
B000LE0TGA|4.0|As far as this being a CD W/book is a little deceptive.There is only a jewel case booklet insert,no book.The original limited edition was the actual 30th. anniversary addition.It had a 24 page book.This addition should really be listed as \\"Out Of The Blue\\" With Extra Tracks in my opinion.<br /><br />I will say this is great sounding CD for any ELO fan.I am not a big on extra tracks being added to classic albums.I think adding extra tracks cheapens them to some degree,and this one is no exception.I saw ELO when they toured \\"Out Of The Blue\\" ,but unfortunately they did not use the flying saucer stage for that show.I would have loved to seen that,or at least read about it in \\"the book\\".
B00006LFGD|5.0|You certainly can't go wrong with this CD.  Every selection was a major hit and knocks it out of the park! The great Barbra S. with many others stars.  It's a beautiful addition to any collection!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great way to spend time I guess its easy to pick up, idk I already knew but yeah really great I love this I play it more often than most of my other 5$ apps and its free! witch is great
B0054JZC6E|5.0|game that keeps you busy and keeps the kid busy tons of good games just gotta earn enough points to unlock them all
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I purchased this cd a few months ago for myself.  Loved it so much, I purchased it for someone else as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  This seller is excellent.  So pleased with my purchase experience, I purchased the second cd with the same seller. Highly recommend both the cd and the seller.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a great group of games. takes forever to unlock everything without paying. great for wasting time and to keep kids busy.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I just love this flash!  I do not regret this purchase one bit! The best part is you can get it from amazon! I love buying from amazon because you know they will always stand behind their product. I still have quite a bit to learn yet about the flash, but it is a great buy!
B00631VJIC|5.0|While I expected this cd to be good I was amazed at just how good it turned out to be. I watch the series every week and had heard excerpts played during the episodes but hearing the entire song is even better. Some of the lyrics of the songs have been changed but they are still great and I was not aware that Katy Sagal sang, her voice is awsome and she does an excellent job on Son of a Preacher Man.  My favorite song on this cd is The House of The Rising Son, the words have been changed but it is still a solid favorite of mine. My children grew up hearing the original versions of these songs, they liked the versions on this cd so much they each decided to buy the cd. If u are undecided on this cd u will only have to listen to a couple of songs from the cd and you will be placing an order.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Great album, people rating this 1 star are seriously haters! Another band love as much as these guys is The Black Keys...Great classic album, tracks such as Congratulations, Brian Eno, It's working & classic song Siberian breaks is truly amazing, it's 4 songs in one...I am a musician, it is a genius track...
0143038419|5.0|I love the author's sense of humor in this book. I can relate closely to her life situations and challenges. I had done a 10 day Vipassana silent meditation last year and reading about her facing similar challenges was encouraging. I too thought the 4 AM chanting would never end and couldn't imagine getting through another minute at times. I love how she writes in all her humanness, not fluffing and buffing anything, admitting her darkest secrets that most of us have but are afraid to admit. AND I love food just as much and I would have done the same thing in Italy if I could have. Her humor around food often had me bursting out with laughter. This book was uplifting and also great laughter therapy. Next i will read her follow up \\"Committed\\". Can't wait.
0792164903|5.0|Tim Burton is master of creating foreboding moods, using unique visual techniques and telling strange tales occuring in fantastic worlds mostly inspired by his childhood nightmares and dreams. The result: visually stunning movies with own realities. \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is no exception at all. I reckon this is his homage not only to Washington Irving, but also to great Hammer Films of his youth.<br /><br />In terms of technical aspects, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is one of most visually spectacular and seamlessly crafted picture in Burton's oeuvre. Thanks to Emmanuel Lubezki, the cinematography is dazzling. The colors are wonderfully washed out that at first glance it gives the impression that the film was shot black & white. Along with the intensive use of blue filters; moody, dark gray, brown and overcast landscape gives a surreal gothic feel to the picture, making viewers think that the sun never shows its face on Sleepy Hollow.<br /><br />The art direction is impressive too. Sets are masterfully designed from the foggy town to creepy woods. It's hard to believe that 90 percent of the movie was shot in the studio, on specially constructed sets with some scenes enhanced with CGI (especially Hessian's sequences).<br /><br />Horror, humor and romance go hand in hand throughout the movie. As always, Johnny Depp impeccably plays constable Ichabod Crane, a man of deep contradiction: Being whimsical all the time, sometimes he is adamant & stalwart when needs to be, sometimes uneasy & wimpy when things go awry. He fearlessly cuts up corpses with Cronenberg-like medical gadgets, but he is afraid of spiders and bugs!!!<br /><br />The only downside of the movie is that romance between Ichabod and Katrina is plastic and half-baked. I think there's virtually no chemistry evident between them, so it is impossible to accept either tenderness or passion in their affinity. Evidently, their romance is the spice added to the spooky mood of the story.<br /><br />Last word: absolutely fantastic and entertaining film on every aspect - one of my all-time favourites...all-time favourites...
1401922414|5.0|Beautiful and inspirational on a daily basis to keep our life moving in a positive way.  Each day has something new and affirming for life's challenges.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I downloaded this game to my kindle fire and it takes FOREVER to load I'm giving it 5 stars because I have played it before an love it.
0439023521|5.0|Great characters, action, suspense, but what really makes the Hunger Games so spectacular is the seamless back story the book is built around. Within the first few chapters you already feel that you have been apart of Panem for centuries. Loved the plot and I am currently enjoying the 2nd book \\"Catching Fire\\".
B002JVWR4A|5.0|We got all the Bones series for my mom and she has watched them all already. she loves them and says there is no problems with skipping
B0042RJWTC|2.0|In response to other reviewers who say the series isn't captioned, I'd like to correct them and say it is. I'm deaf, so captions are a huge deal for me. The series isn't subtitled, which is different than captions. To get the captions to work, you have to have the closed caption option on your television turned on, and you need to make sure your DVD player is hooked up to the television so there's nothing interfering with the captioning working.  I found this an entertaining television show. No, it's not exactly 100 percent historically accurate, but this is television, not a documentary. The point is to entertain. The costumes and the sets were stunning. It brought the time period alive. I had some problems with Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII, as he just didn't fit the role at first, but he grew on me.   So why the two stars? Well, as I watched the first season, I found there were instances in which the image on the television was suddenly pixelated, just for a few seconds. At first I thought I was imagining it, but it happened several times again. At least it wasn't freezing like other reviewers mentioned. In the second season, I didn't have the pixelating problem again, but there were two discs containing the same information, even though they were supposed to carry different episodes. So instead of a disc that had episodes 7, 8, and 9 (and was labeled as having those episodes), I had a disc that had 4, 5, and 6 on it.   I ended up returning the box set. Amazon provided wonderful service in returning it and providing a refund. And although I enjoy the television show, I don't want to order another box set for fear there will be further problems. There were other things that irritated me about the box set, like the fact that there was no episode guidebook, and the fact that the irregularly shaped box meant it couldn't fit with my other DVDs. So great show, but this box set ain't worth it.
B005F96URI|3.0|Set in a time in the future that we are told is... some time in the future; we are faced with a world where man has been so inhuman to man that all firearms are banned! They are allowed to walk around with all forms of medieval stuff though, so all violent types need not fear.<br /><br />Thrown into this heady mix of a world with neither calendars nor guns come three unsuspecting heroes. One, a drifter (Josh Hartnett), two a barman (Woody Harrelson) and the third a lone young Samurai - Gackt (well there is always one isn't there). They coalesce (meet) in `Little Westworld' a place that is ruled by a ruthless tyrannical man in a large hat and cloak - Nicola (Ron Perlman). He uses his army of red besuited henchman to maintain a gang warfare rule, that includes extortion, prostitution, corrupt police and sushi!<br /><br />All three have reasons to want things to end, be it honour, lost love or something more intangible like revenge. They alone must fight the nasty Ron Perlman and Killer No 2 (Kevin McKidd). What is unleashed is an homage to so many things I was a bit confused, the only thread that runs through everything is the fighting - and if that is your bag you will be far from disappointed.<br /><br />This film oozes style, it starts off being like a sixties re booted `Batman' and then goes all `Sin City', and every set is framed and shot like a graphic novel work of pop art. All the cars are classics even though this is the future, from a Fiat 500 to a Bentley hearse that is doubling up as a taxi and I am sure I spotted a Simca in the mix too. There is also oodles of Japanese influences and a particular preference for red in nigh on every shot. The dialogue though intermittent is sparse and to the point, not overly polished, but still contrived enough to have more than a nod to the noir classics.  The plot unfolds quite predictably, the only shocks come from the violence, which is so stylised and choreographed that the blood comes across as not that authentic either.<br /><br />That said this is a sumptuous production that cares more about style than the vehicle it uses to get the message across, and that is the only real criticism, there is humour, there is pathos, though only a veneer and there is a love interest that is left hanging, but there is a load of fighting. If you like action films with more than a leaning to the oriental then this will rock your world; if you like a more original plot then you will probably only remember this for the high production values. I did like the style but felt it lacked substance - hence my rating. There are good performances from  all concerned and director Guy Moshe should be proud of what he has created, it is the script that has let this down, but it is far from being a bad film, it just is not a great one.umptuous production that cares more about style than the vehicle it uses to get the message across, and that is the only real criticism, there is humour, there is pathos, though only a veneer and there is a love interest that is left hanging, but there is a load of fighting.

B00004D3C1|5.0|When I first heard these guys I thought it was some music I missed out on back in the day.  There is a real old school flavor here.  Sort of a heavy classic rock and early metal feel.  For those who experienced the 70's, it will take you back to a paneled basement, sitting around the wire spool table with your friends.
0307891372|5.0|Cheap, beautiful and very, very complete.  By far one of the best game guides ever made, with several bonuses, a big poster,  a guide on the Dovah language and several other small details that make a big difference.  If you are a fan of skyrim, buy it.  Buy it now.

0061714372|3.0|I decided to read Dave Mustaine, not because I loved his music but because I wished to change my opinion of him. To me Dave had always been this arrogant man, and the book kept my opinion strong. The beginning was good and interesting. He spoke of his childhood and his tormented teens which I enjoyed. It wasn't until he started to talk indepth about his faith that I lost interest. The last portion of the book seemed to be defendong his religion and why he believes in his religion. It became tedious.
0439023491|4.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I was on the edge of my seat awaiting the sequel, and it did not disappoint.  The only hitch is that you will have to get through a slow moving start.  Collins spends the first part of the book in the aftermath of the games and the year following in District 12.  After things are set up, the book picks up steam very quickly.  The second and third parts are fast moving and get the reader right back into what made the Hunger Games so great.  Fast moving action and edge of your seat story.  Deal with the sappy start and you won't be disappointed by the action packed end.  Can't wait for the final book!
0312641893|5.0|When I first heard about this book, I was intrigued but not exactly sold on the concept. Sure, I like my super awesome technology just like any other girl and Cyborgs are definitely part of that list. However, I just wasn't sure how it was going to look on paper. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!<br /><br /> Cinder is a story about a girl mechanic, part Cyborg, part something else. She is harassed by her step mother, hated by her step sister, and looked down on for being who she is. Yet, she stands tall and works against all odds. I loved Cinder as the main character. I felt myself cheering \\"You go girl!\\" more than once during the book. Then, enters Prince Kai. Well, hello gorgeous! Right away, I enjoyed the relationship weaving between the two. It wasn't just your ordinary \\"love at first swoon\\", it was a real working relationship. Marissa takes two characters and makes them their own. Doom hangs over them at every step and they are forced to make tough decisions, and yet, they keep coming back to each other. That is real love story in the making.<br /> And that ending, oh. my. goodness. that ending!!! What a cliffhanger! Book 2 is going to be fabulous, I can see it already!<br /> The writing is beautiful, with just enough heart to keep you up at nights. Marissa weaves all aspects of a good fairy tale and makes it her own. The world Cinder lives in is painted with the best colors of words. The setting and the people are so real you can almost reach out and touch them. Cinder will grip your heart and leave you gasping for more. You are going to fall in love!
1583334386|5.0|read it cover to cover. I quickly searched the index for VTA and NA and came up empty handed, but was informed on pages 111-14 that my belief in the dopamine pleasure center hypothesis was fallacious. So there you go, buy the book because I haven't done enough research to explain what I just said and you don't like me and \\"want\\" to be much unlike me, which is to say \\"informed\\".
030746363X|4.0|The book is irreverent and fun reading. Tim Ferriss is definitely a Nike \\"Just Do It,\\" kind of guy. Can you lose 20 pounds in 30 days? I don't think so if you're a woman but the diet is a helluva lot better than the choices some of us make otherwise. As Ferriss urges, consistency is the key to achieving results from his diet/exercise plan. The book definitely is worth the price of admission to Ferriss' world.

Application is very unstable and crashes forcing a deletion and reinstall along with bringing all of the books from the archives back into the program. This is required at least 1 time per day. It would be very nice to see a fix come down for whatever has gone wrong.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was cool. some games I still have no idea how to play. I would not pay for this game.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I liked this book, but it was neither as interesting, nor as compelling as Pride and Prejudice. As a teacher, I would love to offer a course in Jane Austen in general; in the current educational environment, I doubt that will happen. If I were allowed to do so, I would have students compare this novel with Pride and Prejudice simply because I think the papers would be interesting to read. The book is written in typical Austen style, the characters are endearing, and the situations are frequently funny - all in all a good read.

B000E6EHGI|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites. I bought the original the day it was available at the local record store, and this digital album with its extras is wonderful.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|but boringg at the same time the points can be a hassle but otherwise the games are quick but they progressively get more difficult.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many games! love the fact that you gather points to unlock the games by playing instead of paying money to unlock them, the way it should be!!
0131480057|5.0|This book is extremely comprehensive, I don't think I've ever turned to this text and not found some useful remarks or advice on my current task/problem at hand.  The book is organized extremely well, is packed with examples and sample commands, warnings, things to look for, and perhaps most importantly, all comes from the voice of experience.  This book has earned a place close to my heart and will be on my bookshelf for ever.  I would not recommend this as a beginner book.  It is better used as a desk reference.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app as I have it on my aneroid phone and my Kindle Fire. It hosts different versions of the word, daily and yearly study plans and makes for an extremely helpful study tool. Kudos to the designers of this app for presenting quality biblical information in a user-friendly interface!
0062082353|5.0|The book reads like a military thriller. There are times in his narration that you forget this is true. The segments and stories are ones that draw you in to the ugly side of war. It is reality. I served in Iraq myself and many of the battles that Chris describes in the book are ones that I was familiar with. Although I never saw nearly the action that he did, I knew of those battles. He describes the hell that is war. He describes the insurgents, or savages as he calls them, and what they would do. He describes the firefights and the battles in such detail. His recollection of these incidents as he takes you through them lets you see inside the life of a silent professional, the life of a SEAL. Although it might not be the most eloquent prose you can find in a book, he is a Navy SEAL not a professional writer.  I have read some of the comments online and many make it seem as though he is an arrogant man just wanting everyone to know how good he is. These people have obviously not read the book. He points out in the book that his main reason for writing it was because other people were planning on writing about his story and he wanted to make sure that the proper people got credit. He constantly talks through the pages about how he is not the most skilled sniper, but he is lucky and was surrounded by great people. Through his narration you get to see the teamwork that occurred to accomplish the numbers he did, and the pure luck at times. He constantly praises the soldiers and Marines that he was with. You get the sense of a humble man, one reluctant to tell the story but does so in order to honor those who surrounded him.  The hardest parts to read were the loss of his friends. He tells the story of Marc Lee, a story I know through his mother Debbie's activism after his death. He also tells the story about how Ryan Job was wounded. You could tell the sadness in the words on the page. It is powerful. Having a husband that was wounded in Iraq it opened my eyes to whatothers feel when someone is wounded in front of them. Chris's dedication to those he served with is nearly palpable as he speaks of them.  The most intriguing were the words of his wife, Taya. She writes about what she felt and experienced as his wife and the mother of their children. Many of the emotions she felt were ones that I felt when my husband was deployed. Although her situation was much more intense than mine would ever be, I could sympathize with her words. She provided the real insight to the man and not just the sniper.  A part that touched me is when Chris spoke towards the end of the book about giving back. He discusses the retreats that he has helped with for Marcus Luttrell's charity the Lone Survivor Foundation (LSF). My husband, daughter and I were fortunate enough to be on one of these retreats that he described at Barefoot Ranch. It was an amazing experience.   Chris is a great man and this is a great book.
B006UAWH2S|5.0|I'm not sure if I've ever seen a movie that has so profoundly moved me. It was well acted, wonderfully written and directed, and astonishingly edited and shot.   The thing I don't like is how people are reacting to this movie and how the movie is being marketed (which might be connnected). It's not saying ANYTHING about the kind of feelings and emotions this movie brings up in such new and ingenious ways.   I hope this movie gets much, MUCH better marketing when it comes to the US.
B002BWP49M|3.0|Ugh are people really giving movie reviews on the Blu-Ray product while it is still just a pre-release? Shouldn't the reviews here be more like \\"Won't work in my Blu-Ray player\\" or \\"special features sucked\\" or \\"Wow, loved the cover art\\"? My comment along these lines is that Summit Entertainment really blew it by not making it to the theatre in time to get the Blu-Ray out in time for the 2011 Holiday season since home video is where all the dollars are these days. At least they didn't try to go super cheese and make it into a 3D title (Anyone see Clash of the Titans 3D)?  As far as the movie goes it was a decent flick, my only problem was that they artificially split it up into two movies to milk the home entertainment market. Of course I pre-ordered the Blu-Ray anyway because my household contains 9 year old, 17 year old, and 37 year old females who love the Twilight series. When part II hits Blu-Ray I will get that two and proceed to edit the two movies together to make the single 120 minute movie that this should have been. (I am in the process of doing the same thing with Harry Potter part 7.1 and 7.2 now)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Amazon,      I had purchased the original Kindle for my wife a couple years ago. She has stated that this was one of the best gifts I have ever gotten for her. I thought this year I would get her the Kindle Fire. If the original was great the Fire would be amazing. I was right!   She absolutly loves this thing. Once again I hit a home run with this purchase. So far we haven't had any issues. Great product at a reasonable price.  Thanks  Scott
B004ECDNJU|1.0|It's a game. There's no excuse for games not having app 2 sd available. Games are not essential in any way to the performance of my phone. Therefore they can live on the sd card. Uninstalled.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I run marathons, ride bike, go the gym regularly and thought I was in a somewhat good shape.  This DVD brought me back to reality.  I thought it would be  easy and I could do the workout whenever I did not feel like going to the gym, but still wanted to do something so I would not feel too guilty.  I was wrong, this 30 minutes workout kicked my B.. the first time I did it. Julian Michaels is great, she pushes you and you wouldn't dare stop early.  I you are looking to get in shape and are ready to work hard get this DVD, if you are looking for an easy workout this DVD is not for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun (: I wish games could be unlocked easier. but overall I have not found a game I do not like.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|plenty of games makes for a lot of entertainment when you are looking for a challenge. had tons of fun playing the games.
B004IK8PLE|5.0|Just the right amount of history, math, and logic.  Worth every minute.  Now ready for the deep dive.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Season 5 is very intense and fun. Julia Stiles is a strong addition to the cast and her character helps Dexter to evolve through her own experiences,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is awesome for kid's to play when they are bored. I will play this game all the time.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good fun when you want to veg out.  It moves fast and really makes your brain really work fast to figure out the best solution.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|This was the first Legacy Edition Elvis collection put out.  Featuring Elvis' sessions at American (not Stax as previously written), right off the heels of his '68 Comeback Special, this collection is simply amazing.  It's not just some of Elvis' best recorded music, it's some of the best music ever recorded period.  Elvis' creative muse's shine bright in this collection.  For the layman, these are the recordings that spawned some Elvis' best songs of this era, chiefly, \\"In The Ghetto\\", \\"Kentucky Rain\\", and \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\".<br /><br />This collection also yields some forgotten gems, casual Elvis fans may not remember.  Songs like \\"Long Black Limousine\\", \\"Power Of My Love\\", \\"Stranger In My Own Hometown\\", \\"Any Day Now\\", are personal favourites.<br /><br />The mastering by Vic Anesini is simply amazing,  \\"From Elvis In Memphis\\", paired with \\"Elvis-Back In Memphis\\", plus the original mono singles, makes this collection, hands down my favourite Elvis collection of a particular session, and the best Legacy Edition out there.  This should be in every serious music collector's collection.  It's that good.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle is a Navy Seal. He's also a sniper and an ex-ranch hand from Texas. He's billed as the \\"most lethal sniper in U.S. history,\\" but that's only a part of the story. Like many people he has a story to tell that's gripping and real. The reader may not agree with the tactics used to train Seals...they're barbaric in many ways and one may debate whether they're necessary in producing super soldiers, but that's for another time and place, and another book. Kyle simply tells it like it is. And many like myself find it fascinating, just as I would find the story of an officer undergoing nuclear training under Rickover's supervision fascinating.<br /><br />Kyle is a trained killer...an assassin with a license to take out the enemy wherever they're encountered. His one goal in life is simple: protect America's interest and, more importantly, its soldiers. The book opens not with his first kill, but his first kill of a woman, and a civilian. She had a grenade and was preparing to lob it off towards a company of Marines. He hesitates, but his senior officer doesn't. \\"Shoot!\\" the officer barks and Kyle shoots. The woman jerks as the bullet hits her and falls. She was dead before she pulled the grenade, Kyle explains. He just sent her off before she could take any Marines with her. To Kyle it wasn't complicated. He didn't see her as loyal to Saddam Hussein's regime and someone willing to give her life to stop the inevitable invasion of her country. She was evil incarnate and disloyal to the NEW regime. It was just that simple, and Kyle keeps it simple throughout his book. He also reveals some of the boneheaded decisions made by politicians and politically correct civilian leaders. But on this he treads carefully. Despite all, he is a U.S. Navy Seal and he knows how to do his job, whatever it is.<br /><br />I personally have known cops who have killed one person and they suffer nightmares, insomnia and depression. It's no wonder. When a cop is forced to take a life, everything they did prior to it is called into question. Often the police brass show no support and the officers are deposed for hours, and sometimes charges are brought to bear, and if not, they are liable to be sued by the families of the person they were forced to shoot. It's only natural they are filled with guilt and doubt. After all, cops are trained to help people...not to kill. Kyle, though, is trained to kill, and he does it repeatedly and is rewarded. There's no guilt, no intimidation. He has a job and he does it.<br /><br />His story is fascinating, as I said, at least to me. To those who see the complexities of war, it may be too much to take. But Kyle doesn't see things in varying shades of gray, but only in contrasting levels of black and white. During his training, he and other candidates were stripped bare and forced to lie in the cold surf. He describes the convulsions of cold as \\"jackhammering.\\" as he and others interlocked their arms and gritted their teeth wishing someone would come by and piss on them for warmth. Such cold is difficult for most people to imagine, but Kyle and his fellow candidates just suffered through it as well as other grueling training (like hanging from a bar until an instructor ordered him to begin his pull ups, something he wasn't particularly good at.)<br /><br />Kyle's book takes you through his life, beginning with his love of firearms and especially old style cowboy guns. When he talked to an Army recruiter, he was excited about the possibility of being a Ranger. As he exited the area he was stopped by a Navy recruiter who talked him into trying out for training as a Seal. After being accepted, he chose Naval Intelligence as his field of specialty, then as a trained sniper. His story had to be told, though the reader tends to be impatient after Kyle's first story of sniping. Still, it's a page turner, and it kept me engaged to the very end.r to it is called into question.

B0054JZC6E|1.0|Game quality is cheap. Take an example of singer in second level. In top device like kindle, it hardly  moves positions. could have been better.
0743201140|5.0|This book is invaluable.  I have bought this repeatedly for friends and they have loved it.  It is very freeing to find what your strengths are and to hone in on them instead of worrying about what you are not good at.  You will not regret this purchase!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|The app is great and is very easy to use...when connected to the same Internet connection.  While I'm off campus I love to free up my memory on my kindle so I use this remote appto use my computer word documents.  Only problem is it doesn't stay connected very well and sometimes isn't responsive enough to keep up the note taking I'm doing and can get behind.  Fix response time and 5 stars all the way
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very addictive, fun game.  The playing area is big, easy to read, easy to make your selections/play.  Great Graphics.  Highly recommend this App! Great for all ages.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use, no force close, and customizable! I use this all the time, and have never had any problems. I love that you can just tap the card, and it goes into the correct spot. no more sliding!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am a nerd so what can I say other than I love it.  Next season will be purchased as well.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a great product. Great sound, good battery life, and it works from a good distance away. However, turning it on requires you to hold the power button for ~5sec. Even longer if you have it plugged in. This sounds negligible until you try to do it 4 times in a row without success. I'm not sure why they made it this way, but other than that, great product!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm clock app is very easy to use and has many different options. I have not seen any ads even though it offers an upgrade without ads
B004T4LUPW|5.0|First app I spent money on. So many Fire users were happy, I decided to bite the bullet and try it myself.<br />No regrets.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I highly reccomend 101 in 1 Games. This.collection of games is simple, yet highly addictive. The graphics are great as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My favorite so far is the sushi stick. I really enjoy being offered different ways to pass the time. Can't wait to see what is unlocked. 2 thumbs up!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game its awesome because you can keep getting more and more games its realy cool I regimens it to everyone
B00000JPH6|5.0|Being a big fan of the muppets and Henson in general, I had to own this movie.  It doesn't quite hold up as well as compared to my memories as say Labyrinth, but was overall a good Henson production and recommended to any fans of Henson.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 10 year old daughter loves this game and loves MY Kindle Fire.  I haven't even gotten to read any of my new books yet because she is using MY kindle to play Angry Birds.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I used other reviews to help me decide on a protective cover for my new Kindle Fire.  I chose the MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED the cover from the time I took it out of the package.  It is very light weight and easy to slide my Kindle Fire into.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I feel sure that you will love it as much as I do.
B001U887S8|4.0|great product! and super fast shipping. thank you!!!!!!!!!!!! soft inside and warm. great for walking in tile floors during cold days.
0060873086|4.0|I'm not quite sure why this book is receiving all of the negativity; maybe it's because of the hardcord Crichton fans objecting to Preston.  Admittedly, some parts are cliche but the imagery created in the book is incredible.  The detail in which he describes the characters' surroundings is fantastic; the science behind the book is interesting to say the least (excluding the machine).  The plot follows what you expect, although it leaves you stunned at some points.  I had to re-read one passage to make sure that it actually happened the way I imagined.  The ending is disappointing, leaving you wanting more closure.  Either way, I suggest picking up this book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|give more time to play the games would better other then that the games are cool and a little challenging
B005I6EU48|2.0|Nice looking cover but did not quite fit the fire so well.  Cover would not close all the way as if the fire was too thick.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I remember this movie from my childhood.  I actually purchased this movie for my 10 year old son.  He has had a fascination with the Disney movie, Wall-E ... and we thought that perhaps, just perhaps, he would like to see another 'version' of a robot such as the cute character Wall-E.  We were so happy, as this is truly his favorite movie!  It has enough action in it to keep his attention, the sweetness of Johnny 5 and his learning the world around him is still innocent enough that my 10 year old can understand and enjoy it.  If you have never seen this movie, I recommend you do.  It shows us the ultimate meaning, that love, spirit and hope can live in us all!
140053271X|3.0|Bought one right after they came out. I love the idea of a simple, cheap(er), E ink, midsize book reader and it seemed to fit the bill as I tried it out. After using it for a few months, I realize that its not yet the device I was hoping for.  Good:   - My setup was pretty simple   - Nice form factor   - Battery life   - Book display looks good  Bad:   - In-store help was not that great. My nook was one that broke a few months after light use, so I took it back to the store. The thing was completely broken, but it still took 1 1/2 hours. At the end of this time, with the in-store employee having to talk to several different people on the phone for approval and getting ideas for possible fixes and being confused by those fixes, they finally said that I could send it in and get a new one in a few weeks. That was odd because they had just told another customer that in-store help was so much better than working with Amazon. After another phone call and manager approval, who also felt it important to play with the device, I did finally walk out with a new one.   - Holding the device is strange for me. I can't get a comfortable grip that also works for turning the pages. Not sure if this is the size or the fact that I have to be careful not to touch the screen the whole time I'm reading. I just know that there is a subtle feeling that holding a real book feels better than this device.   - Cover looks good, but only hooks in on one side, even though the device has places on both sides where it could connect. Not sure why they did this, but the problem it causes is that when you use the buttons on the left to turn pages, the right comes up off the back an inch or so. This means the thing flaps every time you turn the page this way.   - Syncing to the latest page read does not work between NOOK for PC and the reader. When I e-mailed them, they gave a generic response that they are working on it and to check back with their website, which already said that it was supposed towork.   - Gave up on getting library e-books after installing a couple of applications on my computer, several e-mails to libraries, and discussions with others that got it working, but said it was a pain. Could be a problem just with my area.   - Free books I tried are terrible. I had a hard time finding a decent one (the one I got  through google books were unreadable), so paid for a cheap version, which still had problems.   - Physical page turning using the buttons on the left and right of the device is strange. The buttons require you to either press in just the right place, or press too hard, so there is always a pause to see if it did turn, or if I should hit it again.   - The realization that I have to pick sides early in the Amazon vs. B&N battle since the books I'm buying may not work on the devices of the future, and for the short term, they definitely will not work. For example, I was considering the Fire, but know that the dozen books I bought so far for the Nook will not transfer over easily if I do.     Overall I like it, but hopefully the next version, or the next Kindle, will solve some of these problems. And please, Amazon and B&N, work hard on making sure that e-books are device agnostic in the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a very good game its a super good game like i said its a very super good game
B0054YIQLW|4.0|I'm thrilled they re-released this opera on DVD.  My old DVD was damaged and I almost wore out my old VHS tape.  The transfer looks and sounds great.  Domingo, who is still an incredible presence at 70+, was in his prime when this film was made and gave his usual flawless performance.  I also loved Julia Migenes-Johnson, who effectively conveyed Carmen's passion and courage.  Unfortunately, I couldn't give the DVD five stars: There is no way to turn off the captions and I wish it had a few more chapters to make it easier to find scenes when I am short on time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games ,but not how you must unlock the games. I also love the dart game. Love it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great way to pass to the time. the graphics look great on the kindle fire. it gives u points to rate it which is nice
B0012EM5D8|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite movies..it inspired him to learn more about real bees..some things in the movie are a bit fictional, but it is a fun, light story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is the most entertaining game ever.  I have been playing this game everyday since I got it. get this game.
B005POK858|5.0|Best RPG and quite possibly game I've ever played on my phone (Droid X.)  Picked it up as the FAOTD awhile back played it a bit then really started playing over the holidays with all the airport/traveling/Sitting around time.  Only complaint is the sound always stops working about five minutes into playing.  I would absolutely pay full price for a sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games! My son and I are having fun trying to unlock new games! Great for all ages. I highly recommend this app!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Loved the movie. Didn't get a chance to catch it in theaters but I picked up a copy today. Brad Pitt is great in the role of Billy Beane. I read the book years ago and liked it. Probably should have read it again just so I remembered more of the details. Will be reading the book again though. I like the whole \\"Moneyball\\" concept. I want to see this teams competing in a fair fight. Teams like the Yankees, Red Sox, Phillies and yes, even my Angels have an unfair advantage.  Watching the movie also got the inner sports executive in me fired up again. I think I'll be picking up a copy of the latest version of OOTP.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app gets me closer to the good lord and his son everyday and helps me pull through the day
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is fun for minimal use, but not your only app. The app is addicting but also a major battery killer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is some sweet ass games. I love that it was free two that was cool. it dose not force close ever
1451648537|5.0|What a fascinating glimpse into his life.  It also helped me to appreciate even more those Apple products I love and learn why he has created such an obsession within me for them.  I am a Windows convert and it did start for me with an i product.  As he said in the book it was indeed \\"like giving a person in hell a glass of ice water\\".  Love the authors writing style and plan on reading more of his biographies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a good game for passing time. Some games are hard and some are so easy a blind panda  could do them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are combination of easy and hard which I like. there are tons of games for everyone. good fun.
0446585025|1.0|I like Ellen DeGeneres.  I enjoyed her first two books.<br /><br />I have no idea why she thought that this one would be worth reading.  It's pointless....not funny....she seemed to be reaching for things to say.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.
B001HN690O|4.0|This was a great follow up to the first movie. Not as good of a story and not as funny as the original, but still very entertaining. I can't wait for the 3rd movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The game was an exciting adventure. It had a lot of levels to it. The game is addicting. it will make u never want to put it down. I recommend it.
0761158464|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my nephew who lives in a home for disabled children.  He can't have a TV in his room or any sort of game system, and I thought this book was a good substitute for those types of distractions since the pictures really do move and come to life.  It's infinitely better than the old style moving pictures which really only gave two different pictures.  This looks like actual movement and is fun to watch.
1904920233|4.0|I'm knocking down one star because my favorite dish isn't in the book. Thank you so much for making this book available. I love the dishes and I'm going to love learning/cooking for myself all the way out here in Texas. Thousands of miles away from a Wagamama, now I can have all my second favorite dishes here at home. Best Christmas Present of 2011.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I have only used the one player mode so far and I'm delighted with all aspects of this app. The User Interface is clean, intuitive and easy to navigate. The sliding bar for selecting difficulty level is very helpful and graphics are beautiful. A great free app!
B000H30B3G|5.0|I purchased this c.d. for my son for Christmas. The product came quickly and was in excellent condition. The extended version includes extra scenes of the prehistoric \\"monsters\\". The dinosaurs are great, much better than Jurrasic Park. The first time I watched this with my son I thought \\"Ho Hum\\" another King Kong remake BUT, I really enjoyed this one. The relationship between Beauty and The Beast(Kong and the Damsel) is really developed and I found myself wanting Kong to win. He's not a monster!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Typically I go to Crucial for memory but when they failed me I turned to Amazon. I upped my HP 2025dn RAM from 128MB to 384MB thanks to Amazon + Kingston.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you're looking for something to occupy hours of time, this is it.  There's a little something for everyone. If one game's not for you, odds are that another 50 are.  The ads are a little annoying on the Kindle Fire, but I'm willing to pay that price for free fun. :)
1599218011|1.0|I'd like to start by saying that I find Kris Carr to be inspiring, empowering and amazing.  She has helped me in many ways on my journey with \\"incurable\\" cancer.  That said, I had to give this book a low rating because the dietary information is simply not accurate.  I learned the hard way that a vegetarian diet is not optimal or even safe for all of us.  Let me explain...<br /><br />Two years ago, in August of '09, I was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, incurable cancer of the bone marrow. I declined  conventional medicine and did the Gerson Therapy for two years. It involves 12 vegetable juices a day, coffee enemas and a fruit/vegetable vegan diet; no salt, limited spices, very strict.  After two years on the therapy, my disease was stable (it worsened the first few months and then held stable) and I was exhausted.  I couldn't figure out why I was so tired.  I had encouraged my friends to drink green juice and some of them experienced incredible energy highs; yet, I drank four green juices a day for two years and was exhausted.<br /><br />Since I didn't feel well and I hadn't improved, I switched to the Gonzalez protocol, another alternative cancer therapy that I read about in Suzanne Somers' Knockout book.  Dr. Gonzalez told me to eat red meat 4-5 times per week plus butter, eggs and dairy; all organic, of course. He prescribes a different diet for everyone based on genetics; some patients are on plant based, raw diets and others eat red meat three times a day. I happen to be in the middle of the vegetarian/carnivore spectrum so I eat a variety of plant and animal foods. Once I moved from a plant based diet to a diet that includes a lot of red meat and other animal products, my cancer began melting away. It is amazing and I am thrilled!  You can read about it at [...]<br /><br />Interestingly, I also learned from Dr. Gonzalez that not everyone should strive for alkalinity.  Most naturopaths believe that everyone should be alkaline; if that were correct, a diet of raw veggies will be optimal for all.  Dr. Gonzalez, however, believes that some of us are born too alkaline and need to eat acidic foods to balance us out.

B00002N9ER|5.0|These are great little brackets.  As long as you have them aligned properly, (thank you S. Pandya) they work great and are strong enough to hold my 6D cell mag. Also make sure you have a good surface to screw them into.  Mollys on sheetrock.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Pretty good audio pickup.  This is for a meeting, where previously the presenter wasn't heard clearly.  With this mic, that mission is accomplished.
B004XYF6US|4.0|I purchased this item because I thought there was more to the show, turns out it was canceled by season 2.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I was looking for a \\"parent cup holder\\" for my Britax B-Agile stroller.. the Britax one was $15 and from reading the reviews, I noticed alot of people weren't happy with it. So I went in search of a better one and saw that the \\"Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy\\" was really highly rated.  However, it was $12.95 PLUS $10 shipping! After some more searching, I found the \\"Diono Buggy Buddy Stroller Organizer\\" for $10 so I ordered it.  It's EXACTLY the same thing and it's been working great. It doesn't get in the way when folding the stroller which was a big plus and the cup holder's adjust to different cup sizes.  Even has a zippered pocket to keep my car keys close but safe.  Highly, highly recommend!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Beautiful blend of doubt, fear, grief, love, hope-- all in this carefully constructed science fiction-esque story that blends super-powers and time travel against a backdrop of war.
B005HG4C4C|1.0|In general, this is a very disappointing album. I was really excited when I heard of its production, from it i'd heard On the Backs of Angels and Breaking All Illusions (the only two tracks that make it listenable) and was impressed (totally amazed particularly by the second one). Unfortunately, the rest of the album is so boring it drives me to tears -  First, The sweeping dramatic violins and bawling choruses in nearly every song completely destroy their integrity, in a vain attempt to make each one sound like an epic in it self. This completely ruins the feel. Secondly, if you're tempted on buying it due to how frequently it's remarked as being so similiar to the untouchable Images and Words, STOP! It holds none of the same mystery and dazzling riffs that The Miracle and the Sleeper has (If you're expecting anything amazing like 4:16 - 4:41 in said track, think again) or the original, emotional soul of Wait for Sleep. Instead, it tries to repeat hamfistedly these themes and makes a shameful mockery of them. In one occassion it succeeds exceptionally, with Breaking All Illusions soaring above the rest of the albums repetative and predictable filler. The riffs are indeed reminiscent of an older and much loved Dream Theater, but this fantastic track is where the similarities of the early 90's ends. Instead what we find is horrible repetitiveness in Build Me Up Break Me Down and Bridges in the Sky, dragging the sound down to unremarkable metal (not to mention the cringeworthy introduction of the latter) to rambling slower peices such as This is the Life, easily the worst song on the album. The piano introduction is painfully simple to no obvious effect and the song is somehow both directionless and predictable, with vague Steve Harris-style lyrics (Don't get me wrong, Iron Maiden are a guilty pleasure but this is NOT what I expected from Dream Theater) that removes any semblance of prog these lads once had.  I could go on, but expect to be let down by an exceptionally mediocre release. If you liked the wacky synth runs of Octavarium and Learning to Live, you won't find them here. If you enjoyed the raw metal power of A Rite of Passage and The Test that Stumped Them All, you'll find them but dumbed down and boring. I adore this band, but they need to seriously shape up and pick a better direction to advance in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|decent games so far. some are pretty challenging but if you play long enough you'll end up getting the scores you need. for free, its worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|lots of fun. easy to use. only thing I don't like is that sometimes in the middle of a game a website will come up with adds. and u have to close out adds between each game. other than that I enjoy playing it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I'm doing my devotionals daily and I love how I can do several different ones each day and its so easy to look for certain scriptures!

B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's a Wonderful Life is a timeless classic. I had my 10 year old daughter watch it for the first time when she was home from school with a cold. It's now one of her favorites, and she's a big Harry Potter fan!  One thing I could say about the movie is that it will bring tears to your eyes. It has certain scenes, like when Mr. Gower slaps George in the ear because he thought George put poison in the bottle of prescription medicine. No matter how hard you try to hold back the tears, they come anyway. A great movie with a great message. A must-see movie for the holidays.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|perfect for work, study, and fun. helps me keep up with my creative thoughts in my busy world. don't know what I would do without it now
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Was looking for an inexpensive electronic replacement for the paperback version of the B & N classic 2 vol set.  Table of contents is formatted well.  This is complete in that it includes The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes which I believe is still under copywright. I haven't started reading this version yet but glancing through I didn't see any glaring typos.  Was a little doubtful when I read the reviews regarding A Study in Scarlet saying the second part was actually The Book of Mormon.  Actually the second part of ASiS is a flashback to 1847 Utah from the account of one of the characters and is integral to the story.  The lack of continuity is strange.  I can't believe I forgot this because it is one of the stories I've read.  At the sixth chapter of ASiS it reverts to \\"a continuation of the reminiscences of Dr. John Watson\\" I verified the story line from the Wikipedia entry for ASiS, So rest assured this does contain all of Arthur Conan Doyle's complete writings and looks to be well edited.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a fantastic Bible resource! Our entire church has been encouraged to use it and the reading plan to read through the Bible this year. Hundreds of us are doing it. The only negative is I have seen a number of typo errors such as repeated lines or two words together where there should be a space.
B00005JKNF|5.0|A collection of superb actors play a lifestyle as documentary, as a satire, and as a whodunnit from days long gone.    I enjoy watching it now and then as it isn't the trash that is designed to thrill the cynical audiences so common today.  Most viewers are probably not accustomed to thoughtful films these days nor have knowledge of the old customs of rich Brits.    There are surprises.  The music is subtle not overbearing.  Cinematography is very very good.  The price is excellent.  There is more than one plot line.  I love the old vehicles.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What can I say?  If you want a glimpse into places which you may never see in your lifetime, then this series is a must have!  Crisp definition in SD! Breathtaking views from diverse angles! Creatures and environs people only dream of seeing even once up close! The stoic British narrative which lends an authoritative quality to the stories told.  The cinematography, direction and editing are amazing, and well worth the price for this boxed set which was obviously made through much painstaking effort.  A great addition to your digital library!  Need I say more?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I actually love this game on my kindle fire works perfect and the adds I know are a must but they come up on a seperate screen so no pushing them while your playing and getting redirected. enjoy!!!!
0312370830|5.0|Sarah's Key is a historical fiction story written by Tatiana de Rosnay. The story takes place during the 1940's around the time when Jews were persecuted. The other half of the book takes place in the present day 21st century. In 1940's a terrible event occurred. Thousands of Jews that lived in France were rounded up and kept at the Velodrome d' Hiver.  Some of the families were sent to concentration camps such as Drancy or Auschwitz. Many French citizens aren't aware of the tragic event.  One of the Jewish families that were rounded up in the Vel'd'Hiv were the Starzynskis. Sarah, her mother and father were taken from their residence by force except her little brother Michel who was hidden in a secret cupboard. Years later on the 60th anniversary of the Vel'd'Hiv, Julia Jarmond discovers Sarah's tragic story.  As the police come to take away the Starzynskis, Sarah hides her brother believing that they would return shortly. Sadly, mistaken Sarah is wrong. Luckily, Sarah was able to escape the Vel'd'Hiv. After escaping the Vel'd'Hiv, she returns home to find her brother dead. She's all set to start a new life in America without anyone knowing her tragic story. Years later, Julia discovers her story and is set out to tell France about her story but stumbles through issues with her marriage throughout her way.   Sarah's Key was an amazing read. Throughout the book you can actually imagine what Sarah is currently struggling with when she was rounded up at the Vel'd'Hiv.  You also start to care for the characters and their well being. It was very difficult for me to stop reading, because it always left me in suspense after stopping.  Sarah's story is truly one-of-kind and tragic. This is truly a must read for anyone who is interested about the Holocaust. You'll never find another tragic story similar to Sarah's Key.
0393061310|2.0|Dr. Diamond certainly posits some tantalizing \\"answers\\" to the colonization era of Western civilization dominance which is a throwback to the genetic dominance arguments that were so prominent a century ago and produced such movements as Nazism. Dr. Diamond is professor of geography, so it should not be a surprise to the reader that geography features prominently in this book. To me, as someone who always viewed geography as a collection of facts not a discipline, this is the only real value in the book as I seriously question his conclusions based on fields outside his expertise.  I'll will do my best to review here, but honestly I couldn't finish the book. I just found the discussion more and more ludicrous with each page. A frustration that was reinforced by the fact Dr. Diamond provides no end notes for the curious reader to further investigate.  As mentioned, his most prominent theory is that of geography and how the Eurasian landmass is East-West while the African and North American/South American landmasses are North-South. North-South landmass orientations result in little plant and animal diversification due to variable climes while East-West result in large plant and animal diversification due to similar climes. He then goes on to cite the many different grains and animals that were domesticated by Eurasian peoples versus the limited choices available to African and American peoples.  But even this theory seems like an oversimplification of a much more complex problem. For example: if one looks at food production today, the top grain is not wheat, but maize, which he denounces as a poor crop due to the need for nixtamalization. However, the Three Sisters of squash, maize, and beans cultivated by native Americans demonstrates remarkable technological advancement. And let's not forget the all important potato and tomato to current food production. In contrast, the only real Eurasian grains of any importance in modern production are rice and wheat in that order. The rest barely make a dent. In fact, the only reason wheat is so successful today is the work of a single man by the name of Norman Borlaug in the 1950s and 60s. Prior to this, historically wheat was a very weak crop with a limited suitable growing area; wheat crops often failed and resulted in subsequent famines in places where there was an over-reliance. Dr. Diamond appears unaware of this.  The germs argument is certainly not original, and I think common knowledge to most enlightened individuals. But, while Dr. Diamond asserts that these germs somehow contributed to Western civilization dominance, I think it is more accurate to say: the combination of an over-reliance on a weak agricultural crop (wheat) and deadly communicable diseases resulting from domesticating cows, pigs, etc., actually made Western civilization a quite precarious existence which contributed to the cultural phenomenon of colonization. In other words, colonization was an attempt to diversify away from limited agricultural choices/regions. Seen in this light, Dr. Diamond's arguments are simply hogwash.  Many others besides myself have criticized Dr. Diamond's theories. But for me, the biggest criticism is simply the lack of additional reading, footnotes, end notes, references, bibliography, nothing! The reader has no choice but to take Dr. Diamond for his word regarding the many facts and figures he throws at you. The book I suppose is a good read for the casual reader who has occasionally wondered \\"what happened to the Aztecs?\\" But, beyond that level it is a bad read.  For that, I only give it 2 stars.

So he sent it back to me, Something about region 2  I'v never heard of this, anyway to send it back and pay for shipping it would'ent be worth the trouble.

B0054N73EY|4.0|I think it's very good. Different but still the RHCP. To me, the greatness of good bands lies on their ability to change from album to album, and still deliver great music, and that's what the RHCP have done for years. MAny people compare to Stadium Arcadium and CAlifornication, but those were really commercial albums and that's why so many people like them so much.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has taken the single most important event in his (our) lifetime and placed it at the center of this riveting book. To this, he has added the time-honored device used by other great writers -- time travel -- and asked one of the great \\"What Ifs\\" of all time:  What if you could go back and stop the assassination of our most beloved president, John F. Kennedy? Okay, you're right, there's nothing new here.  Stephen King has taken one from column A and one from column B to write a variation on the cliche: What If you could go back in time and kill Hitler?  In so doing, however, King hasn't merely reworked the Classic Question, he has written a classic book.   Jake is a high school English teacher.  Jake's friend Al tells him ([[ASIN:6305807086 Being John Malkovich]]?) that his storeroom is a doorway back to the year 1958. He enlists Jake's help to prevent the Kennedy assassination. Great beginning to a great story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like most of the games just hard to get coins but overall enjoy playing it it keeps me busy when I'm bored
B004EPYZUS|5.0|When I've told people that I wanted to see this, every single person gave me this weird look, making me say that I am in no way a fan of Tom Cruise, I like these movies because I like the TV series (except for M:I 2). Though the series is better (at least the first five seasons), this one was the best out of the four and I actually liked Tom Cruise in this one. While being the main star of the film, this one brings the team aspect to the forefront, which was never really shown in the previous ones (except M:I 3). Each member of the team is given something to do. The rest of the cast was great as well as the story. Out of the four, the plot of this film reminded me of the series the most; the way the team takes over the hotel by taking over the computer network, changing the floor numbers, etc. The action scenes were great, especially Tom Cruise scaling the building (is it always necessary for him to be climbing or dangling from something in these movies). And, as my title states, this felt more like a James Bond movie than Quantum of Solace (and to a lesser extent, Casino Royale). While the original Mission: Impossible series never featured as many gadgets as the movies have, I feel the films, more or less, still felt like the series (though making Jim Phelps a traitor in the first film is something I still didn't like). Though despite my dislike for Tom Cruise, I actually hope he's involved with a fifth Mission: Impossible. I also find it quite interesting how this fourth film in a franchise  has recieved very positive reviews when other fourth films usually show that the franchise is tired and boring (Jaws: The Revenge, Superman 4, Batman & Robin and Breaking Dawn).

193413712X|1.0|It took me more than a week to trudge through this under-200 paged novel. In the beginning, it reminded me a teensy bit of Cormac McCarthy's The Road. I loved The Road, so I was happy. Soon enough, I discovered that it was nothing like The Road, but still, it seemed decent enough. A few pages later, I realized I hated the book, but forced myself to finish it. A dying man, George is surrounded by his family, and in the few days before his death, he remembers random things from his past. His jobs, his dad and family, his passion about clocks and fixing them. I usually like lyrical prose, and I have no qualms about stories that aren't packed with action. However, I found it very very difficult to like Tinkers. It seemed to be like an assortment of beautiful sentences strung together, and that do not necessarily add anything to the story. The only thing I could visualize whilst reading was the caravan George's father had. That was it. I found the characters dull and boring, except for the hermit. Too bad he only had a few paragraph
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are lame, but there are some realy great games here. there are instructions for every game if you take the time to click on the ?

You do not have to be a baseball fan to appreciate it as my wife is not but she really enjoyed the movie.   Brad is amazing as Brad always is.  I am not sure why Philip Hoffman did the role.  He has very limited screen time and his character is very limited in range.  It does not take much to play the grumpy baseball manager.  I really like him as an actor and he does a fine job, I just felt his talent was a little wasted in this role.

0307474259|4.0|Wow!  What a fascinating book.  I couldn't put it down, and have been telling everyone about it.  I feel like I finally have \\"the answer.\\"<br /><br />I have two personal anecdotes that I'd like to tell about.  First, in 2010, I hired a personal trainer and went from being a person who wasn't sedentary, but did not have a regular exercise routine, to someone who was whipped into shape three times per week, for one hour personal training sessions.  I stayed at the gym after my session for another hour to do 40 minutes on the tread-climber, and then 20 minutes to cool down and stretch.  At the end of three months of this, I felt great, and looked much better.  However, I hadn't lost a single pound.  And, at the end of month two, when my personal trainer tested my percentage of body fat, it had somehow gone up!  I was furious.  I decided then and there that something was wrong, but had no idea what it could be.<br /><br />Then, last winter, I joined the new cocktail craze.  I hosted a big cocktail party just before Christmas, and for it I went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of just about everything.  At my cocktail party people drank mostly beer and wine, and so afterwards I had what amounted to a full bar left over.  I proceeded to fill the long evenings of a Montana winter by mixing cocktails.  I had a couple fun books, and tried a new cocktail three to four times per week.  I knew I was putting on weight during that time, but didn't get on the scale to see how much.  After about four months, I thought, alright, let's see what the damage is.  My jaw dropped to see the number, 20 pounds higher than the last time I'd weighed myself!  I had never gained so much, in such a short period of time.  What the heck happened?!<br /><br />I'm sure every single person, except those, perhaps, who are lean and stay lean without effort, will have episodes from their lives that were perplexing because they seemed to go against what we've all been taught, that are explained bythe information in this book.  I feel like now I have \\"the answer.\\"<br /><br />I just read it a couple days ago, but I do plan to adopt a low-carb lifestyle, once I have a plan.  That's why I gave this book four stars instead of five.  The, \\"And What to Do About It,\\" from the title left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Another thing, like a lot of people, I've tried an \\"Atkins\\" style diet here or there, two or three times, and had results.  However, I always felt guilty while I was on that plan, \\"Surely, this isn't good for me...bacon every day?\\"  And, I never looked at it as a permanent change.  After dropping 10 pounds for an upcoming vacation, going off the diet for the vacation, I came home to find that I'd gained it all back.  After reading this book, I understand why that happened, and maybe more importantly, why the diet works, and I can go ahead with the low-carb plan without feeling guilty about the bacon.<br /><br />Update: 1/20/12<br /><br />My husband read the book, too, and was just as blown away as I was.  He was about 3/4 of the way through it last Thursday afternoon when he said, \\"forget Monday, I want to start today!\\"  And so we did.  I lost 4.3 pounds in the first week.  Today is day one of week two.<br /><br />We cleared ALL the carbs out of our house.  Our big dining room table, and one of our kitchen counters were full of stuff from the pantry.  It kind of felt like handing out poison to all the friends and family members who took the stuff, though.  Cupboards nearly bare, we came up with a menu.  We're following the \\"new\\" Atkins plan, simply because it's so popular and so accessible.<br /><br />Let me put this in perspective:  I am an almost 33 year old woman who's put on about 50 pounds in the last 13 years.  I'm a foodie, I went to pastry school in Paris, I have invested thousands in specialty baking supplies, and thousands more in baking books.  To find out that I need to give up life as I've known it is HARSH.  I'm going through mourning...without craving sweets, if you can believe it (at least not this first week, anyway).<br /><br />Second Update: 9/20/12<br /><br />Well, here I am eight months later.  Over the first several weeks of eating low-carb, I continued to do research online.  Somehow, I stumbled across the Paleo Diet.  I checked out a couple books on the subject from the library, and after reading them, felt as if I'd found more of \\"The Answer.\\" My husband and I have adopted this diet, and have both been very successful with it.  I am now down 30 pounds, and my husband is down the 20 pounds he needed to lose.  I have about 20 more pounds to lose, and my goal is to do so by the end of the year, making 2012 \\"The Year Of Becoming The New Me.\\" We'll never go back to our old ways, and couldn't be happier with our new lifestyle.

B003L20IFQ|5.0|This is the kind of movie you will either love or hate. But the best ones always are. I really can't explain why without spoiling the entire film. If you're claustrophobic and hate suspense movies then don't watch this or you might start to feel like you're trapped in a box.  This film is like a showcase for Ryan Reynolds' acting abilities. He is the only visible actor in the film and is constantly on camera. It was impressive. You aren't just watching a movie, you're praying and hoping that someone comes to save him. It's important to make the audience care about a character and this one does.  I typically have trouble watching movies without getting distracted but I watched this (in my living room surrounded by distractions) without budging. It had a decent running time. I never felt \\"trapped\\" on my couch and I never had to wonder how much longer I had until the end.  To sum it all up. If you like movies like \\"phone booth\\" and \\"frozen\\" then you should see this. If you know that you hate movies like this then please don't.
0810993139|1.0|Just because 386 people gave it 5 stars doesn't mean it's quality.  It just means they liked it.  You need to know what you're looking for in a book.  High quality literature has the capacity to enrich and transform people's lives; that is why we there are books considered \\"timeless\\" and \\"classic.\\"  If children do not know how to appreciate good literature, it's because we're not teaching them well enough, not because we shouldn't expect them to appreciate it.  This is the junk food of books for children: immediately satisfying, yet in the end, a pollutant, causing distaste for that which helps them in the end. This is shallow, simple writing that actually discourages intellectual curiosity, and makes other books seem \\"boring.\\"  I wholeheartedly disagree with the statement that it turns \\"reluctant readers\\" into readers; the only thing it has done to my reluctant readers (I am a fifth grade teacher) is make them whine about reading anything else.  We need to be wise about our choices with what we \\"feed\\" our children's mind just as much as their bellies; both can either be fruitful and life-giving, or actually lower their quality of life.
0894803123|5.0|This is a fantastic book filled with all the best B&J flavors and some great ones I'd never seen before. And there's lots of interesting info about the company, how they got started etc.. as well.  You won't be disappointed in the book or the ice cream you make from it.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|The product came exactly as advertised and in perfect condition.  Had a great time watching on Christmas with the family !!!!
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the Dark Knight builds on the excellent work done in the Batman Begins soundtrack.  It has some unique sounds for a soundtrack that appealed to me.  The music that accompanies the Joker is particularly noteworthy throughout the film.  I have seen Dark Knight dozens of times now, and always enjoy this fantastic soundtrack.
B005D9B26E|4.0|The 5.1 portion of the audio dvd in my Quadrophenia box set only works in my Blu Ray player, I've tried it in four other dvd players, they'll play the stereo tracks but I get no sound whatsoever when I select the 5.1 mixes. Anyone else run into this? Other than that I have to say I wish the whole album was mixed in surround 'cause it sounds great!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|When I got my Kindle Fire, I knew immediately that I'd need some sort of cover to protect it against the normal wear and tear that can occur on a daily basis, but as the device itself is a little on the heavy side I really didn't want to add more weight than necessary. This folio from Marware is nearly perfect. It adds practically nothing to the profile or weight of the Kindle, it has a nice and sturdy feel to it and it has a very cool folding cover that can be used as a kickstand. Very happy with this purchase.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was a little worried reading some of the reviews in-dpeth, but this cover has turned out to be great! You snap the Fire right in, it's tight and secure, and the \\"kickstand\\" folding feature is awesome. The strap doubles as a nice hand hold when you're reading, and doesn't get in the way when not in use. Overall, I love it. It doesn't make the device seem bulky, as it fits snugly.<br /><br />As long as you're not looking for a battle-axe, end-times cover, I think this is a nice buy! I would totally reccomend to anyone.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I've tried out a few different covers and sleeves for my Kindle Keyboard over the last year and none have made me as happy as this one.  The Prologue holds it firmly in place and the cover lays perfectly flat when open.  I think Verso and Amazon should let consumers know that this cover works as well, if not better, for the Keyboard than for the Fire.  Plus it's so pretty and keeps my Kindle totally protected in my bag.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like puzzle games and play them often.  this one is relaxing, quiet, but also demands that you use your head.  like it but don't love it
140053271X|1.0|Terrible unit and customer service is even worse.  I received this new as a Christmas gift.Was defective right out of the box. Pages flicker and blank out randomly.Contacted B/N several times by email and was told this is normal. Called yesterday and spent 45 minutes on the phone trying to resolve the issue and get a refund.Was told they would not issue a refund even though the unit does not work properly. They did offer to send me a reconditioned one if I sent the defective one back at my exspense.  So if they have reconditioned ones on hand it makes sense that there are issues that they refuse to admit to.  So I receved a brand new defective unit and they will replace it with a used defective unit at my exspense.  With customer service like this it's no wonder so many of their brick and mortar stores are closing.  Guess I'm stuck with an exspensive paperweight as the company is not willing to resolve the issue.  To make matters worse , I bought a Kindle as a gift for the same person who bought this for me.  The Kindle works great and in my opinion is a far better device.  I plan to try once more by contacting them again and if I can return the unit I will put the money to good use and purchase a Kindle .I've been dealing with Amazon for around 10 yrs now and have never had an issue with any purchase or product.  Buyer beware.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun. some games take a few tries to get a hang of, but that's part of the challenge. there is a nice variety and range of games.
B002A97IJ0|1.0|Originally got some of these fans for my water loop. Was having a clearance issue with the standard size 120mm fans, so I thought maybe these 12mm's would help.  Having used Scythe products in the past, I figured this fan would be pretty decent for the money, but I was wrong. Altogether I got 4 of these fans, all of them perform exactly the same..  The spin fast, but don't offer reasonable CFM.  Save your money, and buy Delta fans!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I Love this Bible too bad you can't use it offline also! I can find scriptures easily and I can use a highlighter and note pad

B000054OTY|5.0|Excellent experience; Quick and easy transaction. Very fast shipping, the product was exactly what I expected. Highly Recommend this seller!
1609611543|5.0|I got this book at the recommendation of my niece.  I love wheat products and was a complete sceptic.  After one month of no wheat, I felt so much better. I am hooked for life. My joints do not ache, my hair seems thicker, and my weight is down.  I can live without wheat.
1596432594|4.0|Feynman tackled what may be the most complicated problem in all of science: explaining scientific concepts and principles to non-scientists. After reading this book, I would surmise that it was his engagement with his non-scientific side(s) that enabled him to succeed where others failed (or didn't even attempt to try). Ottaviani gives his typical great treatment to the non-fiction material, pacing the scenes so that the graphic medium elevates the story. Very pleased with the book, and highly recommended to geeks and non-geeks alike.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|250,000 points. for me Wooten Wooten lets go lets go lets go lets go lets go lets go lets go
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely love it.  The leather is soft and feels like a vintage book.  The inside protects the glass from scratches and the straps hold the kindle in snugly.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|What a richCOlor extravaganza.  The only thing that annoys me is the lack of ownership by the directors.  It seems they are camera shy or something. You never see them on ANY extras on any of their films.  Booooooo. Great movie.
B005J4TLO8|4.0|Okay, first of all this movie is a comedy. If you don't like comedies, then don't bother watching and PLEASE do not write a bad review on it just because you don't have a sense of humor. This movie is pretty much as funny as any other average comedy, but it has kind of a different plot for once. Jesse Eisenberg is a pizza boy who gets a bomb strapped to his chest by Danny Mcbride and Nick Swardson and is told he has to rob a bank in whatever amount of time or it will blow. He doesn't want to do this alone, so he gets his sidekick Aziz Ansari to help him out. It may not be a very memorable comedy, but it is definitely worth at least renting it just for some laughs. With a cast like this, it would be hard for it not to be funny.  I also reccomend these movies: Zombieland, Old School, Pineapple Express, Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanomo Bay
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! it is super addicting and a great time waster! so glad I got it(: Great for all.ages too.

B005NNV4TU|3.0|Nostalgia is a funny thing isn't it? When you look back on Pink Floyd's career, you can possibly think about some of the best times of your life. Whether it be going to your favorite dining area and hearing Dark Side of the Moon in the backdrop, or watching \\"The Wall\\", Pink Floyd have undoubtedly created some special and personal moments in history.  I must say however, as much as a failure as I thought this was going to be, after considering their changeup in AMLOR, The Division Bell came off as yet another huge change. The jazz influences for this album have taken a much larger spotlight than before. Songs like \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\" really portray this aspect. But the whole Pink Floyd aspect is kept well in songs like \\"What Do You Want from Me\\" or \\"Marooned\\". This album shines in a lot of areas that I suspected of failure before my first listen. After my second and even third listen, this album continues to grow on me every time. The few areas this album fails are pretty huge, but they're mostly the loss of the old school influences Pink Floyd. Being a Floyd man, I know what exactly is going to leave a mark in the musical industry. This album fails to do that, as good as it is it isn't truly Pink Floyd like we've all grown to know and love.
B00008O31H|4.0|Fast becoming my favorite album of theirs. It's got the best artwork, the best title, and the music is....damn good.<br /><br />I pretty much enjoy it front to back, but the title track is a killer opener, and Have Love Will Travel rocks as well. My personal highlight is Everywhere I Go. That's one of those songs worth the cost of the whole album. It just drones and grinds on for over 5 minutes. Very kick ass.<br /><br />I suggest grabbing thickfreakness, your smokes and leather jacket, and hitting the road in your old muscle car...or mini-van.
B000PHX4VA|4.0|I bought the CD for my 14 year old son.  He's very happy with the quality of the sound. The only problem is that the CD case was broken when he opened it. Not a big deal as he immediately downloaded the cd to our computer and put it on his IPod. I was more disappointed than he was about the broken case.
B000062XGD|1.0|Too many improbable situations:   1) I could see someone surviving a smaller plane or corporate-type jet crash but not one with a large jet like that. First, the loss of cabin pressure would most likely have asphyxiated the people inside not to mention the final impact would have been too great for there to be any survivors. The forces alone would have made it impossible for him to hang on as he did in several of those scenes.   2) To say they searched for him for weeks. (See above.)   3) To think they could have located the island after he was rescued when there are so many hundreds of minute islands dotting the oceans.   4) When he arrived at the island there were no birds or animals anywhere and then as the movie progresses he finds only fish and crab?? Is that possible or probable? I don't know.   5) To have a little girl that age, his girlfriend would have had to marry almost right away. Those pictures made her look 3 or 4 years old.   6) No one was thronging him; no reporters following him immediately after he gets back. No way! Good Morning America would have wanted him on the show the very next day.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is really an awesome tool.  It provides remote control to and from any computer.  There is an app for your smartphone too for remote control to your computers.  It is very secure using Secure web site (like online ordering) and 256 bit AES encryption.  There is also the ability to do online presentations with up to 25 people.  And it is all for free!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is a must have for any Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman fan!  It includes all 6 seasons totaling 42 discs.  It also includes two of the movies.  It has many bonus features & a nice summary of every episode.  There's even an A-Z index episode guide.  I purchased this on sale & with free shipping.  It is completely worth full price & shipping.  I would've gladly paid the regular price for it!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using LastPass for over a year on my computers, both Windows and Linux.  This password management tool works flawlessly.  Since getting a Motorola Droid X I decided to try LastPass premium so I could have this tool on the smartphone too.  It works great there and now on my Kindle Fire too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definetly something useful to kill time.  I would recommend this if you have time to waste.  just make sure you read the instructions or it might take a few tries to figure out the rules.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many great games for FREE! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge! I have this game my kindle fire and my ipod! I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
B000VDDDY6|4.0|My friend really enjoyed his gift. Even though the shows were remastered, they kept the series original as seen in the 60's. Will be buying seasons 2 & 3 in the future!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so addicting. All I've been doing is trying to beat all the games to get more games!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My 14 year old daughter has been a big fan of the books as well as the movies.  This was a great gift for her.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games could be a little more involved but over all its not a bad way to past the time. get it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great version. Easy to play. Graphics aren't amazing, but they'll do. This version is not customizable, but it should be!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was my first time to play Angry Birds and I don't think I could have had a better first impression!  Because of this, I will purchase every Angry Birds game I can get my hands on!  Now I see what all the 'fuss' is about!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great. If you are having issues connecting to a machine using 3G, try using their gmail sign in solution. The user interface is really intuitive, and fast. The only way they could make this better would be to use some kind of keycode authorization system to make it easier to connect to a new machine without using your gmail credentials. (Helping a family member, for instance) This app works better than anticipated, and you can't beat the price.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is ok until the last 2 or 3 plates then takes to long I guess it was worth it :/
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love that you can do seperate volumes when listening to mulitple sounds.  Thanks to the devolpers for fixing that problem.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app isintertaink.g but some of thegamez are difficult and frustrating. overall. it is a good game. I was very intrigue d and I can not wait to open the last few games waiting forms.  Being fun and relatively easy I recommend this app to people of most ages.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun way to pass the time. I like unlocking other mini games and you can't complain about free!! Reminds me of Warioware for the DS.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I think it is useful for everyone who have to go to many places an d forget closing computer at home or want to use some files immediately. Just use this app. to control your com. Easy and comfortable. I love it. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The part where you don't have to buy another game for a while is true if you have this app. A great app for when your bored.You should buy it because I think its a lot better than most free apps.Some games included are Pigeon Bomber, Serpent, and Urban Skydiver
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there is a great variety of games. not to easy or to hard. never gets boring! get a lot of chances yo try and beat the different games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great time killer.  I really enjoyed it, and the wide variety of games.  I highly recommend it for everyone.
B00005UO5Z|3.0|Very disappointed that this was a Region 2 dvd.  Now I have to return it.  Sender was prompt and packaging was good however.
0553386794|5.0|My brother got me hooked on this series. I read Game of Thrones to about page 100 before watching the HBO series on demand. It was fun reading the book, then watching the show with my husband. I also had good conversations with my brother about the plots, characters, etc. We are both on Book 4 now (A Feast for Crows), and we are enjoying it (mostly...we aren't too keen on reading about Cersei, but hey...take the good with the bad!).<br /><br />I read some of the other reviews complaining about the graphic content in this book. Yes, it's graphic. Yes, it's disturbing and downright sickening in some parts. I suggest becoming more familiar with the history of the War of the Roses, and get to know some of the horrific things that happened during certain parts of world history before spending time on this series. If you don't care to read about such events, don't buy the book. I love analyzing characters, motives, plots, and schemes, so I love this series in spite of the graphic content. I enjoy solving the \\"mysteries,\\" and learning if my theories were correct.<br /><br />In short, if graphic content does not appeal to you, this may not be your cup of tea. I love the character development and the plots, though!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I want to say right off, I do not know this author and I am posting this review because I bought her book, and loved it, and she deserves it.  I first downloaded the sample chapter of Slammed, to see if it was something I would want to read. It was. I had to buy the book! This story drew me in right from the start. I cared about the characters and cried and laughed with them. I had never heard of slam poetry or the Avett Brothers, and now find I am interested in both. Thank you Colleen!   I like the way she brought the subject of death into a story that didn't make it a depressing read. By the way, I am not a young reader, so at my age, the subject of death is a very real part of life. She tied life and death together in such a way that this story made me see my own life in a different way. In fact after reading the whole book last night, late into the night (I could not put it down!), I could not sleep thinking about how to make some changes in my own life. Novels don't usually do that for me, they are entertainment. This book is different, though, I can't put my finger on why.   The slam poetry is a subject I will be researching myself. Though I wouldn't be going to a club like Lake and Will did. But I do write some poetry and this is a different form than what I am familiar with. It delivers a message and I liked that.   I am giving her five stars because her writing was excellent. Maybe it is her first book, but she definitely has a gift. I will buy her future books, and am hoping she will write more about these characters.   I know many people mentioned this book is for young adults, well I am certainly not a young adult, an older one in fact, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it appeals to all ages, so don't let that stand in your way of buying Slammed. Enjoy it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was very doubtful that the games on the app would be fun but they turned out to be captivating! I found myself playing over and over trying to top my highscores. I would recommend this app to those who have a lot of free time! lol
B003BWERF8|1.0|Bought this item so that I could use my BOSE Soundlink speaker with my iPod Nano (which is not Bluetooth enabled).  Unfortunately, it was very hit and miss as to whether it would work or not.  I know it is not my BOSE speaker that is the problem because that works 100% of the time with my daughter's Bluetooth enabled iPod Touch.  Sometimes it worked just great with my Nano and other times I couldn't get anything to happen.  Tried customer support for this product and they were prompt with responses which was great, unfortunately none of the fixes helped.  It could be that I got a defective one- it happens.  Not sure if I will try another of the same or a different brand.
B006QPVH6O|2.0|Great premise for a movie, that never got any traction. Too jumpy to let a story develop, so the \\"footage\\" style never hit home. I'm a big sci-fi fan, but this?...pass
0451232577|4.0|Once again, Ken Follett manages to turn miles of historic details into a highly readable, engaging novel.  The amount of reseach is testamony to the author's desire to ensure an accurate but human accounting of the political backdrop to the underpinnings of the monumental First World War.  As with all of Ken Follett's writing, the characters are very well drawn and the reader becomes involved with each one. That fact enables the reader to stick with a very long book.  One cannot be in a hurry when reading this or else a great deal will be lost. Savor it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I'm beyond puzzled by the reviewers who complain that this case doesn't fit the Kindle Fire, because I just got it and mine fits perfectly.  Those straps are snug and the fire doesn't move around no matter how vigorously I shake this case (yep, I bought the extra protection plan so I could do stupid things like that) and yet I did NOT feel like I was going to break the straps getting it in there.  The elastic is very strong and clearly made to last.  I've even taken it out and made sure that I could put it back in just as easily - no problems.  My kindle now looks like a journal, which is just lovely.  The product images are actually pretty true to life in terms of color.  Another reviewer complained of an odor, but that's what we call \\"new product smell\\" and it fades quickly - even my kindle smelled funny and plastic-y at first, but that fades as a newly manufactured item off-gasses.  Quality is excellent, very sturdy without being ridiculously heavy - my Fire is save and snug.  I did worry a bit before it arrived because several reviewers complained that the cover doesn't close once the kindle is in, or that there's a weird magnet that doesn't attach to anything.  Let me enlighten both the previous reviewers and potential buyers now: there are two pieces of cardboard in the case when it arrives, and these must be REMOVED before you use it.  They are covered with advertisements for other products, as well as proclaiming the wonders of this item.  They both include magnets, to keep the empty cover closed for display purposes (these were shipped to stores, not just sold on amazon)and if you don't remove them then you'll have a difficult time using the cover.  I don't think this can be considered a point against the product, since \\"remove all packaging\\" is really the first step in using ANY product, right?  A wonderful cover, and I fully recommend it to a new Kindle Fire owner!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so many games to choose from I love it!!!!!!! I really reccomend it and its free which is not even the best part the best part is playing the game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok, a little slow but good. load speed could be better. good games for kids to play. four star review
B0051GOB26|5.0|Everything about this transaction was GREAT!  And, at the risk of repeating myself, the whole thing went very well, except for this reviewing process, which is too time consuming!!
B005636EA6|5.0|Great digital download and using amazon player it downloaded it to my computer and put it directly into iTunes at a fraction of the cost.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great way to spend a few hours. OK I admit that I am addicted to this game. The puzzles are challenging but solveable. Haven't yet finished all of the levels, so, gotta get back to the game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|at first I thought it'd be stupid but after I played a couple of the games it was actually really entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this app but i wish that the descriptions of the games were a little more elaborate. a few are pretty minimal.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hour and hours of fun never get bored always a different game to play my kids really enjoy all the games also.
0307277887|3.0|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is a good book, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody looking for a quick, fun read, but the plain and simple truth is Dexter just tends to work better in a more serialized setting (no pun intended, I guess). It's not so much that the show and book are totally different plot-wise, many of the major events of the book are also turning points in the first season of the show, it's more that Lindsay does not afford himself a lot of time to develop much outside of Dexter and his relationships with Deb, Rita, and, believe it or not, Laguerta. It's almost like a bickering that Dexter constantly has with himself. It'd be annoying if he wasn't so fun to read. Dexter is much more sarcastic here, poking fun at us \\"feeling\\" humans on a regular basis and talking about how easy it is to fake our emotions. To that extent the book can take on a comical tone that, at least as of late, avoids the slap-stick and cringe-worthy antics that certain characters (namely Angel and Quinn) get into on the show. Anyway, the ending does seem kind of quick. It honestly feels one chapter short of being 100% complete. That's it, just one chapter. The epilogue answers a few questions but leaves a lot more nebulous. For example, what happened to Brian? How did Dexter get out of his sticky situation on the right side of the law? What about Deb? I suppose some, if not all, of those questions will be answered in the next book, which I do intend to read.   In the end, time is a very key factor here. Anybody who watched the show first will find there is a lot left to be desired in terms of characterization and sub-plots, but it's a strange situation. The show had more time to expand and develop, whereas Lindsay's book (which, to its credit, came out first) gives you a slightly different, less stone-faced Dexter. The show is, for all intents and purposes, a longer second draft. All in all, I like the show better, but no Dexter fan should go without reading the spark that started the fire.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|*SEVERE SPOILERS*<br /><br />In short, I have never felt so let down by a book before in my life. And it's such a shame because the author so beautifully built up the conflict and could not execute it properly in the last 20% of the book. It's as if she built this amazing house of cards - primed for it all to come tumbling down, thematically and plot-wise - but then decided to leave it standing and build another semi-related house of cards instead.<br /><br />I'm reading Mockingjay last night. I'm up to 72 or 73% on it in my Kindle. I'm loving it. It's even a candidate for one of my favorite books ever. Katniss is on a mission to assassinate President Snow. She's running through the city, tacklings all sorts of obstacles. I'm deeply, emotionally invested in the story, especially in the dynamic between Peeta and her - in the sense that I found his memory loss/transformation to be incredibly heart-breaking and a wonderfully effective plot device. So I'm expecting - HOPING - that Katniss will run up like a bad ass, infiltrate the mansion like a bad ass, have a heart-to-heart with President Snow like a bad ass, who will give Katniss some sort of antidote that will heal Peeta's condition. In exchange, he will ask for immunity, to allow the Capitol to remain in power, but under far more equal and peaceful terms. Katniss will refuse, take the antidote anyway, kill Snow, restore Peeta, save the world, make the choice between Peeta and Gale, and reconcile all the leftover plot points that were left dangling - and beautifully built up by the author.<br /><br />So imagine my shock when, out of nowhere, bombs start falling on a bunch of kids for no reason. And then they kill Prim. For no reason. Turns it's a plot twist. For no reason. Turns out Coin is the bad (?) guy. For no reason. Then Katniss not only doesn't kill Snow, she doesn't get to play an active part in restoring Peeta. His recovery is attributed to \\"time,\\" which is bs. Gale is suddenly out of picture for convenience sake. In short, nothing gets resolved except fo the conflict between the Capitol and the Districts. And we don't even get to see that! As was the case in the last book, all the reading we as the audience did between the bombing of District 8 until the bombs fall was completely useless. It was fantastically built up, but never fully realized.<br /><br />I feel this book - and the last one, which suffered from the same problems, in my opinion - should have been from Plutarch's perspective. Katniss did not play an active or important enough role in this book to warrant it being from her perspective in the slightist. In both books, she was a passive observer and not an active participant in the world. None of the conflicts are really addressed beyond convenient paragraphs and summaries, and all of these conflicts really deserved full chapters of devotion. Katniss' active redemption of Peeta (and herself, for that matter) - which should have occurred as a direct result of the same actions that would have saved the world - would have been so cathartic and so wonderful if it had been pulled off properly.<br /><br />Katniss and Gale could have worked out their differences. Haymitch could have at least stopped drinking. Something! One character needed to grow and become better as a result of this story. It's certainly possible - and I think very likely - that the author wanted to make a thematic statement and perhaps throw in some social criticism. However, this theme of \\"war in general sucks\\" is never seriously thrown into the theme until the last 10% of the book, which ends up dictating the entire resolution - or lack thereof - in the end of the book. This thematic device therefore came off rather poorly in my opinion. I think this book suffered from what the other books had; I personally felt each of the books could have used one or two more drafts because it all felt disjointed, overly-convenient in terms of plotting, and Katniss' role was far too passive and useless.<br /><br />So I'm left at the end of the book, my veins throbbing in my head, and my hands outstretched, palms up, over my shoulders in an eternal shrug, with my mouth agape, as I try to figure out what the heck the author was thinking when she figuratively derailed every plot point, every character, every tendril of good plotting she had built up for over 200 pages (over 600 if you include the previous books).<br /><br />I will say, in compliment to this book, that the annoying tell-and-don't-show style of writing that was very prevalent in the first two books (and almost caused me to stop reading the second book), is significantly decreased in this one. So I think the writing itself is actually better in this book. Or perhaps I got used to these things and dismissed them as a stylistic thing.<br /><br />I give this book 3 stars for the still-awesome world the author created, and the plot she built up. But in my opinion, a few more drafts were necessary to really figure out how to resolve those plot points, which in my opinion, were completely derailed and almost disregarded by the end of this book.hrobbing in my head, and my hands outstretched, palms up, over my shoulders in an eternal shrug, with my mouth agape, as I try to figure out what the heck the author was thinking when she figuratively derailed every plot point, every character, every tendril of good plotting she had built up for over 200 pages (over 600 if you include the previous books).

0439023491|2.0|*SO MANY SPOILERS*<br /><br />I had a few issues with Catching Fire. I found the writing style annoying, I liked the plot until the Quarter Quell happened, and I felt Katniss played an passive, unimportant role in the plot that rendered almost every chapter useless.<br /><br />My biggest problem with Catching Fire was probably the writing itself. I chalked it up to a stylistic approach - an implemented style of writing meant to be consistent throughout the entire trilogy - however, it never ceased to annoy me. I'm more a fan of subtlety and attempting to understand the characters myself. The writing style doesn't allow this to happen; instead we are told, in excruciating detail actually, Katniss' every thought and every motive. I understand this is a first person narrative, but if the reader is allowed to slowly build up an image of another character, by movements, subtle reactions to situation, we feel we get to understand that character a little bit better. Instead, I ended up not understanding most of the characters due to the writing style because everything was spelled out so blatantly. Again, it's a stylistic thing, but the constant \\"now I'm going to explain everything to you about the characters\\" style of writing to be annoying and ultimately counterintuitive.<br /><br />Secondly, the plot felt rehashed once the Quarter Quell came into the fray. Up until the point, I felt the plot was being very well established. Katniss and Peeta were to go around the Districts and quell (see what I did there?) any sort of rebellion. However, this entire plot - which the author builds up quite nicely - is tossed out the window for the Quarter Quell. Here's what should have happened as a result of that:<br /><br />The tributes should have banded together against the Capitol and refused to kill each other. They should have hatched an escape plan from the beginning - in which Katniss should have played an ACTIVE role instead of what we got - The Capitol should have responded by trying to kill every single one of them using the arena. The tributes then try to escape the arena using the same strategy in the book. They then go out and foment the rebellions in their own individual districts and start individual uprisings.<br /><br />This is what I expected to happen and what I thought would make for some amazing reading.<br /><br />However, what we end up with is an ultimately useless rehashing of the first book. Because of Haymitch's escape plan, every single chapter within the arena is made useless. Katniss is suddenly no longer and active participant in the world events and is now a passive observer, just trying to survive. From a plot stand point, this might work, but from a reading and writing standpoint, I ended up feeling betrayed. Like I had followed this plot for 300 pages only to have every single plot point not matter because of external forces. So, instead we are forced to read about the same processes from the first book - the chariot rides, the make up, the interviews, the false lover plot used to string along sponsors, the actual games. It honestly felt tedious to me.<br /><br />Finally, we never get to see the important events that shape the characters and the world. We never really get to see Katniss' confrontation with Gale about the events of the first book, we never get to see Haymitch create the plan with Plutarch, and we don't even really get to see much of the break out or the events that lead up to the last book. It's all basically chalked up to summaries that instead needed whole chapters of SEEING the events instead of being told about them.<br /><br />This is why I believe this book should have either been rewritten into a book with an active character (who wants to read about a passive observer of the world around her?), or from Haymitch's or Plutarch's perspective. Then we would have seen the planning, the logistics, the obstacles that would have arisen as a result of fomenting a rebellion against the capitol. Instead we see a rehash of the first book.<br /><br />I give this book 2 stars because of the basic plot points (the Peeta-Gale-Katniss love triangle which, if done right - I'm shaking my head at you, Twilight - makes for really compelling reading; the Capitol vs. Districts central conflict) and because of the setting. I found the setting, which was really established in the first book, to be fascinating enough to be built upon in the second book. And it was. And I felt the continuation of these plot points were the only real redeeming qualities of this book.<br /><br />In short, I felt the plot went in the wrong direction, which caused for Katniss to become a passive observer in the world instead of an active participant, which made the majority of the book feel useless to me. Nothing but respect for the author and the books, but I found myself feeling very frustrated and let down by the end that I almost didn't read Mockingjay, which I found equally as frustrating and a let down.tead we see a rehash of the first book.<br /><br />I give this book 2 stars because of the basic plot points (the Peeta-Gale-Katniss love triangle which, if done right - I'm shaking my head at you, Twilight - makes for really compelling reading; the Capitol vs. Districts central conflict) and because of the setting.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I was reluctant at first but WOW what a system! I purchased the G155 because I travel alot and am always on the go. I thought it would be a bit large and clumsy However; that was not the case at all. This system really pulls you into the game ( even though the screen is only 15+ inches, you'd never know it ). Solid material, tightly packed, sturdy case, easy to connect console to, easy to use wireless or plugged in headset and easy to use all around. You don't feel like your playing on a small screen. The speakers sound great for this type of unit. If you use a headset, then power it up. My Astro-40 wireless headset almost blew my ears out when connected. Love this portable gaming unit but wish there were a little more room to pack things. The xbox 360 does not fit perfectly on the mat included but it gets the job done. Once closed and locked it packs in nicely but there is no room for other accessories. A+ well Done!

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|In this futuristic retelling of Cinderella, we follow the story of Cinder. Cinder is a mechanic, but more importantly; she's a cyborg. Half -human, half-machine. After a tragic accident when she was 11 years old (one she doesn't even have memories of), she was repaired by surgeons and made cyborg.<br /><br />In this dystopian future, cyborgs are treated as less than people. They are treated virtually as slaves and viewed as inferior. Such is the case with Cinder. She has no parents, and was taken into the care of a man who died shortly after bringing her to New Beijing - leaving her with her wicked stepmother and stepsister. Adri, and Pearl. There is one bright spot in their home though - and that is stepsister number two; Peony.<br /><br />One day while working her mechanic stall at the local market, THE Prince Kai of New Beijing shows up requesting her help with an android. Cinder is dumbstruck! Not only is he there at her booth (incognito, of course!), but he is as charming as can be. After Cinder is done falling all over herself in awe, and plans are made to fix the royal android - the prince takes his leave, but then Cinder hears a scream. A scream that Cinder quickly realizes means something very bad.<br /><br />Someone at the market has the plague, also known as Letumosis. A disease with no cure, that kills the host in four stages. It's sweeping through not only New Beijing, but all of Earth.<br /><br />Then, the worst happens. The plague hits home. Cinder is out at the junkyard searching for parts with her beloved stepsister Peony, when she sees a dark spot on Peony's skin. A dark spot that can only be the plague. Cinder has no choice but to call quarantine. She then watches as her poor sister is carted away, and is left feeling that Peony catching the plague can only be her fault.<br /><br />Cinder's horrid stepmother agrees. Since Cinder is her \\"property\\", she volunteers her for plague research. Cinder is taken away to take part in research that's killed every cyborg ever to be used in it.<br /><br />In the meantime, all of the commonwealth is readying themselves for the ball and the coronation of the prince. Cinder never truly thought she would go to the ball, but it seems that even the tiny flame of hope she had left has just been doused. Cinder didn't think her \\"life\\" could get any worse, but long-held secrets are about to be revealed, and Cinder will find out she isn't just a cyborg, but something much, much worse.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />I had a love-hate relationship with Cinder. I always love futuristic ideas - androids, cyborgs, hovercars, dystopia, etc. I just love all of that being put together here. I think the world-building was done really well. A clear, crisp landscape was created for this story. A+ on that aspect.<br /><br />Character building, however, was not so great. We know next to nothing about Cinder, Prince Kai, or the supporting characters. Now, Cinder doesn't have memory of her life before age 11, when she became cyborg - but still, the development of her personality and experience living in New Beijing could have been shown a bit more. Same goes for Prince Kai! We know he has a temper problem, but at the same time he's a doormat. His royal adviser treats him like a little kid all through the book and he lets him do it. I hated that. I kept waiting for him to put the guy in his place, but it never came! That one little thing made Kai less of a hero to me. *shrug* Aside from that, I really don't feel I know anything at all about Kai. Charming, sure - handsome, yeah. What else though?<br /><br />I do have to say that the descriptions of Cinder's machine aspects was so fun! I liked the way her \\"brain\\" (interface) would tell her things. Like if her body temperature was getting too high, if she had too much adrenaline going through her, and best of all - if someone was telling her a lie. Very neat. :)<br /><br />The romance was subtle, and I felt like it was realistic enough, but still had a magical aspect to it. The intense moments between Kai and Cinder were really fantastic. A+ there!<br /><br />I didn't like the way we were left with a big, fat question mark on the outcome of the \\"relationship\\" though. Not only that, though - almost everything just dropped off! A cliffhanger is one thing, but this book just completely left you going \\"OH MY GOSH, WHAT HAPPENED?!\\" - and NOT in the good way. Sadly, I am more angry than anxious for the second installment. I feel that the author could have written the ending a little differently. It was like going to a commercial break during a TV show. Something else needs to happen to wrap up the episode, ya know? It needs something more to leave you satisfied!<br /><br />Overall, I did like this book. I plan on reading the next installment when it's released. I teetered between 3 stars and 3.5 stars. I decided on the rating I did because this was a very fun book. I think it was a great beginning of a retelling, but since it's first in a series... you don't get to see if the retelling aspect continues to be good until you get to read the rest of the installments. I almost think this book should have been a stand-alone novel. There are many different ways for the plot to take though, as there is a lot more going on than just Cinder and her could-be love with the prince. LOTS! I'd recommend it to people who enjoy futuristic and dystopian novels, but aren't too picky about details, because if you are nit-picky, you will just be angry after reading this book.e the way we were left with a big, fat question mark on the outcome of the \\"relationship\\" though.

B0053JJLLC|1.0|I grew up reading Michael Crichton - I read Jurassic Park in the third grade, brushed up on all of his preceding work, and was quick to snatch up any following new work as it was released.<br /><br />Crichton has the uncanny ability to take a scientific line of inquiry - no matter how far on the fringe it is - and deliver it with such technological knowledgeability that I was willing to accept something that, in synopsis, may seem entirely implausible. Each book is littered with data, charts, numbers that give the impression that the possibilities are real - that infectious agents from space could wipe out civilization ([[ASIN:006170315X The Andromeda Strain]]), that extinct creatures could be recreated from recombinant DNA ([[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]]), that time-travel is possible utilizing the multiplicity of quantum mechanics ([[ASIN:0345468260 Timeline]]). Despite having read his books years ago, I can remember the technological / scientific basis for each and every story.<br /><br />Micro is quite simply not a finished work. The thought that kept reoccurring as I was reading this was how unrefined the story was, how undeveloped the characters are (before the beginning of the story, there is a list of characters with brief descriptions - all are two-dimensional and do not progress any further beyond those descriptions), and how passingly the scientific premise of the story is presented. We, the reader, are essentially told that the technology to shrink things exists (something with magnetic waves - my inability to remember this despite having just finished the novel is telling). ZAP! Our ragtag group of characters are shrunk and the adventure is off. While I can't deny there is something very intriguing about the descriptions of life at such a small scale (and there are some scenes that seem like Crichton may have developed further), the entire premise of this book feels more like a Saturday morning cartoon that a gripping piece of adult fiction. Even the bad guy is comically ridiculous - Crichton's initial character sketch probably read \\"evil corporate businessman - no ethics, all ego\\" and, again, he remains a cartoon villain from his introduction to his expected death by the technology he was abusing. The story has a very unbalanced feel - with most of the weight going to character drama (love, death, and the anxieties that lie between), and the descriptions of the micro world interspersed in-between. The problem here is that, I had no attachment to any of the characters, who were frankly a bore in their personality and motivations. My interested pique when they met their miniature deaths, but I didn't miss anyone after their departure. The more vivd scenes of the micro-world show the potential for what the novel could have been, and as I mentioned before, seem to be the few moments that approach something I would expect from a Crichton novel.<br /><br />My understanding is that Crichton only finished about a third of the novel before his death. While I am not a writer, I would make the assumption that he had merely completed the roughest of drafts - outlining the beginnings of a story without having done any editing or research into the scientific basis of the shrinking technology. Preston (whose novel, [[ASIN:0385495226 The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story]], I absolutely loved) seems to have left Crichton's rough first draft intact and finished the story while failing to do any editing of research to make the shrinking technology seem a fully relevant part of the story, let alone something plausible.<br /><br />If you are a Crichton fan like me, you probably won't be able to resist reading this (if you haven't already) - just don't expect it to meet the caliber of his earlier works.<br /><br />If you are looking to get into Crichton - pick some of his earlier works because this doesn't do justice to his legacy as an author.y ridiculous - Crichton's initial character sketch probably read \\"evil corporate businessman - no ethics, all ego\\" and, again, he remains a cartoon villain from his introduction to his expected death by the technology he was abusing.

B0067AC5KA|1.0|I'm all for rewarding creative effort but these authors need to break their ties with the publishing houses when it comes to digital publishing...guess I'll wait for the paperback or hit the used book store for $1.99 and no cut to the author...sigh!
0446547654|2.0|I've read many of Nicholas Sparks' books and often buy them. But this time I chose to check The Best of Me out of the library and was VERY glad I did not buy it.   The novel drips with predictability and I'm honestly not sure why I followed through with the story since I had it figured out so early. Granted, many of his novels are predictable but since this one so clearly drew on storylines of other novels I grew frustrated and bored. The Best of Me did not add anything new to Sparks' collection of the different ways in which love expresses itself/plays out. The sacrificial Dawson is pretty much John from \\"Dear John.\\" There's a ghost guiding the action, AKA \\"Safe Haven\\" or \\"True Believer.\\" (Speaking of the ghost thing...I hope this isn't becoming Spark's new trademark thing). I could go on with the examples.   Mostly I enjoy Sparks, even if I find him predictable. However, his story lines are becoming SO predictable that I do not want to read the next thing he comes out with. I wish Sparks would come up with a better way of dealing with difficult situations in his novels other than killing off characters. (Clayton in The Lucky One...the dad in The Last Song, the man in The Guardian).
0142418471|4.0|So far, this is the third book I've read by John Green and my first by David Levithan. I had mixed feelings about this book. Through the actual reading process, I loved both Wills but then I didn't. As usual these characters are realistically crafted and easy to relate to. There were times throughout the story that I felt myself nodding in sympathy or feeling vindictive hatred for the unfortunately dead-on portrayal of selfishness and angst that's common in most high school teenagers. What I love about these characters is that they are individuals who learn life lessons and cry and hope and dissect situations to ridiculous extremes and hold grudges and appreciate love and friendship. This is the kind of book that reminds you what a coming of age tale is supposed to be.<br />But then there were the times when I felt like giving up. I don't get why his is written in all lower case letters, something that actually bugged me quite a bit. \\"will\\" was the MOST stereotypical emo character I have ever read. Every clich&eacute; \\"emo kid\\" idea you could come up with is thrown in his chapters. And I do have a few emo friends, even they do not whine as much as this guy!<br />However, I trusted John Green as a writer so I continued to read on. After several chapter, there is a clear shift in \\"will's\\" character and then the novel became quite enjoyable. John Green never fails to present a wonderful character who is full and enjoyable.<br />All in all, this was a pretty great novel. It's not long before you are pulled into the world of the Will Graysons. You will laugh, cry, have hopes and enjoy the time you spend reading this novel.

0439023513|1.0|This book is a significant change from the previous two, which were pretty good, if a bit low on character development and in great need of a good editor. Many people have commented in depth on the one-dimensional characters, the extensive use of short-cuts by having Katniss told about what happened while she was unconscious or doped up, and how selfish and pathetic Katniss was most of the time.  My main issues:  Why is Katniss so shell-shocked at this point, when she destroyed the 2nd arena and was rescued? It was a success, and they won the game by destroying it instead of being puppets.   Why doesn't Katniss demand that Peeta, Johanna, and Annie be rescued as a condition of being \\"The Mockingjay\\" (and that she be part of the rescue) instead of whining and breaking down and just demanding that they pardon the Victors and she be the one to kill Snow?   Absolutely NO explanation of why Finnick is totally messed up--at the end of Book 2, he was calmly discussing the situation with Plutarch and Haymich. Yes, Annie had been captured, but she'd been \\"imprisoned\\" for years, under threat of torture while Snow pimped him out (kind of weird and out of the blue side story), yet he maintained his physical and strategic brilliance and sense of irony....   District 13 is the drab, grey, communist society as the counterpoint to the decadence and color of The Capitol. In 13, the food is grey and awful, everyone strictly regimented, no one ever has any fun or joy. In The Capitol, the food is spectacularly delicious, the majority of the populace extremely privileged from feeding off the slavery of the districts, and usually delighted. Black and white, grey and purple, bad and bad.... and never any sense of the political infrastructure, except that somehow Snow and Coin are absolute dictators, apparently making all key decisions themselves.  Total waste and misuse of the Victors, as if nothing matters but Katniss being a symbol for the rebellion. Why would a teenager dressed up as abird have such meaning? Her significance was her televised rebellion in the Games. Why was Peeta not significant? He was the heartfelt, sincere one, who touched people's emotions. Katniss was usually a bimbo in front of the camera, except during the Games themselves.  Katniss & Finnick both have serious PTSD, when neither had indicated any before (except when Katniss ran away and hid when she learned about the quarter quell). Katniss and Finnick would have been focused on how to rescue Peeta, Johanna, Annie, and others if possible. That would have been an interesting \\"hunger game\\"--the rescue. Instead, the rescue happens way too late, while Katniss and Finnick are in the bunker making knots!  After being a sullen, \\"unstable\\" teenager for 2/3 of the book, Katniss has a temper tantrum about going to war, so trains to be a soldier and manages to get into excellent physical condition and become a superb soldier and sharpshooter in 3 weeks. Huh? And she never learns to take orders, except in the test. I can't imagine that Finnick or Johanna, or Gale, would be very responsive to being foot soldiers either.  Re Johanna, she was in on the plot to rescue Katniss & Peeta from the 2nd Games and was captured while doing so, yet they know she was tortured by water and electricity, but apparently do nothing to try to help her past it. Instead, it is used as a device to keep her from the attack on the Capitol. Plus, we never learn why she has no family or friends--no back story--nor what happens to her afterward.  Why would 13 invest so much time in training a crack team of sharpshooters then relegate them to the photo ops? Why not bring them in to take out the Peacekeepers among the crowds of citizens near President Snow's mansion, instead of having a bunch of hacks killing off more citizens than Peacekeepers? Why not have the Victors be a crack team, using their preferred weapons, and taking out strategic positions, if the war has to be the focus?  How were the rebels able to take a tunnel and part of the capitol? Why didn't they unleash thousands of muttations and other \\"weapons\\" to turn the rebels back or even just block the tunnels?  The entire \\"it's an arena\\", with all the pods in the city (why would they have pods with all these elaborate dangers as defense for a city that has never been invaded successfully? why would they endanger their citizens, or even their slaves? what possible motive would there be for having pods in the sewer system???) was absurd and irritating, long before key characters were killed or wounded and the \\"mission\\" failed.  I think a much more interesting ending to the series would have involved Katniss and Peeta becoming mentors, teaming with Haymitch, Finnick, BeeTee and Johanna, and subverting the Capitol's power from inside, along with Plutarch, ultimately changing the game and turning it against Snow and his minions. Don't kill off Cinna (drop the Mockingjay feathers underneath the wedding dress bit, it was ridiculous), but use his talents to deceive and inspire through beauty/art. Also, of course, some fabulous archery (Katniss), use of nets & tridents (Finnick) and knives (Johanna), silent hunting & snares (Gale), technology (BeeTee) as well as someone who always knows the right thing to say so resolves conflicts and helps forge them into true allies (Peeta). Then, after the power structure is destroyed, the long, hard task of rebuilding and creating an equitable democratic society would begin. I'd have the Victors be elected/chosen as senators for their districts.  In regard to the \\"love triangle\\", why not have them evolve to be friends/companions/lovers and get past monogamy and jealousy? One of the most honest statements in the book was when Katniss told Peeta that she wasn't asking his or Gale's permission about whom to kiss. That was about the only time I liked her in the book, that and some of her interactions with Johanna.
B0063IH60K|5.0|quick and responsie card game with options to deal random or a winning hand. The more you play the faster you get.
6304479689|5.0|The only thing that could improve this documentary/movie would be its digital transfer from VHS to DVD.<br /><br />Like Elvis himself this documentary is; wholly unique, multi-faceted, thought provoking, filled with great music, an exciting confirmation that Elvis was the greatest entertainer of all time.<br /><br />[[ASIN:6304479689 Elvis on Tour [VHS]]]
B004EPZ03O|4.0|Saw this with the missus (who keeps her inner child alive) over the weekend. If you love the muppets, you'll enjoy this.  This is good old fashioned leave your brains at the door corn regarding the beloved marionette puppets (thus the origin of the name if you've ever wondered) and their puppet within a human world admirer Walter. Walter and his human brother (don't ask) and the latter's girlfriend go on a mission to meet the Muppets, when he learns that their old theater may be taken over by a crooked oil tycoon (note-one of the fools at Faux Noose has accused this film of promoting anti-capitalism among the kiddies-moving right along). As was the case with the band in \\"The Blues Brothers,\\" the beloved Muppets are scattered all over the place at crummy jobs that they hate, and Walter tries to get them together on this mission to stop the crook.   The film never takes itself too seriously. The crooked tycoon has a group of crude, pseudomuppets called \\"The Moopets\\" (the gangster rapping Fozzie Bear counterpart is a real hoot) that he intends to replace the lovable Muppets with. One song in the film is actually called \\"Am I a Man or a Muppet\\" and is sung straight (which makes it all the more funny). The song and dance numbers are jaw droppingly cornball. One really hilarious movement has a group of chickens clucking the lyrics to Cee Lo Greene's (Forget) You.  Aduilts who grew up with the Muppets will enjoy this best. Tons of self-referencing humor. There is even a segment reviving \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" from the 1979 Muppet Movie and \\"Manomenop\\" from their pre-Sesame Street appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show in the late 60s. Incidentally, a kid sitting next to us asked his parents where were Elmo, Big Bird, and the rest of the Sesame Street crew. Kermit aside, legal issues prevented this and Frank Oz (the original voice of Fozzie Bear) did not care for the fart jokes (that and a scene involving moldy fruit are the only remotely offensive things about the film, itsokay for the kids) and some aspects of the script. The kiddies will have a good time though. Overall, if you don't take it too seriously and let your inner child come out while watching this, you will enjoy it too. Bring the whole family and have a ball.
0439023513|1.0|I was a massive fan of The Hunger Games. Book 1 is still one of my favorite novels. I noticed that I didn't like Catching Fire quite so much, but it wasn't bad. Mockingjay is absolutely God-Awful. There really is no way to spoil this book, as the ending third is so haphazard and random, failing to capitalize in any way on THREE BOOKS of buildup and tension. Even the Peeta/Gale choice, which is one of the main plots of the series, just fizzles into a disappointing shrug. I've never been less satisfied with a series. Keep your money and preserve the good memory of the original.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app! The reading plans are very helpful.  I love how it tracks your progress. Very easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005PTYOTE|4.0|For the price, this set is totally worth it. But to be completely honest I would not have minded paying a little extra for a better remastering of the first two films. The transfer for the first two films is not bad, but it isn't great. There is still a soft and grainy quality to the movies. For a blu-ray, this should not be an issue. For those of you who say that the age of the film is a factor, I invite you to watch Blade Runner on blu-ray. You will be amazed. Now keep in mind that Blade Runner is about 30 years old already, and the remastering of this movie looks A LOT better than the transfer for Mission: Impossible 1 or 2. I suppose I can't complain much since I paid 20 bucks for this set, but still. These are great movies, they deserve a better transfer.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|Ordered for Christmas, recvd in less than week.  Quick service, good product.  Movie was in origial wrapper, brand new as stated.  No problems.  Would order from them again.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|This movie was fantastic! I was blown away by every aspect of the film. Joe Cornish did a phenomenal job. It was visually stunning and at the same time, it felt very warm and fun. The writing was very clever as well. It's easy for a conecept like this to morph into something campy, but it never felt that way. You really empathize with and root for these characters, throughout. That is no small fault to the cast. Considering most of the cast is made up of younger actors, it is a very solid ensemble.   I, basically, loved everything about this movie. I know this is very trite to say, but this really is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|so far it sucks but I need to give it a chance if you could tell me how to play I would say THANKS!!!!!!!!!!HOWEVER SO FAR IT KIND OF SUCKS AND ITS OLD.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|I wanted a case that was made of a rigid but pliable plastic. I chose this one after reading others' reviews. The material of this case is exactly what I hoped it would be, based on the reviews. The case fits very well and appears to offer excellent drop protection. The corners all have enough material that they will offer decent protection from any angle. I haven't tested dropping on concrete yet, the phone has survived several 3 to 4 foot falls onto thin carpet.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|like that you have to get things from other scenes to complete levels. very entertaining and engaging. my daughter is even addicted to the game.
0671034065|3.0|Linda Howard is a great writer. But this story was weak. Things started a little slow, picked up a bit then sloooooowed down agian. The relationship between Sam and Jaine moved at a normal steady pace, they had sex about a week and a half into knowing eachother and the same night they decided to get married. GET MARRIED. After knowing somebody at most 2 weeks? come on. I wasn't moved by the story like in \\"Cry no more\\". In fact the deaths that occured were minor speed bumps to me. Just slowing down the story. I couldn't finish the story.
0439023521|5.0|I am not an avid reader, nor do I always commit to books I start reading unless they hook me in from the start - convincingly.  I had more fun reading this - and found it harder to put down than [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]].  For adult readers, don't let the \\"young adult\\" label this book carries dissuade you from from jumping on the Hunger Games bandwagon.  This book, and the entire series have very mature, adult themes, corruption, unbelievably violent fighting and deaths (of children, no less...) and complex characters.  The only real reason this title deserves the \\"young adult\\" label at all is the lack of sex and vulgar language which opens this book up to a wider audience.  I picked up The Hunger Games up free from the Amazon Kindle Owner's Lending Library as my first book for my [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire, Full Color 7\\" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi]]. I stayed up until 4am to finish the book. Immediately after finishing I thought about waiting another month for my next \\"free\\" book loan to read the next book in the series, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].  That thought lasted only a fraction of a second before I purchased and downloaded it... and the last book, [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]] too.  I finished the series within a week - and wanted more!  I can't wait for the movie - and can't wait to see if Collins can come up with a 4th book for the series, which wrapped up tidily in three books... but could always be brought back to life... if we're lucky!
B00092ZL80|5.0|You have to keep in mind you're not going to get what they sounded like 30 years ago, that's just impossible with the switching of performers, but I still enjoyed it just the same. I had to laugh the outfits though :) I'm still giving love to these guys cause they can still groove even after all these years. This is what you call music, and musical talent, esp the guys from Earth Wind.

The story of Steve Jobs is very funny at times and it gives us a look at the intellectual environment in a different time.

(I am not making this up!) And... it's NOT a bad show! I have no idea how much it changes and gets more estrogen-filled over time but it's not a bad drama/comedy combo. We've now watched about 8 episodes (thanks Amazon Prime!!!) and it's one of the most unique shows we've seen in a while (although I still prefer reality shows).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just started playing these games so I haven't lost patience with the ads.  Thought I'd be bothered by the minimalist directions but quickly realized you'd have to be a total moron not to figure things out once you start playing.  This will be a nice, quick distraction when I only have a few minutes to spare.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63:  A Novel by Stephen King<br /><br />Anyone who is over 55 years old remembers where they were and what they were doing that day, the day Kennedy was shot.  Stephen King was 16 that year.  He had the idea in 1972 for this story:  What if you could go back in time and prevent the presidential assassination?  But in 1972 it was too soon, too fresh on everyone's minds.  Now the time is right, and the 849 page novel tells the story as only Stephen King can.<br /><br />This novel is several genres all intertwined into one, a historical novel, a science-fiction tale of time travel, a work of fiction, with just a little King horror thrown in to round it out nicely.  The overall combination makes for a great page-turner and provides some thought-provoking what-ifs?<br /><br />If you are a fan of King, you will appreciate early in the story the reference to some previous King stories, mention of the Derry, Maine clown who terrified children, and the prison up at Shawshank.<br /><br />Historical novel:  King went to great lengths to get the history and facts correct in this one.  No, he didn't just sit down at his typewriter and let the story flow out of his warped mind this time.  He visited the key places in Dallas,  talked with many experts on the subject, and viewed old film footage.<br /><br />His story brings back those iconic black-and-white images we all saw on our televisions.  The president and first lady riding in the convertible in the motorcade, Jackie in her blood-spattered pink suit standing with vice president Johnson as he took the presidential oath, Oswald in the police station gunned down by Jack Ruby.  All of these accurate historic scenes and more were described in detail and integrated into the context of the story.<br /><br />Time travel:  I have always loved time travel stories.  More research went into this part of the story, life in the early sixties, the language, the automobiles, the lifestyle, the money.  The terms we learned in 'Back to the Future' are here like time-space continuum and paradox, along with harmony and residue.  And the fact that time does not want to be changed, is obdurate about it, and will put any obstacle in your path to stay the same.  [ob-du-rate, adj. stubbornly refusing to change one's opinion or course of action, see STUBBORN.  (just place your Kindle cursor on any word and the definition pops up, love it!)]<br /><br />Fiction:  Once all the research was done King incorporated it all into a story with believable characters, some you remember from the television coverage or from history books, some new ones.  The time travel portal (or rabbit hole) takes you back to September 9, 1958, so with the plan to stop the assassination of JFK, you would have 5 years to kill in the past waiting for that fateful day.  A lot of time to fill up with story line, and who better than King to create filler material.  I admit (like some other King stories) it seemed to bog down just a bit in the middle, but maybe it was just because I couldn't wait for the fateful day to arrive to see what would happen.  Would he really be able to prevent John Kennedy's assassination?  Would that also prevent the deaths of Bobby Kennedy and maybe even Martin Luther King?  What would be the ramifications?  What would the future be like?<br /><br />Horror:  Unlike his usual books, this is not a horror story, but it wouldn't be King without a little scary stuff, and he sprinkles in some here and there just to keep you on your toes and looking over your shoulder.<br /><br />The 849 pages went much faster than I anticipated, another great story from the master storyteller.<br /><br />I remember where I was that fateful day, 11/22/63, what about you?x, along with harmony and residue.

Great games to bide the time. This is one of three games on my Kindle and I play this one more than any other. Challenging and fun. Great to play when riding as a passenger in a vehicle and not bothering the driver on those long drives or even when standing in a long waiting line.

1451627289|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I have read in a long time!  I never appreciated the 60's as much when I was actually living in them as I did while reading this book.  The future (our present) has it's advantages, but there is something to be said about the simplicity of life back then.  Great book, wish I could forget it and start again.

B004NELBPC|5.0|I love this app!  I spend most of my time with this app on the political pages. When it comes to politics let's just say I am politically illiterate.  The Huffington Post seems to be neither far to the left nor far to the right.  I really like that!  The Post also has numerous sections such as; business, world, media, entertainment, style and more!  The articles are great and are updated regularly throughout the day.  Definitely one of my favorite apps for my kindle fire!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a beautiful, well-designed game. Conceptually the game is simple to understand and play but to actually play well and perfect each level can be very challenging.
1451627289|5.0|Since by now you will already know the premise of this book, and other reviewers have given good overviews, I won't bother with that here.  Instead, I will say that I truly believe that this is King's best work of his very prolific career.  I was a big fan of early Stephan King and his pseudonym Bachman, but stopped reading him about 10 years ago.  I felt that after his initial big successes, he sadly succumbed to \\"writer's popularity\\", churning out works \\"on schedule\\" to meet publisher and fan demands that sold merely because of his former successes.  However, I bought this book because the premise sounded so promising.  I'm so glad I did.  I quite literally could not put this book down.  In my opinion, King's earlier works were unmatched for suspense, yet his endings often left me disappointed.  I hoped that 11/22/63 would not be the same.  In this work, King has mastered it all.  His first foray into time travel has all the suspense of his earlier works and, although this is a very long book, never once did it drag. King has managed the enviable accomplishment of making every page a page-turner.  I found myself sorry to finish it.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|This case is a qualtiy case, a bit thick but does the job.  My only questions is why have a clear case with swirls on the back?  They kind of defet the purpose of the clear case, IE showing off the phone.  In my case we have skin-its on the back that i didn't want to cover up.  Just my thoughts...Good quality, good price but swirls?!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm just doing this for the bonus points. good game though. very very very very very entertaining I like it
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very full app, including bookmarking, note taking, highlighting, and a very long list of various Bible reading plans. It is a great tool for Bible study and keeping my scripture memory verses at hand all the time. It is easy to navigate. I love, love, love it!<br /><br />I have one complaint, though, which I hope the app developers will correct in the very near future. I mainly use the NKJV, but the text in the NKJV of verse 1 of most chapters repeats. I haven't found it to do that in the NIV or ESV. I also do not appreciate the way the headers in Psalms are after the first phrase of verse 1, and then a portion of the text continues in verse 1 bolded as if it's part of the header. If I am asked to read scripture aloud in my Bible study group and don't pay attention to which part is header and which part is the actual verse, I sound like a moron. PLEASE, app developers, could you fix these two kinks?<br /><br />If you want a versatile Bible tool on your Kindle Fire, I highly recommend this one in spite of the NKJV text kinks.
B00004TJKI|5.0|One of the best trial films made; with an outstanding cast of believable characters. This is truly a classic motion picture and a chance to see a young George C. Scott.
1607053888|3.0|This book has pretty illustrations but the directions for me were a bit confusing to follow as there are no pictures to show you what to do and how to do it. It just explains the steps in vague sentences. I am a visual learner so reading the directions rather than seeing them was inconvenient. Also, the patterns are hard to work with as parts for one pattern will overlap the parts of another pattern so you can't cut out the patterns. You simply must trace the pattern but for me this is a huge inconvenience and takes up too much of my time. Overall this is a nice book but if you are looking for a book that shows directions clearly and has patterns that are easier to work with then I wouldn't recommend this book.

0738727326|5.0|I purchased this deck, which came bundled with the Shadowscapes Companion Book at a retail store over a year ago. I was just learning how to read Tarot and I'm extremely happy that I went with this deck over any other. The illustrations are gorgeous and detailed but more than their beauty, most of them actually illustrate the meaning of the tarot card so that without even knowing the meanings behind each card, you can usually figure out the general story without having to refer to reference material. (Though I still do use a reference just to be sure of myself.)   I did not find the cards or illustrations too small: I don't have perfect eyesight, but I'm able to pick up and enjoy the detail in each card without strain. I think if the cards were any larger they would feel awkward to shuffle, deal, and handle. I have long and thin hands and these just fit comfortably.   The only bad thing about this deck is that I think it's spoiled me forever to other decks - it will be the deck that I compare all others to!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is a great app that I use for a variety pf purposes including taking notes during the Bible studies at church.  Since I am using this mostly on my Kindle Fire, I haven't. used the other features like capturing photos with a camera.<br /><br />However, I just tried it on my iPhone and it works well on my wife's iPad.  I just downloaded on by Barnes &amp; Noble Nook Color (ok so I am a tech junkie).<br /><br />Bottomline is that this is a good app that works on all platforms.  I love the flexibility that gives me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Got it for Kindle Fire and it works great.  It can be addictive though. The three draw random deal seems impossible to win.
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|i absolutely love this app, but using it on my samsung sidekick is irking me. the widget keeps disappearing and then i cant even re-add it without a complete uninstall and reinstall. ive had to change apps just so I'd have a widget. beyond that i love this program. &lt;3 cheese mode!

1601251505|5.0|Our group, sick to death of all the edition changes from WotC, decided to convert to the Pathfinder system when it was announced that 5th edition was coming out and that all our manuals and modules would henceforth be useless (because, while we still possess the books, I suspect that their critical tool, the online Character Generator, will only support 5th edition after its release.  Thus to play 4th Edition or Essentials, you'll have to level your characters up manually:  quite a convoluted and error-prone process).<br /><br />Thus we started casting about for a new system.  We liked the combat system in 4e, but we didn't want go around buying all the 5th edition books only to hear (around 2014, I'm assuming) that WotC has decided to come out with a 6th edition!<br /><br />Eventually we agreed on Pathfinder.  The maker, Paizo, dosn't seem to play such games.<br /><br />The combat is based on the more complicated 3.5 system, but the major advantage of converting over to Pathfinder is that you can rest assured that the makers aren't going to COME OUT WITH A WHOLE NEW EDITION every 2-3 years!  Hence you can safely build up your materials without that unnverving, sword-of-Damocles feel that working with WotC materials gives you.<br /><br />So far things have been going well.  And, unlike D&D, there are actually only three books you need to start playing and play for years:  this one, [[ASIN:1601251831 Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: The Pathfinder Bestiary]], and [[ASIN:1601252463 Pathfinder Roleplaying Game: Advanced Player's Guide]].<br /><br />And that's it!  You're good to go for the next decade!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. used it everyday since its been installed. fun for people of all ages and a great challenge to unlock the games
0316098329|4.0|I'd rate this book somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars.  It was fast and absorbing - I read it in one day and really enjoyed the experience.  Many negative reviews complain that the story was frustrating because it was told from the point of view of a 5-year-old child.  I agree that this was frustrating at times - I really would have loved to hear more of the mother's conversations with her family and the doctors.  But I disagree that those omissions detracted from the story.  Donoghue made a stylistic choice to have a 5-year-old narrator, and kudos to her for sticking with it for over 300 pages.  This was the story she wanted to tell - it's not a \\"worse\\" story because she left certain things out.  My only complaints are relatively small ones.  First, Donoghue is Irish, while \\"Room\\" takes place in America with American characters.  There's a lot of UK/British words and phrasing, such as \\"proper,\\" \\"have a go,\\" and \\"with colors on.\\"  It's not that Americans never speak this way, just that it's a far more British/Irish way of speaking, and it sort of pulled me out of the story - especially to hear 5-year-old Jack, who had been confined his whole life, speaking like a little British boy.  Second, while Jack's narration is mostly very convincing, there are several inconsistencies that reminded me I was reading a novel written by an adult.  The simplest things are completely foreign to Jack, yet other things he seems to accept without question.  Rain and revolving doors terrify him, but he doesn't seem bothered when he finds himself in a crowded mall.  He's never seen another real person in his life besides Ma and Old Nick, in fact he is enthralled by a mouse because it's the biggest living thing he's ever seen, and he expresses disbelief that other humans exist - yet when he finally meets other humans, he doesn't seem phased.  He cannot fathom the idea of there being more than one Room in the world, then effortlessly slides into description of several rooms at the Clinic.He cannot understand the concept of \\"outside,\\" yet narrates eloquently about stress and death.  These small inconsistencies add up after awhile.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  I thought it was clever, emotionally engaging, and well-written.  There are problems with the story, but they are mostly easy to overlook.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the variety . lots of different games to play.  like the challenges the games provide. keeps me entertained for hours.
0880796863|5.0|A great divination tool, especially for beginners; The drawings on the cards, although a bit childish, are very detailed and meaningful. Recommended, especially for a good price like 13$.
1451627289|4.0|Reading this book, I felt like I had slipped down a rabbit hole to the '70s -- when I could not get enough of Stephen King's books. I consumed the novel in less than a week and was hard pressed to put it down for sleep. That said, I was disappointed in the ending. It was, well, the only word that comes to mind is mundane, albeit radioactively mundane. Such a writing talent could and should have constructed a finale that lived up to the caliber of the remaining body of work -- rather than slapping on a final chapter which I have heard called \\"sappy\\" by a number of others. I, for one, was happy with the sentimentality. Just felt cheated by the wrap-up's brevity.  Am I recommending it? Definitely, YES. Did I experience disappointment at story end? Most certainly. But, I do not regret one minute of this reading's nostalgic ride.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of the best free apps I've been able to find. So many different games. Worth paying money for even though it's free!
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|DVD skips and doesn't work properly.  I have asked twice now for a replacement.  No response.    I would like a working DVD!  Make it happen.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|I bought this movie for my 14 year old son.  It didn't have volume for the first 5 minutes or so, but there was nothing but credits going, so am assuming it's just part of the movie.  Once we got past that, the movie played as it should, full volume.  Wonderful movie.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It brings back memories of playing with raindrops on the window as a child. The puzzles make you think outside the box.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I had this but returned it as I didn't think it had  much protection.  Got the roo one instead.  That is made  much better and has zippers and a place for a stylus.  Much better quality than this one.
0385738773|4.0|The Maze Runner has been such a fantastic adventure. I found myself frustrated through the middle of the book, wanting Thomas to go one way while he continued to go another. I don't know if it was planned that way by the author or if it was just my stubborness, but either way it all came together in the end.<br /><br />Thomas' name was used less in this book, probably because it was the biggest complaint from reviewers of the first two books, Thank you Mr. Dashner :). The writing style was consistant to the end and I appreciated the authors ability to describe places and people in a raw and realistic way. The only thing that didn't quite work for me was emotion. I felt like the author didn't quite capture the depth of loss, anger, and frustration that the characters would have experienced through their journey.<br /><br />All in all, I would say that this was yet another action packed and thrilling read- a real page turner. Mr. Dashner was able to keep the end game secret until the very last moment and convinced me that even I couldn't trust anyone in the storyline- always second guessing each characters motives. It is quite a remarkable feat to be able to keep your readers on their toes through the very last breathe.<br /><br />Parents:<br />Language: Like the first 2 books, there are substitution slang/cuss words - shuck being the biggest one used. No real profanity, but used in a way that you could consider the made up words profane.<br /><br />Adult Content: Government corruption, Wide spread disease, mind control, mental disorders, trust issues. A skewed sense of reality.<br /><br />Violence: Lots of it. There are bloody and descript battles. Cannibalism, Cranks losing their minds. Less made up creatures- a couple of grievers in the end, but most of the combat in this book is person to person. Electric Shock grenade launchers, guns, knives, cars, poles, anything that can be used as a weapon in this book- it is.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not sure yet. Some of the games are hard to control.  I am going to keep trying. Kind of addicting.
B0061S073A|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old can play learning games and never get into what I don't want her into. She LOVES playing on my &quot;lil puter&quot; (my kindle fire). I would recommend this app to any parent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are easy, as my five year old unlocked the first ten, but fun!  I don't understand the bad reviews.
B000024KBK|5.0|Well to begin with, Morrissey was at the height of his powers on his second long player. I have heard many reviewers complaining that the album was simply worthless. What drivel! This album is quite beautiful, melodic, and really  quite masterfully rendered. What i've learned, after his first four albums, is that Morrissey, was The Smiths, all along!
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Fascinating concept. A perfect functioning girl (woman) genetically created with built in idiocincracies to suit her owner/master. The overall plot has shades of Pinnochio, and why wouldn't it. She wants to reach the town where the wind-up people live, to be among her own kind--New People--to fit in. She wants to be treated as a 'real girl', to be rid of the limitations built into her which make her movements seem like clockwork, and mark her as different. She wants children, her own family.<br /><br />The world building is excellent and the Asian setting authentic, grimy, real, and dangerous. The corporate-political solution to the country's problems at the end felt a little dry and disappointed me slightly. The story was at its most interesting when the wind-up girl, Emiko, was the focus. This is a must read if you like this genre.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was fun but I don't like havering to get points to win games. and it was a bunch of little games.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I was ecstatic when I found this app. It has a lot of really great features like customized reading plans and the option to hear certain translations read aloud. But after saving it to my kindle fire for only 2 days, I became quite frustrated that the app opened itself while I read other books. I also feel it may be a security issue.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so easy to earn points and unlock the other games...very fun and easy way to pass the time. some of the games are a little childish but nevertheless its a lot of fun
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I recently purchased a 55-300mm zoom lens for my Nikon D40, and knew that my old camera bag was going to be too small.  I read the reviews on this bag along with a few others.  I choose this bag for the amount of room inside as well as the durable looking construction.  I am glad that I did - this bag holds everything and has lots of padding and velcro-stabilized separators that keep all of my equipment in place.  I am able to bring along my video camera as well inside, as well as the zoom lens, an extra flash and flash diffuser, lens pen, the manual, and I still have extra room. I am still a DSLR novice, but there is room in this bag for whatever equipment I might need, plus anything extra I may want to carry.  Highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works great on my Kindle Fire, it fills the screen which I like. Great time filler while you are waiting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Can't stop playing. I love it. also love cut the rope too. There are so many different boxes and levels!!!!!!!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Having not purchased these movies before, owning all 8 movies in one compact package is super convenient.  The movies look amazing on my samsung lcd/blue ray player, and the audio is top rate as well. Each film is the theatrical release and has the usual behind the scenes reel, as well as deleted scenes selections.  Since most of the movies are in excess of 2.5 hours anyway, I don't feel cheated not having the edited scenes incorporated into the films, a la the directors cuts of the Lord of the Rings series. My only issue involves the packaging. Some of the discs come loose quite easily, risking damage with rough handling. Otherwise, very pleased with this package.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app works great, and is far faster and consistent than vnc, or other desktop sharing apps. 2 thumbs up!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Allows me to get the word in wherever I am!!!! I am so excited about the different plans and devotions.  There's a version of the Bible available whether you prefer KJV or NIV, Amplfied and so many others. The book marks and highlighting and ability to input notes is spectacular...Thanks for such a great app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I use to buy Games similar to this one ALL the time. Yes, they don't have the greatest graphics, and some of the control methods (such as for the game comparable to the loved &quot;Nokia Snake&quot; game) make it a little difficult to play some of the games, (I've only come across 1 so far, but its still completely doable, it just takes perfect timing &amp; a slick and smoothe finger strike.) These games are fun because their quick, easy, &amp; addicting. Some of the games are pretty lame, I admit. But, that doesn't stop myself &amp; my fiance from battling it out &amp; trying to beat eachothers score...! FWI, I normally crush his score... LoL~ I think it's a Great Game, Especially for a Free Game...It's really a good alternative to boredom and will keep you entertained for hours at a time. Not to mention, that it is a great game for ALL Ages..!!! Fun For The WHOLE Family..! 5 Stars Hands Down, &amp; By FAR One Of The Top Free Games That Are Available... *** ~SXYTHG
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is an ok app to pass the time.  be nicer if there were other versions of solitaire to play as well.

B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Jane Eyre is timeless.  I enjoyed this version, it had some flaws but all is made up for by how hot Michael Fassbender is aka Mr. Rochester.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is so addictive. Some of the games are super easy to beat and some take forever but I was challenged by some of them so I ended up playing forever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I'm enjoying this app. runs with kindle like a charm. straight forward use with easy access to radar and forecast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game. so does my family and friends. but I don't like the amount of points it takes to unlock most of the games.
B0047UC4GM|3.0|I ordered this on 12/9/2011 for a christmas for my daughter who is studing Italian and asked for.I don't understand why this took a month to get. Why did it have to come from Italy?
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app forecasts down to the hour.  However, there have been a few times that its said sunny and clear but when I look outside, it's very clearly dark and cloudy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app along with my kindle touch, they are always in sync with each other and allow me access to anything in my library wherever I left off.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|this album is the one you've been waiting for since KISS took off the make up!  OK, maybe not THAT long but it feels like it.  This is the best album of Anthrax's career - and that says a lot.  Who would have thought 20 years after 'Persistence of Time' and in their 50's they'd be at their peak again?  Singer Joey Belladonna never sounded so good and Charlie is getting better and better and proving to be the best metal drummer in the business after Mike Portnoy and Dave Lombardo.  Scott Ian did a great job writing the songs - they are heavy, crunchy and the choruses rock and are very catchy.  Rob Caggiano is finally shining at lead guitar and able to show off his own capabilities - the boy's got some serious chops!  \\"In the End\\" is a fitting tribute to Ronnie James Dio and Dimebag Darrell (as this is Anthrax's first new album since their passing).  METAL IS BACK!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|2.0|It was cool to use this and see my desktop on my phone. Apparently not compatible with Gingerbread, Android 2.3 operating system Bionic phone. Too bad. Would have loved it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a great game it fun and you get coins to unlock new fun games it is pretty awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this app but I'm so happy I tried it it's totally worth the space
0439023513|2.0|The first two books of the trilogy were riveting. I stayed up til all hours of the night reading them and told all of my friends and family about how they NEEDED to get these books, or else their life would not be complete. In \\"Mockingjay\\" however, I felt myself becoming severely annoyed with the authors writing style about 1/4 into the book.  The chapters lead up with this intense, suspenseful scenes that leave your mind racing and fingers flipping through the pages, only to come up disappointed at the page turn when it begins a new chapter with a flashback of the intensity that we are being cheated on. Her style of building, building, and building to this climax leaves you with a real buzz-kill as Katniss retells the drama after it's already happened, thus leaving you twiddling your thumbs and feeling like you got excited for nothing. There really is no intense action in this book that the reader is able to follow the narrator along like you were able to in the \\"Mockingjay's\\" predecessors.   Also, the ending of the book left me feeling like I could have done something so much more productive with my time. It is so disappointing that such a great series ends on such a confusing, dull note.   *****SPOILER ALERT*******   After Prim dies and Katniss is on fire, I was incredibly confused as to what was \\"real\\" or \\"not real.\\" For about 10 pages I was waiting for there to be another chapter pulling her back into reality, when she would spring up with a vengeance and fly up to the Capitol to murder Snow herself... But that never happened. By the end of the book, I felt depressed, not because of a strong emotional connection to the outcome of the characters themselves, but because of the disconnect I felt after having such an intense relationship with them throughout the previous books. It was a MAJOR let down, and now if my friends ask me how I liked the books, I will probably just shrug and say \\"Meh. Don't waste your time.\\" Which is SO unfortunate because the first two were so amazing.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I like this app, but it is a little hard for younger kids. It was hard to control the robots moves and to take on larger robots. It had my son in tears, but he still loved trying to play it!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This kit was great. It really improves thhe amount of light that the little flashlight produces. It is brighter and the batteries last longer as well. I strongly recommend it to any one.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Fabulous app. Can access my photos and music files as well as anything else on my desktop. My kindle fire is now a mini laptop. I don't normally write reviews but so impressed with this app had to share.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|helps pass the time. fun game for all ages. only bad thing is you have to either buy or complete games to get coins to purchase new games.
B006U43QTM|5.0|Agatha Christie is always very readable, and this is one of the best.  And for a really good price.  I've got most of her books in paperback, but am trying to rebuild a digital Christie library without breaking the bank.  I guess they've never needed to lower the price on these because they never stopped selling well, but paying $7.99 for books I've read many times and owned in paper always seems extravagant.  I hope \\"Agatha Christie publishing\\" does more to make her books affordable.  I think, then, even more people will be drawn to the ultimate mistress of mystery.  It is amazing that although they are set in a \\"dated\\" period, the books themselves and the characters never become dated.
B00164CM46|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my grandson, and it was well received. He is a film major in College, and loves movies and games.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a good game - Not the most difficult but great for use when sitting around. Have a good day
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is so helpful.  It's easy to use and I love being able to switch to  the different versions so easily.
B0042L78MG|5.0|This is a great CD.  Every song is a gem, and it is delivered with a sassy, sultry-voiced punch.  I highly recommend it!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Just got my cover.  Seems to be adequately constructed for the price.  Not as pleased with the quality as other reviews led me to believe i would be.  Will be lucky if it lasts a year.  Next time will pay a little more and purchase one from Best Buy.  Amazon could do much better.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I really like it.  Even though I'm more in to bands like Metallica, Five Finger Death Punch, InFlames, Three Days Grace, etc., I like Adele also. I think she has some good music.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|All these versions for free, plus audio, plus all the tools? The only way this could be better is if you didn't have to have wifi to stream it. I'm still giving it 5 stars because it's the word of God.
0439023521|5.0|I'd read this book already, but purchased it for the holiday toy drive. nSuch a great read, and perfect for jr. high school age  Great price on amazon

B003L77FYS|5.0|I am a huge fan of anything Castle and I own the first two seasons and I watch them over and over so season 3 was a must. It has some of my favorite episodes on it and I can't wait for season 4 to come out on DVD. Season 3 has everything that you want, murder, romance and a cliffhanger that stuns. Its the best season so far and I am happy that I have all three seasons to watch over and over again.
0062101897|5.0|If you like Harry Potter, then you must have this book. I have read and of course watched all the movies, but this book gave me look into the making and thoughts I would have not received otherwise.
B0063GORYU|5.0|a great spider solitaire!  so much fun and freeee . graphics good. game play fast and hints are nice too!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I should have listened to the reviews sooner. I seriously doubt that there is a more relaxing game than this. The preview pictures don't do this game any justice. I bought Quell reflect after just 3 rounds just to make sure I had more.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|So - many people are giving Spiel & Co. the finger over Super 8. Here's my finger back at them, plus support for my gesture:  1. Likable characters  2. Decent plot  3. Righteous FX  But the biggest reason I liked 8 was the sentimentality of it, something Spiel is a master of. He makes me remember being a kid and having dreams, biking around and thinking about nothing except the moment, wishing for the pretty girl to say hi, the posters and models - it just touched my heart. So thanks, Spiel and Abrams. You guys made me remember.  It's a perfect summer film. Not taxing on the mind, just a slice of \\"Ah, I used to be like that.\\"
B005K17RU0|5.0|works as expected.  have used other apps with my droid and this is as good as any.  User friendly and intuitive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Game has a lot of fun and exciting games is great for every person in the world that likes fun and games.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our kids cousins brought this game when they visited in the fall. The kids said they really liked it, so it was under the Christmas tree. Well, they talked me into playing one evening over the Christmas holiday and I was instantly hooked. We played at least once a day during vacation. They are back in school now and I can't wait for the weekend so we can play again. The game is excellent. The kids are learning strategy and I really like the fact that there are so many different ways to win. Creativity and strategy will pay off for even the younger kids with this game.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study was recommended to me by a Physician friend.  Dr. Campbell makes a very persuasive argument against dairy consumption, supported by massive data, from around the world.  The China study analyzes exhaustive testing of over  6,500 Chinese adults, in addition to nutritional and epidemiological studies around the world.  While most scientists, nutritionists and many heath care providers agree that a whole food diet is healthier than processed, refined sugary foods, the detailed testing discussed in the China Study makes a very persuasive case for a vegetarian, dairy free diet.  Many studies discussed in the book link cow's milk to increased diabetes and  multiple sclerosis. Campbell discusses studies done in the United States and Finland, which found Insulin dependent diabetes rates were 11 to 13 times higher in children who were started on cow's milk formula, without being breast fed for at least three months.  Since the dairy industry will likely criticize every review linking cows milk consumption and disease, I will post a couple citations.  Neuroepidemiology. 1992;11(4-6):304-12.  Correlation between milk and dairy product consumption and multiple sclerosis prevalence: a worldwide study.  Malosse D, Perron H, Sasco A, Seigneurin JM.  Source  Laboratoire de Virologie, Faculté de Médecine, CHRU, Grenoble, France.  Abstract  Multiple sclerosis (MS) epidemiology suggests that different factors are involved in the clinical expression of the disease. Alimentary cofactors have already been considered, but mainly theoretically. We have studied the relationship between MS prevalence and dairy product consumption in 27 countries and 29 populations all over the world, with Spearman's correlation test. A good correlation between liquid cow milk and MS prevalence (rho = 0.836) was found; this correlation was highly significant (p < 0.001). A low but still significant correlation was obtained with cream or butter consumption (rho = 0.619 and rho = 0.504, respectively). No correlation was found for cheese. These results suggest that liquid cow milk could contain factor(s) - no longer present in the processed milk - influencing the clinical appearance of MS. The possible role of some dairy by-products is discussed in the light of a multifactorial etiology of MS.  DM-1 [Type 1, insulin dependent diabetes] was correlated with supply of: A1/capita in milk and cream (r = 0.92, p <0.00001); Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 24-January-2003, Vol 116 No 1168  Since approximately  50 percent of American adults are lactose intolerant, it should not be surprising that dairy consumption can increase chronic disease.  While reading about the significantly increased risk of diabetes, and multiple sclerosis with increased dairy consumption, I wondered if increased dairy consumption might be increasing human exposure to the Lyme spirochete.  Cows live, eat and sleep in grass, where ticks live.  The Lyme spirochete has been found in human milk.  I have not been able to find any testing of cow's milk for Lyme disease.  Steven Sponaugle
0756686970|5.0|This was a gift for my 5 year old son. He just loved it! The mini-figure was cool and a great bonus! He really enjoy flipping through the pages and identifying all of the minifigures he already had and those he still \\"needed\\". Great gift for a Lego and/or Star Wars fan!
0385535139|4.0|This book was just plain all around fun!  It's not the tightly wound suspense of his first books, so big fans of The Firm and A Time To Kill might be disappointed.  But if you go into it without those expectations, I think you'll find this book to be very enjoyable.  While it is a return to the legal thriller, it has a much faster pace and more engaging characters than Grisham has given us in a long while.  His non-suspense books were okay ... I quite enjoyed Playing For Pizza ... but I prefer more escapist fiction, and The Litigators lives up to that.
B0052U59F4|5.0|First, I want to preface this review by saying Fifty Shades of Grey started out as a Twilight fanfiction on the internet. I never read this when it was Twilight fanfiction. I'd heard of it but never got around to reading before it was pulled. That said, I'm pleased I never let others complaints about the author pulling the fanfic offline deter me from reading the published version.  Originally I was in the mood to read something different and downloaded the sample on my kindle. After reading through that, I purchased the book right away. I was hooked. Fifty is filled with intense characters that are full of passion. They are also riddled with flaws and imperfections. This makes the book entirely better, in my opinion. Anastasia and Christian are true people. I fell in love with them very easily.  As I read I went through a slew of emotions. Laughter, tears, frustration, heart break, love. I like nothing better than a book that makes me FEEL things from start to finish. I found myself actually talking to the characters as I read. Like they would hear me and I could change the outcome or make a difference in their story.  Fifty Shades of Grey is much more than a book about a man that feels the need to control emotionally and physically. It is about people that learn and evolve. Christian is changed by Anastasia, even in the very beginning. Even when he doesn't want to see how she's effected him. But not only does Ana change Christian's life, he changes hers as well. She finally gets something she never knew she wanted or needed in her life.  This book does contain BDSM but it is not used gratuitously. It is important to the story though so if that squicks you out, consider it before hand. There is nothing too severe, this is just a heads up.  I loved Fifty, honestly. I don't give a five start rating that often, not unless a book really sticks with me or I can't put it down. This is definitely one of those books.  [...]y-by-eljames.html

0060833459|5.0|The first edition of \\"The Effective Executive\\" appeared in 1966 and it was republished several times since. If most of the management books are on how to conduct other peoples, this book is about how to manage ourselves. The focus of the book is on the executive, or decision maker, and what he or she must do in order to be effective.<br /><br />Although written in simple words and easy to read, the book is not superficial. It is not the \\"5 steps to effectiveness\\" kind of book. It is a competent analysis that manages to make tangible a vital concept for an executive.

B006C45MRE|4.0|I got this one from redbox, and must admit that I was not expecting much from it. Instead, I got a movie that was entertaining, and somewhat imaginative. However, it was a little silly in how it proposed the cowboys to kill the aliens. I mean it was fun, but just a bid ridiculous. It was well done, but also left a chance to offer some insight into how fighting aliens would change men. So, I would suggest it to those wanting a visual joy, but not looking for anything to overwhelming.

0425241505|5.0|Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: A steamy new paranormal romance that will keep you strapped to your seat as you enter a new world filled with fantasy and magic.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: Pia was blackmailed into committing a crime more suicidal than she could possibly have imagined, and she had no one to blame but herself.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />To start off, let me be honest, I love Dragons. I bought Dragon Bound because 1) it had Dragon shifters and 2) J. R. Ward had a blurb on the cover, but it was Thea Harrison's writing that kept me glued to my chair turning pages all night long with her extensive world building and dynamic characters. It has been a while since a book grabbed me from the start and kept me reading start to finish, but Dragon Bound managed to keep me intrigued and left me wanting more when it was over.<br /><br />Dragon Bound starts with the heroine, Pia, being blackmailed into stealing from a dragon's hoard. Pia is half human and half wyr and she has lived her entire life hiding what kind of wyr she is and her abilities from others. Her mother taught her to keep a low profile and to never trust anyone with her secret. She has several contingency plans in place to run if need be. After using her unique abilities to steal to from Dragos she goes on the run and all hell breaks lose. I liked Pia and her personality. She did not take Dragos' arrogant attitude and abrasive behavior sitting down and made him strive to be a better man. I had fun trying to figure out what kind of a wyr animal she was throughout the book and as it turns out I guessed right.<br /><br />Dragos Cuelebre is a very old dragon; he is described as being born with the solar system. Dragos is the iron-fisted leader of the Wyr Demesne, the ultimate predator ruling other predators. He is an extremely possessive creature and is very much used to getting his way without regard to others feelings. He sets out to catch the criminal that stole from him and instead gets caught himself by Pia. He finds himself feeling things and doing things that he never saw coming. He becomes protective and caring and finally realizes that he has found his mate.<br /><br />The passion and heat between Pia and Dragos is explosive. Harrison writes several very steamy sex scenes between them. The progression to a couple takes some time because of Pia's mistrust and wariness. At one point in the book when she tries to run again I am literally screaming \\"no don't run just talk to him about it!\\" Dragos surprised me throughout the book because he tries his best to gain Pia's trust and change his ways to make her happy, even though you would assume he would just demand things happen his way. I was pleased with the way things ended and can't wait to see more of them in future books.<br /><br />Harrison also delivers the goods with her supporting cast of secondary characters in Dragon Bound. I was amazed at the various beings that inhabit the world that she created. Rune, a gryphon that is Dragos' First in his court; Tricks, the faery, who handles the PR for Dragos' firm; and my personal favorite, Graydon, another gryphon in Dragos' court. There is also a Thunderbird and a Harpy among the many other mythical beings in this unique fantasy world that stands side by side in the open with the human one.<br /><br />Dragon Bound is a great addition to the paranormal romance genre and a great start for Harrison as she blasts onto the scene with The Elder Races series. Harrison delivers with a new, complex world filled with magic and her own unique paranormal beings along with a compelling storyline.<br /><br />The Elder Races Series:<br /><br />1. Dragon Bound<br /><br />2. Storm's Heart<br /><br />3. Serpent's Kiss<br /><br />4. Oracle's Moon<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Berkley Sensation provided me with a copy of Dragon Bound. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review. In addition, I don'treceive affiliate fees for anything purchased via links from my site.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I looked at many covers, but I wanted something unique, and when I saw this cover I knew I had to have it.  Visually speaking, it was my dream case.  Initially I was put off by all the negative reviews, but when I read the company's response to all that whinging, not only did I want to high-five whoever wrote it, but it gave me the confidence I needed to go ahead and ordered it.  And, I'm happy to say, I was not disappointed!  I honestly can't understand what people were griping about.  The corner straps are just as tight as you would want them to be, and it really didn't take any sort of Herculean effort to get them over the corners of my Kindle.  And yes... the cover does not sit perfectly flat at first, but it shouldn't take a genius to realize the binding would relax after a few days.  Which it did.  When not in use, I stored my Kindle with the front of the cover facing down, so that the weight of the Kindle itself would help to relax the binding.  And after a few days it sits flat as flat can be.  I grin every time I pick it up.  It is that awesome!

I often speak with my phone in airplane mode to avoid calls and this app works great. I would love if they made the NIV downloadable but I assume its a legal issue. There is no better Bible app out there, they could charge $30 and this would be worth it. I greatly appreciate them always improving it. Thanks!
B005MW8CUG|5.0|That my almost total boredom for the vast majority of music being currently produced was just an unavoidable symptom of the accumulation of a couple extra decades of living on my part, you know, \\"Arrr ya young whippersnappers, when I was young we had REAL music...\\"  A couple thorough listens to the sparkling clean remasters on Siamese Dream set me straight though, something *is* missing these days. Where is anything even approaching the likes of Siamese Dream today? Idiosyncratic yet accessible. Repeated masterful flourishes of a velvet glove, with an iron fist ever ready. No formula, just artistry and experimentation in the best sense.  The set itself is a true treat. Basically a mini-box set with the wonderfully remastered album, a second cd of demos, rarities and other good stuff, and the concert DVD. Throw in a well produced booklet,some individual album style CD sleeves, photo cards and really cool packaging design, and I think the seemingly somewhat high price is fully justified.  Off right now to order the Deluxe Gish, and hoping that Mellon Collie gets the same treatment eventually...

B000FVE3AC|5.0|As an avid watch-a-holic, I ran across a ShopNBC Invicta Watch Info Hour. As a died in the wool, Citizen and Seiko lover, I had to admit that the designs for the Invicta watches were pretty impressive. But, I read some of the reviews and they were less than impressive, especially for their lower end watches and subsequent customer service. So, I saw a few watches that I liked and did some research, I really liked the the Invicta Reserve Grand Lume and the Grand Diver 3045. I called shopnbc and they really don't offer next day service. They did offer \\"expedited delivery\\" which would get it to me a week from 2013. So, shopnbc is not on my sellers list. But, I have always been VERY pleased with the service and warranty given by Amazon. That extra 30 days is outstanding and THEIR service is the best in the land! So, if I were to pull the Invicta trigger, that would be the best way to go forward.  I just received my new (1st)Invicta Grand Diver 3045 WITH the Seiko NH35A movement which is a really sound/stable movement. In fact, unlike the description shown here, it is a 24 jewel movement (not 21) that can be hacked and wound by hand. It would appear that Invicta has been reading these reviews because the face, the band and clasp are of a top notch quality and materials. This is a beautiful quality watch for the money. Now at present, my Citizen Blue Angels watch is my favorite time piece, we shall see if this really nice watch is more than just a hand bag for munchkins!?  UPDATE: I took the watch to my watch guy to have some links removed. I have used and trusted this man for 17 years. He has ALWAYS told me to stick with Seiko and/or Citizen and I will never go wrong. I told him for the money, I thought I would take a chance. He shocked me when HE told me this was the best watch on the market today FOR THE MONEY. I was a little surprised, since he always pushed Seiko/Citizen, he said that THIS IS WHAT I PURCHASED, it's basically a Seiko in the movement and a very well made watch. So far, so good...

0385342063|5.0|When Poppy Wyatt loses something very improtant to her, it's even worse when her phone gets stolen. She feels like it's her lucky day when she spots a cell just thrown away in a trash bin. She decides to get it, since the orginal owner didn't want it. That's where her story begins and she's pulled into a whole different world than she's use to. Trying to hold on to this phone might be a little harder than she thought!<br /><br />I love Sophie Kinsella! Her books are all great and I was super excited to read this one. It did not disappoint! Like some of Ms. Kinsella's books, this one is funny, charming and hard to put down. The characters are believeable and easy to relate to. If you've never read one of her books before, this would be a great one to start with. If you have read her books before, then you'll be able to just jump right in. I would highly recommend this one!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nice variety of games to play so you wont get bored easily. some of the games are hard and some are easy.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|Ok, I wasn't expecting a deep film here and actually for the first 40 minutes I was interested, but then it turns into a ham fest with ridiculous overacting and heroic patriotism that is shoved down your throat like a greasy \\"A $$  burger\\" straight out of a fast food chain in South Park! Sure it's got explosions, but not one character is interesting and everyone is made of cardboard. The aliens are kind of uninteresting too. I caught this on cable, so it didn't cost me anymore than my time, which it wasn't worth taking.<br /><br />If you want to see a cheese fest done right, watch Armageddon(very entertaining), which is at least fun while being overblown!
0062082353|5.0|This book is about much more than what you're hearing on some tv and radio shows regarding confirmed kill numbers and former governors - it's really more about saving lives, American lives, than it is about killing.  As someone with no military experience, it was very moving to read about Kyle's multiple deployments to Iraq.  It was also very interesting to hear the impact of those deployments on his family though his wife's contributions throughout the book.  American Sniper reads like you're sitting at a bar trading war stories with a friend.  Kyle exposes the good, bad, and ugly parts of his experience.  I appreciate his (and his wife's) candor and feel that I might have a better understanding of the sacrifices our military families make.   If you're like me and have been living safely at home in the US during the last 10 years of war, I recommend you read American Sniper and learn more about the people who've provided that freedom.

1451627289|5.0|I had kind of given up on Stephen King - I believe the last novel of his I tried to read was \\"Lisey's Story\\" a few years ago which I couldn't finish. I loved all of his earlier works including \\"Salem's Lot,\\" \\"Carrie,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" and on and on, but some of his later stuff just didn't do it for me. But when I first heard about \\"11/22/63\\" and its premise of going back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination, I had to read it! I got a copy as a Christmas gift and I was not disappointed. This has to be one of King's best books since \\"The Stand\\" - I loved every word of it (and that's a lot of words - almost 850 pages worth)! I was 13 in 1963 when Kennedy was killed and I actually remember thinking at the time that it would be nice to go back and prevent the killing - it really was like a bad dream. King's book uses this idea and the resulting novel is all that you could ask for in a time travel story. Some of it was reminiscent of the \\"Back to the Future\\" movies including using known sporting events results as a betting tool to make money. It also reminded me a little of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and how changes can effect other events and people's lives. Along the way in this novel, King takes us back to Derry, Maine and the events of his novel \\"It\\". He then provides a myriad of information about Lee Oswald and his wife Marina, and the events leading to 11/22/63. The novel also includes a great love story and the ending I thought was near perfect. This is the first book I have read in 2012 and I doubt I will read a better one this year - very high recommendation!
080214473X|4.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is an absolutely wonderfully exhausting book. The sheer magnitude of the action and number of discrete narrative threads make the book an enjoyably significant investment.   Bowden provides an apt description of the experience of \\"Black Hawk Down\\". He writes, \\"You could be prepared for the sights and sounds and smells of war, but the horror of it, the blood and gore and heartrending screams of pain, the sense of death perched right on your shoulder, breathing in your ear, there was no preparation for that. Things felt balanced on an edge, threatening at any moment to spin out of control.\\"  Mark Bowden's investigation into a single battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, is painstakingly detailed and thoroughly notated. Bowden weaves hours of interviews into a cohesive narrative, that doesn't feel stretched, or forced into a beginning, middle and end for mass consumption. In a world desensitized to violence by TV, video games, movies, Bowden has written a heart-wrenchingly real depiction of a real battle fought by real humans with very real feelings (physical and emotional).  American troops had been placed in the African nation to help support the rebuilding of the small, poor and desolate place. Bowden gives a sense of this distant battlefield: \\"Mogadishu spread beneath them it its awful reality, a catastrophe, the world capital of things-gone-completely-to-hell. It was as if the city had been ravaged by some fatal urban disease.\\" Army Rangers and members of the elite Delta Force were on a base on the outskirts of Mogadishu while periodically making small and seemingly effective raids in the capital city.   In early October, 1993, a Delta team, supported by Rangers, was dropped into the city with the hopes of capturing high ranking insurgent officials. The mission started to fall apart very quickly. Not one, but two helicopters were shot down. U.S. convoys drove around the city lost, and before they knew it, what started off as a routine mid-day mission, became an overnight, almost two day long nightmare.  Bowden does an amazing job of synthesizing official reports and hours of his own interviews into a solid narrative. While the book isn't long, it's certainly overwhelming. But it's not supposed to be an `easy' read. It's well-written, but it's also very real. One soldier's bravado in one scene becomes a very child-like fear in the next. As a soldier is asked to return to the battle after supporting a small convoy of wounded returning to the U.S. base, Bowden writes of an exchange with a more senior officer: \\"The difference between being a coward and hero is now whether you're scared, it's what you do while you're scared.\\"  The only downside of this book is that it doesn't include a summary of the characters and their relative relationships. There are dozens of soldiers with varying degrees of impact on the story of the battle. I simply could not keep up with who was who, and who was in which unit, and where they were at the different phases of the battle. Consider this a heads up for future readers.   To be clear, reading this book is an amazing experience. I don't consider myself a regular reader of military fiction or non-fiction, but I consider this a tremendous piece of work.
1451627289|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King and his alter egos since the late 1970s. To date, I've probably read thirty of his works, and \\"11-22-63\\" is King at his very very best. So many of his works have driven me to insomnia, bad dreams, and low level inexplicable anxiety. But not this time. This book is riveting and mindbending without the terror of so many previous books. There is an element of Mark Twain's \\"Mysterious Stranger\\", one of my favorite pieces of literature, but the Twain story was just a novella, and this book is almost 850 pages. I wish it were longer. I never wanted it to end.
1451627289|2.0|In retrospect, I'm mostly glad that I bought this only on my kindle, that way I wouldn't have been burdened by seeing how much further I had to read, as well as having to lug around a 20 lb tome.  I won't burden you with all that disappointed me about the novel, so here's the (main) rub:  The first 100 or so pages are terrific--characters are developed, plot builds, setting and details of 2011 v 1958 (where our hero lands each time he goes through the portal) are tight and interesting.  So far, so good.    The next 400 pages are like a pretty good TV mini-series though--we get some more characters, the plot developes a bit further, but it's getting a bit tedious. Yeah, yeah; \\"the past is obdurate\\" and a current runs through the universe that resists change, over and over again we get this. I couldn't fathom why a writer of King's talent (ok, you can dispute that) would add so much pointless dialogue and description, as well as characters who really just didn't matter or plot elements which were entirely tangential to the story.  The book could have been 200-300 pages shorter and we wouldn't have missed anything.   For the remaining million pages or so (ok, 300) it was just a matter of finishing what was started.  The Oswald and family stuff was obviously meticulously researched, and most of it was good, but did Jake really need to stalk him for so many hundreds of pages?    Mostly, I got this book because it was on the NYT list of five best novels of 2011 (although I did not read their review).  I can't imagine what the reviewer saw in it.
0062068423|3.0|Stieg Larsson's [[ASIN:0857050141 Millennium Trilogy]] made Scandinavian crime fiction hip again. So, in the wake of his success (and the vacuum created by his untimely death in 2004), Jo Nesbo was brought in to fill the empty spotlight. With only mixed results, I am afraid.<br /><br />I decided to start with REDBREAST because it is the first book of his Harry Hole series that has been translated in English (although there had been two books previous to this one in Norwegian - and there are references to the hero's previous cases). The story may be a standalone but the character development suffers from this truncation.<br /><br />The story of REDBREAST steps on two timelines that slowly converge. One is the story of a group of young Norwegian Nazis fighting on the side of the Germans during WWII. The other is a mess of a police story where a mistake prone Harry Hole stumbles onto a case of the import of a vintage (and extremely expensive) sniper rifle and then manages to fumble most clues and miss a number of opportunities to solve the mystery long before its climax.<br /><br />I am not going to continue with any more books by this writer. The narration feels forced, with a number of mood-killing reality TV references, predictable stereotypes and one-page chapters. What is worse, the characters are both underdeveloped and internally inconsistent. Nesbo is clearly not in Larsson's league.<br /><br />I gave the book an extra star for cantor. When the Germans themselves try to squiggle out of their national shame of supporting Nazism (not to mention still avoiding paying their WWII debts), it was brave for Nesbo to admit that the majority of Norwegians in the 1940's indeed supported the National Socialists and were willing collaborators of Hitler's vision.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of the book does not justify the admission price.

The DVD is very well made and the movie itself is exceptionally well made and very realistic without too much of the \\"Hollywood BS\\" normally seen in Sci-fi themes.  Computer immaging as well as acting is superb.
0062060554|3.0|This book has many things going for it. I found it, despite flawed, well written enough to make me want to keep reading to the end - as such was a good holiday page turner. However, I really had to suspend my disbelief as it became clear, to make the novel the work, the writer had to keep a very limited cast of characters and make sure the protagonist didn't ask too many questions that would ruin the suspense element of the book. If I woke up and was told I had lost my memory many years ago, I wouldn't be so accepting as Chrsitine.  Too often she would justify her lack of suspicion or doubt by saying \\"he must love me so much\\" \\"I must be such a burden, it's better not to burden him further \\" etc.  Or worse still, \\"I wanted to ask him more but then we got home and had dinner and it was too late.\\" What???!!  The most life affecting thing in the world happens to you and you and you can't react as any normal person would by shouting and screaming for answers because it's dinner time?  Also, the fact the author is male is overwhelmingly obvious. Many a good writer can take on the voice of a female protagonist, but Watson talks about Christine taking off her trousers and then her tights...who on earth wears tights under trousers? - and myriad other slippages which made it hard to believe in Christine as a character.  The character of the psychologist was so one dimensional and only there as a commentator on memory loss, that he doesn't even turn up in again in the last part of the book, despite being present in every other chapter.  I read that this book was written on a creative writing course and it shows....the cast of characters is so narrow - why do her husband and child simply give up on her and move abroad without even checking occasionally to see if she is okay?  Why does she only have one other friend? How has she managed to live all these years and make no connections with any one at all except her fake husband? What about the local shopkeepers, people she meetsin cafes etc?  However, what I will say is after letting these things slide, I did find it compelling enough to read quickly to the end and found the denoument the best part of the book - can see how it would make good movie action - and even though it is fairly obvious from the start that this man is pretending to be her husband, somehow it was still exciting seeing it played out.  So I don't regret buying the book and think it has lots to recommend it.  I just think with a bit more respect to the intelligence of the reader, it could have raised its game quite a bit and I am sure the writer is capable of that as their are sparks there that suggest such.  Just a shame about the lazy writing.

0156027321|3.0|Piscine Molitor Patel, known as \\"Pi\\" tells his life story and epic adventure as an adult looking back at both his childhood in Pondicherry, India, and his survival on a life boat in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days with a Bengal tiger.  As the son of a zookeeper and owner, Pi is forced to use all of his knowledge about animals (which is quite extensive) in order for him and his tiger to survive.  As a story of survival, Yann Martel, does a great job of writing and engaging the reader.  From this perspective, the story was thoroughly enjoyable.  However, toward the end, an already bizarre adventure took some even more bizarre and unbelievable twists... such as encountering yet another (at this time blind) castaway (a Frenchman) on the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.  Hours before what seemed the inevitable death for Pi, the Frenchman, and the tiger, both castaways decide to join in one lifeboat as `brothers' in their death.  Yet, the Frenchman decides instead to try to murder Pi and eat him, but first he is eaten by the Tiger instead.  The other plot twist toward the end, which still leaves me scratching my head, was when Pi and the tiger land on a floating island of algae, trees, and docile meerkats... here Pi is able to eat his fill of juicy algae, drink from freshwater ponds, and eat fish who apparently swim in from the ocean and die... Oh, by the way, as it turns out, the Island also consumes humans at night??? So, inspite of some weeks of luxury and comfort, Pi decides to take his tiger and once again head out to sea.  It was at this point, though late in the book, that I began to realize that much more of the story had to do with metaphor and allegory than I had previously taken it.  Perhaps, or more likely, probably this whole scene has some sort of metaphysical and religious symbolism that I can't quite place.  Speaking of religious things, Pi is a very religious boy.  Here is where the author was clearly trying to put forth a worldview for his readers to embrace.  Pi is what theologians would call a religious pluralist or syncretist.  As an Indian boy, he grew up for a love of all things Hindu.  During one family vacation, he stumbles into a Roman Catholic church, and subsequently becomes a Chrsitian (I use the term loosely here).  It's not that he rejects Hinduism, but rather he adds Christianity.  Later he does the same with Islam, and in his mind there is no contradiction.  In fact, this seems to be what the author would have the reader himself do... don't worry about the nature of truth or the law of contradiction... that, in his mind, is besides the point.  One can worship the god of Islam which fiercely claims that there is only one God, and at the same time worship the multitudes of gods and goddesses within the Hindu pantheon.  While this view of reality certainly will appeal to the postmodern mind, it turns out to be both philosophically untenable, and also religiously ignorant and offensive to those who hold dearly to each one of the faiths Pi embraces.  How can Pi embrace the Bible and ignore the first commandment - \\"You shall have no other gods before me\\"?  How can Pi be a devout follower of Islam and yet burn incense to the god Vishnu?  How can Pi embrace the pantheism of Hinduism AND the transcendent God of both Islam and Christianity? How can Pi acknowledge pain and suffering from the perspective of both a Hindu (it is an illusion) and Christian (it is very real, and God's own Son suffered under it)?  Simply put, he can't do this.  The syncretistic, postmodern view of ultimate reality that Yann Martel puts fourth may make for an element to a good story, but as a philosophy it is a shoddy bucket that can't hold water.  Conclusion: Enjoy the story, but don't turn your brain off to the philosophical implications of Martel's worldview.

B003MC5N28|3.0|- - Personal Background - -<br />Back in Middle School (Jr. High), my English Teacher told me to read this book.  I didn't.  Years later, I'm a Computer Teacher and our school requires us to have a time for reading, too.  My class read \\"Anthem\\" by Ayn Rand.  That book reminded me of this one.  So, I bought it and read it for my self.<br /><br />- - The Book - -<br />It is obscurely apparent that this is a post apocalyptic Utopia.  Good story all the way through...<br /><br />- - The Ending - -<br />At first, I thought that there may be an error. Nope. Sequel to the cliffhanger?  Not that either. According to the author, the ending is up to us...  I bought the book because I wanted entertainment... because I don't have the discipline to write one myself.  Think of it like the \\"Soprano\\" grand finale.  Intentionally left blank.<br /><br />- - Final Thoughts - -<br />Before I tell you whether you should read it or not, let me explain it as follows<br /><br />.
B004AR4WVM|5.0|Well first off just having an actual record in your hand is nice.  Then the next thing you can do while side 1 is playing is admire the artwork on the album cover.  Kinda hard to do that on a CD without a magnifying glass.  Next to the sound.  Records just have that warm sound I have never been able to duplicate on any CD and this record was recorded and mixed exquisitly.   My verdict is if you enjoy Celtic music this album is a beautifull example of this genre.  A must have to any Loreena Mckennitt fan

We are also introduced to a handful of hilarious new characters, such as Finnick Odair, who give this book a little more life.<br /><br />Not to give anything away, but the reason I give \\"Catching Fire\\" a 4/5 + not 5/5 is because I didn't like the way the quarter quell went down. I wasn't worried about the characters this time because everything seemed so...fixed.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Was originally using a Freezer 7 Pro rev2 for my Phenom II X2 unlocked to X4.  After a few years I noticed the idle temps were probably a bit higher than they needed to be, ranging from 40 to 47 Celsius.  Decided to upgrade to the 212+ and this HSF knocked my idle temps down almost a whole 15 degrees.  The fan is a bit more loud than the Freezer 7 Pro but I've already gotten used to it.  The \\"direct contact\\" heatpipe design seems much more efficient than usual heatpipes.  Another thing about the 212+ worth mentioning is that you can add another similar sized fan to an unused side to go with the fan that comes with it, but you probably won't need one.  If you don't already have this HSF, you should get it for the value, performance, and price.

B0060AY6FO|3.0|One's appreciation of this sport will depend on the expectations with which one begins it. It turns out to be an absolute mistake to enter this book thinking that P.D. James has attempted to write in the voice or manner of Jane Austen. Instead, she has borrowed a setting and characters from Austen and brought to them a Jamesian sensibility that, effective in her works set in a modern environment, seems too remote and dispassionate for a tale set in the early 19th century. She imitates forms of early 19th century discourse with moderate success, but her authorial voice is characterized by the remoteness and flat narrative objectivity of a more modern literary age. James' prose largely lacks the wit, subtlety and evocative understatement found in Austen's own narrative passages.<br /><br />So what we have is an out-of-era Jamesian mystery that utilizes many of her conventional themes and stock characters: the present impact of past social and criminal trespasses, ethical weaknesses among strong and forthright characters, chances of redemption through faith for the morally weak miscreants and exploiters encountered in different levels of society, and so forth. There are the usual red herrings that James strews in the path of her readers, some of which are cleverly (perhaps too cleverly) resolved when she finally lets her characters understand the sequence of events on the night of the violent death that lies at the center of this tale, and some of which are left completely unaddressed. From James, usually a precise deviser of timelines and character interplay, that is a little sloppy. The gunshots (plural, from what is presumably a single-shot pistol!) heard by some witnesses remain problematic and unexplained, and a witness to a central dispute in the events of the evening is never interviewed about her perceptions of the argument. That silence certainly advances the story, but leaves other characters looking inattentive and unaware of important avenues of investigation.<br /><br />As a Jamesian mystery, this tale deserves no more than two stars; nothing here approaches the excellence of even the weaker Adam Dalgliesh novels. On the other hand, as a daring and imaginative attempt to take James' mix of social and detective fiction into new territory, this tale deserves some credit; I give it another star for that.<br /><br />Austen wrote subtle comedies of society and manners, and James has mostly written subtle tragedies set in similar milieus. This book is a courageous but unsuccessful attempt to take known characters from one world view and let them play out a story in a very different one. A+ for imagination -- but only a C for realization.<br /><br />[Edited to fix a typo.]

B002BJGYUS|1.0|I've been gradually buying the Gilmore Girls TV series dvds and just started to watch them. Unfortunately, my Season One is essentially worthless because the disc identified as disc 1 contains the episodes from disc 2, so I am lacking the first episodes of the series. The discs are also in very poor (unplayable) condition. Unfortunately, I ordered this too long ago to return it, so I will have to replace it. I don't recommend this seller.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is different from other Christmas movies as it doesnt have anything to do with Santa Claus or Santas daughter or somebody having to save Christmas. It has to do with love and a few relationships in the last few weeks before Christmas and I highly recomend it. I do have to  caution you though the movie is rated r for a reason in this case some adult content so keep little ones out of the room but it is enjoyable. Merry Christmas.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch a few months ago and am still wearing it. I enjoyed how it looked stock but quickly changed out the band for a black and silver 18mm Nato band by DeBeers. It looks dramatically more expensive now. I recommend purchasing this watch and maybe a black leather band and some Nato bands for switching it up. The watches black face allows it to have a lot of different colors of bands and gives it incredible versatility for different occasions.  This watch is a must buy for those who want to pay a good price for a very accurate and fun automatic watch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|As stated by others in their reviews, this app does use excessive adds to stay free, which are annoying and at times can interrupt game play. That being said, the description mentions that you only start with ten games and have to unlock the rest. Those complaining must lack eyes. Also, to the left of the play button, there is a button where you can read the instructions for the game, so complaints about the instrucctions not being available until after game play are also unwarranted.

0525478817|5.0|Ever since her diagnosis at age 13, Hazel Grace Lancaster's cancer has always been terminal. Two years later and with tumors now in her lungs, Hazel was ready to die before a miracle drug stabilized her condition, giving her a new lease on life, at least for the time being. Now besides being out of the hospital and not dying, her life hasn't changed that much. At 16 Hazel still doesn't miss an America's Next Top Model marathon, leave the house except for classes at the community college, or have more than three friends (her parents and an author she's never met). Most of all her oxygen tank - a constant reminder of her illness - will never leave her side. Naturally, it's understandable that the cancer support group her mother insists she attend is the last place she'd choose to go. But Hazel never could've guessed that she'd meet tall, good-looking, and metaphorically-prone Augustus Waters, and that Augustus, a survivor of osteosarcoma himself, would be interested in her. Quickly becoming friends, Hazel and Augustus will do anything from reading the others' favorite book to challenging each others' deeply-held views on life and death, leaving them irrevocably changed, for better or for worse.  Besides knowing the interest-drawing title and seeing the beautifully graphic cover, I knew very little about John Green's newest novel, and in retrospect, I'm glad. It made the fact that The Fault in Our Stars was written from a female's perspective without precedent for Green a very welcome and happy surprise. Likewise, not knowing beforehand that the main characters had cancer allowed me to go into the read with no labels or stigmas attached. What having cancer has done for the characters is given them a vehicle through which they can reflect on the universal themes of life and death. And as in true John Green style, Hazel and Augustus have done so in impeccably humorous and clever ways leaving the reader smarter, not only in facts but in insight and ideas.  The first and perhaps only coherent thing I can say is that The Fault in Our Stars is my kind of John Green. Forever torn between the lightness of An Abundance of Katherines and the poignancy of Looking for Alaska, he's conveniently combined the two loves so I don't have to choose between them. If that wasn't enough instead of using his usual yet effective formula of geeky guy with quirky best friend wants unattainable girl, The Fault in Our Stars is told from the perspective of a girl who is neither particularly nerdy or popular and who likes a guy who is completely and willingly attainable from the moment they first meet. With the potential recurrences of cancer as their only real obstacle, Hazel and Augustus fall fast and hard for one another, an aspect of their romance about which I was certainly not complaining. In addition to their endearing wit, Augustus' friend Isaac, who has lost both eyes to cancer, also adds lightness to the heavy material. I enjoyed all of the cheesy blind puns, the seeing impaired video game mocking, and laugh-out-loud scenes like the car egging. Most of all though I loved Hazel and Augustus, who are both book and life smart, kind, incredibly real, and authentically flawed. Their relationship is sweet, addicting, and at times heart-wrenching. You'll want everything they can have and everything they cannot have for them. Sobbing and smiling throughout, I found The Fault in Our Stars impossible to put down until I finished its' near flawless last pages. Perhaps John Green's best book yet, it's a breath of fresh air in both his works and YA contemporary novels on grief and illness in general. It's certainly my favorite of his novels, and after rereading much of it in preparation for this review without anticipating doing so I look forward to rereads to come.
B003Y5H5AQ|2.0|I don't write reviews however the misery of the Ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" inspired me.    The movie is great, kids love it, etc.  Ultraviolet is a joke.  The download is in a proprietary format and as far as I can tell can only be played using Sony's media player.  Sure you can stream it but how do the kids watch this movie while we're in an area of poor cell reception or on a flight?  Do not buy this if you want a true digital copy!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is really fun but the description is slightly different than what the game is. Some of the games are just hard but others are like, delayed.

B0019NG73G|5.0|This was an awesome version of the orginal.  The battle scenes were more realistic and the bayonet charge down little round top felt as though I was somehow running down that hill side with the men from Maine.  The extra scenes showing the beginning of the battle put more understanding of the importance to stop and hold the high ground for the Union Army.  I highly recommend this version to anyone interested in the Battle that turned the Civil War.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show, caught the first few seasons on NetFlix and the new stuff on Amazon VOD (Seasons 3 and 4).  I love the interface for watching it, and I really love the show.  Season 4 takes it up a notch, getting really wild, and then brings it back to the small town biker gang we know and love, with a lot of plot points closed and some new fun threads to explore next season.  For people that haven't been indoctrinated into SOA, beware there is a lot of mature content - drugs, violence, sex, and the rest.  But there are also a LOT of consequences shown for the people leading these lives, in fact a lot of the show revolves around key characters wanting to escape \\"the life\\".  Highly recommended, just not for kids :).

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like others, I struggled to finish this book.  It did not hold my attention like the previous two books.  I felt like the author started to dabble too much in an area that she wasn't comfortable enough with or knowledgeable of and the result was a book with less direction and authenticity.  The entire book felt like it was written by someone in a rushed fashion.  With that said, I thought the ending was fine.  I did find it interesting that the author just wrote Gale off, but I suppose it is her book.  There could not realistically be a fairy-tale ending with the events that took place. I just wish the book was more well-written.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|pretty good games for the kids. it seems you need to be a kid to enjoy these simple games. my son and daughter really like.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Awesome free app. So many cute mini games that are super addicting. Only thing wrong is that there are no game instructions, took several tries on some of the games to figure out how they are played.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The absolutely best Bible App!  I love the reading plans, different versions and devotions. You can also set up reminders.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game. I wish you got to play all the games at the beginning. I only have sixteen games unlocked
B0054JZC6E|3.0|frustrating to have to play their choice of games to get to even see the other choices.  The first set of games are not the type I like.  The directions, though, do help.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is actually not a bad game its jjust i don't get some of the levels and they don't even explain how to do them
B0060FXDCG|5.0|It was a holiday gift, however my brother-in-law was very pleased and watched them right away.  I was pleased with the speed in which they shipped and arrived!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy this app.  it's challenging and intriguing...definitely would recommend to anyone that is wanting something to pass the time and enjoy yourself doing so.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great smooth game on kindle fire. brings great variety. never get bored. fun cool game for kids and adults. enjoy
1451648537|4.0|I've worked in several types of companies, typically with non visionaries but have seen Steve Job-type people.  The visionary is often a curse - this person can see the future as if it were already here, and doesn't care when \\"reality\\" hits and subtle things like no money, no sales, etc kick in.  Their drive makes improbable things possible, but also has other consequences.  There is a message board on Quora that asks the question \\"if Steve Jobs was so bad then why did anyone work for him\\" and the highest-rated responder says he's worked with many \\"rude\\" visionaries who grind their employees down, but they do it because \\"it must be done\\".  The interesting thing is that the different between a visionary and a stubborn \\"rude\\" person is whether the product takes off, which can be a matter of timing, luck, etc, so we have to contemplate that Steve Jobs in a different life would be a drifter who few liked, and in fact we find out that he almost didn't do Apple to live the life of a Monk.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app for games. gives you a lot of different choices of games to play. u use points u earn from playing games to get more games.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I bought this awhile back and completed it in fair time. thought I'd go back and try again but I cannot seem to find the key that opens the lock on the stairs.anyone know where it is?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and I like it. So does my ten year old. It's a fun way to pass the time.
0439023521|5.0|Great book for the post-apocalyptic society fans out there! The plot is extremely thought out and the entire book works out like a puzzle. No endings or twist that make you feel like the author wrote herself into a corner and took a cheesy way out or anything. Also, does have a touch of love story but just enough to make it interesting and give the reader some relief from the books brutality. Great book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it would ne a bit lame for a free game, but it is a lot of fun and a great gaiety of games to play.  I would tell everyone that likes puzzles that this ia a great one to get.
0439023491|3.0|Don't read this unless you want spoilers....<br /><br />This book was going along fine.  The recaps of the first novel were brief and didn't mind those.  But I did mind the fact that this was going to be essentially Hunger Games, Take 2.  Really?  Going back in the ring again?  Didn't the author already write about that in book 1?  Again, it was fast paced, but couldn't get the taste of deja-vu out of my mouth the entire time.  Plus, I didn't think any of the plot moved - not with the love triangle, not with possible rebellion (until the end).  Did not live up to the first book at all.
B001PPMJHQ|5.0|Too many fine men in here for women not to like it.  Too much action, blood, and all out badassness for guys not to like it.  Guy Richie does it again AND it has Idris Elba in it!
0439023513|2.0|Maybe I am comparing it to the first 2 novels (Hunger Games - awesome!, Catching Fire - good) but this last book was a let down.  It was slow and tedious without building up Katniss or the love triangle or even the war.    Warning - SPOILERS:  I know they did not want Katniss on the front line, so we saw everything through her eyes and I felt that we were just on the side line of the rebellion until the end.  Also, Collins seem to just want to kill characters off for the heck of it.  Every death was just glossed over and seemed pointless.  And the resolution of the love triangle was just blah - no big decision, one kind of left and the other stayed around so it seemed like Katniss chose that one.  Katniss never developed into the Mockingjay that I had hoped.  There was a glimmer of hope at the end when she shot the last arrow of the war (which I guess did equal out her vote to continue Hunger Games), but she never even dealt with the consequences (just tried to drug herself).    END SPOILERS  Probably the only parts of this book were the supporting characters, like Finnick.    Really, save yourself the trouble and read the spoilers instead of the book.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|Here once again Chris Daughtry delivers a awesome collection of song. He truly shpould have been the winner on Idol but he's just fine without their support!. Great CD from start to finish!
0439023521|5.0|Wow, this book is amazing!  I literally could not put this book down.  It was action packed from the start!  I am not one for the romantic triangles, which is so overused now, but this was subtle so I was fine with this.  I was really scared for Peeta and Katniss and rooted for them throughout the book.  This novel was great and lived up to the hype.
B0031MA8VA|5.0|I pretty much go everywhere with it and swoon over the letters. The brief description that accompanies each letter is helpful in identifying the writer (of the letters)
0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  Really nice hardback set with dust covers and box.  She loves it!  Arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This product is Amazing! if you are on the fence about it get it! I bought it mainly to carry my PS3 in safety through the airport and thought it would be nice if I didn't have a TV where I was going but it is awesome, with headphones and the screen closer to you than a large TV it is really quite immersive. Highly Recommended!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love this show in so many ways. The Cast is amazing, great writing and directing and how can you not love a good quantum physics joke. I got  season 1 and after the first disc ended, i got back on Amazon got them all. I haven't liked sit-com this much in a long time.
B005EL6SUG|5.0|We got this for our 6yr old for Christmas and left it in the box for him to assemble.  He was able to do so over time with only a few corrections along the way!  He assembled the engine first, which he could play with right away.  Then the other cars and buildings were put together over the next few days. Each one took under an hour for our novice lego builder. The train runs great and my son loves driving it. The track is easy to assemble and holds together very well.<br /><br />We ordered the light kit to add on based on some other reviews.  With no instructions for incorporating the lights, our current implementation has some wires hanging out, but that's the way my son likes it so it's fine.  (My husband used some additional lego pieces we had to hide the wires and add the lights to look more correct to us, but that was not the way it was allowed to stay - haha!)<br /><br />It's impressive the amount of detail that each train car and the conveyer belt incorporate.  We've shown off the train to many people and everyone is equally impressed. Legos have come a long way since I was a kid!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a similar app on my droid2 but I prefer this one. No problems so far and addictive! so far so good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love this app! the games are fun and easy. I'm always entertained. any age can have fun with this. I'm not too.impressed with the graphics however.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Easy to play.  instructions available for each one.  not too tough to earn the minimum points, at least for the first level.  ads are a little annoying though.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app had me unsure at first. I draw on physical material, not computers but I picked up the express version, played with it. and downloaded the full version five minutes later. the tutorial isn't very helpful and I accidentally erased entire layers of work,so be carefully and save often, but its an amazing tool on my kindle fire's ample screen. I'm amazed at what you can do withva sensitive touch screen like the fire's. I made my own stylus just to use this app better. anyone who is artistically inclined will have a fabulous time, if you are looking for a Doodle app for your child, do not purchase this app. try the express version if your skeptical definantly worth the .99&cent;.   (In order to save your work you must buy the full version)
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Breaking Bad is the best show on TV. After watching the first three seasons, everything else seems boring. I am bugging out waiting on season four to be released.
145551389X|5.0|A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!  This book is AMAZING! The pictures are so beautiful & give you just a bit deeper glimpse into the world of Lady Gaga!  If you weren't already a fan, you will be after this!  This photographer was amazing in capturing the essence of Gaga, without use of any words!  The overall size of the book is large, which has perfect sized photos.  A BARGAIN at the price because it is worth so much more! If you are even \\"creeping\\" into Little Monster territory...this will push you over the edge to full fledged 'Little Monster' world.  Thank you Terry Richardson & Lady Gaga, for your talent & sharing your beauty with the world!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've used a lot of devotionals, study booklets, small groups, etc...but this app is so much fun to use!! If you like, you can set it to read to you as you follow along. Easy set up and very User friendly. Great App!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game ever I beat it in one day I rate it five stars in a row good game guys
B000RZIGVS|5.0|The only problem with this item is that I paid approximately $230 before Christmas, and when it came to me there was a price tag stuck to the front that said $125. Gave it to my boyfriend as a gift, he was thrilled, and has had absolutely no problems whatsoever!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Got this for free and it does exactly what it says it does! Showed it off to some people and they were impressed. One iPhone users was upset that he couldn't do this with his phone. Score 1 for Android!
B004ZJZQFG|5.0|U-571 is by far the best movie about WWII. The visual and audio special effects add a touch of reality to the movie. I gave it 5 stars, but it deserves 50! :)
B004LWZW7O|4.0|When I put the movie in my husband asked, \\"what is this?\\" I told him the title but didn't mention Justin Timeberlake. Mostly because I didn't want him to have any opinion before we started. He had no idea who the star was and really enjoyed the movie. At the end he said, \\"that was actually really good.\\"<br /><br />It is an interesting concept that actually reminded me a little of Logan's Run. I know many won't know what I am talking about after all it was from 1976, but I really love that movie growing up.<br /><br />In Logan's Run once you reach 30 you die. This is accepted as your fate and everyone goes except for the runners who don't want to die. For In Time, once you reach 25 you stop aging and suddenly get a digital counter on your arm that basically counts down your life in a way to keep the population controlled.<br /><br />The only people who live long are the rich. Instead of currency you are paid in time and pay out in time. Your counter is replenished with time when you work, or if someone transfers time to you, otherwise it counts down.<br /><br />Justin as Will receives time (a lot of time) from someone he helps. When he is falsely accused of murder, he must figure out a way to bring down the system where the wealthy live forever and the poor scramble for every moment. Stealing time from those who fall asleep. It's easy, you simply put your counter against theirs and go!<br /><br />I had high hopes for this movie and I must admit, I LOVED it. It is a great Sci-fi fix. While I think it could have been better and I am not sure that Justin is a great actor. I truly did enjoy it.  Will has time, Will has no time, Will takes time, Will gives time. Sounds boring but honestly it is pretty creative. Different! The only negative thing my husband said was, \\"Justin needs to use his big boy voice.\\"<br /><br />Personally it was thought provoking. How would you spend your time? How would you live your life if you know exactly how long you had to live it?<br /><br />A+
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I like this app because it allows me to run and monitor utilities on my computer without actually having to be sitting in front of it. I can clean my system, do malware and antivirus deep scans and defrag my drive without having to be right there. It's very useful to do all this while I'm at work and helps save time that I would rather use fragging.<br /><br />Being a person concerned about privacy and hackers and so on, it is a little difficult to allow a program like this on my computer, but I cannot deny the usefulness of this app and will just have to be extra alert for anything going on out of the ordinary. I wish I could give a more definitive rating regarding the safety of this app/program, but I'll have to leave that to somebody more knowledgeable about it.<br /><br />Overall, seems like a great product.
0545403359|5.0|I truly enjoyed the Book War Horse. It was one of those, \\"can't put it down books\\". It is the first time I've read any of his books. I shall read more of them.  The only thing I would really like that would complete the book would be a painting or photo of a horse that epitimizes Joey. I'd also like to see the same of that black horse. I plan on buying the DVD when it comes out. I am sure they chose horses that resemble both of them in the movie.  I am especially impressed reading about the fact that the author had children come to their farm and learn where food comes from. Imagine, something like 30,000 children over the years. My hat it off to you. PJA
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice interaction and a decent gameplay. aggravating interface, but easily adjusted. good overall job on the game. it is not half bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|after searching for simply solitaire and finding EVERYTHING but this is very relaxing. I grew up playing this game and sometimes the oldies are the best!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is outstanding.  it provides all I need:  current status, hour-by-hour, multi-day forecast, radar in motion, and video weather reports.  it far exceeds whet other apps offer.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|This is a really, really good movie. Brit Marling's a new name I will keep an eye on for more movies of hers.<br /><br />Above all the story telling is phenomenal.<br /><br />Physicists have long suggested that there maybe multiple universes; at least that's what the math is hinting us of such possibility. What happens when another universe that was created based on a decision path cracks wide open and the two universes slightly overlap? We'd see the Earth-Moon above the sky on the Earth we live on. We'd see it everywhere we go. Big circle, small circle, like cogs. We'd try to communicate with the beings on the other Earth. People on both Earths are ever so slightly different based on decisions they've made and circumstances that influenced their behavior. In some cases, like that of the woman we see on the cover, a slight change results in consequences exponentially divergent from what might have been, and is.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I found the game to be not only interesting but somewhat challenging. Would recommend. this game to other casual gamers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its an alright game. some of the levels are way hard.i guess I'm still going for the challenge. its entertaining when there's nothing else to do
0062060554|4.0|Who are we? We are more than our physical attributes; we all are a sum total of our experiences and memories. What if you only have the present, because you have no memory of the past and no tomorrow because what you learn today will be erased from your mind? Christine Lucas lives in this state and says that she feels like an animal just existing. Each morning she awakens as a twenty something young woman only to find a more mature woman staring back at her in the bathroom mirror. Pictures are carefully placed around the mirror tells her that the middle aged married man she's left sleeping in the bed she awoke from is Ben, her husband.<br /><br />Each morning, Ben tells her that she was in an accident and was severely injured twenty years ago and they love each other very much and are quite happy. Later in the morning, Christine receives a phone call on a second cell phone from Dr. Nash telling her where her journal is and that she is his patient receiving treatment; Treatment that Ben is unaware of.  In the journal Christine reads the bold notation: Don't Trust Ben! Suffering severe amnesia, Christine tells her story in her journal as she gets flashes of memories that burn brightly then flicker as a lit candle in room quickly filling with CO2.<br /><br />C.J. Watson has created a brilliant debut novel. We readers like Christine don't know who trust, but we know something isn't quite right. We are afraid for Christine. We want her to be alright. We wish she can get her memory and her life back and live again. Told mostly in journal form, Watson steadily builds suspense throughout BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP until the electrifying ending that surprised this reader. I highly recommend this wonderful debut novel.

0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is a hero but, as he points out, not any more so than the folks he served with.  That includes people of other nations such as the Polish GROM that he was so complementary of.  May God bless them all.  According to some, this book is controversial.  No doubt this has to do with the descriptions of enemy combatants as savages and how Chris does not grieve every night over their loss.  I would like to believe that, if I were in Chris' place, I would feel the same way.  These people were intent on doing American's and other Iraqi's harm.  Their backward religion has taught them that the slaughter of innocents is OK and, in fact, rewarded.  I have always said that nobody kills more muslims than another muslim...and that's a fact.  Chris' goal was the protection of the honorable and the innocent.  He and his comrades were very successful and, because of the number of scumbags they killed, this world is a better place.  Now, before you bleeding hearts weigh in on this review just remember, those same scumbags want to cut your head off too.  You cannot snuff out their hatred with pretty talk and warm feelings.  Going on a world wide apology tour, like Obama did, will be interpreted as weakness.  These people understand dominant military power.  And for those of them that might have forgotten, Chris and his comrades helped to drive the point home.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are hard but its fun.  it doesn't crash.  wish there were more games for the younger kids.  fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome I can play any game I want plus you get tons of free points that's why I am writing this review
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Wasnt sure at first!  But it is fun and addictive! Great app that just helps pass the time. Works great on the Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has lots of fun games. some mindless others you can't beat some you might not want to play again but its fun to pass the time.
1451627289|5.0|This was the first Stephen King novel I have ever read. I have seen a few of the movies based on his books, but never read his books. This book sucked me in, in a few pages of reading. I love his writing style. He is very descriptive and this makes it easy to imagine what is going on in the book. The story line is awesome! Who doesn't like a good time travel book? This book helped me visualize what it was like to live in the late 50's into the early 60's.  This book isn't really about what the world would be like if JFK wasn't assassinated (although it talks about it near the end of the book). This book is really about Jake Epping, a man from the present, living his life in the 50-60's.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm glad to have finally found a game for free that's actually a great time waster. There are, of course, those few games that are near impossible to beat, but I'd rather have the challenge.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|It's just ads and incomprehensible games with no directions. Don't waste your time. If I could, I would give it zero stars.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I love the sturdiness of the shell because I can just throw the Fire into my bag without worries.  I would buy it again.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|all the fun great games I use to play. great for all ages. I spend hours on this! thanks for a great game!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This works really well, expecially if you are using the same wifi as y our computer...  I use this while im in class all the time when I need to get into some of my files
B0058VW36U|4.0|Beat the game after a few weeks of here and there play but go to get more levels and nothing. &quot;update cant install&quot;  Bs - i even paid for it.  Amazon youve been letting the app store get worse and worse.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|so far I love the app but it does take some time to figure out how to make it flow and organize it to my liking.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|This movie really surprised me. I really liked Tom Hardy in Inception, so when I heard that this movie is going to be released I looked forward to it. For some reason it did not do well in the movie theaters and I missed seeing it on the big screen. Nonetheless, this movie should have been aired way longer in the movie theaters. It's an amazing movie and I can only recommend it. You do not need to be a MMA fan or a sports fan to like this movie. Give this movie a chance and you will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is addictive and fun! Great way to relax and do something mindless. I like that you have to work your way up through the levels.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It was an entertaining look into the tort system.  I laughed, cheered for the hero, and was disgusted by our need for tort reform, all at the same time:)
0439023521|5.0|My friends told me I should read these books and I put it off for three months before buying the kindle version. I loved it from the first word. To you, Suzanne Collins, I LOVE YOUR BOOKS! Thank you so so so so so much!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This set of games is very fun. I also like that not all of the games are available at the beginning and you have to unlock most of them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazingly awesome in all ways you will have tons of fun and play cool games that get harder as you go.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Product works great and was shipped quickly. Works a lot better than some others I have tried in the past.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Bought this cover to use with my Kindle touch, and it fits great. The elastic is quite snug, with no wiggle (which I was a bit worried about, since it's made for a larger model) and with about a half inch setback between the edges of the device and the outer edge of the case.   After looking at the Kindle branded options for the latest models, I was less than impressed with the gadget-style covers they were offering. I wanted my books to still feel like books, and this fit the bill. I love it. The outer cover is quality leather, soft and pliable (dreamily embossed with various city names). The inside is lined with a soft microsuede fabric and includes a pocket in the cover that I've been using as a sort of handle when I read with the cover folded all the way back.  The only reason that I deducted a star was for the lack of a closure (don't get me wrong, it's a sleek sexy case without a cumbersome clasp, but I'm worried that it will suffer intrusions from the random beasty things that live at the bottom of my purse). I purchased this from a \\"real\\" store, and the packaging had sneakily included magnets in the inserts in the pocket and straps, so that it seemed to have an embedded magnetic closure. But, alas, upon getting it home and pulling out the packing material, I figured out my mistake. It was by no means enough to make me want to return it, just a bit of a SIGH moment. I'll probably just use an elastic band (ala the old Kindle case style) in order to keep the screen safe from my keys and the other large beasty things that live at the bottom of my purse.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|To download your digital copy into iTunes, do this:  1. Find the email address for contacting Flixter UltraViolet Digital Copy Customer Support. It's on the DVD insert that has your Redemption Code number.   2. Email them that you need help downloading your digital copy to iTunes. You will need to include your Redemption Code number.  3. 1 hour later (in my case anyway), they will email you a new code that can be used in iTunes.  4. That's it.
0062082353|5.0|This great book gives a glimpse of what our elite warriors are made. The book dramatises, in first hand account, the feelings and motivations of those great men and also of their families.  This book lets us realize that for these men, it is not about the killing...it is about the saving of lives.  Troops are sent somewhere with a mission to accomplish.  These brave men and women are there doing their job. Chris and his fellow Seals were there to help them complete our country's mission and bring home as many of our young soldiers as they possibly could.    This book helps us remember to appreciate and thank the young men and women who are out there facing indescribable horrors and risking their lives doing what their country has asked of them.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this cd so much bought for my best friend and daughter in law. Found that both my husband and son enjoy just as much so, not just a cd for women.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games to waste time.  Only just started to play but I like so far.  Games are simple &amp; easy to play.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Took me awhile to figure out how to get audio to play through my phone and also annoyed at PC's default resolution setting (which screwed up my desktop icon placement) but found found setting to not change PC resolution on connect and now everything is perfect. Beyond my expectations, actually. Worth paying for!

B006VYYUKU|5.0|If you are in your late 30's or 40 something, then you grew up in the 70's, when people actually bought 12' round vinyl discs and played them on a turntable! If, by chance, you were really into high quality audio sound (refered to as an audiophile), then you should be well acquainted with this musical offering.   A company known as Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL), out of California, pioneered the \\"Original Master Recording\\" album. Also referred to as a \\"half-speed master\\". This company would seek out and only accept a first generation master tape to re-issue a popular music album. They made the choices based on popularity and sonic quality. The first few offerings were records of recorded \\"nature sounds\\" such as lightening, wind, streams, birds, etc. I think one was called The Power and the Majesty. The very first musical selection (catalog #1-005) was Supertramp's Crime of the Century. That's one of the reason's I bought this album. As a young music buyer of the day (late '78) I had not heard of Supertramp. I did know who Pink Floyd was and of course, the Beatles. I was surprised that Crime of the Century kept showing up in the MFSL offerings along with Dark Side of the Moon, Steely Dan's Aja, Fleetwood Mac I, and The Beatles Abbey Road. MFSL's Original Master Recordings were limited editions of 25,000 pressings.   In the early '80's, they began offering Ultra High Quality Records. Limited to only 5,000 pressings. These were the most incredibly high-quality analog phonograph records ever produced by anyone. Heavy, 200 gram records, pressed on virgin vinyl, so clean you could see light through it.   Again, Supertramp's Crime of the Century was one of the first five offerings, along with Floyd's Dark Side. I'm talking about a record that cost $50! Only the ultimate in sound quality music was considered for these very special discs. Even a regular Original Master Recording record cost more that a compact disc does now! About $17.   All this history lesson in sound recording media, that I have presented here, is simply to justify the fact that Crime of the Century is quite possibly the finest sounding achievment in all of recorded rock music. A \\"masterpiece\\" as another reviewer put it (pety brawl). Asking the question as to why it didn't stand in the same ranks as Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\"? Well...it Does! And it always has. review by Richard Thompson - Music Fanatic

B005RQQ2JU|3.0|Early in Chris Isaak's career, there was a common critical dig that Chris was a slavish Elvis impersonator with a jones for Roy Orbison heartache. His videos for \\"Dancin'\\" and \\"Blue Hotel\\" did little to dispel that notion, despite that his second album had already shown Chris to be an astoundingly good singer and rapidly coming into his own as a songwriter. \\"Wicked Game,\\" which out-Orbisoned Roy finally pushed the comparisons aside and made Chris a star. But he never shed that love of the Sun Sound, which followed his albums as he delivered them over the last three decades.<br /><br />It's on \\"Beyond The Sun\\" that Chris pays homage to his old 45's. A chance comment by Sam Phillips that he was a fan of Chris' musical style and sincerity made Chris decide to gather his band, bone up on those classic Sun Studio 45's and make a trip to Memphis to record them on their home turf. I went for the double disc edition as a long-time fan and, while not disappointing, feel a bit awkward at rating the set higher than 3 stars. If you're going to dig into classics from Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, or Jerry Lee Lewis, you have to wonder if Chris wanted to claim them for himself or just make a record of tributes? \\"I Can't Help Falling In Love\\" (Presley) is such a stunning recreation that you could easily fool friends into thinking it's the King himself. Johnny Cash isn't quite the same, but Chris takes \\"Ring of Fire\\" and does little to change the song from the sound of its original single.<br /><br />Lesser known material fares better. Songs like \\"Dixie Fried\\" (Carl Perkins) or \\"So Long I'm Gone\\" (Warren Smith) help to balance the familiarity factor. Chris also chips in an original titled \\"Lovely Loretta,\\" a cool bit of Memphis swing. Michelle Branch shows off her chops with a duet on \\"My Happiness\\" (Presley), a highlight on the set. All across \\"Beyond The Sun,\\" Isaac delivers convincing performances and shows his reverence for the material. It's thoroughly enjoyable, just don't expect transcendence.n't expect transcendence.

0865478570|2.0|If something makes people think about translation I'm all for it, and Penguin have done Bellos proud - as I say on amazon.co.uk, a masterpiece of product placement. (They're trying again with the considerably worse Wired for Culture.) The unstoppable advance of a kind of watered-down English, like the destruction of natural habitats, is of concern to us all, and there are nuggets among the waffle (the Arabian Nights of Mardrus that was truer to the original than.. the original; a prime piece of 17c legalistic franglais - indeed, the whole chapter on EU law and other less theoretical chapters in the second half of the book would make fine stand-alone journalism) but waffle in the main it is. #29 is a fine example of fatuity. Beating the Bounds? I'd say beating about the bush - or disappearing up your own autocue. David Bellos is the Man who would be Gnomic faced with the bleeding obvious. 'Translation is another name for the human condition.' Would you like maple syrup with that, David?<br /><br />Bellos is no doubt in many people's good books (heh heh) because of the Perec connexion, and the narrator's voice, as it were, comes across here with considerable charm, the (very) odd bit of slang striking the only jarring note, but trying to generalise about translation, to non-practitioners anyway, is like trying to generalise about poetry or love or carpentry. Just do it!

B0068AWQQ2|2.0|This is one of those remakes where they basically could have given it a different name and 3/4's of the people watching wouldn't have even realized they were *watching* a remake.  This was very poorly written, there was no suspense as they rushed into the action as soon as possible.  part of what made the original great was the disbelief that there was even a vampire in the first place, it was a great source of tension and suspense in the movie.  That doesn't exist in the remake, I barely had my popcorn ready as my wife and I sat down to a horror movie night when the fact that there was a vampire and everyone accepted that fact and decided to kill it was revealed.  Everything seemed so unnecessarily rushed just to get to the action scenes that it took away from the story.  I'm not against remakes or re-imagings but I left this movie thinking that it would have been so so so much better if they had just stuck to the original script.  The acting was good and the special effects were......well, they actually weren't that great, but they were good enough.  It seems to me right now, after seeing some movies like this lately, that movies are either poorly written these days or I'm past the age where a hot chick and a car chase are enough to do it for me.
1451629184|5.0|I recently figured out how to get ebooks on my laptop.  I spent the next week wondering, with all that is out there to read, what will change me for the better?  Today I found A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard and knew immediately who could change me and I needed to know how she got through so many years of captivity.  Jaycee Dugard spent her life in a reality no one should ever know but everyone should read.  There are too many secrets in our world, too many people afraid to make right of something they see wrong.  You can not close your eyes to what Jaycee had to go through, but we all have the chance to discover what real survival of the spirit is.  What making the most of the worst you can ever imagine is.  I had no hesitation buying this book.  I hope Jaycee gets support from all readers out there.  I am thoroughly touched and impressed with how much Jaycee has to offer still and wish her family a beautiful life.

B003Y5H53S|5.0|The characters are great to watch and listen to.  The animation is also very good.  The story line still pertinent for this day and age, as we, especially in the desert, need to be aware of how we use or preserve our resources.  I always enjoy anything \\"characterized\\" by Johnny Depp, and he doesn't disappoint here either.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|When you see the cast of actors in this movie you would never know that the movie itself was about bird watching, but it is, and the actors do a great job within it. There is definitely chemistry within the cast and you can see this from the beginning to the end of this movie. I loved the depth that each of the actors brings to the movie and you are not assaulted by off the wall humor, but humor is still there (just not as much as you would expect with this cast). You also are not assaulted by colorful language, but instead this movie is one that is well acted, well thought out with a strong plot. The movie is definitely one that I would recommend as I know you will enjoy it as thoroughly as I did!
B004SB60OC|5.0|I first heard Christina on Pandora, and loved her song \\"Jar of Hearts\\" immediately.  I am so glad I bought this CD.  She uses a wide variety of styles.  Especially love \\"Jar of Hearts\\", a beautiful ballad with an undercurrent of cello, \\"Interlude\\" which is a bit Enya-ish, \\"The Lonely\\", which is sad but wonderful, and \\"Tragedy\\" which a little bit more edgy, and reminiscent of a song from The Lord of the Rings.  The song \\"Distance\\" reminds me of the style of Glen Hansard of \\"Once\\" fame.  I thoroughly enjoy this album and highly recommend it.

B003VWU2WA|3.0|I bought this probably 7 years ago. I used it on windows XP during that time and loved it. The mute no longer works but having the big knob to adjust volume was what I used it for. As others have said, the drivers are a bit funky. I would have to unplug and plug it back in on occasion because it would stop working. I just built a brand new computer with windows 7 and there ARE NO DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS 7! I even went to Griffintech's website and chatted with a rep. to make sure. Now I am stuck with the keyboard volume controls which suck. I tried all of the current drivers and could not get any of them to work. I really miss this little device. It is unfortunate that I will no longer be able to use this because Griffin won't update their drivers. I give it three stars because when it worked I loved it.
0767810856|5.0|this is a romantic comedy / drama from rags to riches kind of movie this is also a chick flick !!! its about a police officer and his snotty stuck up wife and a real sweet waitress . he offers her a lottery ticket because he did not have enough money to leave her a tip, and they agree to split the ticket if they win the New York State Lottery. wife finds out and gets upset and starts all kinds of problems,to find out what happens next you need to rent or buy this movie! if you are a movie collector this a must have movie . so grab the popcorn and your favorite drink and enjoy this movie, I give it a 10 plus a 5 star rating!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|IF YOU'VE NEVER READ GAME OF THRONES.....Should you watch the show or read the book first? (no real spoilers)<br /><br />First - just to note (in case you didn't know), Game of Thrones is based on a book series called \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" by George R.R. Martin.  There are five so far (the first written in 1996, the most recent written in 2011), and he's planning to write at least two more (at the time of this review - 1/4/12).  \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is the first installment of the series.  HBO decided they liked the name \\"Game of Thrones\\" rather than \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" (I can see why - sounds less fantasy and more mainstream) and so that's the name of the whole series.  Each season is based on one novel.  So the first season was based on \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and the second season will be based on the second book, \\"A Clash of Kings,\\" and so on.  Well, it may not be in exact perfect book order, and it will be interesting to see what they do in books 4 and 5, which have overlapping storylines.  Plus, aCoK is really too long to have in one season...the second season will air in April, 2012.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the original question.  Show or book first?<br /><br />This is a really difficult question.  For most books turned into show/movie, you'll want to read the book first, because it is usually superior to the adaptation.  However, we are talking about HBO here, so be prepared for a VERY good show.  Are there differences from the book?  Yes, but in general it stays true to the storyline and all differences are done artistically and were approved by the author, George R.R. Martin.<br /><br />NUMBER OF CHARACTERS - There are a LOT of characters in this story.  Because the show has to be condensed somewhat from a 800 page novel to 10 hours of airtime, it can get really confusing to know who is who while watching the show.  It can get confusing in the book as well, but things are usually more detailed for you in the book so it is easier to reference.  However, it always help to put a face to a name, so that's a plus for the show.  But once again, sometimes there will be a really long part in the book that will be eliminated entirely from the show, and the absence can throw you off a little.  The book definitely has more backstory, and you'll probably be able to more accurately identify characters when watching the show after.<br /><br />NEW SCENES FOR THE SHOW - Since we can't just look into the minds of the characters as in the book, there are a lot of invented scenes between characters in the show.  This isn't a bad thing, but it's just to give you more of an idea of who these people are and what is going on in their minds.  There is also a (sort-of) made-up character for the show, the prostitute Ros.  At first I thought she was added in there for just eye candy or something and found that sort of annoying, but ultimately I think she is just an outlet for us to get into the minds of characters since it's a show and not a book.  Also, her interactions with Greyjoy display (in my opinion) his disgusting personality, and since he's a much more important character in book 2 than 1 (his personality and backstory are almost non-existent in Book 1, they just hint at it), Ros was a way to kind of ease his character into the second season.<br /><br />DIFFERENCES - Like I said, the show is generally true to the book.  However, if you read the book first, you may get super annoyed with some of the differences when watching the show.  One of the major differences is ages.  Everyone is a lot older in the show (the children, especially), and people are generally a lot different and better looking.  That's not really an issue though, or else the show would seem odd and creepy.  An example is Dany, a 13 year old in the book, is in frequent nude and sex scenes.  In the show, I think they say she is 17 (but the actress is actually 24).  It would also seem silly if Robb (14ish in the book) was actually 14 in the show, with him playingthe type of role he has.  My major gripe was a few storyline differences that I didn't think were necessary at all for the show, but I'm a nitpicker.  An example is the major absence of direwolves in the show.  They're there, but are much more prevalent in the book!  I love the direwolves and think they are very symbolic, and wish HBO did more with them.  Maybe next season.<br /><br />DO YOU LIKE TO READ? - That's probably the best way to decide.  The book is BIG.  Around 800 pages.  It's similar in size to a Harry Potter book, and in my opinion, even more captivating.  But it's a LOT of material, and you have to really pay attention due to the number of characters and intertwining story lines.  If reading isn't your strong suit, the show may be better at breaking it down for you.  If you are interested in reading all of the books, that's about 5,000 pages to trek through.  For comparison - if you read the Harry Potter books, all 7 books in the series are roughly the same number of pages as the first FOUR books of A Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />YOU CAN'T GO WRONG<br /><br />If you are an HBO fan, you know that HBO doesn't produce garbage.  This show is a masterpiece - one of my favorite shows in a long, long time.  It reminds me of a mix of Lord of the Rings and the Sopranos, with it's edgy, unforgiving attitude and a splash, but not too much, of fantasy.  People aren't casting spells with wands like Harry Potter or anything.  The fantasy aspect is very, very subtle.  Actually, way more subtle than I expected.  It's very reminiscent of medieval times.  The acting is superb and like most HBO shows, there aren't a lot of big names.  Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage are probably the most well-known.  The scenery and the show itself is drop dead gorgeous, however, maybe due to budget constraints, the show feels quite a bit \\"smaller\\" than the book.  Feasts, castles, celebrations, cities....all seem smaller in the show.<br /><br />I think all changes in the show were done very well and nothing butchered the book.  Although nothing can compare to the books for me, I think aids it in really bringing it to life.  Plus, Martin was along for the ride of the writing and making of the show, so you know he'll try not to let writers deviate too much from the heart of the story.<br /><br />My two major recommendations are:<br /><br />#1 - watch show, read book, re-watch show: this is better if it's hard for you to get into books or just really want to see it first.  Then you can read the book, and think, \\"Hmm...I never remember seeing this person,\\" and low and behold, when you watch it the second time around, that character IS there.  It really puts the pieces together.  However, prepare to be confused.  This is normal. The show has many, many major characters, and it can be really difficult to keep track.  I know several people who only watched the show and didn't read the book who can't point out Varys.  If you read the book, you damn well know who that is!  The show and the book alike both start out a little bit slow....but trust me, they both quickly turn into something quite thrilling and action-packed.  Just wait until Season 2.<br /><br />#2 - read the book, then watch the show: the only downside to this is that you may sometimes be disappointed if things don't live up to your idea of the books standards.  You might find yourself saying things like, \\"WHAT!  That's not how they consummated!\\" and nitpick.  However, you'll understand MUCH more of of what is happening in the show with your book knowledge.<br /><br />Also, this book was right up HBO's lane.  HBO likes to make gritty, real, intense and often unforgivingly brutal shows.  There aren't any good or bad guys, and when you think you found one....well, take a closer look.  Sick of fantasy books where things are too black and white (too good vs. evilish) or where the big characters are never killed off no matter how many deadly situations they are in?  Sick of books just not being REAL?  Well, Game of Thrones, the book and the movie, are a fantasy lover's dream.  Whether or book or show first, watch and read them both to really appreciate the art of Game of Thrones and the Song of Ice and Fire and series.very well and nothing butchered the book.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle and it does not work. It keeps telling me that sn Internet connection is needed, why if it's a downloaded app. It also keeps kicking me out. It is the most frustrating thing ever. I took it to church to use it and keep my notes in. I missed half the sermon just trying to get this app to work. I have since uninstalled and begun looking for a different Bible to put on my Kindle. maybe I will have to buy the book to be put on here.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Nothing else needs be said. If your into sci-fi and haven't seen this, your doing yourself a disfavor. So what are you waiting for?
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This apps does a better job than any others I've used. The Google tasks sync is working with ICS on my Galaxy Nexus. Simple, but good features.
B005HS4CUY|1.0|All three of the 3D discs in this package had the same problem - they would play for a while, then they would stop playing ... after a few seconds start up again but at an earlier point in the movie.  I don't have this problem with any of my other 3D (or non-3D) discs.  Just this series.  In my opinion, they were poorly made.  Great Toy Story content, just bad media.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a very clean app. It's easy to use and seems better organized than other free note apps I've tried.
B005BDZN62|5.0|If you like West Side Story, you'll love this product.  In addition to the blue ray disc, the special features disc that comes with this product is fantastic.  You'll hear from people (actors, choreographers, directors) who were part of making the film, as well as folks who were involved with the original play.  This is a great value.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|If you have liked the first two of Director Michael Bay's Transformer movies, you will like this one as well.  If you thought Transformers was good, and Transformers: Revenge of the fallen was just OK, then you are in the same boat I am, and you will be pleasantly surprised by Transformers: Dark of the Moon.  If you hated them both, then you're not reading this.<br /><br />The visuals are, as has been the case with this iteration of Transformers, outstanding.  The Blu-ray quality is a must in my opinion as the details in the action sequences are spectacular.  I personally don't have a 3D television so I cannot comment on that feature, but, the video and audio quality made watching in high definition with an average sound system a very fun experience.  The visuals are very clear, the colors look great, and all of the explosions rumble proudly.<br /><br />The story is, well, good enough.  I wasn't watching for the story.  I was watching for big robots and stuff blowing up.  The story delivered that in large supply.  If the goofiness of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen turned you off, I can honestly say that it has been toned down here, and the action, not the dialogue, carries this film.  You will have a much easier time believing that giant transforming robot aliens exist, than believing that Rosie Huntington Whiteley chooses to date an unemployed Shia LaBeouf however, when there is a billionaire \\"McDreamy\\" Patrick Dempsey knocking on the door.<br /><br />Overall, transforming robots look really cool blowing up a city, and that's what this disc is all about.  Enjoy.

0808514520|2.0|I ordered this book based on the picture that was shown for the paperback edition.  That edition showed a handsome book, and I figured the hard bound edition would only be better.  When I received the book, it was merely a hard paperback version of cheaper of the two paperback version.  It was very old looking and with small print.  I returned the book and got the nicer of the two paperback versions.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|The edges of this case are sharp and when I held the Fire (in the case) it caused severe discomfort to my hands.  It felt like the case was cutting into my hand.  I immediately took the fire out of the case and returned it after less than an hour of use.  Now I'm using the Marware leather folio, and it works much better, although high priced and not perfect.  I would like to see some better options out there for cases (ie. a slim cover like they make for the iPad).
B00457X7XQ|5.0|My two favorite \\"Live\\" authors are Tom Clancy & Vince Flynn, and those are the kind of books I like. I am not all that computer literate but our son is and he knows Mark, and really pushed me to read this.  My wife bought me a Kindle for X-mas and our son bought a download of Zero Day, Mark's first fictional book, for the Kindle. I am glad he did, I really enjoyed this story, we were told there is another book coming this year, I hope so and will read it as soon as it is out. I think Mark employs the suspense of Clancy and Flynn plus includes the computer technology in the story and makes it very interesting. I am a fan.   Larry Bolton

0525478817|5.0|Although his brother Hank might argue that the real \\"fault in our stars\\" is that our sun contains limited amounts of hydrogen, which will cause it to eventually run out of the only fuel source capable of supporting its mass against gravity, thereby expanding until its outer shell envelops our tiny planet and consumes it in a fiery death, I think it is more likely that John Green's title refers to a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar:<br /><br />\\"The fault, dear Brutus is not in our stars, / But in ourselves, that we are underlings.\\" Caesar (I, ii, 140-141)<br /><br />What does this quote mean and how does it relate to a novel about two kids dying of cancer?  I'll explore that below.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the story of two 16-year-olds who meet at a cancer support group.  Hazel Lancaster, the narrator, is afflicted with terminal thyroid cancer which has ravaged her lungs enough to necessitate the use of an oxygen tank wherever she goes.  It is during a support meeting that she is introduced to Augustus Waters, whose leg was claimed by a malignant bone tumor and who soon becomes the object of her affection.<br /><br />When I learned of the plot of this novel, I was initially a bit turned off.  I'm reminded of a comment a friend made when I asked her if she wanted to go see the movie [[ASIN:B004QL7KKC 50/50]], upon which she exclaimed \\"who wants to go see a movie about people dying of cancer?\\"  I couldn't come up with a satisfactory response, and we settled for a two-hour movie about the competitive world of robot fighting (which still caused me to shed a tear).  So why would anyone, especially young adults, want to read about \\"cancer kids?\\"  As Hazel herself states in the novel, \\"cancer books suck.\\"  But \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" isn't about cancer, and it's not about death.  Cancer is an important subject in the book, but it's not nearly as important as the characters. The disease is mainly used as a vehicle for moving along the development of Hazel and Augustus. In the absence of teen wizards, dystopian death races, and swooning vampire/werewolf feuds, it allows us to view the protagonists in a more complex setting than the traditional high school drama.  It also forces the characters to grow up much faster than they should, which I think is important for Green's audience as well as his needs as a writer.  The \\"young adult\\" label should not be cause for dismissal to older audiences.  As equally evident in his previous novels, Green's writing is not dumbed-down in an attempt to cater to a misguided adult notion of the intelligence of teenagers. While Hazel and Augustus certainly share in the same adolescent interests as many of their peers, their dialogue is written at a level that betrays a deeper level of maturity.  Amidst trips to the mall and countless video game sessions, the characters expound on subjects in life that everyone faces.  While it might seem strange to hear a 16-year-old use words like \\"cloying\\" and \\"sobriquet,\\" this is par for the course in a John Green novel.  And strangely, it works very well (provided you keep a dictionary handy).  Even though I initially balked at reading a \\"young adult\\" title (I'm well into adulthood), I realized that just because a book is marketed toward adolescents, doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed by those outside that niche.  I'm hesitant to make the comparison, but \\"The Fault in our Stars\\" bridges the age gap in the same vein as Salinger's [[ASIN:0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye]].  It contains content and themes thoroughly relatable to a young audience, while being presented in a way that adults will appreciate.<br /><br />Green's characters always come off a bit stiff to me and start off sounding like pretentious jerks who are trying too hard to grow up, but I always warm up to them and end up relating to them by the middle of the novel.  Gus was no exception. However my opinion of him changed as early as chapter 2, and I knew as soon as I heard him have a conversation with Hazel about their counselor's incorrect usage of the word \\"literally\\" (a fact that had literally been bothering me since it was mentioned in the first chapter) that I knew we could be friends.  The likeability factor of these characters is one of the reasons the rest of the story can be so heartbreaking to follow at times.  Even though I was fully aware from the beginning that Hazel's condition is terminal, she doesn't behave in a way that constantly reminds me of that fact.  Instead, her sarcastic wit and outlook on life draw me to her as someone I could easily be friends with (if only there wasn't that problem of her being a fictional character).  From very early on, I'm sucked into an emotional attachment to the characters in the story that made it very difficult to actually put the book down (and one of the reasons I will probably read it several more times).  Returning to the titular quote above, although it is fully explained in the novel, I think the line from Julius Caesar is also appropriate as a title because Hazel does not let her ultimate fate determine the course of her life.<br /><br />I thought Green's last two solo books, Katherines and Paper Towns, were pretty good, but they didn't capture that sense of awe I felt after finishing his first novel.  And again, I think that's because I've seen such a huge change over the years in Green's ability to connect his characters to the reader.  The Fault in our Stars returns me to that era and I'm reminded of just how good of a writer he is.  I do not know if it will win the same Young Adult Fiction awards Alaska received, but I do know it will be regarded by myself and many more as one of, if not his best work to date.  Regardless of their literary interests, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of great writing and character-driven stories.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that Green personally signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of this novel. So if you are buying it soon after release, your copy will almost certainly be autographed.<br /><br />John Green's other novels include:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]] (2005)<br />[[ASIN:0142410705 An Abundance of Katherines]] (2006)<br />[[ASIN:014241493X Paper Towns]] (2008)<br />[[ASIN:0142414999 Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances]] (coauthored - 2010)<br />[[ASIN:0142418471 Will Grayson, Will Grayson]] (coauthored - 2010)<br /><br />DFTBArsation with Hazel about their counselor's incorrect usage of the word \\"literally\\" (a fact that had literally been bothering me since it was mentioned in the first chapter) that I knew we could be friends.

B004UHF51S|5.0|Michael Franks released one of the top twelve albums of this year. No doubt about it. This seductive album has no minor track. The sensual samba blue, the enraptured feathers from an angel's wings or Now the summer's here, are pleasant songs that will sumerge you in a dreamlike ambiance, filled of refreshing melodies.<br /><br />Buy it for you for your girlfriend, wife, lover or dearest friends.

B006SV2LWA|3.0|Its hard to really review this movie because its not really bad or really good. It hovers somewhere in the middle. They tried to make us have a connection to a couple of the female leads before they died, but it didn't really work. They tried to connect us to the three male leads with limited success. I think I only felt somewhat sympathetic towards Laurence Fishburne's character. I also didn't even really feel much about the outbreak itself. Yes, its a big deal when millions die, but this was a movie, and in the movie it felt like I kept waiting for a climax only to find the movie suddenly at an end. You really felt like this was all leading to something truly horrific, or that humanity would nearly wipe itself out, and then it was over. I have no opinion on the supposed political messages in the movie. Some people seem to forget the fact that its still a fictional movie, but what it is based on is possible one day the more we tinker with things that are deadly if they were ever out of our control. I just expected more from a movie based on this kind of subject and it ended up just being very average.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|Was pleased with the overall quality.  It makes a little noise when it turns that kind of bugs.  The light isnt to bright (more of a night light).  Quality is Good and there were no problems with shipping (good packaging).

B0050SYS5A|1.0|I recently purchased this from Amazon, by no fault of the seller this product does not work the way it should, it does decrease the amout of space needed, but thats all it does, as soon as i popped it on i noticed some issues.   The Kinect kept saying it cant see the floor, i adjusted the kinect settings, and still it cannot see the floor when it was pointed in the direction of me about 2-1/2 to 3 feet off the ground, and me standing about 3-4 feet in front of it. I was able to get it to work with some games, but the \\"cursor\\" was jumpy and twitchy. I adjuted the kinect according to the Zoom directions, but still the jumpiness was too much. Even moved the lamp, and for some games i had to keep moving it back and forward on the stand for it to read me/us.   I did find a way to adjust the kinect that may help you. I have a very small living room, between the tv stand and the couch is apr 7-1/2 feet between the stand and couch. I pushed the tv  (32 in flatscreen Samsung) back on the stand so that it is touching the wall, (giving me about 2 extra feet) and bought a mount( Sensor mounting clip) made by PDP,that i bought at Bestbuy that attaches to the top of the tv and the kinect sits up there, adjusted the angle and now i have plenty of room to play 2 people at a time. (just about touching the couch with a few inches to spare) it has no problem seeing all of you.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|Long story short: A couple of the rockers make an impact, the singles are good, and surefire crossover hit \\"Lullaby\\" has just the right amount of earnestness and gorgeous acoustics to get the job done. Otherwise, this is a collection of generic lyrics and boring guitars, falling victim to the same problems that dragged TLR and ATRR down. Also, there's way too much balladry at the end of the CD.

1932100660|5.0|This book is a real eye-opener; explaining the negative health implications of following the Western Diet. Just look around and notice all the health and weight problems in the USA.

B005BZQS1E|3.0|I'm giving this three stars, but I would like to give it four. I'm giving it three, because I think this film could be a bit hit or miss. I watched it once with my wife and thought \\"Yeah that was fun,\\" then watched it with all our friends and a few bottles of wine and we all laughed till the tears rolled down our faces. What was different? Enjoyment was contagious.  There are a lot of pure gold moments in this film. The funny thing is, it is a better fantasy adventure flick than some 'real' adventure fantasy flicks, such as Eragon (nice but a bit dull).   In other words, you kind of have to 'get' this movie. I'm not saying that it's clever or an intellectual exercise, it isn't. If you've ever hung out with a bunch of geeks and played Dungeons & Dragons and enjoyed it, you will probably 'get' this movie. This isn't essential, but it will enhance your experience. I would recommend it, but if you are not in the mood, or expecting something else, well you probably won't enjoy it. I would recommend the trailer before you start.

0060882611|5.0|If you aren't familiar with this story, then you must not have been paying attention all these years since it was published (in 1952), but just in case: Charlotte's Web is the story of a girl named Fern who convinces her father, ax in hand, to allow her to take care of the runt of the most recent litter of pigs instead of (ahem) doing what he'd planned. But all good things must come to an end, and once he reaches the right size, they sell him to a neighbor, who, Fern learns, plans to take him to the fair to sell for slaughter. Fortunately, Wilbur befriends a wise spider named Charlotte, who devises a plan that, with the reluctant help of a rat, she hopes will save his life. Templeton, a gluttonous rat with an attitude, is bribed into tracking down appropriately intriguing words that Charlotte then weaves into a web in his pen. As hoped, once they arrive at the fair, folks show up in droves to admire Zuckerman's Famous Pig. Over the years, I've read the book, watched the movie and listened to author E.B. White read his story. The movie does justice to the story, but it's best experienced in its original form, as read by the author. Charlotte's Web is a fantastic, family-friendly (age 8 and up, for some sad stuff near the end) story about friendship. Also good: Essays by E.B. White, Emmy and the Incredible Shrinking Rat by Lynne Jonell and The Cricket of Times Square by George Selden.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my second Seiko 5 Automatic, the first is an all stainless 24 movement that is bullet proof. If you know what you are doing or take it somewhere it can be polished up and look like new every few years. I like that is a living thing that needs you as much as you need it. It is EMP proof which means when everyone elses watch is dead yours is still working. Being an automatic the accuracy will vary +/- a few seconds a day, for me not a big deal as people with so-called accurate watches, pda's, smart phones, iPads etc. are always/usually later than me...?  This model does not disappoint, Amazon had a good base price but it does fluxuate, a few weeks ago before Christmas it was going for around $80, today about $68. I searched the web and luckily found the one I wanted being blown out much cheaper, but today they are out of stock. Less than $70 is IMO a good deal. It is light and despite what some say the nylon band is very nice/adjustable.  I usually dont like bands other than SS links BUT this one has won me over, many hole options make it super adjustable.  For the money a way beter value than any Timex or Casio, a watch that should last a lifetime!
B0053VKP8S|3.0|I really cannot recommend the FiiO Converter.  While it does work as advertised, it does not fit my needs.  I have a Samsung HDTV with an digital audio output only and an \\"older\\" Bose Cinemate that has RCA analog connectors.  The FiiO converter works to produce sound in the smaller speakers, but the \\"audiomass\\" or sub-woofer.  After some research, I found that a much more expensive converter is necessary to work with the sub-woofer.  Therefore, I cannot recommend this product to work with a 1st generation Bose Cinemate.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Let me start by saying that I live this app. However, there are bugs that are extremely annoying. 1) not saving the filter after the screen goes off or simply by switching lists. 2) the notes made for a task can and will display as notes for any other task in the lost. Other than those bugs, I just want an option to delete an image for a task without having to recreate the task. Thanks, Handy Apps for making this great app :)
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Disclaimer: This review comes from someone who knows little about ballet.   This is a terrific movie. Portman plays a dancer working toward the top of her  profession. She acts very well, earning the award she received. Through clever  photography and some training she is convincing as a professional dancer.   The other performers are fine also.  The fast pace is maintained by the use of short scenes. The score is partially  original and partly Tchaikovsky. The Swan Lake music is expertly adapted and  arranged to match the action on screen.   Portman's character suffers from a self-injuring disease AND a mental problem  that gets worse as the pressure on her increases. By the end of the film she is  hallucinating and or imagining things regularly. I had to watch the film multiple  times to figure out what was real and what wasn't. I like the ambiguity.  The film takes place in New York City. We are not told the ballet company involved  but since they are performing at Lincoln Center I think it must be NYCB or ABT.  There is nothing to offend the average viewer. No nudity or graphic violence.   Prudish types may be put off by the brief sex scenes. Ballet enthusiasts may be  shocked when the Prince drops the White Swan in Act II in the live performance!  You don't have to like ballet to enjoy Black Swan.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging - but not so difficult as to be frustrating.  Engaging enough that you will want to replay boards to achieve a perfect score at each level.  Will recommend this new fav to all my puzzling friends!  Keep up the great work!

0425241505|3.0|Avid fans please dont kill me but I just couldn't understand how Pia claims to be so scared of getting caught yet when Dragos find her she acts like his some new acquaintance. She acts nothing like you'd expect someone fearing for their life would and it just doesn't make sense. The plot is pretty good and refreshing for a PNR yet the characters are very inconsistent so it's hard to actually understand them and really connect with them because there simply isnt that much to connect with either way.  This might be a spoiler to some so don't read further.....  It really bothered me that he never told her that he loved her.. sure he didnt know what love was and what not but cmon! or did i miss that somewhere in the end? please let me know if i did! i know this is not a big deal but the romantic in me didnt appreciate that.

145162445X|5.0|The Big Bang occurred about 13.72 billion years ago (temperature was 10 billion Kelvin at the time), and the universe is till expanding. Our galaxy is one of about 400 billion. Hubble's Law (1929) found a linear relationship between recessional velocity and galaxy distance - distant galaxies are moving away at faster velocities. When a star explodes, over the course of a month or so it shines with a brightness of 10 billion stars, and is the brightest phenomena in the universe, is referred to as a 'standard star,'and used to estimate the speed of recession. An exploding star  occurs about once every 100 years within each galaxy. Only the lightest elements (hydrogen, deuterium - heavy hydrogen, helium, and lithium) were made in the Big Bang - the rest were formed via fusion in the stars. About 200 million stars have exploded to date.  A circle about the size of a dime made at arm's length and examined by one of today's larger telescopes would contain about 100,000 galaxies; the viewer would see about 3 exploding stars/night. (I think his talk on U-tube stated '10.') Astronomers estimate that galaxies are moving at about 70 km/second - about 151,000 mph. Within about 2 trillion years these accelerating galaxies will reach the speed of light and no longer be visible. The fact that they're accelerating proves that 'empty space' contains vast amounts of dark energy.  Starlight was observed to curve around the Sun during a 1919 solar eclipse, by exactly the amount predicted by Einstein in his theory of general relativity.  The universe could be of three types - closed (would allow a person who looked far enough in one direction to see the back of his head), flat, or open. Author Krauss believes the universe is flat, and that the evidence that the universe arose from nothing is the most compelling.   As stated in my review title, 'A Universe from Nothing' is no easy read. I'm going to read it again, especially the latter part. Listening to his U-tube presentation on the same topic can also help.
B001CDLATE|3.0|This film starts with some great scenes of nature and indigenous societies. But one of the main themes is the meaninglessness of modern, technological society. Scenes of baby chicks being sped along are juxtaposed with scenes of commuters rushing to and fro. Yes, we know the modern world is often inhuman. While this is a perceptive film, it's not really an upper. It also is one-sided in its appreciation of humanity connected to nature, as if nature is itself without a dark side.   Naive primitivism is not an answer to technological angst.  There are some good time-lapse clips, but overall the film did not, for me, live up to many of the superlative reviews. I was questioning whether I should buy this, and would have appreciated more critical reviews.

All in all just an excellent book.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book helped me find love for reading again. After picking up a few books every now and then, reading a couple chapters and then forgetting about them this book came to me as a surprise. I just purchased the kindle fire and the first book I decided to read was in fact the Hunger Games. Once I read the first few pages, I was hooked. I read the book for hours until I finished it in less than a day. I even read it aloud to a friend who couldn't help but tell me to keep reading as I flicked through the pages on my new kindle. The story follows the struggle of the main character, Katniss Everdeen as she is forced to battle one member from her \\"district\\" and 22 other district teens. There will be only one winner... I would recommend this book to anyone, in fact, I've already been telling everyone I know about it. I'm on the third book now, and I still can't put it down for more than a minute or two before curiosity overcomes me and I begin to immerse myself within the pages of this fantastic book series once more.

014241493X|5.0|This was the 1st John Green novel I have ever read. And I was simply and immediately drawn in. Whether male or female, young or old there is something in this story that speaks to everyone of us. And in the long run I think that is what Mr. Green will be noted for. Writing literature that speaks to us, not at us. #DFTBA
B003K1EYM6|3.0|OK, I realize that it says \\"iPad\\" right in the product name, but I bought one of these to try connecting an external USB audio DAC to my iPhone 4S and 4th gen iPod touch, which I'd heard might be possible.  Even Apple's support line said it ought to work.  But as soon as you insert either the SD card adapter or USB adapter (just by itself, without any SD card or USB device connected), Apple has iOS recognize the adapter using an embedded ID code, and you get a pop-up message \\"This Accessory is Not Supported by iPhone / iPod touch\\".  There's probably no technical reason it couldn't actually work if Apple hadn't deliberately restricted these adapters to be iPad-only.  Hope this saves someone some time.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie was fun and exciting.  If you like old 1950's monster movies you will love it.<br />There is a problem with the disk though.  I could not sync the sound with the video.  All<br />my other blu-ray disks work fine.  Other than this.  GREAT MOVIE.
B000051Y0G|4.0|80's popmusic often bothers me with it's clanky hollow drums and overall superficial sound of computers. She's Unusual is not that much different but what sets it's apart from other similar albums from that age is the excellent songwriting by Lauper and other's whose songs ended up on this CD. OK, Opening track Money Changes Everything could easily have been on a Springsteen album but the song is still good. Most known are of course the superhits Girls Just Wanna Have Fun (with lyrics that deserve more attention since it is not all about just having fun) and Time After Time. Prince's When You Were Mine is another example of great songwriting. So underneath the often clanky sound sits a well written record.
0375842209|4.0|'The Book Thief' is entertaining, thought provoking, and very well written.<br /><br />It is the story of a young girl, Liesel Meminger, living in Nazi Germany during WWII.  She has lost her family and is sent to live with a foster family, the Hubermanns.<br /><br />There are numerous subplots within the story, several of which are thought provoking.  Hans Hubermann, Liesel's foster father, takes some actions that put him in danger by helping Jews.  To avoid spoiling the plot, I will refrain from further details about that.<br /><br />Liesel and her friends are forced to be in the Hitler Youth, but show some disdain and resistance.<br /><br />The NY Times Book Review really oversold this saying it 'can be life changing'.  I would say that is an overstatement, but it really is 'brilliant and hugely ambitious' as they also said.<br /><br />This book is very different.  It is certainly unique, and it is a worthwhile read.
0439023521|5.0|I had tried to start the hunger games a few times and each time I disliked the writing style and got bored. Luckily, I made a third attempt due to the popularity of the book.  I teared up on multiple occasions and frankly believe this book epitomizes the perfect mix of character and plot driven story telling.

014241543X|4.0|In an instant, 17-year-old Mia's life is ripped apart. Her family's car is struck, and her mother, father, and only sibling, her young brother, are killed.  She finds herself standing outside of her body trying desperately to comprehend what happened.  She is in a coma, suspended between life and death.  As her body lies mangled in the hospital and her extended family and friends rally to her side, she reviews her life and comes to realize that it's up to her to choose whether to stay or leave.  The book examines the many aspects of life and what family and love means.  This is one of those books that is almost impossible to put down.  It very well written and the characters are completely believable.
0446364495|2.0|This book seemed so \\"engineered\\" -- my word for the author proceeding with a plan, then inserting cardboard characters to move through the plot. Neither character seemed more than a cutout: perfect, intelligent, witty, accomplished, talented, blah blah blah. At no point in this book could I lose myself in the plot or the characters. A disappointment.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I just got this cover today for my Kindle Fire, and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.  The quality of the item is great, and the black with tan looks very professional.  I think this sleeve will offer my Kindle Fire plenty of protection from anything it runs into while being toted around with me everywhere from work to school to travelling and back home.  Very happy with it!  Price was a little high, but I wouldn't take any stars off for that since I think it's worth it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I've been fan of the series since '99, watch it on cinema 5th times, then i watch the animatrix online, play the game, watch the other two, and was looking foward to buy the Matrix Complete Collection on DVD, i didn't find it anywhere, so the time passed the technology changes, and i got this on my hands, it was a closedeyes order, i couldn't lose. Then after a long time, the package arrived, the Cover of the BOX, the BOX, the Disks, all the stuff, worth every dollar and time of shipping, i'm watching it right now with a cousin, he haven't seeing any, so now, watching it in HD for the 1st time, just imagine, he should write the review, anyway the content of the disks, the commentaries, To every fan of the series is a non-regret buy, so, if u think u're a huge fan, u should get it, and u'll get a lot of time of Matrix fun_
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love this series but I don't love it enough to see it again.  This is a wonderful box set for those who love \\"Prohibition\\" history (even though it is not to fact based) and are not yet familiar with the series.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham did a great job on this book. The hype of an upcoming J.G. novel certainly had me excited, but I'll admit, once I read the description of the book (and the mentioning of Finley & Figg) I was a bit turned off. However, from page 1 through the end, I enjoyed the book, I was captivated, and I laughed out loud a countless number of times. I'd highly recommend this to anyone seeking a good read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is just such a fun and great game.  when your doing nothing u should play this it is awsome
B0063IH60K|3.0|I felt like this game was really easy and there was no challenge I wish there was more of a challenge and more backgrounds or fifteenth types of cards
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I think this game was very annoying. The reason for that is that the controls are way to hard i guess. when ever I pressed on the birds they would never explode. my advice don't buy this app its a waste of time and space in your app library.  I just got the damn thing and its already gotten me infuriated.
0517147688|5.0|The book was in excellent condition for a used book.  Jane Austen: The Complete Novels was a Christmas present for my daughter.
0553386794|1.0|I read this book due to the NY Times bestseller accolade.  Here are my (4) criticisms:<br /><br />1.  Martin's Female characters:<br />All Martin's female characters serve the purpose of being walking vaginas. In his fantasy world, women and girl-children fall into 3 categories:<br /><br />lowly 'working women' (Martin uses the unpleasant noun of 'whore') who are eager to service disrespectful, barbaric men and wantonly do so (according to Martin's standpoint); or barely-teenagers (sometimes older widows) who are either in constant danger of succumbing to forcible rape or already are the victims of brutal rape done by depraved men; or the final miniscule category contains a total of two, possibly 3 female characters (a female child from book one, and 2 unmarried young women from book two) who manage to display a glimmer of self-reliance, but these characters, are so unattractive that they are commonly mistaken for males while one is highly boyish (according to Martin).<br /><br />I cringed at the physical abuse and pedophilia that befell young girls throughout the book. Martin's sex scenes, which make use of much foul language and graphic detail, fall into two categories: cruel and/ or criminally deviant, or follow this recipe 'Wench, (again, Martin's choice of noun for females) service me now so I can give you a bastxxd (Martin consistently  uses this word refering to children born outside of marriage) in your belly.'<br /><br />2.  Martin's male characters:<br /> The majority of Martin's male characters are narcissistic sociopaths, some outright blood lusty psychopaths; only a handful of males are honorable; they often do not fare well in Martin's fantasy- plot, which adds to the unpleasant reading.<br /><br />3.  The female character of\\" Danny\\"  I found wearisome to follow for two reasons:  Martin uses a plethora of invented/ very foreign words which trip up the reading pace. Danny, no surprise here, also lives in an abusive world surrounded by bloodthirsty nomads with grisly customs involving cruelty to animals.<br /><br />4.  My last criticism is tame when faced with the above list, however, it proved annoying that when reading this book, you'll likely need your archaic dictionary from English in the 1500's, or earlier, handy to decipher oft-used words like 'jape' and 'helm', which the author likely would have found it efficient to type in the same number of letters spelling joke or jest, and added two more to type the word helmet.<br /><br />Why, you ask, did I bother to finish reading this book? The link between some of the characters to their pet wolves is the only interesting thread in Martin's book and it captivated me.  Also, very early in the book a critical plot event occurs and I continued reading through book 2 in the assumption that justice and honor would be restored, questions to mysteries answered, and lose ends tied up; I was grossly mistaken.  In fact, brutal cruelty escalates, the bizarreness of 'Danny's' world increases throughout this and the 2nd book, where I realized my mistaken assumption.  I am most happy to avoid any other writings and dark thoughts from 'the mind of Mr. Martin'.<br /><br />I realize the value of virtually all writing content and styles, and there is an audience for Martin's writing.  However, a simple and practical aid to help patrons locate books they want to vuy and read would be to follow steps taken for the extreme violent content of video games.  Amazon (and the book publisher/s) could place a 'Readers Advisory' sticker on the book cover re: Extreme violence including against women and children, explicit language, depraved sexual content, and some cruelty to animals.<br /><br />I have attempted to warn others who would mistake this book to be an imaginative, mysterious, clever reading adventure, replete with relatable characters you love, sharing in their triumphs and journeys.  Marin's book/s is the antithesis and not what I wanted to buy.s.  4.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|Awful... Do not read, you will wish you hadn't spent the money within the first 50 pages.   I was in need of a quick read and decided it been a while since I had read a romance novel so I searched for a good college age romance novel hoping to get my fix. This one had really good reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.   Honestly though... how does this book have such good ratings?  The characters are whiny, narcissistic, one dimensional and at many points in the book I wanted to pull my hair out and scream at them for being so immature.   Yes, I understand that this is the kind of book it is, and I'm all for books that are less than academic but come on! The first half of the book is the same story repeated over and over and it is just her saying, \\"I don't want to have sex with you\\" every time she is with Travis. Really though, that is all they talk about anytime they are together!   Towards the end we start to see into Abby's past and it is attempted to give her more depth but it felt like they just threw that plot line in part way through so the story wasn't SO shallow. In the beginning and end, the stuff with her family and past didn't have any mention at all.   Plus there are so many moments where she is so rude to her best friend and to anyone around her (for example, her best friend is always saying how beautiful she is and yet Abby never once says anything complimentary back.) ALKJDFLKjsdlkjf I can't even articulate how frustrated I was at this book.   I love these \\"types\\" of books yet this one was a major let down.

0596805888|5.0|Cooking for Geeks held my attention from front cover to back. My girlfriend read the whole book over my right shoulder. Every time I opened the book she appeared like magic. She is just as enthralled in it as I am! We don't keep it in the kitchen. We actually read it in the living room.LOL We are planing a Valentines day Geek cook off. WE should win easily with the fantastic ideas we've gotten from the book.
6305433909|5.0|Sister Act II is one of my favorite movies. Alot of people say that the first one was better but I enjoyed this one better than the first one. The songs, the acting, the whole storyline was good. I would recommend this movie to anybody.

B0049985XW|1.0|Against all indications at purchase, no movie disk was included in my order.  Instead, I received only a special features disk.  Be advised against ordering the single edition disk if you want to see the movie!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like being rewarded with access to new games for playing. all types of games, so there is something for everyone to play
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have used. YouVersion Bible app for years on my Blackberry. phone and loved it. So I was very happy at the thought of using it with a much larger screen on my new Kindle.. tried to sign up for one of the reading plans and could not even get the registration completed. It would not allow me to sign up and would not save a record of what I'd already read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this app. I like that you have so many options of games. I can be on a long trip and never run out of games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun app that is great to play. I enjoy playing this app because it has a large variety of games instead of just having one game to play in an app.
B003NVMYSY|5.0|This episode follows up \\"Cyberwoman\\", the episode where we as an audience realize that we don't really KNOW these characters so far. I think that it's a brilliant display of what is so fantastic about this series. It's not the effects or the crazy alien windy plots and subplots, it's these characters. We see all of these fantastic personalities at work in this episode. The tension throughout is fantastic and the dialogue and acting is to die for. If you're wondering where to start to get you really hooked on Torchwood this may be the perfect episode for you. Just keep in mind that this particular episode is slightly different than it's normal format.<br /><br />Happy watching!<br /><br />--Amanda
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is fun and great for any one! I play it all the time! everyone one should have this game! glad to have it!
B0050KEVO6|2.0|I love this game. Only problem is there are no hints avaible thru the game. must go on line to look up help. However if you've got the time. it's a real time consuming game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good games to waste a few minutes on. not bad at all. not the best games out there but not bad for free
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much fun i just love it unlocking them is as Much fun as playing them everyone should try this game
