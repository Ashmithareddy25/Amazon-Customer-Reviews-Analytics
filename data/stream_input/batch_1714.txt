B005S0HNU2|5.0|Just love the Merlin series...can't wait until season 5 comes out on DVD. Looking forward to more wonderful adventures. \\"Amazon\\" is the first place I go to look for anything I want to buy now, and just love the prices. Love Love Love it :)
B007GCY8FS|5.0|[[ASIN:B007GCY8FS A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel]]  Well, Lee Child has done it again, with Jack Reacher, A Wanted Man.  It's classic Reacher.  Reacher stumbles innocently into a MAJOR situation, gets to be the major player in that situation, kills the bad guys, and quietly disappears into the sunset...or sunrise as it was in this case.  I kept waiting for the girl friend part, but it never happened...and that was fine. You wonder how there could be so many dead bodies over the United States (due to Reacher) and how he's NOT a wanted man for all those previous murders in his long life.  Funny, in this book, he did mention that he was getting older, and eluded to the fact that he couldn't do as much as before.  I hope we are not getting prepared for the end of Jack Reacher. In conclusion, another great Jack Reacher book by a great author, Lee Child.  I will be definitely looking forward to the next one!  On a side note:  I really can't see Cruise as Reacher, but no matter, I will definitely go see the movie no matter who plays Jack Reacher.
0316228532|5.0|This story is full of very unlikable people yet characters are so well developed that the reader likes and pities them..good and bad.  There is a dearth of good people herein, and they do shine through the murkiness eventually.  I really loved her  depiction of time and place, as I had never read any Harry Potter stuff, disliking fantasy to the max.  I will read anything else this masterful storyteller writes for adults.
B008Q08EV8|4.0|Enjoyed the film and the history was reasonably accurate for a holiwood adventure film.  I think it is hard for film makers to represent professional soldiers these days, but this film did a good job.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Product works great and was exactly as described.  We had purchased other products but they didn't have the drivers to support the hardware being used.  This product works great.
0307951529|4.0|Having read several books on how to get into gear and start your own business I was terrified that I would be reading what I already knew.  Thankfully Chris, with colorful commentary, offers many examples of side hustles one can work on while still maintaining 9-5 and examples of leaving one's comfort zone entirely and putting everything one has into a new venture.  Overall I was pleased with the book but readers may still not know how to get rolling at the end of it.  As someone who loves their full-time job I'm also not part of the target audience but I have always enjoyed Chris' writing and journeys!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed reading; the character progression and development mostly mostly implied with descriptive language, and I  continually matching clues to information.  Tyler Perry would be the best Max,  ... Denzel -- Quinn.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|I bought on it a whim. Saw a t-shirt with This album on it and found myself buying it within munites. It's just like my old LPs.<br /><br />If you are an ol' fart like me,( not true of course ) you love this album. And if you are a young muscian and love theses classic sounds, buy it. You'll enjoy it and it will improve your guitar playing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a very very very good app and I recommend it!!!! this app will be on my kindle forever and ever!!!!
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|Biocentrism is not the \\"Unified Theory of Everything\\" we've been waiting for, it is a great, mindblowing \\"Unifed Theory of the Nonsensical\\".<br />Every weird, contradictory, non-intiuitive notion of quantum physics is explained here reasonably well as a result of biology. I've also never been more convinced that space, and especially time, don't exist outside of our minds.<br />After reading this book, you'll realize you know much less than you thought you did, and you'll be more confused than ever. And isn't that what knowledge is all about? Highly recommend.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is amazing! I could not put this book down. Very well written. I always learn when I read her books.<br />Another winner!!

B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book had so many twists and unexpected turns I hated to finish it.  Highly entertaining.  The kind of humor that makes you laugh out loud.  I would call this a must read for the recreational reader.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|As a result of my reading Antony Beevor's \\"Second World War\\", I purchased and read \\"Stalingrad\\" as well.  Both books were well researched and written.  They were enjoyable reads and increased my knowledge and understanding of both events.
B00433SVP6|5.0|Amazing the use of each chapter being centralised round a character is exquisite . A must read book for all ages Roman Or Greek :)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After reading the popular \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I decided not to proceed to the next two books.  The book read easily, because the writing was not very interesting, language-wise, and the subject matter repeatative and, therefore, boring.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It seemed that Ms. Cornwell got tired of working with this book and ended it very quickly.  It was not up to her usual waiting skills.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is freaking awesome. I cant stop playing. my city is growing like no tomorrow and its not planning on stopping any time soon
B00021R7CG|5.0|Seeing one of the new TV series this fall, \\"Last Resort\\", reminded me of a movie I had seen on HBO in the early 1990's, \\"By Dawn's Early Light\\", a Fail Safe scenario, starring James Earl Jones. This scenario if not resolved would result in a global nuclear war. The movie is well-done; it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. It makes you think about the stress that current-day bomber and strategic missile commanders, both land and sea, go through all the time they are on alert duty. James Earl Jones also starred in another Fail Safe scenario movie in the early 1960's, Doctor Strangelove. I loved them both; they are in my list of all-time greats.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I purchased this book because I had heard that it was a true story and was one of the books recommended on the \\"Oprah\\" show. The story kept me interested all the way. full of so many emotions & incidents. The way it's written puts you right there with the author on that trail. Such a brave and driven person, and maybe to trusting of fellow man/woman along life's path.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Bob Dylan is amazing. He blew his throat out in the 2000's. Came out with his new voice on this album, sounding like a 90-year-old bullfrog with a frog in his throat, and it's great. What a song writer, and I've grown to like his new voice.<br />My favorites: Long and Wasted Years, Tempest, Roll on John, Tin Angel.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I grew up with my 3 story Barbie house so am of course a fan of the original. However, this 2 story house is even better than the large 3 story one. It is just the right size for kids so they do not get so overwhelmed with what to do.  The house is interactive and encourages play both inside and out. Our daughter loves the pass through in the kitchen and the floating stairs.  A great house for an amazing price!
1451695195|3.0|The most interesting portions of this book were not the author's Near Death Experience, but the sections where his doctors and family were dealing with his quickly deteriorating medical condition.  The writing is crisp and clear, but the sections on his other-worldly experience seemed pretty uninteresting, and offer nothing new.  Still, it's a quick read if you are interested.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|Lots of good examples on how to create another form of work. Author repeats concepts but helps get the message across to explain how easy it is to get started on doing it.
B001RCUL5Y|5.0|The beginning to this movie was kind of boring as they tried to lay down the storyline, wasn't quite sure where it was going. But once the story starts up, the lines are very well written, cute story! Adam Sandler was a little more serious in this one, which i loved and appreciated (im not really a Billy Madison fan)<br /><br />Good story, entertaining, my kids loved it as well. A happy story and ending, and a highly recommended watch for this family movie!
B003THHQW6|5.0|huge fan of nathan fillion, loved him in firefly & he does just as great a job on castle!  can't wait to catch up on all the older episodes so i can start watching new ones!
B005GSVFBE|5.0|Love this movie!! The characters are extremely likeable, cute, very funny. This movie is very well written! Good story, good characters, a favorite in our household! This movie will never get old, I know it will continue to popular for many years, and through many new generations of children and parents alike! Disneys best!!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I really didn't like this movie, the tv series was much better. My point of view Johnny Depp hasn't made a great movie in years. The only good thing about this movie was when Alice Cooper was singing. Other then that the movie was stupid and boring.
B007DICTJC|5.0|Wow, this one really amazed me! Also impressed my husband who is a mechanic! The planning behind this Lego set is really impressive, not only do you build a Lego Tow truck, but you also have to build the engine and steering mechanisms to the truck as well! When you complete the set, you will have a functioning tow truck complete with a gear-lowering tow bar, doors that open and close with ease, and a steerable vehicle thanks to a rotating gear at the top of the car. This one sure impressed us! And the kids think it's awesome! It took daddy the weekend to construct it, but it was so worth it! GREAT idea from Lego!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is not as good as the first.  It doesn't advance the story much, you don't really find anything else out about Gideon's past and how he was abused.  I think it is worth reading in hopes that the next one will be better.  Not sure though how difficult it would be to skip this and pick up the next.  Continues to parallel 50 shades of grey in a lot of ways.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started out unsure of how I felt about this series.  It was driving me crazy!!!  Why in the world would they clean???  Why not just run?  It is, in fact, this very thing that kept me turning the pages, wanting to know more.<br /><br />With the introduction of Julliette, I went from being driven for answers to caring for this character and needing to know her whole story.<br /><br />This book draws you in then seeps into your very being.  Every new character draws you in deeper. I do not want this story to end.  I need more Wool!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book starts out with some promise of being interesting, but quickly becomes laborious and predictable.  Even generous doses of \\"sex, drugs and rock and roll\\" don't help.<br /><br />I think JK should stick to the genre that made her rich and leave this one to those that do it well.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was a page turner.  Brought back many memories of the Civil Rights movement in the south and the struggles many people still face today.<br />I would recommend this book.  It will get your blood pressure up and make you want to just keep reading.  I was so sad when it ended!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Monster by KISS is great!  The band has outdone themselves!  Full on rock!  Totally recommend this to anyone, KISS fan or not!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Hats off to Big Fish with this one,  but especially to the original producers,  storyboard and graphic artists, and animation crew who developed this &quot;BANG FOR YOUR BUCKS &quot; game!!!!<br />Enigmatis kept me intrigued from start until its shocking shocking end! A true jaw dropped climax for sure... can't wait until Enigmatis 2 hits Amazon..better believe I'm going to be one of the very 1st to purchase it!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Don't waste your money with this book.  If you want to read it, check it out at a library.  Total disappointment!  There was no passion from Patricia Cornwell.  It was like she didn't even want to write it.  Wish I could get my money back, and I have been a fan of Kay Scarpetta since she first entered the scene.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this app. i like the fact that you can change the difficulty of the suits. i would have liked to see it keep your high scores tho!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie was ok. Left the backdoor open. The writer should have consulted with me before releasing the film. I would have brought more depth to the story. Overall just nice to see a new sci-fi movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. If you love this book get the other two books! Trying to finish the third book now.
B0001K2JYY|5.0|The music in this soundtrack takes my breath away. It is powerful and fits very well with the Passion of the Christ. I like how it has ancient Jerusalem sounds in it. Some of my favorites from this CD are \\"The Olive Garden\\", \\"Song of Complaint\\", \\" Mary Goes to Jesus\\", \\"Raising of the Cross\\", \\"It Is Done\\", and, of course, \\"Resurrection\\". Resurrection is so beautiful. It sends wonderful chills up my spine. It fits very much to when Christ rose from the dead and his victory at the cross.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a great game. so amazing. I really really love it so.much its awesome! I hope u guys make it even better so it can be amazingly cool man.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Only if you are an Alien fan would you be able to follow and appreciate this movie. Since I am, I throughly enjoyed it. I found that if you missed even a small part of it you will be lost and wouldn't understand what's going on. Overall, I enjoyed it as a sci-fi movie.  It had a different spin to it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I love this because I do book reports for school and I usual don't have a dictionary so realy helps me finding the meaning of the words.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This album is more than I was even expecting it to be when I initially purchased it. I absolutely love every single song and all of the collaborations that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis did with the other artists on the album are absolute perfection. Once again, Macklemore delivers nothing less than the best.<br /><br />And I have to say that one of the things about Macklemore that stands out to me in comparison of other artists is how all of his songs are meaningful and are not about doing drugs, getting with someone, etc. These songs have the best messages.
B006P4FBUE|4.0|Note labels can be turned on or off. Size of keys is adjustable. Two octaves is so much better than one! Works well for rehearsing chorus music.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Fantastic blend of steam punk and paranormal romance. Great world building. I'm definitely going to be looking for more from this author.
B001QE9WEO|5.0|My 6 year old nephew/walking deads #1 fan called me wanting to know if I could tell him some good movies that would be appropriate(yes he said appropriate) for him to watch for halloween that to my sister means no boobs & not a huge amount of cussing. So I got him return of the living dead part 2 & it is his favorite movie. His favorite part is \\"get that darn screwdriver outta my head\\" and the end part, not really sure what part that is but he loved it next buy for him is monster squad.

Go sign up disneymovierewards.com and then everytime you buy a disney movie you enter in the code and get points to spend on free stuff, like more movies, gifts, sticker books, lots of fun stuff. Ive gotten lunchboxes etc, - thats not the point, and I dont get points if you sign up, I just think if your checking out disney cartoons you should know.  I buy these for car trips for the car. They always have a positive theme, and I love that this is girl power, being independant and figuring things out.

B008QE9XD2|5.0|As a diehard Dark Shadows fan, I loved the Depp/Burton film. It was hilarious! It was good to see the four original Dark Shadows cast that were in a cameo. Jonathan Frid and Johnny Depp were actually good friends and Frid was involved with the film. It's a film I'll watch many times.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|..... For how great this is. Must see the documentary, been even without that you will be taken to a whole new place.
B009JNXK88|4.0|I purchased this app on one of the &quot;free apps of the day&quot; specials.  I really love the retro style graphics.  it reminds me a lot of platform type games that you would see online.  it is very fun and I'll probably get a few hours out if it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great conclusion to an excellent series. Still as round about as previous books, and how things went were not as I initially expected.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|Detective John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield are again the focal point in Nelson DeMille's latest offering.  As a character I have enjoyed following him in all the previous adventures, but this book was a bit tougher to enjoy than some of the previous novels featuring this set of characters.<br />Previous books (Plum Island, The Lion's Game among them) have a vibrant, gripping story and character interaction that creates a book that is tough to put down.  With this outing I was able to ignore the book for a week before picking it up again.  This is the test for any book to be called great as opposed to good, when time flies and you ignore other important tasks to just read \\"one more chapter\\"<br />The pace is slow and you do have a sense early on in the book of how the story will unravel.  Surprises are few and in some places it seems to be more of a tour of Yemen than anything else.<br /><br />One will get the usual cutting wit and sarcasm from John Corey as well as the cynism of elements of the war on terror. The discussions between characters and analysis was interesting given the recent \\"Arab Spring\\" and the Yemeni Army's recent victories in Yemen. Be prepared to do some thinking while reading this book!<br />So, is it brilliant, unfortunately not.  Is it terrible, no. Is it worth a read? As a first time Nelson DeMille reader you may be disappointed.  As a fan you will find something to enjoy for sure!<br />I believe the author is still one of the best in the modern era(the short story The Book Case and The Gate House are testament to this), so I look forward to the next book!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I turned this movie off after 45 minutes so I can't give you an accurate review of the whole movie.  It was very awkward and boring and could not hold my attention.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved, loved, LOVED this book! Immediately after reading it once, I flipped to the front and read it again! I loved the love story and can't wait for the next story!  Amazing!
B009KKLQVS|1.0|I was really looking forward to this DVD because I thought the tour was phenomenal.<br />Very few concerts can be called \\"historic\\", though many phoney ones claim to be. This one ACTUALLY WAS!!<br /><br />They chose to just release half of a concert of something they, themselves, billed as an important event in an important band's long and storied career?<br />You can keep it guys!!! I'm not buying it in protest....I'll wait until you do it right.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|As a fan of Duran Duran since the 80's, I loved seeing behind the scenes of my teenage dream's life. Since he's still in the group he doesn't go into all the detail that Andy Taylor did in his autobiography, but gives enough detail that you still get his experience on the many iconic moments that the band went through. I loved it. I hope Simon will one day do his story as well.
B008BM9L72|5.0|An excellent read which I would strongly reccommend. My Kindle was glued to my finger tips as I couldn't put the book down. I was very sorry to have reached the end but also pleased that I read it in the first place.<br /><br />Do read and enjoy.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|One of the most amazing films in the history of filmmaking.  The behind the scenes souls be watched prior to watching the movie for all of the cleverness that was shot in the filming.  An amazing story of greed and insecurities!  One to own if you are a movie lover
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Wow!  That's all that is needed to be said about this beautifully filmed movie.  The scenery, acting and music is beyond any musical ever brought to the screen.  A must have for any fan!
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|My God what an episode. I was not expecting so much change so fast. The writers really know what they are doing.
B003THJA1G|5.0|Pleasant generally upbeat mystery series.  Often light and amusing.  The series is more about the interactions between the primary characters then about the intensity of the story line.
B005MW68RK|5.0|This is some of the best music I have heard in a very long time.Glad I discovered her as I had never heard of her before.Ive listened to it already til it might be worn out.Love this womans voice and cant wait to get more of her music.
0786962984|3.0|I was delighted to see that Dungeon!, a favorite boardgame from my youth, was now available in a reprint, as the originals are getting harder and harder to come by.<br /><br />The mechanics are pretty much intact. A very, very simple and straightforward dungeon crawl that deftly avoids being an RPG.<br /><br />But what gets me here is the construction. The board is sturdy and colorful, but the cards are cheaply produced -- little more than thin card stock, almost paper-like. And the playing pieces are cardboard -- which comes across as completely cheap and tacky, especially when you consider the original (and even contemporary releases like Castle Ravenloft) used molded plastic. The manual is a flimsy fold-out brochure -- so they wouldn't even spring for staples.<br /><br />The game itself is still fun and playable, but it's obvious this game was a cheap-o penny-pinching production.
030759565X|5.0|As a longtime fan of Smitten Kitchen (I have to keep myself from typing \\"Smitten Kitten\\" :-) blog I had eagerly awaited Deb Perelman's \\"The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook. The book has arrived, and it was worth the wait.<br /><br />The chapters are: Breakfast; Salads; Sandwiches, Tarts and Pizzas; The Main Dish: Vegetarian; The Main Dish: Seafood, Poultry, and Meat; Sweets (cookies, pies and tarts, cakes, puddings and candy); and Party Snacks and Drinks.<br /><br />In some ways my favorite chapter is the Party Snacks and Drinks one... perhaps the \\"how to throw a dinner party that you'll actually get to enjoy\\" line caught my eye. In any case, the selection of munchies and drinks is very appealing. Really, how can you go wrong with \\"baked potatoes with the works\\" or \\"blue cheese and black pepper gougères\\" with \\"muddle puddle battle\\" (a strawberry lime tequila combo) as a beverage?<br /><br />Browsing through the book for the first time I wound up with a collection of bookmarked recipes. The breakfast section has several winners: I've tried the \\"baked ranchero eggs with blistered jack cheese and lime crema\\" and the \\"new york breakfast casserole\\" (a bagel/egg/cream cheese bake that you put together the day before and throw in the oven in the morning... handy and yummy). The \\"cheddar swirl breakfast buns\\" are next on my list. The ratatouille for the \\"ratatouille sub\\" is made in the same style as, yes, the movie \\"Ratatouille,\\" and then transformed into a filling vegetarian sub. (I have the ingredients for that ready to go.)<br /><br />The author's approach is very friendly, and the recipe introductions are often longer than the recipe instructions. The ingredients are all easily obtainable, and the pictures are divine. In the case of more involved recipes or ones with special techniques (like the ratatouille or the \\"fig, olive and sea salt challah\\") there are multiple pictures.<br /><br />The author is very familiar with making the most of a very small kitchen, and she includes a \\"build your own smitten kitchen (deb's kitchen essentials)\\" section to aid the reader. The recipes cover all of the bases, and the effort that the author put into developing them puts the reader at ease. (Plus, the stories of her successes and failures make for entertaining reading.)  I'm moving on to the \\"sweets\\" section next (the \\"s'more layer cake\\" is calling my name), but I can see myself trying every recipe. Very Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the games...been playing a long time. problem is, I'm now scared to do the update after reading all the other reviews. Thanks.
B0091XRL86|4.0|I didn't care for it. Just a personal thing!<br />You might like it just check it out! Did have some funny things that only adults would understand.

1932100660|5.0|This may be the best book I have read to understand what food and nutrition can do to or for your health.  A MUST read!  I recommend this book to everyone.  It is an amazing informational read.  I love the fact that Dr. T. Colin Campbell started his research, not as a vegan, but gradually changed his eating lifestyle based on research.  Please have an open mind and turn your life around, especially if you have any degenerative diseases.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Not much to say about this book.  It was boring to me.  Can't believe they bothered to make a movie out of this story.  Hope it's better than the written word.  But I won't know unless someone tells me because I have no intention of going to see it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Very detailed and had me at the edge of my seat trying to figure out the missing wholes in the prophecy. Can't wait for The House Of Hades.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|People don't understand that everything is connected. Everything we do, everything we say, no matter how insignificant or flippant, it can effect someone to the point that their life is altered.<br /><br />In Jay Asher's novel \\"13 Reasons Why,\\" Clay Jensen receives a box of tapes recorded by his crush, Hannah Baker, who had recently killed herself. On the tapes, she recounts exactly what happened leading up to her suicide, and pin pointing certain people and events that caused her to think that her life wasn't worth living anymore.<br /><br />Her design for the tapes was that they were supposed to go, in order, to the people mentioned on the tapes. Everyone who got them had a hand in her decision. Clay, a decent enough chap, had no idea why he would be included on the list. He could have loved Hannah. He certainly had a crush, and they shared a nice kiss. Why would he be included on the list? That's for the reader to find out, because I'm not going to tell what happens.<br /><br />That being said, I read this book extremely quickly. I was dying to find out what happened. How was Clay involved? Was it all a ruse? Was Hannah really dead? She seemed like such a lively, lovely person that you'd never imagine what kind of inner turmoil was happening. She wasn't a sharer. She was more of a \\"this is my life, and it's as good as it's gonna get\\"-type girl, I felt.<br /><br />The people that she mentioned on the tapes probably had no idea the impact that their actions could have. She'd been labeled a tramp, among other things, because she'd accidentally, or inadvertently insulted someone. Rumors hurt. Maybe if she hadn't been bombarded with the rumors by so many people, she would have moved past it. Maybe there was something bigger at work. Whatever the case, Clay had some answered questions, but I had too many unanswered questions for my liking.<br /><br />Example, I would have loved to have found out how the few people who received the tapes after Clay reacted. Would it have changed them? Would they have realized what they'd done? Sadly, it's difficult to say, but this was definitely a good read.<br /><br />Written by Rebekah Martin, author of \\"Sugar and Spies.\\"e changed them? Would they have realized what they'd done?

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the book.  Can't wait until the next one.  Eva and Gideon are great for each other. I liked it better than 50 shades of Grey.  Very good.  Could not stop reading.  I have read both books twice.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This book has amazed me from the beginning. The writing is crisp and decisive, there is enough intrigue to keep me excited and curious, and it is written in a world that would not be too far off that of reality.

Good grief.<br />I do believe this is the most poorly written book I have ever read in my life.  Letters to the Editor in Playboy or Penthouse has this beat in spades, for good ole erotica.  Just one question:  Is there any way to delete a book from my Kindle Fire?  I just don't want this taking up space.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|Okay so I am an avid Stephen King fan.  I tried to make a go of reading Mr. King when I was in high school, but, I just couldn't get into his books, I think I was to young to relate.<br /><br />I started reading Stephen King in my 20's so I know I have a long list of books to go by him since I plan to read them all.<br /><br />I just recently finished reading IT and let me tell you, IT scared the crap out of me!!!!  I saw the movie a few times on T.V. so I knew what the basis of the story was about.<br /><br />The book is told in two stories, the past which introduces us to the seven main characters, how they all come to meet and each of their individual encounters with Pennywise the killer clown and the present when the seven main characters come back together after recieving the phone call that reminds them of the promise that they made when they were children to come back if IT is not dead.<br /><br />Mike Hanlon is the character that keeps them together, he stays in Derry, and he monitors the activity in the small town, while the other six have all moved away and became very successful.  When they receive the call all but Stan, who takes his own life, return to keep their promise.<br /><br />The book is super scary, I woke up at night because I thought the scary clown was in my room, it really kept me up at night for a couple of days.<br /><br />What I didn't like about the story and I am glad that it was not in the movie, was the sex scene. I mean I didn't see the point of this being in the story, I didn't understand how an 11 year old girl having sex in a cave with six different 11 year old boys back to back benefitted the story.<br /><br />Other than this scene, I enjoyed the book, I am thinking about reading The Shining next as I already read The Stand and I want to get through all of Mr. King's classics.
1451627297|1.0|I don't know how this book became a bestseller. The idea of moving back in time has been used so many times before. The only original part is the stopping of Kennedy's killing and by doing so changing the course of historical events. But the author does not really address this part. The novel is too long, no original thoughts, and despite the plot, there is no real mention of how the events change. It is just a regular novel just placed in a promising plot.<br />Disappointing book..
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app you are gonna find in the app store in a long time. works great on kindle tablets.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I did enjoy this book. It is an easy read and yet chalanged your memory. At the end, if it does not tug on your heart strings, you might not have one. Use you time here wisely. Enjoy
B004EPZ07K|5.0|Yeah, there may have been room for improvement - I've read Green Lantern since I was a kid ( 60's - 70's ) and fully enjoyed the movie. It was comic book to film .... what were you dinks looking for? It worked well. Looking forward to more of the same. Quality comic book, balls to the wall, action packed  adaptations.
B004I744AS|5.0|If you use words or read them, you should use and enjoy this app. Not only can you use it as dictionary', you can improve vocabulary. Another bonus is article of the day, learn something you never knew. You will enjoy the fact and perspective on history.  Then there are the word games.  I check this app right after the weather channel and AP News. Six stars if available.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille's humor, as always, was hilarious and refreshing.  The story was well written with just enough detail, intrigue, and action.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Confusing. The chapters/ stories never come together. None of them were very interesting. I kept waiting for a connection so I kept reading. A waste if time!
B000WLNZX6|5.0|This is a great compilation of BB King and many outstanding artists.  I love that there is everyone from Willie Nelson to Heavy D on here.  My favorite is BB and Tracy Chapman doing The Thrill is Gone.  I bought the CD years ago when it first came out, the CD got damaged before I ever got it on my computer, so I bought the digital version from Amazon.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a great game. However when it was updated it made it more interesting but the pop ups about the halloween edition was annoying. if I decline the first time don't allow the pop up every time I sign back in. Its great for those that like halloween but I'm not a fan. I am hoping however there is a Christmas edition.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|From the previews, thought Dark Shadows was going to be bet to corny for me.<br />But after seeing it, its just plain funny in true Johny Depp fasion!<br />Its good laugh.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|It's a fine app minus the auto-correct frustrations. I haven't figured out if/how to turn it off yet. It's sufficient for taking notes or making a list.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Loved it loved it read it twice all 3 books what else can I say .....Changed my life forever love my husband even more he is my Mr Grey and I have a strut in my step.  Thank you Mrs James hope you write more books like this.
0143119680|4.0|I was a bit worried what I would get when I bought this, figuring it wasn't exactly targeting men as the core audience. That said I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the book and it's sequel. Granted the book is laced with the standard urban fantasy \\"girl meets dark handsome vampire\\" stuff but I didn't feel overwhelmed by it at any point (ok I did skip a paragraph once or twice). As a fan of history I liked the way different historical events and characters are referenced and how the story is tied to them (this gets even better in the 2nd book). The story is fast paced and there was never a point where people spent more than a paragraph or two on staring into each others eyes.<br /><br />I'm sure there are a lot of reviews out there that judge the book from a feminine side so let this be my recommendation from a male perspective. I liked the book and the sequel and will buy the 3rd book as well.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Probably one of the most enjoyable \\"hard\\" science fiction books I have ever read. Mr. Weir actually makes lengthy technical and engineering details well, riveting. And he does it with a great deal of campy humor that makes this a very human story, not just a technological thriller. There are excellent psychological overlays, and one gets to know not only the primary character but many others quite well. Not that many books I have read have managed to be exciting in the page-turner sense, thoughtful, irreverent and a real hoot at the same time. \\"The Martian\\" truly does. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. You will be glad you did, unless you have an utter abhorrence of space, technology, and lame (but wonderful) jokes.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Not much to add to what has already been said. This is a great book. As a piece of literature it's not quite 5/5 IMO but considering it's only 2.99 I did give it 5 stars. One of the best (if not The Best) indie books I've read this year. Can't really recommend it enough, especially for those (like me) who enjoy a good coming of age story.
B00A202A3I|5.0|This episode actually made me cry. I am a hard nut to crack and this one definitely opened my internal tear factory. The acting was superb! I forgot I was watching a show for a few moments and started to feel the characters pain. This one is a must see!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Being a huge fan of the Alien series of movies, I could not wait to watch this.  While I would have preferred a prequel, true to the Alien series, I was happy with the treatment and absolutely loved Noomi Rapace in her role.  Something in the ending cost it the 5th star, I was not \\"satisfied\\" and would have preferred something different!!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but it seems to lag quite a bit, especially if connected to the Internet. It lags more than any other game I have!
B009AJD5E0|4.0|having been a Aliens fan, it was what I expected.  It's not an instant classic but it's entertaining enough to watch a couple times.
1595827684|5.0|so i order the art of mass effect universe like 2 weeks ago and im impress on how much art this book contains from all of the mass effect games . I love it and if you're a fan of ME you also need to have it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a good app but it needs to be updated. I would get this app though. the update will be better because you can get minecarts, fishing and portals
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Cute movie, my 3 year old loves it & I don't mind watching it with him.  I've been running accross kids movies with inappropriate language or it being too dark of a movie, this is NOT one of those movies!  Very upbeat & happy.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I've always thought Pete Townshend is a genius, but believed him to be a snob.  Maybe he's mellowed with age.  I really enjoyed this book and learned so much about a man and group I have always idolized.  I don't think he held anything back. I would recommend this book to any Who fans, and even those who aren't may hear their music differently after reading this book.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|this is what my son want's for Christmas. It looks good and got here fast so i can't complain when it get's this it's going to make his day
0143034901|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who enjoys scary, erotic, touching, tragic and thrilling. After a bit of a slow start the story is very intriguing. It takes place in Barcelona in the 40's and 50's so a background in Spanish and/or a knowledge of Barcelona would add to the reader's appreciation.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Fun, simple game with some hefty challenge. No frustration here. I've got a high tolerance though.<br /><br />Get this game now.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game until it reset on me and I lost my scores, upgrades, money, items... all gone. What's the point now?
B000067QMD|5.0|These caps are great for the working pumping mom of an Avent bottle family. I pump into an avent bottle, put a cap on it, and then it's easy to transport. Our nanny then just puts a nipple on the same bottle when ready to feed our daughter. It cuts the amount of dirty bottles in HALF (a big deal in our house).
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|having the tablet version of this game gives you more space to draw what is needed to draw, so the fun never stops,
B004MYFUC8|4.0|I loved the book, so I was interested in seeing this illustrated version. I like to draw Victorian pictures and then pop culturize them in a sort of \\"Dali\\" way.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|this app does work well but the oly upset i have for it is that downloading videos takes a while and sometimes the videos wouldn't work well. Depsite this small defect I got i really  like it.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Of course, the first movie was better...brilliant, funny, exciting, a wild ride filled with great action scenes and sarcastic comments and the deep friendship between our (rough around the edges and too smart for his own good) Sherlock and the ever-suffering Dr Watson.<br /><br />As a second movie goes, this is a good one.  Its always hard to follow brilliance.  That being said, its well worth watching and owning.<br /><br />The friendship is still there, though Watson is understandably being pulled further away from Sherlock by his impending wedding.  Sherlock seems more vulnerable in this movie, perhaps because he is on the verge of losing so much and is facing a man as brilliant and cunning as he is...if not more so.  I wasn't sure they could cast someone to be as charming and evil as Dr Moriarty always has been in my mind from reading the books, but the one in the movie comes close enough.<br /><br />Who will win the battle of wits?  What will Sherlock do, what will he give up, for Watson's sake?  It really did feel like the real fight in the movie was between Dr Moriarty and his impending mechanistic impersonal World War mentality and Sherlock with his clumsy appreciation and belief in (much as he might deny it) human companionship and caring.<br /><br />One thing that these movies have done is made Sherlock more vulnerable, more human...as much as he is made inhuman by his gift/curse.  Watson is also as imperfect as he is loyal and brave.  Law and Downey have done a terrific job with these characters.<br /><br />Holmes purists probably dislike these movies, but I enjoy them as a modern re-envisioning for our times.  Which, if you're going to make a movie out of any books written in and tied to a previous historical period, you have to find a way to make them connect to and have meaning for a modern audience.<br /><br />Saw both in the theatre and bought them both on DVD and will go see a third movie if they make one.  Bravo!

0385535147|5.0|I have almost given up on Grisham after reading his most recent legal books.  I am glad I did not and read this one.  I loved the story, especially how it developed.  I will not give away anything to say that the plot turns were wonderful.  I am amazed at the differences of opinions of the reviewers.  My vote is that this is a winner.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like very much the simple design and ease of use. Like the colors and the big keys and the big numbers on screen.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its a amazing game!! oh and the solution to losing all your gadgets: leave one mission un-completed! I do this so I can buy all the gadgets and never lose them! :) hope this helps!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I bought this set for my son's 5th birthday! It's so stankin' hard to find Doctor Who products of any kind in the U.S. so I knew Amazon would be the place I'd hit up first for gift ideas. I certainly didn't want to disappoint my son, who is a true Whovian in the making! He was SO excited to get this set. Matt Smith is his favorite Doctor and he knows ALL of the aliens and story lines. I love this show so much! It's great for the entire family. I love that not only can I enjoy this show but my young children too! it's a great family program and I am very happy to have found this set on Amazon.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't get enough of Christian Grey. Disappointed by the ending but it was predictable. Read it with enthusiasm though. I would recommend all three books.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Simply loved it!  I've already watched 5 times.  Music was great.  Tom Cruise really pulled the part off. I really hope they make a part 2.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I definitely couldn't of gotten through the game without using the walk through. Didn't take me too long to get through it but I could have gotten through without the cheats either.<br />Was the first long play game I have played on my phone and I enjoyed it. I like puzzle games and this is a good one.<br />Only complaint would be having to go back and forth a lot but would have to do that on some console games also. All in all, good job.
1439152802|5.0|I feel no need to write out the story . Don't spoil it for yourself by reading the plot. Just know that it is about 3 people whose lives collided and everything coming out of the collision was nothing you'd expect. Kate is an awesome story-teller, and her writing is simple and deep.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|One of the most moving books I ever read. Vxfycvvuvkvkv ggg high high bbl Gb Bush. H. High bbl hath_
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie.  It made me sweat in weird places while sticking my hands in my arm pits and smelling them.
0596804822|5.0|- Lot of valuable information about 3D programming on iOS<br />- Starts a project from a scratch (HUGE THANKS, this way you will know exactly what is going on)<br />- using OpenGL ES with fixed(ES1) and programmable pipeline(ES2)<br />- yes, projects are outdated in 2012, therefore be sure to know your way around XCode4+ to get code compiled.<br /><br />Anyting else!?<br />YES!<br />Looking forward to see \\"iPhone 3D Programming 2nd edition\\" definitely more books about OpenGL ES from the author<br />(a chapter or two about shadows, picking and other cool 3D visual stuff)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! I thought it was a cute story and I also thought the characters were really cute and worked well within the story line. I felt Abby was a likeable leading lady and I loved Travis. He had issues, but I think Abby provides a nice balance for him. Overall, I would recommend this book to others. It was entertaining and the drama was well balanced!
B0098460O4|5.0|These two have the most amazing voices! It takes a special talent to evoke such emotion in the listener. There is not a track on this CD that I would skip. I love them all! The only thing I would change would be the sound mixing. At times, the accompanying instrument sounds and voices are overbearing. Charlotte and Jonathan have such pure, strong voices: they don't need so much interference that at times detracts from the music. I look forward to their next album: maybe something for Christmas next year?
B0092C2X7U|4.0|The game is goodish... I beat the trial from google play and was already bored with it. I gave it a high review to make up for the ones that rated it low without even playing it. Though minus one star for permissions.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Fantastic ensemble cast of talented actors in a bittersweet and ultimately uplifting tale about aging gracefully and finding meaning in the golden years. The message stays with you long after the film is over. A must see for young and old alike.
B0053FP1PQ|3.0|I did enjoy this newest record from the Kooks. It's got great songs and a great story... But I can't say it's my favorite of the Kooks albums.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I love Ian Banks books in general and Culture books specifically.  I was somewhat let down by this book.<br /><br />I thought the plot was pointless and lacked any impact. The sad part is that the pointlessness of the plot is so blatant it almost feels like the author was trying to make some kind of statement or lost a bet. kept hoping for some surprise plot twist that never came.<br /><br /> The Culture 'Minds' were petty and not altogether in keeping with how they've been portrayed in other novels.  Also I didn't empethize with any of the humanoid  characters.<br />I'll think twice before buying another Culuture book...
B0022W6L6G|4.0|I loved everyone song on this album. The choices were all great to make up this collection. However, I feel like it missed a few of the essential Mac songs.
B003KVKQB4|3.0|Naomi Klein's distorted view of events makes for interesting and shocking reading but history is much more complicated than the simplistic explanations she draws and conclusions she arrives at.<br />The idea that the US (and specifically the Chicago School) and Israel are the source of all of the worlds problems is just not tenable.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was very exciting.  I never expected this movie to be as good as it is.  Very entertaining.  I like that Liam Neeson is so intent on finding his daughter and he won't give up until he finds her.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I've never read the 50 Shades stories (mainly because everyone else reading them took the fun out of it) but The Crossfire Series is definitely a series to keep up with! The author is very descriptive, making you feel like you're their, and even if you didn't read the 1st novel, she makes sure you are up to speed on the happenings within the first book! (but I HIGHLY recommend you reading the 1st one in addition to this one).
B009NQKPUW|4.0|My husband stayed awake for the whole movie. It was interesting, but left a few loose ends - probably sitting on the cutting room floor somewhere. Or perhaps I need to go watch the Alien movies and it will make sense.
B003QJME5G|4.0|It is nice to be able to control some of your fan speeds.  I bought this one based on other good reviews.  The fan controller only controls 4 fans, thus I have two 200mm Intake fans connected and two 200mm Exhaust fans connected to the controller.  It is important for me to be able to control air flow to keep my overall computer temperatures down as far as I can.  This fan controller works as advertised and it is nice to be able to turn down your fans to save on power when I am just using my computer for regular applications and not gaming.  It also has four temperature sensors in which you can put anywhere in some of the larger computer towers due to the length of the sensor wires.  Being able to change the interface colors is kind of cool as well, and very easy to do.  A good product for the price....
1442337966|5.0|I have read all her books and yet found the audio book of The Power much more powerful.  I seemed to hear it more effectively this time.  Recommend everyone in the world works with this material and what a better place we would all live in!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of Thrones is an amazing TV adaptation of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. The casting is excellent and the creation of the land of Westeros (and beyond) is imaginative. The \\"Wall\\" is particularly well done and brings the enormous scale described in the book to the screen. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the series.<br /><br />Two caveats: I have read all of the books in the series that have been released to date (eagerly awaiting the next release) and I don't think that I could catch all of the nuances referred to in the TV adaptation without having read the books. Second, HBO has included all of the violent and sexual scenes described in the book in graphic detail (I imagine to bump the ratings) so it is definitely adults only viewing.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Great book. Everyone has to read it. All  the time I wait and it just gets better and better. Go Rick Riordan
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|This show is ridiculous. The plot is weak and has a number of holes. The acting is poor. The only reason I continue to watch is because I bought the whole season on Amazon. Don't waste your time or your money.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Worked well as soon as loaded. Easy to use. Wish it did an auto In box request on start up, but not a big issue.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Always a great book and able to download it immediately on all my tablets.  Great, fun company to buy books
0670022411|5.0|Having read all summer, I was bored with the same old murder/mystery/suspense, and/or romance methods.  This title caught my interest at the library, so I gave it a try after reading the overview.  Could NOT put it down!  Reminds me of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series...time-travel, adventure, and an old-fashioned romance.  I'll be finishing this series and looking for other titles by this author.
B005E7AOHI|2.0|As a long time Primus fan, i was licking my chops in anticipation for this one. Though Herb wasn't in the studio for this, I figured Ler would lend enough influence for this to at least not sound like one of Les's solo discs. Sadly, I was wrong. The entire CD screams \\"Les side project\\" and, though many like his solo work, I was hoping for the Primus which had made such a strong comeback with the \\"Animals should not....\\" EP.<br /><br />Lots of throwaway songs on this disc, unfortunately. \\"Lee Van Cleef\\", \\"Jilly's on Smack\\", \\"Eternal Consumption Engine\\" and others sound like nothing more than excuses to showcase Les (and he is one of my favorite bassists, by the way) while tossing in some mindless lyrics and vaguely cohesive song structure. On the plus side, Jay Lane steps in for Herb and performs quite well in the drum chair. Herb will always be THE Primus drummer, however, and his absence will always be conspicuous.<br /><br />As with any band, expecting Primus to stand still and record \\"Sailing on the seas of cheese\\" is pointless and silly. Evolution is good and they have evolved well, for the most part, over the years (witness the incredible \\"My Friend Fats\\" from the aforementioned previous EP), so I was expecting a lot more with their latest full length. For better or worse (depending upon your perspective), I believe that Les's side project work has manifested itself in his Primus material. For me, that is a disappointment.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The CD was excellant and Adele is easy on the ear. Being in my 60's I feel this is a great compliment to her. I can actually understand the CD and relate to it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great read, and one you want to read again.  A fast pace, cannot put it down book that captures your interest from the first page.*****
B008I43DYU|5.0|works for my Uil mathematical work worth the dollar I would reccomend this to everyone good luck to you all in you're mathematical adventures
B000MD9UJC|5.0|My two Mini Mags are twenty years old and this conversion is a excellent upgrade to keep a old incandescent flashlight in service. If you are looking for max lumens this is not for you this conversion will not turn your Mini Mag into one of those high end LED flashlights. This conversion by Nite Ize is a excellent upgrade it will double the lumen output of the incandescent bulb from 15 to 30 lumens. And the push button switch in the cap will give you easy one hand on and off operation. With this conversion the light will last for 25 hours at 30 lumens. If you want max lumens then get the TerraLUX LED that puts out 140 lumens but it will shorten your battery life to just 4 hours. People seem to focus on lumen output to much and do not give any consideration to battery life. You will have to decide what you need most more brightness are longer battery life. Since the 30 lumen LED doubles the light output you will defiantly see a difference between it and the old incandescent bulb. Honestly 30 lumens is not bad at all for the average task people use a Mini Mag for it works great. After you install the LED chances are you will never have to replace it again. Get you some of those long life AA batteries and you have a light that can set around a long time and still work when you need it to.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|You have to admire this guy.  Being a focused and disciplined person has helped Arnold achieve greatness in bodybuilding, movie making, and politics.  Its hard to imagine a guy who has a thick accent and not the best looks, achieving what he has.  It is amazing.<br /><br />I do find the story somewhat sanitized.  I think there was alot more that went on in his life that he didnt disclose.  I think he is on a campaign to win back Maria.  If he would have revealed all the warts, it might be more than she could possibly forgive him for.  But powerful, wealthy men many times think they can do anything and get away with it.  Arnold proves this maxim true.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|I have subscribed to Amazon for every episode of \\"The Walking Dead\\" and this has got to be the greatest TV show of all time.  I really hope this series goes on and on and on
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Id recommend this book to any one...I loved it...I never looked forward to getting back to reading a book soon much... u really feel for ana and grey... u cry when she cries...its a soap opera in page form... I can't say enough about this book... I love it... I love it.... I love it ;-)
B009K72G8I|4.0|thought the picture was as download were great. i have watched all seasons of clone wars but this season has so far been an upset, this season feels so dull no action, drama, nor suspense but as a true fan i am going to keep watching them...
B0092C2X7U|1.0|I actually found the game a lot of fun but it constantly locks up or crashes on my GS3. It was just as fun to find new ways to fail as actually play the game.
B0058YPILY|5.0|There isn't much that can be added to this series!  Love these shows and the ease of buying this item on line, having the best price guaranteed, and getting it so quickly at my front door, makes this just the best way to get your favorite videos!
1423136802|4.0|I received my box set and I'm very happy with it. Deducting one star because of minor damage to the box set (not the books) and i think the package could've been better isolated. There was a lot of free space in the cardboard box where the box could've jumbled around
B000066C1Z|1.0|Record arrived on time. However it was not scratched but broken hence I have no use for it. I would of understood if there had been a small scratch  but not completely broken. This  is unacceptable. I'm very disappointed.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect but was taken with the way Vonnegut could weave together such a wonderful story. I will be reading as much Vonnegut as I can in the future. Highly recommended to anyone interested in great literature.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Awesome movie and great with friends! I absolutely loved it. And u guys have to stop comparing it with Borat. That's a whole different movie. You can't compare a movie and give the the one u liked more a better review. These reviews is intended for someone's review on a movie, not two different movies.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I saw Magic Mike and wanted to see more of Tatum Channing.  This was great because I got to see Tatum and it made fun of a television series that I watched when I was younger.  Very entertaining.
B001230JXC|5.0|The original release blew me away in 1990, and this remastered and expanded version takes the music to even greater heights. I've only heard a few songs from Depeche's more recent albums, but given the fact that I'm still getting plenty of mileage out of Violator, I may add the remastered Songs of Faith and Devotion to the collection and call it a day.
B008SGMPVU|4.0|Looks and sounds as expected.  Decent upgrade from previous DVD releases.<br />Please Note: Amazon lists the \\"Special Features\\" as \\"None.\\"  Which is wrong.  I believe it was changed because it initially stated that both the 68 min. student film, and 83 min. feature film version of the film, were each present on this release -- and that isn't true.  So they simply deleted that information and substituted \\"None\\" in the Special Features field.  A common mistake made by Amazon.  There \\"are\\" Special Features.  They are the same as VCI's previous Hyperdrive DVD edition, and are as follows:<br /><br />1. Let There Be Light: The Odyssey of Dark Star The Extended Version (feature length documentary in HD)<br />2. Audio commentary track by \\"super fan\\" Andrew Gilchrist<br />3. On-camera interview with science fiction author Alan Dean Foster (SD)<br />4. 3D Visual Guide to the Dark Star spaceship (SD)<br />5. An interview with actor Brian Narelle (Doolittle)(SD)<br />6. Text trivia<br />7. Original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />** AGAIN: Missing from this edition is the shorter, 68 minute \\"student film\\" version of the film **
B009NQKPUW|2.0|In its theatrical form, this movie is a straight-up botch. It is so poorly written and delivered that I have to wonder what Ridley Scott was thinking when he signed off on the whole mess, and I cringe to think that this was meant to be the kick off for a round of linked stories. Further, I would implore any fans of Alien or Scott who have not seen this yet to just avoid it entirely. It's that lame.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|The graphics stink but the clearly fake reviews make this much more so (poor) don't waste your time on this
B0063B2BGG|5.0|Witty, fun and entertaining.  Continues the story line from previous seasons although the story becomes strained at points.  While each episode is self contained, there is a solid core of threaded undertones that adds depth and humor that will be missed if not watched in sequence.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I knew that I was going to get this book, because the fact that its written by JK Rowling is a massive selling point.  However most of the book was unfortunately rather dull.<br /><br />The book explores the roll of lots of different characters, some of whose story lines are interesting and enjoyable to read, however others you don't really care about them.  Towards the middle of the book I didn't want to put the book down, unfortunately this was for the wrong reasons, I couldn't wait to get the book finished so that I could read something a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />The casual vacancy does have its great moments but it is let down by how dull some of the other story lines can be.  It is well written as Rowling does make the characters feel very believable and realistic but don't expect it to be the best book you've read this year.

B003QP4NPE|1.0|The prose is lackluster, and a lot of detail is given about what things are instead of how they affect the story - especially in the beginning. The author should take a note from Gibson or Sterling or even early Stephenson: if a wildly advanced technology is so important to the narrative, then make the narrative drive the description of these technologies. The first quarter of this book feels like a primer on what technology has been doing for the past fifteen years -- and probably would have seemed out of date when it was published three years ago.<br /><br />He introduces random point-of-view characters, only to have them never be featured again. With very little gained from the inclusion of these aside chapters. It's an attempt at being edgy and exciting, but comes across as disorganized and amateur. I've seen spaghetti code more organized than the plot of this book.<br /><br />All of this makes sense, given that Daniel Suarez is an IT consultant first, and author second. Throughout the book it seems as though it's more important that Dear Author brandish his terrifying knowledge of obscure IT acronyms, to prove that he knows more than the reader.<br /><br />Those familiar with people who work in IT know the type.<br /><br />The entire novel is self-indulgent, poorly constructed, plastered with poster-board characters trying so hard to be archetypes and failing so hard that it hurts.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|My all-time favorite movie!! Hachi is a very touching story, it truly shows the devotion and loyalty of a dog for its human companion. I cry every time I see this movie, and as a owner of three beautiful dogs and a dog lover, this movie just really shows how far a dog will go for you and how much they care for you, expecting only your love in return. So, overall, if you are hesitating on whether or not to buy this film, I say: go for it!!! It is a must-have movie and I mean it's only like $4.99 so you can't beat that!!! It truly is a wonderful story!!
B00979CS50|4.0|As one of the few performers - perhaps the only one - to be sued by his label for producing \\"unrepresentative music,\\" it should be clear to all and sundry that Neil Young will issue what he damn well pleases. Perhaps less apparent to more casual visitors to his extensive catalog is the cyclical nature of his output, which is both a comment on and a tribute to the enormous breadth of the man's talent which allows him to operate in multiple music genres with equivalent success. This pattern has its positive and negative effect for those not interested or willing to follow Mr. Young on his travels down the musical highway and - to paraphrase the man himself - into the ditch at the side of the road. Those loving his country side can be put off by his garage band material, while those wishing it was only Neil and the Horse might feel the same about the country product. Then there's the far more eclectic material - his forays into `alternative' styles (`Trans' and `Le Noise' being two examples separated by over 20 years) - that can alienate a wide audience, including David Geffen. Suffice it to say, the small group loving Neil Young the composer of the broadest scope of music imaginable is the only segment always satisfied.<br /><br />I'd suggest the last decade tested even this group; his last four or five albums have been somewhat mediocre and, on a couple of occasions, highly politicized. Throughout this period, his label stuck with him, though it's probably the case they had little or no choice other than dropping him. So, one can only imagine what - despite the history - Reprise executives thought when they first heard of `Americana.' But, the bigger surprise may have been when they heard it. While still a point off the notional curve, the album was a brilliant rendering of American music as reinvented by Neil Young with Crazy Horse. Now, it's been a long time since he recorded with these guys and some believed - myself included - that they'd never play together again. But, they did get together and record, and now we have a second album; one that is a triumph.<br /><br />`Psychedelic Pill' is a two-CD, 88 odd minute return to the glory that can be Neil Young and Crazy Horse. It evokes the same sigh of pleasure and relief one felt when first hearing `Ragged Glory,' itself a return from another stylistic adventure. Given Young's tendency to write songs and then stow them away for years and decades, it's hard to know or imagine or guess when any of the material may have been written. For example, the first cut (`Driftin' Back') feels a lot like it was done during the `Sleeps With Angels' / Complex Sessions period. After starting over an acoustic guitar and vocal solo, the band joins in for a 27 odd minute journey that made me really want to be driving north on Highway One past Pismo Beach and Avila Beach heading for Santa Cruz. This trip gives you time and situation to think about things and delve even the whys and hows of it all. This is why the thrust of the song seems to be recovery and reunion on multiple levels. Clearly Neil Young wants to reconnect with his garage side and his long-time (40 plus years) partners; that can be seen by the sharp shift from the aforementioned solo to what is an archetypical NY & CH production. It also appears to be a yearning for past things lost - another concept which permeates much of his music. But, this emotion is heightened by lyrics that - while a bit opaque and inserted periodically throughput the 27 odd minutes of the piece - reference his recently released autobiography; his long-standing and well-known hated of digital (note the CDs were recorded in A - A - D format; who does that anymore???) and the potential decline and fall of civilization due to corporate collectivism, among other things.  Yes, overall, he seems a bit peeved with the current state of things; again, not an unusual commentary from him. Let's say, it's epic in its scope and a fine entre into this recording as it tells us Young wants to get some things out in the open.<br /><br />The two versions of `Psychedelic Pill,' one in the second slot and the other at cut nine is a defiant scream that being old (I'm 63; he's 67) doesn't mean acting that way. Built around another of those Neil Young mythic women the song orders us to follow her lead and live life to the fullest.<br /><br />On `Ramada Inn,' we have Neil Young and Crazy Horse evoking the sound of 'Touch the Night,' from the Geffen period `Landing on Water\\" CD. A couple is passing the night just outside of Los Angeles. If understood correctly, they're moving south and are firmly bonded by their purpose of visiting long-time friends. Dinner and drinks and still more drinks gradually exposes the horror of the relationship. At the least, the man is an alcoholic; at worse he's an abuser. The woman - through inaction arising from fear, or desperation or something - stays in the relationship. There are several times in the song where we are informed the man \\"gets what he wants\\" and the woman \\"does what she needs;\\" with the unspoken message being \\"to survive.\\"<br /><br />`Born in Ontario' returns to a retrospective theme with a tune that is the least psychedelic of the set. While he's talked of growing up in Canada before on `Helpless,' this piece seems again to have been driven by thought processes related to his autobiography. He references both his parents and their travels - any maybe travails - as he was growing up. Pushed along by a countryish melody with a chorus built around listening to the Grateful dead, it is, to my mind, it's the least substantial song here.<br /><br />The substantiality is greater on the second piece describing how Young got into song writing. With `Twisted Road,' we learn of the impact of two giants (yes, it's a pun but you have to wait for it) on Neil's song-writing. The song begins by mentioning the how Dylan's `Like A Rolling Stone' caught his attention and the connective leap he made to Hank Williams. Having not yet read his autobiography, I don't know if this topic is mentioned as a notional moment-of-creation. I will say that upon hearing the words, it made perfect sense to me.<br /><br />And now, to loop in the pun with my view of \\"Walk Like A Giant,' another song that is part of the look back that permeates the entire two CDs of material. It's what this song is not that makes it so powerful. It's not a rant and it's certainly not a whine. Nor is it a belly-aching bitch. In point of fact, I'm not sure I can describe what it is with any certainty until several - perhaps many more listens - so that I can divorce my feelings of what getting old means from the message Young is making. What you will find is an instrumental digression at the end that - along with three false endings and what sounds like the base line to `Like A Hurricane,' approach `ARC' in its organized chaos.<br /><br />`She's Always Dancing' is one of those enigmatic Young songs, depicting admiration from afar. Likely more metaphor than reportage, it's another recurring theme harking to other remarkable and perhaps unobtainable women as portrayed in `Cinnamon Girl.'<br /><br />Shock, pain and the inability to solve the problems affecting your family makes `For the Love of Man' the most sad and poignant song that Young has perhaps ever written. It addresses the agony a parent, any parent would feel when confronted with insurmountable barriers like those his son has faced throughout his life. The song reaches its pinnacle in the last line when Young - a man always seemingly in control, or at least determined enough to push on despite the damage he may cause - simply admits that parents often find themselves unable to help their children they way the really want to do. But, they often find the strength to do what they need to.<br /><br />All in all, this record is classic Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Though the lyrics may be a little suspect, one cannot deny the magic that happens in the synergyof these four guys.ms.

B003Q5CO6Y|5.0|Wow. Just... Wow. Prepare to be blown away. By far one of the best episodes, if not thee best episode of Breaking Bad. When it ended I was in shock, covering my mouth, leaning forward on the couch, staring at the screen and saying, \\"OMG! No way! OMG!! No way!!!\\". As soon as I could I watched the whole episode again, then the last 5 minutes a few more times. Unfreakingbelievable! I was most impressed at how far Mr. White would go to protect Jesse - a punk who seems to deserve nothing but who, if you really think back, has actually been quite loyal to Mr. White and Mr. White did not forget.

B000000WFZ|4.0|There is not one bad cue here , and a few that are amongst Morricone's best - and this is saying A LOT having been a fan since I heard A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS in 1966.  MISERERE is just an absolutely beautiful, sad, haunting work that damn near brings me to tears every time I listen to it.  And ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN is unforgettable.  Why this score did NOT win the Oscar is a total mystery, especially since 'ROUND MIDNIGHT was more about adapting songs than original music, and why the Academy music branch nominated it is criminal.  Fortunately they fixed their mistake in 2007 when they awarded Morricone an Honorary Oscar for his life's work.
0446580848|5.0|Agent John Corey has retired from NYPD and now works for a federal Anti Terrorist Task Force. He and his wife FBI Agent Kate Mayfield, team up on a dangerous mission to Yemen. For readers daunted by the Mid-East setting, Nelson DeMille captures yet simplifies the complexity of the Mid-East culture, adding his expected cynicsm, irreverence, and very sharp wit.<br /><br />This is a clever and believable suspense novel. DeMille's unique writing style blends the harsh reality and terror of Al Qaeda with laugh out loud humor and somehow he makes it work. Just when you let your guard down and are chuckling at one of Agent Corey's many humorous digressions, you are jolted with a reminder of The Panther's presence.<br /><br />The well executed story segways nicely from The Lion, but if this is your first De Mille book you will quickly get to know John Corey and back tracking to earlier books will be well worth it. Nelson DeMille remains my all time favorite author and The Panther ranks in my top five.

B005HSGB6W|5.0|I had heard of this movie from a friend many years ago. From what I'd heard of it, it was a graphic story laden with violence. I also learned that it was based on a book. Years later, still have never seeing it, I saw that my local library at the time carried the movie. So I checked it out and prepared myself for a controversial film. (I was in the midst of watching a lot of other classics at that time that I had never seen: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Pscyho, Gone with the Wind, etc.) This was around 2009 or 2010.<br /><br />What really ended up surprising me was that I really liked the idea behind the movie. I didn't care for the violence or any of that, obviously, but the central idea behind it all really won me over and really stuck with me well after I had turned it off and moved on. And what was this idea? It was the classic issue of morality. Free will. Good and bad. Moral choice.<br /><br />The gist of the story is, if a society had the ability to \\"rehabilitate\\" sadistic and violent individuals, at what cost would that be justified? Because, ultimately, after Alex receives his treatment, he may no longer have been able to inflict harm on others, but he was also rendered incapable of choice. In addition, he was incapable defending himself against the evils of the world, since he was conditioned to be intolerant of any kind of violence.<br /><br />So this leads one to wonder, if this type of treatment existed, would it be a fair course of action? Might some justify it as payback for truly sadistic persons who have inflicted so much harm upon others? If given the choice of this \\"treatment\\" versus a life incarcerated, or even the death penalty, what would someone in Alex's shoes choose if they were truly informed of the implications of such conditioning? We certainly become aware that Alex comes to regret his choice and loathes the \\"rehabilitation\\" he recieved, but he was never truly informed of the specifics of his treatment. Ultimately, he finds his quality of life so intolerable after the treatment that he sees the only possible way to resolve his situation is to off himself.<br /><br />In 2011 I got my hands on a used copy of this book. Ever since viewing the movie, which, as I mentioned earlier, stuck with me, I was eager to read the literary work that was responsible for inspiring the film. The edition I picked up was the one most recently published in the US, the one that included the original 21st chapter that was published in Britain but excluded from previous copies here in the states. Therefor, Kubrick's film, though filmed in England, sticks to the American version - the version that ended with the 20th chapter - instead of the 21st. (More on the 21st chapter later.)<br /><br />The first thing that caught me off guard when I first began reading the book, that I had no knowledge or expectation of, was the language. The language! Surely I've read books with some unusual use of language, old english, slang, etc., but the language in this book was a different breed altogether. The language Alex speaks in, while essentially English, is so obscure and filled with such odd words that it hardly resembles English at times. It's called Nadsat, and it is the teen slang of the future. This in itself was intimidating. Just a few pages into the book, I was quite nervous about what I'd gotten myself into.<br /><br />Sure enough, I got the hang of it eventually. A lot of it can be figured out in context. A few chapters into the book I ended up looking for a glossary type resource online, and found one. This helped a lot with determining the meaning of some of the tougher words. The truth is, though, if you go into the book and treat it like submersion in to a foreign language, you'll understand enough, do just fine, and ultimately figure it out. Of course, if you want to pause and look up every word, too, this will eventually work out fine as well, since by the time you're half way through the book you have an excellent grip on Nadsat. (P.S. Any one want to govoreet in Nadsat with me? I'm real horrorshow at it now.)<br /><br />It's been a few years now since I've seen the movie. From what I can remember, the movie seems to be quite true to the book. Though I am curious, had Kubrick incorporated the 21st chapter into his film, how that would have been done. I would love to see yet another director take on this work of fiction and put it on the big screen yet again in a fresh new interpretation.<br /><br />So, that 21st chapter. I said I'd get back to it, didn't I? Well, though I appreciate that Alex eventually comes around and wants to change (a nice fairytale ending), I have a few problems with it. The thing is this: yes, kids can be irresponsible, reckless, explosive, impulsive, and violent. But I don't believe that all kids are this way, and the ones that are all exhibit these traits to varying degrees, and most not to the extent that Alex was. The level of violence exhibited by Alex was in no way a mandatory or common component of youth. Alex was above and beyond the troubled teenager. And, in my opinion, Alex demonstrated psychopathic characteristics. (I'm no phsycologist - this is all just my opinion.) He got his kicks from other people's suffering and demonstrated little to no remorse for his actions. In addition, he was incredibly egocentric and narcissistic. So, for Burgess to suddenly have Alex overcome this youthful lust for destruction, and crave the more productive route of creation, seems a little too \\"out of the blue,\\" if you know what I mean. Especiallly given his propensity towards violence throughout the entire book. It bothers my that Burgess implies that youth=an inclination towards detruction, and maturity=an inclination towards creation. It just doesn't work that way, to me. Maybe in this strange, distopian, nadsat-speaking world Burgess fashioned, but not in this world. In spite of my criticism, I realize why Burgess wrote the 21st chapter this way, as he said himself, \\"the twenty-first chapter gives the novel the quality of genuine fiction, an art founded on the principle that human beings change.\\" The problem is, I would have liked the change to have been more authentic and convincing.<br /><br />Regardless of the 21st chapter, this is a fascinating story of a thuggish protagonist with some serious issues, and the curious path he follows which brings into question the matter of moral choice, free will, and a human's inclination towards good and evil. A classic tale, for certain, with some crazy language mixed in. Now I have to go find the movie again and see what I think of it now.rip on Nadsat. (P.S. Any one want to govoreet in Nadsat with me?

In spite of my criticism, I realize why Burgess wrote the 21st chapter this way, as he saidhimself, \\"the twenty-first chapter gives the novel the quality of genuine fiction, an art founded on the principle that human beings change.\\" The problem is, I would have liked the change to have been more authentic and convincing.<br /><br />Regardless of the 21st chapter, this is a fascinating story of a thuggish protagonist with some serious issues, and the curious path he follows which brings into question the matter of moral choice, free will, and a human's inclination towards good and evil. A classic tale, for certain, with some crazy language mixed in. Now I have to go find the movie again and see what I think of it now.

0385341008|5.0|At first I was a bit intimidated by the epistolary writing style. And, if you are the same, please don't let it put you off or prevent you from reading this book. Give it time and you will see that this writing style is what drives you to fall in love with the unforgettable characters in this book. Also, it will make you appreciate the art of letter writing, and fret for its demise in modern society. This was an uplifting read in spite of the theme of war. Prepare yourself to fall in love with the island of Guernsey and it's diverse and quirky inhabitants.

I feel other games will get better because of the new high standard it has set in Video Gaming.  I even ordered two copies because I am giving one copy away as a Christmas gift to a fellow Family member who likes the game as well.  The product is awesome, as well as the Amazon delivery.  It's all good !  Much appreciated.<br />Skip Wieland
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I picked up Beautiful Disaster knowing that there was some controversy surrounding the story. While it's labeled as a YA book, many readers and reviewers alike are upset because of the racy content; Sex, violence, gambling and unhealthy relationships fill this book and possibly the minds of the young readers who are drawn to this book. Is it mislabeled or misjudged?<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster tells the story of Abby Abernathy and bad boy Travis Maddox. After leaving her hometown in Kansas, Abby and her best friend go away to school at Eastern University to start new lives where no one knows of her family and her past. When she thinks that she's finally got a new life established, she quite literally runs into Travis Maddox, Eastern University's bad boy. Their relationship is passionate and tumultuous, but is he worth her image and the careful life she's built for herself?<br /><br />This was not my favorite book of all time, but I did really enjoy it. I read it all in one day and I have to say that I was really happy after I finished reading the story. I'd seen the book everywhere and while it took me a while to finally pick it up, I'm glad I waited until I was in the mood to start. This was one of those books where if i had started reading it and wasn't ready, I would never have sat down to finish it.<br /><br />I really liked the characters in this story. While Abby was a little bit messed up, she's still a strong woman with morals and a strong sense of who she wants to be (not  necessarily who she is at the moment or how to get to where she wants to be... she has some issues with that). Travis was the typical douche-bag, who also happens to be a big man-slut. He slept with anyone and everyone and made no apologies for it. Together, they made a very interesting dynamic. You saw Abby and Travis grow together and change because of each other. Abby became more adventurous and less cloistered. She wasn't as scared of the world when she was with Travis and he on the other hand changed completely. He became a one woman man, was sweet, he never pressured Abby and he protected her.<br /><br />Of course we saw them fall apart, but as you can imagine, there was a happy ending. This was a sort of feel good book that ended with you smiling and feeling all gushing inside. I love when books make me feel that way.<br /><br />The plot of the story was not as original as I would have liked, but I wasn't bored. It was a lot to happen in one story and the end was a little bit rushed, but other than that, the pacing was pretty spot on.<br /><br />Now I do understand why there is some controversy over this being a YA book. There is violence and sex in this book and it wouldn't be appropriate for young readers... BUT (and it's a pretty big but) this book was aimed at an older YA audience. It's about a college aged girl who finds love and explores it. College aged young adult readers, in my opinion, are fully equipped to handle the more mature themes in this book. I mean, when I think of what I was doing in college, this could have been a story about me. I went to parties, I had a steady boyfriend and I didn't always make the best choices.<br /><br /> In regards to young readers picking this book up and reading something inappropriate, all they need to do is read the back of the book and look where they found it. I did not find this book in my local book store in the YA section, I found it in the romance section. I also (as I always have done since I was a kid) read the back of the book and it told me that there was sex and violence in this book and I made the decision that Beautiful Disaster was appropriate for me.<br /><br />All babbling aside, I truly enjoyed this book. It was interesting and heart warming at parts and I would recommend it to those who like a good romance rife with teen angst, frat parties and motorcycles. It's a fun ride!<br /><br />8 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)other hand changed completely.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|Enjoyable, but not quite up to Baldacci's standards. I enjoy Baldacci surprises, but the plot here got almost too convoluted to follow.  I'll always buy Baldacci's books over most others, but this one did not seem to match what he's done in the past, nor what I expect he will do in the future.

B0092C2X7U|3.0|Most of the time I fail at doing a back flip just like I do in real life. It's a interesting concept for a game and has interesting rag doll physics but there where several times where I landed the flip when I really should have fallen on my face. It's worth playing it since it's the FAOTD but not sure if it would be worth the asking price. Runs fine on my Nexus 7.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love the superhero movies and this one is awesome! Great story, great special effects, action all the way through. We watched it on our 55 inch LG TV and put on the home theater system and watched from the comfort of our living room. Better than going to the movies. This is a must have for all the superhero fans and anyone who likes a great movie to watch with family and friends.
B008KE3960|4.0|You will feel the need to spend money in order to fully enjoy this \\"free\\" game.  This is an interesting twist on the tower defense genre of games.
B0097UGXFK|4.0|The Hunger Games(released Mar/12)stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen,Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark,Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne,Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy,the mentor,Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman,the show host,Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow and many others.It is a solid cast in an overly long movie that the film makers successfully pull you into at the beginning,but bog down in unnecessary detail during the actual games.<br />The story finds the country divided into districts,12 of them to be exact.After a bloody uprising over 75 years before,society has rebuilt a dystopian world for itself.Each district annually must bring forth two volunteers who compete in a life or death scenario;in an age group of 12-18 years.This is in payment/tribute for past sins while ensuring obedience for the future.The games are held in the capitol city and the farther away people travel to the games,the more impoverished their district is.Our protagonist is Katniss who comes from district 12.She lives a hand to mouth existence and when the call comes for people to register for the games,the scene is something out of a concentration camp.<br />This year Katniss's younger sister is picked but Katniss volunteers to take her place;a gutsy move.Katniss and another local lad are whisked into the capitol city aboard an opulently styled train,filled with food and other delights,none have ever seen before.This is two weeks before the actual games.During that time the two are assigned a mentor,appear on local TV and the more favour they garner,the more sponsors they can pick up.The sponsors can actually help them during the games.It is a whirlwind two weeks,much of it media geared,but at the end the games DO inevitably begin.<br />24 teens are thrust together in a forested area,with a cache of weapons and supplies within reach,but when the alarm sounds to begin Katniss rushes away from the cache to higher ground;advice she follows from her mentor.The cache soon becomes a killing ground and only half the number remain.Katniss is pursued relentlessly by a group,one of which is her friend from her district.When she is chased up a tree her pursuers wait her out.She spots a nest of tracker-jackers,genetically engineered wasps.She drops it on them and while one out of the group perishes,she is also stung.She comes down but is delirious.Her friend from her district tells her to run but she only goes so far before she collapses.A young girl from a different district helps her.They become fast friends and work together,until the girls untimely demise.Katniss eventually finds her friend from her district in a bad way and nurses him back to health.However the two have become close and the media plays it up as two star crossed lovers and even change the rules to allow two victors from the same district instead of one.<br />The games continue until finally the two friends and one of the favoured males from the first district come together on top of a weapons cache.Not only do they struggle against each other but there are four big and vicious cat-like creatures below waiting to feed.The district one male goes over and the two remain.Suddenly the rules are changed once more to allow only one victor.They agree to eat poison berries together,but before they do so,the rules are changed back.They have to have someone as a victor,and their deaths would have denied that;they must not let the public down.<br />The film ends as Katniss and her fellow district 12 friend,return home once more to a rousing reception.<br />The film,in the beginning,takes its time to show you the world you are about to enter and once it grabs you it keeps you;for a time.The absolute decadence of the capitol city compared to the desolate countryside and deprivation there is stark,to say the least.When the actual games begin,that is where this film bogs down.Too much detail and an overly long scenario takes place there.Judicious editing should have been the word of the day here.We also expect our heroine to be more assertive and powerful during the games,than she is.We soon come to realize that she is just as ordinary as anyone else,strong personality aside.And of course this is going against formula and that is perfectly alright,and I get that.However more than once she is saved from certain death by the most formulaic of circumstances;for example,she is about to be killed by another district female and she is in turn killed by the partner of the little girl she befriended who comes out of nowhere,as an altruistic gesture of thanks,or we have the actual killing of the little girl,as a sword flies through the air and should have hit Katniss,but hits the girl instead(bait and switch).That,of course,is bound to give our heroine the extra strength she needs to carry on;as formulaic as it comes.Despite these criticisms,the cast is strong and the plot,despite its obvious weak points,is still an interesting one overall.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.There are no extras on the one disc DVD which I am reviewing here.<br />All in all an intriguing look at a future complete with death games,worked into its dystopian dynamic.The film moves along fine until too much attention to detail bogs the film down in what should be its most exciting moments.Unfortunate.3 1/2-4 stars.It could/should have been better.e word of the day here.We also expect our heroine to be more assertive and powerful during the games,than she

B008XG1X18|5.0|I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire and love it. I can now browse Pinterest to my hearts content. There are only a few small issues that could be tweaked. Most of the time the app starts up just fine, but when I first got the app, and every once in a while you it crashes when loading and you have to restart it again. Not a huge deal. Sometimes when browsing a category, when I've extolled down quite a ways it will crash the app, that is fairly annoying. And finally I wish it encorperated more of the main site features. I would really love to be able to edit my pins after I had repinned them.other than these three issues I love this app and it is definitely getting some mileage from me.
B006RXPUR2|4.0|The acting was very good.  The plot line was also well written, not what you expect in this type of movie.  They stayed away from the formula driven plots so often over used.
B009NB465C|5.0|Watching this series via Amazon is so much easier than recording a show and scrolling through all the commercials. The show is so engrossing it is worth the price to watch it in one piece. The quality is amazing. As for show, the writing only seems to get better each season. Characters are clearly defined and do not stray into crazy story lines as many of the other series do. We can't wait for the next show.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Everyone in this ensemble cast gives a great performance and is so enjoyable. Story is quirky and poignant.  Will watch again to take it all in.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|This game was very fun at the beginning but the repetitive nature of the game makes it get old quick. The graphics are great on Kindle Fire, but otherwise I would not keep this on my Fire. Its just not something that I could see me playing to pass the time since its the same old same old.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a general calculator app. This one does a good job. It is easy to use. I would get this app again.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I did like this game and it kept me busy for a little while. If there was one fix I would ask the creator to make, it would be to make it a longer game with more levels to it.

B001HN6922|1.0|I saw Cars 2 in the theaters with my children, all of whom are 10 and under. We loved the first \\"Cars\\" film and have the PlayStation game for it. I really looked forward to the sequel and was terribly disappointed. The plot was thin and gimmicky, the focus on Mater quickly became tiresome and while the animation was amazing, it was a difficult movie for children to follow. The box office figures don't show it, but Pixar laid an egg with this one.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Season 1 of this show was really scary and it had \\"some\\" gore, but it was more a ghost story. Season 2 is over the top with a lot of gore, sex themes, very disturbing. Does it do it's job and scare, Yes... but is it way too much for kids who may be tuning in, Yes. I can't beleive, even on cable, that they can get away with showing this. Back in the day they wouldn't even allow this material to be seen in theatres, it would have been slapped with an X. Now I'm not some old lady with school children writing this review, I've seen almost every horror film out there. It's just too much. More scares, less sex and extreme gore and you may have something even scarier and BETTER. My opinion.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun and easy. the kids love it. thanks. the mini games are cool too. keep updating please. make acorns easier to get.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a must read if you want the real story behind the lead-up to killing UBL.  Well written!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Though I found the premise a bit hard to digest (the book does a better job here) I found this movie to be gripping and very entertaining. The actress who played Katniss did an incredible job, and it was due to her acting chops that this film works. The games were suspenseful, though I dropped a star for what I believed to be a copout ending. I'll be back for the rest of the series, however. Recommended.

But what I love about her book is that she puts all her resources where she gets some of her products and give you other ideas for different shapes of the cake pop. Things I have not thought of. This book does help you become creative and also shows you there are ways you just have to try it out. Love her tricks too. I love love this book. I have bought her holiday one and I plan to use some of her ideas and try some of my own. I also like she gives some recipes of some cakes by scratch and what frosting would work with what kind of cake.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have to say I was quite surprised by this book or books. I receive the first one free and read it instantly, then I was hooked! I read the other 4 books right away. It is a clever story about a dystopian society with a believable plot. It has great character development with just enough twists and suspense to keep you wanting to read on.

B0042FZOFU|5.0|My first son was just 2 1/2 years old when I got him the Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack. I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, \\"You purchased this item on November 28, 2001.\\" Wow...how time flies.<br /><br />So it was to my surprise when my son recently stayed home from school with a cold that I found him watching Toy Story again more than 10 years later. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, \\"What a great, classic movie, Dad....Let's watch Toy Story 2!\\" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)<br /><br />I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. I even had to buy the standard DVDs, because my kids insisted that they need to be able to watch the movies several times...but \\"upstairs\\" where I don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.<br /><br />Even after having viewed these movies multiple times since their original releases, every time we watch we're all laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.<br /><br />The first is about Andy's toys and what happens when Andy (6 - 8 years old?) introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy-torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not) or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?<br /><br />Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).<br /><br />And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz Lightyear Disney Channel spinoff but not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.<br /><br />So grab this collection and watch them in chronological order if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch them chronologically.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|I guess i could nitpick and find all sorts of things \\"wrong\\" with \\"Dark Shadows\\", but i'll leave that to the hyper-critical, self-appointed \\"authorities\\" on film making, who think they know what the rest will, and should, enjoy.  Personally ..... i loved every minute of it.  A fresh take on an old favorite, maintaining all the fun and charm of the original.  To take it a step farther ..... i appreciate the efforts of the powers-that-be who brought us this wonderful movie.  Thank you to everyone involved in rounding up so much wonderful talent, at every level of the production.  You've created something to be very VERY proud of.
B007M6OIF8|5.0|I've been reading this series since it came out in 2003, and I'm a total nerd for it.  I was very worried that the television adaptation would suck.  Guess what... IT DOESN't!  It's awesome!
B001AJ09JW|4.0|This was a pretty good, strange movie.  I have seen the movie before, but ordered it for my 12 year old daughter to see because she is in to ghosts and supernatural activity these days.  It does have some bad language and brief nudity (female of course), but overall, it was a good movie!

B0033H7VI6|5.0|After looking at a lot of knives and reading review after review, I decided to purchase this knife and I am very happy I chose this one.  Really solid, heavy knife, comfortable grip even for my small, female hands.  The sheath has plenty of velcro strapping to adjust sizing of the sheath and even though not shown in the pics, it does have a leg-tie.  I was thrilled that it was solid built throughout (full tang) with the two separate grip sides actually being well attached to the tang.  The knife arrived sharp but could be a little sharper.  The sheath has an extra compartment which for my knife now holds a sharpener but it could probably hold an emergency fire starter.  This knife is part of my bug-out-bag/camping/hiking gear now.  While you could probably find a lighter knife to keep weight down, I'd prefer a heavier knife that I know will do any job I need it to do.  This knife should hold up well.

030759565X|5.0|I have followed the Smitten Kitchen's cooking blog for a few years and have ALWAYS found the recipes to be both fool-proof and DELICIOUS. Well, the cookbook is exactly like the blog and I couldn't be happier to have it on my kitchen counter to \\"cook through\\"! It is WONDERFUL and contrary to another reviewer's comments, I thoroughly enjoy the personal touch that the author adds to each recipe. It's as if we're all sitting in her kitchen learning each recipe one by one. Last night's dinner was the most delicious mussels with the best french fries I have ever cooked.....we all loved it and can't wait for the next creation out of this wonderful new book!!!
B00009P1O2|5.0|I can sum this up easily: I've watched this concert now about 10 times (and I just got it). Every time, I find myself wishing with all my might that I could time-travel back and be there in person. WONDERFUL. Worth every penny and then some.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille has continued the momentum of his John Corey series, highlighting the cynical nature of an \\"ends justify the means\\" approach to foreign policy and national interests.  Whether one believes in that \\"realpolitik\\" approach, or believes that a nation's core values (and moral sense of \\"justice\\") should have some weight in the overall scheme of things, his series is both entertaining and thought-provoking.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|While I think this was perhaps an interesting concept, to ME it was more like watching a video game.  I didn't feel compassion for the main characters - they seemed one dimensional - unreal. There was no emotional attachment/investment for the viewer with these characters. There was a LOT of slashing and blood flying etc. (much like a video game), and it left me cold and empty.<br /><br />If you buy into the concept of the vampires, it was completely unrealistic that Abe could've killed so many of them with his silver edged axe/shotgun no matter how good his training/skill was.  The scene with Abe and the wild horse stampede fight with a vampire was extremely unrealistic - Abe should not have been able to survive that, much less put up the fight he did. They outnumbered him greatly and had superior strength and speed AND the ability to disappear at will. Not to mention they could've killed him easily in his sleep at any time.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but not well thought out and not well executed. I didn't \\"hate\\" it, but it is NOT a movie I'd want to watch again, nor would I recommend it to anyone.  Ok, maybe some bored gamer teen/young adult males might like it - or those who enjoy blood flying. . .

B000SEIK2S|4.0|Enjoyed the concept of old men/women being recruited for war. Character John and the Colonial world are well developed. Has the ingredients of a fine series: fascinating future world, plausible sci-fi, very human yet idealistic protagonist, and idyllic love interest, all wrapped around an insurmountable set of challenges.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The DVD arrived so quickly, that the seller must have posted it the day the order was received.  Great service!  I bought the movie for a friend, but I have my own copy too, and have watched it 5 or 6 times.  Good movie.<br />Thanks so much to this exceptional seller!

B006LSZECO|5.0|A very twisted, unpredictable plot containing interesting and unique characters.  Overall, it's a highly recommended read. Some people may be offended by the language, which is very vulgar at times.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Led Zeppelin had a style all their own. Just like their drummer John Bonham that style would go down in the annals of rock n' roll history. I prefer this album more because it really showcases Bonham's prolific, one and only style.

B005LAIGW8|2.0|This DVD was a real let down after the original Ghost Rider of a few years ago. It was more like The Batman show fron rthe lat 60's. With crash, boom, bangs flying everywhere. A very disapoininting movie.
0060873175|3.0|It becomes apparent fairly early in the book that Crichton provided the outline for this story and Preston filled in the rest.  Preston did a pretty good job of copying Crichton's writing style, but you just don't get the insightful in depth science passages for the lay man that is Crichton's hallmark.  Not a bad book -  but if you are expecting something like his early works, you will be disappointed.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|This is one of the most horrible movies out there. I thought it was going to be a wonderful movie particularly because of Cameron Diaz, but it wasn't. Justin Timberlake was equally horrible. He just looked good in his nerd outfit. I don't know the other characters well, but they were also terrible. It wasn't funny at all and the movie was boring. Don't waste your time and money on this film. Look elsewhere.
0062200399|5.0|\\"Stardust: The Gift Edition\\" by Neil Gaiman is a re-issue of the 1998 original fairytale story for adults--turned movie. To be fair, the only fairy tales I've ever read are the Harry Potter books. I don't general read this genre, but I made an exception for this book, as the premise sounded interesting. Flash back to small-village England of the 1920s. Dunstan Thorn is a bored, eighteen-year-old youth who lives in a tiny town that's blocked off from its neighboring land by a Wall (with a capital w), which is guarded at all times to keep anyone from entering the neighboring faerie lands, where magical creatures live. The only time the wall goes down is during the fair, which happens every nine years.<br /><br />When such a fair takes place, Dunstan meets a young girl slave at one of the faerie land booths and falls in love with her. They have a one-night-stand, and then the day ends and the Wall comes down once again. Dunstan gets married to a sensible girl, who he has no feelings for (though she loves him), and then goes on with his mundane existence.<br /><br />Nine months later the girl slave from the faerie land gives birth to her and Dunstan's son, Tristan Thorn, and leaves him at the entrance to the Wall with a note. Thus the story kicks off, Eighteen years later Tristan is a full grown young man who has no knowledge about his faerie background, and lives with his father and stepmother. He falls hard for Dunstan's best-friend's daughter, Victoria Forrester--thought to be the most beautiful girl in the village--but who is rather cruel, and mocks Tristan's advances.<br /><br />As they walk together one night, a star falls and Victoria laughingly tells Tristan she'll be his if he finds the fallen star and brings it back to her.  A nearly impossible feat. What's more, the star has clearly fallen beyond the Wall. Unperturbed, Tristan asks his father for permission to cross the Wall. At which point, Dunstan secretly convinces the guards to let Tristan enter the Wall because of his faerie mother. When Tristan enters the Wall, the real adventures began. Many obstacles, encounters with magical beings, and the journeys of others who also have an interest in the star follow.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this to be an enjoyable story. The writing is very descriptive--which is important as the story largely takes place in a fairy land, which would otherwise be impossible to envision--occasionally poetic, and stylish--noticeably written in a way that mimics the style and magic of old fairy tales--with plenty of adventure.  Some parts are too racy for children, but for adults who appreciate fairy tales, I thought this was a well-written read.because of his faerie mother.

B008TRUDAS|3.0|This book had the potential to be awesome, but the author dropped the ball in a couple of places. I'm not a fan of insta-love, and Lake and Will fell in love immediately. They go on one date, during which they talk all evening. Unfortunately, almost none of thier supposedly amazing conversation is in the book, we just hear how great it was from Lake without actually getting the chance to read and experience it with her. I would have been more invested in their love story if we had been able to see it develop.<br /><br />Also, I feel the character of Lake's mom wasn't fully developed. Without getting spoilery, I think the author missed an opportunity in not even introducing readers to Lake's mom's friend, who apparantly had a rather important role in the mother's life.<br /><br />On the whole, it was a good book, but it could have been so much better.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I saw it as our meeting the Gods that created us, only to find they were about to destroy their \\"failed creation\\" by using creatures they created.  In the end the coupling of the creatures with a god created the alien we know so well.
B007P6VM8Q|5.0|When the Swedish quintet The Hives broke out in 2001, their career has been marred by a series of failures. When \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" became a huge hit for the band, their label London Records was shuttered by its parent company Warner Music Group. In 2004, they moved to Interscope Records for their next album \\"Tyrannosaurus Hives\\" and the album went largely unnoticed. A few years later, they moved to Interscope subsidiary Octone Records- also the home of pop rock band Maroon 5. They tried experimenting with new sounds and worked with producers as diverse as The Neptunes, Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse) and Jacknife Lee (R.E.M., Weezer). \\"The Black And White Album\\" was critically lauded, but like their previous Interscope album it was not a success. So they decided to take matters in their own hands on a number of levels.<br /><br />After a five year hiatus, they are back with a new album \\"Lex Hives\\". It's the first album on their own imprint Disques Hives and the first album they produced on their own. They start the album off with the ultra-brief and fairly repetitive \\"Come On\\" which leads into \\"Go Right Ahead\\", in which they lift the riff of Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Don't Let Me Down\\". on \\"1000 Anwers\\", they make a humorous attempt at selling the concept of finding happiness. On \\"I Want More\\", they take their love of greed up a notch by having a desire to want more material things despite already having enough. They try to tune out a miserable and talkative person on \\"Wait A Minute\\" and critique the wealthy on \\"Without The Money\\". They chastise the baby boomers who complain about today's generation on the fast rocker \\"These Spectacles Reveal The Nostalgics\\". On \\"If I Had A Cent\\", they take someone to task over their disrespectful ways and close the album with the ode to graveyard shift workers \\"Midnight Shifter\\". Overall, \\"Lex Hives\\" is a return to form for the quirky band and shows that not even setbacks and disappointments can tame them or their sound.
B008CP93S0|2.0|The best part of this video is some of the outdoor scenes. The plot is rediculous and the acting is mediocre.I would not recommend it unless you like to see a naked man.
1469984202|5.0|I read \\"Wool 1\\" in Feb.  I was frustrated by how short it was and the ending came so abruptly.  Since then, when in thoughts about books, I've found myself thinking about it often.  So I bought the whole series and I'm glad I did. I think it was absolutely awesome.<br /><br />It's set after the end of our world, people live in an underground silo where everyone has a dedicated task that takes their every minute and you absolutely are not allowed to talk about the outside or the uprising.  Just mentioning it may send you to cleaning - which is death.  Which each book you learn more and more about the silo and it's fascinating.  For anyone that likes this genre I'd recommend it.<br /><br />I will read more from this guy and can't wait to read the rest!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I adored this book! As I read through the first half, I panicked that I would never know what happened to the first few stories, until I checked further on to see that there was a second installment. Although a lot of the material is depressing, I ended up feeling satisfied with the resolutions. I felt rather gullible many times, not noticing the hints until the author himself pointed them out, but I thoroughly enjoyed the revelations. With so many books following the same generic plot, these 6 connected but entirely independent stories were refreshing.  With the exception of the one standard action tale with Luisa Rey, which made up for itself through a little bit of excitement, every story was entirely unique.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Action and relationships<br />Intriguing plot twists packed with suspense, drama and characters you wi rember as well as new players<br />You should enjoy if you enjoyed the early Dr Scarpetta novels<br />Recommend this book!

B000KJU182|4.0|Just saw this last night, it was a great sea-going movie. Who know Terence Stamp was young once? I just mainly remember him for Gen. Zod and Tunstall from Young Guns(I know he's been around other places-the limey). Everyone was great in it; although I'm not sold on Robert Ryan and his non-british accent.  With Peter Ustinov already in it, any british guy could have played Claggart and not have to distract you away from the accent.  Don't get me wrong, Ryan did a good job during his scenes, but without the accent it suffers a little.  I'm guessing he was a big thing around this time still; although he'd been a big thing before and after. I loved the ending, even though it had to happen that way, I wish it wouldn't have.  I didn't read the book so I was surprised and excited at following it through to its unexpected(somewhat)conclusion for the first time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the fact that you have to purchase the other games is a bit misleading but all in all a descent waste of time.

1619695006|5.0|Ms Rowling starts her book with descriptions of some singularly petty and unlikeable people from a small English town.  They are squabbling over some of the seemingly inconsequential issues that tend to crop up in small towns everywhere.  As the story builds, the characters begin to fill out and the reader (one hopes) starts to become cognizant of the very deep cruelty and deprivation that results from social policies made by securely self righteous people.  The author brings it all down home to the costs in human suffering that are the result of self-seeking policies.  Her characters are rich and interesting, noone escaping her xray vision for foibles and flaws.  Suspense builds as the book goes on and the reader takes sides.  Her adolescent characters are particularly well-drawn, with nothing held back in her depiction of the dog-eat-dog world of adolescence.  The author could certainly not be criticized for glossing anything over.  This writer read the audiobook, which was very capably performed by Tom Hollander.  The design on the jacket and the CD's is the best I've seen.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Is it just me or did anyone else think it was the same exact story line as Fifty Shades Of Grey? I mean, the book was great but it had so many similarities to Fifty! I am looking forward to the next book to come out so I can see what happens, Sylvia Day is a good author.

0374531269|5.0|There's a reason why armies in Africa, Latin America, Middle East, and the Balkans always mess up; the soldiers are from poor families and terribly paid, while the officers are from connected familes and live like princes. Richard Marcinko mentions this in his book ROGUE WARRRIOR, and ARABS AT WAR discusses this in great detail. These regions all have similar problems as a result; corrupt military leaders, and of course, kiddie combatants.<br /><br />Ismael Beah wasn't much different from the average kid; he went to school, liked to eat a lot and play soccer. Then one day his family tells him to run away because armed men are coming. He sees killing right and left. Then one day some of these \\"soldiers\\" get a hold of him, give him a cigarette to smoke and put a gun in his hands. With his mind derranged from drugs, coupled with the anger he felt, the rest is history.<br /><br />Beah's story didn't really shock me. I see the same thing here in the USA; kids from broken families are recruited by drug dealers, and when you're an angry, fatherless kid, and someone gives you a choice of going to school or making some money, what're you going to pick? If you're a kid, and someone gives you a gun to play with, would you take it? Somehow I think most kids would.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I bought this because it seem like fun.  Do know what to do with my outcome, but that is okay.  I took a large two quart jar that beab salad came in.  The glass was very thick.

B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Setting aside the decidedly weak production values, unappetizing song arrangements and just plain *weird* casting, the most grotesque thing I could have ever pictured doesn't compare with seeing Alec Baldwin kiss Russell Brand, or \\"Grampa\\" Tom Cruise with out his shirt.<br /><br />This was poorly done, even for a musical, and then even for something in which Adam Shankman was involved. Mr. Shankman: please stick with 'So You Think You Can Dance' -- it's what you are suited to do. From the looks of \\"Rock Of Ages\\"..... perhaps the only thing.<br /><br />There is no surprise that this is the inevitable result when a production company gives Adam Shankman way too much money, and then tells him that he is a director.<br /><br />I am currently online looking for knitting needles big enough to completely gouge out my eye sockets, they having witnessed the above and other bizarre acts in this decidedly Shankman video.<br /><br />Maybe a better name might have been \\"Rocking The Aged\\"? Pass on this, entirely.<br /><br />Or, if you can't resist, then before you actually view it, go buy some LARGE, thick knitting needles (or maybe a large, flat-bladed screwdriver!) in preparation for afterward.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I have to say it has been a long time since I cried over a book but Wonder was the one to make it happen.  This story was so magically told.  You simply fall in love with this boy (August) and even with his friends and family.  I loved how you got to read from the other characters point of view. We were able to learn how they truly felt towards this boy, August.  It was very different and very fresh.  I loved everything about this book and I would not only recommend it to my adult friends but I have started to read it with my 9 years old and 7 year old.  It is teaching them a great lesson about friendship as well as having empathy for people.

B0070NSPCU|4.0|This was a very well written book.  The story moved along at a good pace, the characters were well developed, and the world was interesting.  I can't wait for book 2, but unfortunately (for us, but great for the author) Anthony Ryan got picked up by a publisher and it looks like we will be waiting a while.  That is the only reason I rated the book 4 stars instead of 5.  I can certainly understand why a publisher would want to sign him.  It was an enjoyable read, and I would highly recommend it.
0307946711|3.0|David Nichols is without a doubt a talented writer. I enjoyed his prose tremendously however I felt that his story lacked originality. I found Emma and Dexter's personalities so cliched that I was able to predict the next 'day' before getting to it. I found myself a little bored because of that. Even where Emma and Dexter finally get it together is hopelessly predictable and cliched. It was almost as though he had all of these wonderful words and sentences that he needed to craft into a book so he decided to wrap them around characters and a story without giving much thought to originality or depth. One Day has an original concept, that of revisiting two people on the same day each year, however the actual story and the characters were not in any way original. What kept me reading was the prose. I like well crafted sentences and because it was pretty clear how these characters were going to evolve I found myself focussing on only the prose and not the characters. I left the story feeling indifferent to these flat characters and their story.

And isn't that really what the world's about? : P
B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|I am a big baseball fan and wanted to see this movie.  When I did, I was disappointed with it.  The set-up is great, a GM loses top-flight players and has to rebuild with virtually no money.  The movie had me for the first forty minutes or so and the scenes between Brad Pitt and Phillip-Seymour Hoffman were tense.  Unfortunately, the movie never picks up it stays at that same 'building up to something' speed. This movie never really leads to anything. The A's losing in the first round of the playoffs? And changing the way scouting is done in baseball is not a climax (a good story element though). Is it possible for a movie to be filled with more silence and characters reflecting than this one. Boorrring (good drama needs energy in order to validate the silences and reflection).  The movie also leaves out a couple of things: They make it out as if he was working with a AAA team, when in fact, the A's had the best starting staff in the AL at that time, they also fail to mention that they had the league MVP in Miguel Tejada. Despite the losses, they still had a good team.<br /><br />One funny thing about this movie is when he says 'Defense is meaningless' and then they lose the playoffs because of an error. Defense is not meaningless in playoff baseball,Billy. That may explain why they've never won anything. The performances were good, but this movie could have used a lot more energy (and dialogue) that would kept me from wondering 'When is this over?'

B007SGM084|5.0|I only recently started reading romance novels and there are several series out there. I loved how this was packaged very neatly together for me. Not that I can't distinguish between which book comes first, but why bother if it's all ready done for you. Again, this was a great product that made reading these books extra easy.<br /><br />The story itself was very good. I loved the characters and could really emphasize with each one of them. Well written and just something different from teh mainstream romance novels I've been perusing.

1569242739|5.0|I started watching Cupcake Wars about a year ago and became very interested in making cupcakes.  I have purchased several cupcake books and I have to say without a doubt that this is the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!<br /><br />First of all, I am not Vegan....but you don't have to be Vegan to love these cupcakes.  They are delicious and creative!!!<br /><br />Also I am new to baking ANYTHING from scratch and I have no problems following these directions.<br /><br />Next I would like to say that the author is HILARIOUS AND QUITE ENTERTAINING!<br /><br />And one my favorite things about this book is that they have included everything you need to know about baking cupcakes and about the ingredients that are used.  It has conversion charts.  And best of all it has a TROUBLE SHOOTING guide.  There is so much more information than that and it is all written in a way that keeps you smiling and interested.<br /><br />Another nice thing about this book is that the front and back covers have flaps that can be used to keep your place in the book...like book marks.<br /><br />Oh, wait...you want to know about the recipes???  They are the best I have ever had.  A great variety and tastes GREAT!!!
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I love fairy tales and I really could not wait to see this movie.  It has beautiful costumes and very impressive special effects.  It is a cross of fairy tale and sword fighting.  One would never imagine Snow White looking like Joan of Arc when she is riding the horse with her army in her effort to free her kingdom from the reigns of an evil witch.  It is a kind of movie that will entertain the family but I would not recommend it for very small children.  Some fighting scenes are quite savage like.  It is definitely an impressive show however I cannot see it becoming a classic.
0425263908|5.0|I thought at first these books were going to be a copy of 50 shades. But it's totally different. It's a great live story. Similar to fifty shades but I think more interesting!! Can't wait for the 3 rd book.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is full of tips and advice on writing fiction. It is conversational in style with down to earth explanations of strengths and weaknesses of good and bad writers. He writes from his experience as a writer of fiction but this book is a must read for anyone entering the world of writing.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is a movie I watch at least every other year.  It is always fresh.  My favorite part of the movie is when Maria and the Captain dance and it is obvious they are in love even if no words have been spoken to that effect.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Amazing what they did in restoring this movie. The details that I never noticed before when watching it almost make it seem like a new movie.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I'm so happy I bought this.  Nothing about it was disappointing.  The video was very good quality, and so much better than any BAD concert videos I've seen in the past.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Got my CD today and was blown away with the production. Welcome back Jack Douglas, ( produced all the 70s and early 80s ) this CD shows the guys still got it, 2 songs that really stick out to me at least are, Out Go The Lights, and Street Jesus, the pair of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford whaling on these awsome crisp riffs really sounds and reminds me of the old days of Aerosmith, Tom Hamilton shredding that Bass with Joey Kramer pounding on those drums, really took me back to the 70s and 80s, also Joe Perry wrote and sings 2 songs on this CD, really strong CD guys, welcome back......
B0092C2X7U|1.0|just like the title says, there are fake reviews to boost the rating, you can gamble in game with real money, and they gather your info to sell
B00846REIS|5.0|This is such a good book. It is a good story that is really similar to 50 shades but different at the same time. Can't wait for the second part.
0446580848|4.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviewers here. This book was awfully slow and it felt like I was reading a history book on Yemen. There was no action until the last 10% of my Kindle. The only reason I didn't stop reading was because of John Corey's wit and great sense of humor. I am a big fan of DeMille but this book didn't even come close to The Lion or the Lion's Game which I was on the edge of my seat reading. The one mistake I did while I was waiting for this book to be released was reading my first Vince Flynn novel...WOW! I am so in love with Mitch Rapp and the CIA....talk about action!.....I read his 13 books in a row and could not stop. Hopefully, Mr. DeMille's next book will be as exciting as the ones I know he is capable of writing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have readied this book about 5 times. I will read it over and over. I feel in love with the characters. I can not wait for the second part to come out.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good game. It never freezes my phone and it's pretty fun. I got it as a free app, so depending on the price if I had to purchase it for a dollar or something I would.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first part. The second part was even better, can't wait to see what happens in the third part. Stayed up that night until 3am waiting for it to down load to my kindle. A must read If you loved the fifty shades of grey.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining.  I play it in my Kindle Fire and it works fine. I like to play after a long and stressful day at work. It keeps my mind alert.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|WHAT A WAY TO TEACH ANGLES TO OUR LITTLE ONES. THEY LOVE TO SHOW US GRANNIES HOW IT IS DONE.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been with pinrest since last week and I have found many people that I had forgotten about from my school and my wandings
B008MEM24S|4.0|I HAVE ENJOYED THIS GAME WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN. IT GIVES US SOMETHING WE CAN DO TOGETHER AS WELL AS ON THE ROAD.
B002DPRLEI|4.0|One of the funnier movies Doris Day made, but the pairing of Hudson and Randell is the best part. Watch for the inside jokes on Hudson's personal lifestyle.
B009HNDHFQ|5.0|My favorite show of all time!!! Great season. This show never gets old!!!  I have watched every single episode from day 1!!!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I reallynlike this game, but I shouldn't have to go through 6 pop ups every time I start it.  Also I don't know how to add any friends and I am not willing to spend real cash to get through a goal.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Truly something completely different from J.K. Rowling- Characters get confusing at times but the story line holds the reader's interest.<br />We're not in Hogwarts anymore!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I never read any of the books, and I expected to see kids killing each other with lots of gratuitous violence - and was pleasantly surprised.  This movie is very well done, telling a much bigger story than just some excuse to make kids kill each other.  I hope they follow up with a sequel because there's definitely more to tell about this dystopian society.
B004I744AS|5.0|I am the worst speller on this earth. I need a dictionary. I once was told if you can't spell it don't use the word. I would be speechless. But, I do use this a lot to check if the word spell check, check is right. I think spell check is the 2nd worst speller.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Story a little far fetched...  Not to hot for hostage stories.  It had a lot of build up and a five minute ending!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I can not believe that these \\"kids\\" are only teenagers. The depth and clarity of their voices is amazing. The music is easy listening and soothing; at the same time it is powerful and moving. These young people have been blessed with a wonderful gift of song. I give it a 10!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Defiantly get season 4. I have all four seasons and can't wait for season 5 to be put on dvd to order it.
B0041L0Z1S|4.0|I love anything Jane Austen.  I thought this was a well made adaptation!  Good acting and editing done by the Bbc America.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Its a fun game, I like it but it takes way too many coins to do/buy things. and cuz of that it takes forever do to the goals or clear the land. fun besides that.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|Love this documentary...can watch it over and over!  Dave Grohl is fantastic!  Super story and great music, can't get much better than that!
B00009TB5G|5.0|i bought this as a gift for my brother who had bought the first and third in newfoundland and couldnt fine the second. it shipped reasonably quick and was what i ordered. i would suggest this seller to friends and family.
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Overall this is a good read.  The writing is thin and simplistic at times, but the story is engaging and well told, keeping the reader engaged page after page. If you're not looking for anything complicated, or with too many characters to keep track of, this is a good choice.  Suggest ideal for a holiday read or a long flight.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Love it. I like how rick riordan has put you into each characters shoes and how you can read the thoughts of the characters too!
0515149489|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The characters were believable and very unique, especially Simon.  Lot's of information on dog training, maybe even too much. Not everything happened the way I expected it to, though some things did. This isn't my favorite book of hers...Mainly I'm starting to feel like her books always end the same. I think she could be a little more creative...but overall this was a good book and I do recommend it.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Liam Neeson pulls off the action performance of his career in this tight, fast paced spy thriller.  I only deducted one star because the body count explodes above what is believable in movies and up into video game territory.  It looks almost too effortless for him to track down and eliminate these bad guys though they certainly deserved to die down to the last man.  If you liked the 1980's \\"one man army\\" type of movie you will instantly feel at home watching this.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|about slavery in the 1700's.  how one family attains them and keeps them through the years.  talks about the tough times and good times .
B008OOYALE|4.0|its slow at first but when u start getting at higher levels it more fun because of the stuff u unlock i would recomend this game to anyone for  this game my ID: is ChillyWilly123 add me if u get dragon story :)
1615238948|5.0|This is a really good read, it kept me guessing and turning the pages! It was eye opening. Great book club book;)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series of books has kept me riveted  unable to put it down.  And my 10 year old twins feel the same!
B005LAIGP0|4.0|This movie is good and has a very dark vibe to it.  A man who can't get over his wife's death and whether or not if there is a heaven and she's there, you can't but feel sorry for him.  You can feel and see his tourment and his loneliness.  As you can see the acting in this movie is really good and it pulls you in.  Even though the movie is good it isn't super scary.  It does enough to keep you on the edge of your seat anticipating what is going to happen next.  I really enjoyed this movie and believe that if you like movies with a dark, creepy, and gothic vibe to them you will like this movie also.  Plus this movie does not use gore to try and scare you, its more sounds and shadows and brief encounters with the ghost.  I give this movie a solid B.
B00452VF4O|4.0|Truly enjoyed the whole trilogy.  A good picture of the life and events of my \\"family\\" during the 11th & 12th century.  looking forward to reading other books by Penman.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Fairly decent movie throughout. A nice, dark twist on the Disney version many of us grew up on.<br /><br />However, both my wife and I looked at each other in disbelief at the ending of this movie. The acting looked dramatic but the dialogue fell far flat. How the heroine defeated the bad queen wasn't apparent despite obvious attempts to setup an understanding of it previous.<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br /><br />More than anything else, it just felt like there would be a romantic aspect to this movie. The best friend boy as a child who lets nothing stop him from finding her. The rugged Huntsman who's redeeming himself for the guilt of his wife's death. There are numerous opportunities for this to have been something more than what it was. Maybe it couldn't happen because the director was getting a little out of movie romancing from Kristen Stewart of his own?
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This series is fabulous! Love the actors and love the authenticity of the products.  Love the actual events mixed with the story.  Great job!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is an excellent review of world history at the turn of the 20th century.  Thru the eyes of selected  characters we see the abuses of the aristocracy and self appointed leaders. From family to business, politics and world leaders.  Excellent read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book, a close spin off of 50 Shades, but the only thing I have found that even compares. Will be rereading this series!!
B0091THRCU|5.0|This sleeve is actually great, and I wished I had ordered two at the time. It holds the iPhone 5 securely in place, and they have upgraded the tab so that it stays secure with a magnet, really good product.
B00138GY5I|5.0|This has been one of my favorite CD's for quite a while now. My brother introduced me to it when it first came out and we listened to it all of the time. I'm glad to own it again and be able to listen to it on my phone.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I loved these guys from the getgo and especially this  album, almost as much as their first album. I highly recommend these guys on your playlists.
B007THA4FI|3.0|very slow an not interesting until 3/4 the way through. After reading felt it would be a good book for book clubs, lots of<br />very interesting discussions. Got the feeling author does not like men
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This game looks to be fun but it is a bit hard to figure out how all the controls work. Landing has been a big challange for us and we have crashed everytime.<br />There is a tutoral on how to operate this plane but, still can't seem to get it right. I think I just need plenty of practice.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Needs more levels! I keep checking hoping one day there will be more. Someday.. Someday.. Please add more to it very soon.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is really fun and keeps your mind thinking.  Great way to put a little smile in your day.  WARNING....can be addictive !!!
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book was hard to get into and as you persisted it started to get better. By the end of the novel you could not put iyt down. You had to know how it ended.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|They get to build and my son gets to use his imagination! Great game and hours of entertainment when we are in the car!
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Excellent album.  Even though it was released over 30 years ago, the album still contains fantastic melodies and ironic lyrics that are sure to please rock music listeners.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|I was initially skeptical when I saw that Newman was scoring the new Bond movie.  He is extremely talented, but has a distinct style and I've never heard him do an action soundtrack.  When I began listening to the first track, \\"Grand Bazaar, Istanbul,\\" I thought for five minutes that this score would be spectacular.  The action cues are sensational and the Monty Norman bond motif makes subtle appearences making me think that we would get much much more.  Throughout the entire soundtrack I was teased with the possibility of a crescendo of the classic bond theme.  My favorite Bond soundtracks were always the David Arnold ones, especially Tomorrow Never Dies and World is Not Enough.  He masterfully combined action music with the classic bond theme.  I always knew that was Bond on the screen when that music was playing.  Obviously as they shifted in a new direction with the series so too did the music.  Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace hinted at the return of the Bond Theme, but never delivered.  This set up Newman to create a truly epic score.  Unfortunately he comes up short.  Despite his best efforts and working out of his element, Newman succeeds only in copying David Arnold's Casino Royale Score.<br /><br />Mixed with the action are Newman's signature strings and beautiful orchastral talents.  This felt out of place in a bond movie, but works well on a stand alone soundtrack.  Overall, this is the best bond score this century (which isn't saying much).  The most infuriating track is \\"Breadcrumbs\\" in which it plays the beginning of the Norman Bond theme and builds and builds...to nothing.  It's like the track was cut off for no reason symbolizing both the potential and the reality of the soundtrack.  I will continue to be unsatisfied until I get the Monty Norman Bond theme mixed into the score like the classic David Arnold days.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|They're Baaaaacck! After a short 11-year hiatus, one of rock's most dysfunctional families is set to release an album of new material. Aerosmith's Music from another Dimension hits stores Nov. 6.<br />The original release date was pushed so as not to conflict with other artists. Tyler told Cleveland's WMMS: 'You know what? We've got the goods. [There] ain't no doubt about it. We'll wait another couple of months.\\"<br /><br />It's a rugged, back to basics album with the band returning to their gritty, arena rock roots. Producer Jack Douglas's old school touch (Toys in the Attic, Rocks, Honkin' on Bobo) is evident as Tyler's full throttle voice is strong throughout, as is Perry's scorching guitar. Each member had a hand in contributing material.<br /><br />The first track \\"Luv XXX\\" begins with a spooky introduction suitable for a Laserium show followed by bruising drums and guitar that set the stage for the return to the true Aerosmith sound built over the last four decades. There is no need for heavy thinking; the songs are mostly about fun and sex.<br /><br />The duet with Carrie Underwood on \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" is a disappointment. It sounds like the group is trying to inject hard rock into a syrupy top 40 country ballad.<br />This is somewhat rectified by with \\"What Could Have been love\\", a soaring, aggressive ballad performed Tyler style at arena volume.<br />The album takes an unexpected political turn with the hard charging \\"Freedom Fighter\\"<br />A peace lover's camera is a metaphorical weapon pitted against the aggression of an oppressor<br /><br />I'm a freedom fighter<br />I aim my camera and I take a stand<br />I'm a freedom fighter and I hear your lies<br />The guns you carry and the bombs you make cause too many tears and hearts to break<br /><br />Tyler is finished judging pop stars and back to being a rock star. It suits him well.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|When I try to take video the App closes. It is not worth paying money for something that does not work.
031618201X|5.0|The Soulless manga is a fun read, and really fun when you've already read the books. I'm not sure if the story is really complete without having already known the story, but I think a lot of comic books are that way.<br /><br />The art is really well done, and it really gives life to the characters I'd already grown to love. I would definitely recommend the manga to those who already love the books, and if you haven't already read the books... you should read the books because they're awesome.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is book five in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R.R. Martin. This writer and series is similar in many respects to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series if you like this kind of reading. This particular book in the series, I found to be much more pleasurable reading than the previous book.  The previous book got bogged down in names, places and unnecessary Machiavellian intrigue that tended to make it difficult to follow or did not add to the story at hand. The present book is more concise and keys upon issues of reader interest from previous books and the story. The work flows really well and maintains the reader's intrigue. I think that this particular book is a great read and captures the reader's imagination. I could not put it down.  In all the whole series was very well done and is probably a classic in this genre of fantasy work.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Formula at best, little substance. I expected better from DeMille.There is more puns from the main charicter than story line. May be my last DeMille title, and I have read everything he has written. Seems to me he has gone the way of L. Saunders.
B000SGSU58|4.0|I've enjoyed all the Harry Bosch mysteries that Michael Connelly writes.  Harry isn't your typical cop, he's more of a loner and never gives up even when his theories don't aways initially work out. I was glad to see him romatically involved in this book and feels he needs a woman in his life.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This sophomore album did not disappoint.  I love the instrumentals and the harmonies, and the cover of Simon & Garfunkle's \\"The Boxer\\" is absolutely fantastic.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|This first 15% of the Wool Omnibus was a great short story.  The characters were interesting and full of backstories; the setting was ominous and allowed the imagination to run wild; the plot was eerie and engaging.  The other 85% dragged on and on.  Uninteresting characters were sporadicaly added and the characters did unintersting things.  Even the silo itself (which I kind of thought of as a character) became tedious.  Nothing should have been printed beyond the first 15%.  Maybe I should get back 85% of the purchase price!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great page Turner. Found myself reading hour after hour. Can't wait to start the next book and really interested to see what's next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Although I didn't really care for any of the characters, I couldn't put this book down.  Unexpected and well packaged.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A visual masterpiece but didnt come close to the greatness of original or 2nd Alien movies.  The acting was OK but the story was lacking, boring at times.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. I find it relaxing to play and I even enjoy the music. It is one of the few games I play with the sound on. I play every level until I get a perfect score on them all - and then reset the scores and start over. I really don't understand the bad reviews. Must be a matter of taste. I don't much care for high stress games but I don't mind thinking. Play in on Kindle Fire so the SD card thing is not an issue.
B005HSL626|5.0|i loved this game. when i started playing it was so fun, cuz i kept on trying to beat my record on classic mode.<br />i unlocked all the backgrounds and swords. the swords and backgrounds could be unlocked by completing the fun missions such as getting exactly 50 points on classic mode for the patriot sword.<br />u should get this game! its very fun!
B00433SVP6|5.0|Aghh, I can't stop reading these books!  My daughter suggested I read them and I have thoroughly enjoyed losing myself in the adventures of demigods, gods and monsters.  I should be far too old for this!  I wondered if having new characters in The Lost Hero would lose the flow of the series, but I found them just as intriguing as percy and his crew, even if Leo seemed just a little cliched at times, (but then i'm not 12yrs old).  Rick Riordan is a great writer in my opinion.  I can't believe I'm not bored with the series yet, after 7 books (and counting!).<br />Definitely worth a read.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|i havent even played this game but judging by the photos it looks fun. get it. it looks fun. now.
B0013HYLT0|5.0|Who doesn't love Mary Poppins?  She's piratically perfect in every way!  I love the soundtrack, it is so much fun to turn on while cleaning house or even on a road trip. I'm a kid at heart!
B0082PPTA6|4.0|As usual, Picoult has me thinking in shades of grey and not black and white.  At the beginning I was very interested in this IVF baby and the struggles of the couple to conceive.  However, I find that the break up and new couples weren't developed very well and the new relationships seem to pop up out of nowhere.  It makes it hard to cheer for the ladies as a couple.  Whatever my personal beliefs, this book had me thinking about what I would do and how I would feel in that same situation.  I loved the ending and it changed my overall opinion of this book.  An interesting read, not for everyone, just the open minded.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|I came into this expecting a really generic horror television show with really awful jump scares and bad effects. Boy was I wrong, it look about three minutes for me to get sucked into the odd camera editing and angles, bizarre noises and music, and fantastic cast and story line. This isn't just another ghost story, American Horror Story is revitalizing the genre for what it is, a masterpiece.<br />Now I realize this show has flaws, I'm not saying it's perfect. The story line got a little confusing and I actually rewatched the entire season from start to finish just to make sure I knew what happened, and I enjoyed every minute of all 12 episodes, both times. I actually enjoyed it more the second time.<br />Another thing I want to add: This show doesn't exactly follow the rules of normal paranormal style shows. It basically made its own rules and just hit the ground runnin'.<br />Moving on, the acting this season was just plain great. All characters were blowing me away, seriously. Even the extras who had maybe one or two lines, were great. Overall I can't complain at all about the acting.<br />Now for the scares, and this is the last thing. This show has probably three or four jump scares throughout all twelve episodes, which, frankly I enjoyed, because as long as they're not being overused, I enjoy jump scares. The horror is mainly suspense, and there is LOTS of that. I found myself quite nervous on multiple occasions, waiting for something to happen, whether it did or not, I was anxious.<br />Overall I give the show an easy 5 stars.
0307454568|5.0|I love this book and thought it finished the series very well. (I recommend you read the series in order though).  I have to admit there were a few paragraphs I skipped because I just couldn't care less about the arrangement of government in Sweden. If I were to read it again I would keep a list of each characters names so I could keep them straight easier. Dorky, I know, but the foreign names just don't distinguish themselves in my mind very well.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I definitely enjoyed the depth of the story, and each chapter held my attention all the way through.  But, because the story is so long, and because my eyesight isn't that great, I had to devote MANY reading sessions to getting it done.  By the time I reached the end, I think I was more tired than the characters in the story itself.  (attempt at humor)<br /><br />I saw no significant errors through out the book so that's one distraction that was not an issue.  The characters are well thought out, and well developed as they were integral to each part of the saga.  In the story itself, there is an \\"evil\\" somewhere within, and you begin to suspect where the evil really lies.  But, you don't know which character it really is, but my suspect that I felt it would be, did indeed turn out to be the villain I thought it would be.  The main character develops very well through out, and it's fun to watch his skills advance.  However, near the end, his skills seem to become almost \\"godly\\" and \\"magical\\" and perhaps not completely realistic.  That is, he even makes Bruce Lee and all his skills pale by comparison.  (for those of you who even know who Bruce Lee was, and how magnificent an athlete he had become before he died... sure, the movies make a lot of stuff look better than real life, but the stunts he performed were amazing.)<br /><br />Bottom line, I recommend this book as worthy of your consideration, if you like Adventure as would be seen in a Conan saga.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a 5-part story, and it was really good! The story takes place in the future, after something (we don't know what...) made the earth above-ground unfit to live on, so people have built silos beneath the ground - 50 of them, each isolated from the other, where people live and work, 99% of them totally unaware that other humans exist at all. Those who become too curious, and want to leave are sentenced to 'cleaning' - sent outside to clean the one big window to the outside world. The suits they work in are designed to fail, and 'cleaning' is a death sentence. One person discovers this and manages to get the suit built to protect, survives the atmoshpere outside and wanders away, finding another silo. The story really moved quickly, was exciting and had lots of action and good characters. Highly recommend this series!!
B001BSBBEE|5.0|Carnival of Souls(1962) is a solid, surreal, low budget horror movie filmed in black and white. It was not a big hit in 1962, but late night TV airings helped the film reach cult status. Everything from The Sixth Sense(1999) to The Frighteners(1996) borrowed ideas from this movie. Carnival of Souls was directed by Herk Harvey. He made dozens of educational shorts for Centron. In Carnival of Souls, Mary Henry(Candace Hilligoss) survives a nasty car accident caused by some reckless drag racers! She moves to Utah and gets a job as a church organ player. Mary can see pale ghosts walking around. There are moments where people ignore her. Director Herk Harvey plays a ghost known as \\"The Man\\". Sidney Berger plays John Linden, an oily, charismatic guy who is attracted to Mary. Carnival of Souls is a creepy, atmospheric horror film that's low on violence. It feels \\"dream like\\" at times. It has an organ driven music score. Carnival of Souls was made with good taste and it's tame enough to show on TV. Filmmakers such as David Lynch and George Romero are fans of this film. A \\"remake\\" of Carnival of Souls was made in 1998 and it went straight to home video. The remake starred Bobby Phillips from The X-Files and Stargate SG-1. Some people have pointed out that Carnival of Souls feels like a Twilight Zone episode. I guess that's true. Candace Hilligoss is decent as Mary Henry. She was a really good looking B-movie starlet. Hilligoss looks lovely as she sees \\"The Man\\" staring at her from the first floor of a staircase. I first saw Carnival of Souls on a Netflix rental in 2005. Since then, it's been one of my favorite movies. Carnival of Souls is a classic film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|\\"The Walking Dead\\" has left me breathless, caused some chest pain, and a lot of screaming. I can't get enough.
B001F8TN0E|5.0|This is a favorite of mine.  I think I have seen every show with Charlie too many times to mention. The writers did a great job.  Overall great escape entertainment.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy the game and the challenge of each level. then with the different sizes brides add a whole nother challenge in its self. I am a gamer and I approve this review........happy voting!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|can't wait for the sequel! !<br />not too hard to figure out but challenging enough to offer hours of play. good graphics and fun storyline.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I heard great things about this book, so we each bought a copy and read through it together a couple of years ago.  We got so much from it that we still use today that this one I bought for a couple we're friends with who got married this summer as a wedding gift.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good graphics and story keeps it interesting, especially for my kids. Increasingly challenging as you progress through the levels.  Great deal for the free app of the day!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app I play every day after school my little brother loves it too sometimes I play it for hours
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was great.  I'm so ready for the next!  It kept me guessing what was going to happen next and left you begging for more!
B008EZVNO0|4.0|Great...........Not his best but still great!  Hard base lines takes me back to Moondance days when he let the base cary the melody in some songs
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have purchased every season of Big Bang in the last 4 months.  It is hillarius.  We weren't interested when it first appeared on TV.  Then it showed up on TBS and we started watching.  We are now HUGE fans of Leonard, Sheldon, Penny and the gang.  Soft Kitty is sung often at our house!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Appointment waits no longer feel endless.  Having something to challenge your mind is benifical in many ways. Playing Spider Solitare can be addicting.
B0070NSPCU|3.0|This was a great story, however the grammar let the book down. Really enjoyed it in spite of this. L
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I haven't been able to get past the first part of the game, when it locks up.  I enjoy playing the part that works.
B003Q6D25U|5.0|This movie is a prequal/sequal to the first paranormal activity. This movie takes place months before and days after the first movie but it follows the younger sister Kristi and her actions following the birth of her baby boy with the &#34;Demon&#34;
B009G3MSC0|5.0|A fantastic insightful read. Gives a open description of Arnold's life. Not just his bodybuilding but a full on view of all that has made up his life. It's funny but also heartfelt and touching. I would recommend this book to all people.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|Paranormal Activity 3 is a Prequal to the first two paranormal activity movies. This movie takes place during the childhood of the sisters of the first two.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is really worth it you can watch videos u download anytime any place any where its worth it I searched an old show like and downloaded it it doesn't need wifi you should GET THE APP
B002VKE0XA|5.0|Paranormal Activity is a new series that uses the &#34;Found Footage&#34; style of filming. It is a interesting take on the haunted house/ghost style movie.
B004EJUMT2|1.0|Well I bought this thinking it would be as half as good as Mercyful Fate. And it is not even close, not Heavy not nothing.<br />They sound like a band from the 1970's with flowers and smoke. I think the dude on vocals should be on the 700 club singing for them.<br />Guitars are week, like flat beer. This is one CD that will be on the firing range!<br />Blah.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was full of immense detail. I could not put the book down. It did however, have a terrible ending.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For the entire story I've felt that I was reading the stories of real people in real situations. An enjoyable read about two teenagers that speaks to me far more than I expected, especially since on the outside, I am not of the same age, nationality or afflictive condition.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|A must see if you've been following this series.  Short of spoiling the episode, let me just say that it will leave you feeling sad.  It's well worth the $1.99 to watch.  Enjoy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I've always loved Thai game and it's great to have on hand to entertain the kids while waiting in line.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I heard this CD originally on Spotify and fell in love with the diferent sounds with the cello and piano.  I really enjoy this one.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|very good book, told through the viewpoint of Bobby instead of D.D., so it makes a typical Lisa Gardner plot have a different twist.  Liked the difference
B0085RQLXK|1.0|So, 1 Star is all you get Aerosmith, you money hungry losers.  Why?  Mainly for the your ridculous packaging.  YES That's right, PACKAGING!!!  THIS DELUXE EDITION $19.99 PACAGE??-WTF!!  You couldn't just make your CD packaging like every other CD Package out there, noooo you had to be original (riiiiight) and make the biggest bulkiest crap eco-package to date.  Forget about putting this CD on the shelf with your other CD's this needs it's own zip code!  Let's hope the music is better than the marketing (I'll post a review after I've listened).  WTF!  FYI, I did not spend $19.99 on the DELUXE EDITION.  I bot the NORMAL CD VERSION...why....cuz it fits on my CD SHELF!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I got into pinterest from my sister and only wanted the see what the appeal was. I was pretty cool so I  decided to try it on my kindle fire. Such a good idea! The interface is very simple and easy to use. The only suggestion I have would be to have an easier way to go back to the category you were viewing instead of having to relookup that category again and lose your spot. (hitting the back button brings you to the main screen again from some reason) . Otherwise still a great app
B007IXWL2C|4.0|As it brings the story of Christian and Ana full circles, \\"Freed\\" breathes life into the trilogy by causing them both to grow up and accept each other for who they are and all their many attributes. I enjoyed this one the most of the three.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this book because it don't have to get up and get a dictionary anymore & i need a  dictionary
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love it because when your bored this is the right game to come to because it a good game and addicting
B009ME47H2|5.0|I really. Love. This apparently.  Very handy and easy to navigate.  Would recommend to anyone who goes to lectures meetings etc.  Or even just for leaving yourself messages.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I started with the HBO series & now I can't wait for the next book!  I love the literary bravery that Martin shows; any character can be killed off at any time!  It makes for a book that keeps you on your toes.<br />Loved it!
0375826742|2.0|I cut and paste the review of the second book, as my feeling of them are identical.<br />I listened to this book on audio to/from work, otherwise I would not have continued \\"reading\\" this series.  Paolini is very detailed about the world and magic system, but that just doesn't drive a good story for me.  In fact, I prefer authors to be more concise about that stuff.  The book is OK, probably worthy on 2.5 stars, but it took me awhile to read it because I simply found it boring at times and went months between reading on multiple occasions.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My son is two and a half, he loves this game! His favorite is the teeth brushing game! He likes the sound the germs make when they fly off the teeth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Having read all of the books in the Hunger Games trilogy, Mockingjay is definitely a fitting ending.  The story is finely crafted and a great blend of action, drama and moral ambiguity.  Katniss obsesses over her failures, her weaknesses and her destiny.  At times she seems self absorbed. But as she struggles, the reader gets drawn in, weighing over her issues in respect to his or her own life.
B0045DO85Q|5.0|Great album. Good music. Something different from Simon and Garfunkel. Highly recomended. Never hear something so good, different, and classic like this.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like it, Its all that I could expect from a tablet/phone game.<br />But I feel that its no where close to the computer game Needs more blocks, Moving needs to be easier, But other than that its pretty good
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett delivers another riveting historical fiction.  Like the Pillars series, Fall of Giants contains lots of historical details, plot twists, and characters you will think of as family by the end of the book.  Also some very important historical lessons that are poignant for our current times.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Tired of buying extra batteries for your Android powered cell phone? Me too! Especially since I've been switching to newer Android phones at a much faster pace lately. Get this external battery! Seriously!<br /><br />The best feature of this external charger is its ability to shut itself off after fully charging your device. Second, is the handy built-in flashlight, which seemingly lasts forever.<br /><br />Gonna knock one star off because of its plastic housing. It fell apart after dropping it on the office floor while at sitting height. But it was easily snapped back together with no issue.<br /><br />It's definitely a buy though.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Enjoy playing to pass time and the graphics are great. Wish they had more card options and instructions on what to do for the other game options.
B00338QENI|3.0|I enjoyed this book although it included both story line and a bit too much technical information. Some of the surprising medical practices of the 50's seemed indeed archaic and probably punishable by imprisonment using todays standards. I would have preferred a bit more organization and sequencing of events as it was repetitive and left me seeking more answers. The descendants of Henrietta are currently on a speaking tour. Watch for them in your city.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game made me play forever! thank the person who made this because it is absoloutlley amazing. get this game its worth it.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is so funny I always enjoy anything she is on weather its a book or her Tv show.. she is awesome..
B008QTVNUI|5.0|One of the best dramas I've ever seen.  We planned to watch one or two episodes per week, but we couldn't stop watching and ended up having a  \\"Homeland Marathon\\" and watched them all the first weekend!
B009KHCT94|4.0|Not an unqualified success but still a remarkable, clever and very brave film. Sure the Nazis have to be stopped, but they ain't all bad. Well, at least one of them isn't! The story, and the film's style are reminiscent of the early Flash Gordon era of sci-fi story telling; but profoundly modernized. Where Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow fell flat on its face, this film does not. I was thoroughly entertained by the fast-paced story and enjoyed the dark humor and satire that permeates the film. The actors work hard and the heroine in particular turns in an excellent and likeable performance. The production values are simply amazing; especially when you consider the limited budget and where his film originated. So if you want something sci-fi, something different, then you'll enjoy Iron Sky as much as I did. Believe me the film makes far more sense than dismal outings such as the recent \\"Battleship\\" movie.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|THE BEST animated Batman movie yet, gory, gritty, dark, hardcore!!!!! the movie is based on Frank Miller's classic graphic novel (same title). Batman returns from retirement at age 55 ruthless than ever and seeks dark justice on Gotham's new criminals.
B001BSH11G|4.0|I was very pleased with your product.  There were hardly and(if none at all!)scratches on the vinyl.  I aws happily surprised to find the lyrics to the sondgs on the inside of the album.  And it arrived in such a short time!  Thank you so much!  It came fron Amazon.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The only issue I have is the adds are to clost to the buttons.<br />I like the way it saves the timmer for the next use,it also has a lot of daley settings.
B001AITH50|5.0|A good movie with a slight twist.  Don't know if they made a second movie but it was worth the rental price I paid.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I  love this game Its a great game- not many game I like but this I do. If you like adventure  game then you will love this game.
0393339882|5.0|\\"Does the moon exist only when you look at it ?\\" asked Einstein.  This forms the central philosophical battle that Manjit Kumar's book traces through the history of the quantum from 1900 until today.  On one side is Einstein, the cultural icon who also happens to be perhaps the greatest Physicist of all time and on the other side is Bohr, a physics icon who among the inner circle may be of equal stature.  Einstein could not believe in a world without the realism that seems to be true in the macro world but Bohr felt nature is as the quantum describes it - probabilistic, non deterministic and most importantly dependent on an observer.  Joining them in battle are the great physicists of the 20th century whose names live immortalized as constants, measures, principles and equations.  Kumar mixes in equal parts biography making this an interesting read beyond the science.  Although much has been learned since 1900 and so much of our man-made material lives are a result of the understanding these individuals gained from the quantum world we still cannot really answer Einstein's question.  We are all made of quantum stuff and believe in our reality and determinism but all that we are made of does not seem to follow these rules.  A wonderful journey through a mind boggling world.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I used to wait for Scarpetta stories ... no more ... story was boring ... writing was complex and overly technical.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|This movie is a bit of a puzzler.<br /><br />The story has a lot of promise, but I feel that it wasn't exploited in the best way in this script. It seemed to lack focus, containing a number of superfluous characters that could have been excised to make way for more footage with our heroine and the key antagonists.<br /><br />The acting suffers from the same malaise that all Italian movies of the time did - the shooting in multiple languages and dubbing-in of English (in this case) later gives the delivery a certain remote quality. You get the same almost caricature delivery in spaghetti westerns.<br /><br />There are also some idiosyncratic things that arrived sideways for me until explained in the bonus disc. I generally disapprove of nuance that requires an explanation to avoid derailing the movie. Movies should stand on their own. If you have to explain something for it to make sense you filmed it wrong in the first place (unless surrealism was the intent of course).<br /><br />The movie is also hampered in that the state of the art for SFX in Italy at the time was not that of Hollywood, which was falling off the brink of Computer Assisted camerawork and the infant CGI techniques that would soon replace older, less satisfying techniques.<br /><br />That said, this is my favorite Argento movie. The idea is a good one, the set-piece scenes are well composed if sometimes overdone (I sometimes think this film might have been much stronger if filmed a-la Hitchcock rather than a-la Chainsaw) though the sheer exuberance of the blood-and-guts has its own charm.<br /><br />The young actresses are gorgeous, especially the female lead, who has eyes you can just fall into.<br /><br />I believe this was also the last occidental movie to be made in technicolor. The use of color in this film is striking, but I looked in vain for any sort of message in the choice of colors. Very clever, though, and I think the explanation of how it was done was probably the best part of the bonus disc for me.<br /><br />Four stars for effort.s disc for me.<br /><br />Four stars for effort.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|It's hard to imagine that Mr. DeMille actually wrote this book. A dragged out tome of utter nonsense. The first DeMille book I have not been able to finish.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many negative reviews have been posted about the ending of this book. The reality is that those of you who didn't like the ending didn't like it because it wasn't the usual. I didn't like the ending either however, the fact that I cared about it tells me it was a good read. Think about it...if you weren't drawn in you wouldn't be upset at all about the ending you would just think the book stunk. I didn't give it 5 stars because its not a future classic or something I will re-read.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Just finished watching and I'm speechless. Yet another well-written, superbly acted, taut episode. And absolutely heart-breaking.<br /><br />As much as I want to see this outstanding series continue, I don't see how it can. It won't be long before only the dead remain.
B003YP7N9O|5.0|I have this on vinyl & cd. Great remaster for even better sound. Great packaging & presentation. Great value for the money. Thank-you!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found Wool to be a quick moving story with a very intriguing story line that maintained consistency throughout the read.  Better than average character development that builds a reader's interest in the main characters as well as the characters and environment they interact with. An overall good read!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Ok, what A-smith album isn't better than Draw the Line though, am I right? (I'm just playin, Draw)But here is my explanation; What is up,we have all have known the Bad Boys through many a phase post 1980. The burned out sounds of Rock in A hard Place and Mirrors, the squeaky clean pop sounds of Push Play, the outrageously loud mixes on Bobo etc...  but all these albums, through the faults, show that Aersomith is no joke as a rock and roll band (see them live, no gimmicks and they straight up sound as loud and nasty as 1973...what are we gonna do if they write songs for the teeny pop girls as well as the hard core fans? One time I saw the boys when they asked the crowd which song we wanted to hear next.. Livin' On the Edge or Don't Wanna Miss a Thing... the girls yelled louder and we got the ballad. Democracy people. )<br /><br />ANYWAY! ...The last couple of A-smith releases I avoided. I didn't think they were terrible, just knew they wouldn't get much play. Nine Lives did nothing for me...so I didn't buy it.  Honkin on Bobo hurt my ears...I basically expected this to be a combination of those. Well, it is, BUT, the mixing has improved greatly... some sounds may make you choke upon the first notes, but almost everything on here winds up being a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />On one hand, it's like the best attributes to Get A Grip and any number of female focused singles released by the band; On the other hand, a wonderful classic rock element shines throughout, a fun honky club Stones meets street fighting Stones meets psychedelic Beatles hybrid... without the nonsense of Taste of India!) The album kicks more ace then the boys have done on record since at least 1993. It's as if the band this time has drawn a full circle.  And the Joe Perry songs don't suck either.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Just a vivid dream that was exaggerated to make money. Shameful. There is no God and no heaven. Don't buy it,
B00913DPW2|2.0|I really wanted to give this a great review. I was REALLY enjoying this game until I got to puzzles that were too small to play. I suppose this game is meant for tablets but they should have that in the description. 100% disappointed. :(
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is one of those apps that you think will be stupid, but you find yourself playing it every spare moment you have, definitley a fun app
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i was so excited to read the last hunger games and honestly i felt let down i feel like the plot wasnt great and it was weird and katniss was just annoying through the whole thing

1432794426|5.0|Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy, in its second edition, is a very interesting book about Michael Jackson, especially his last  mysterious years.  The behind-the-scenes stories about Michael with his children and about his daily life are fascinating.  This book covers every aspect of MJ's life and personality.  As a psychologist, Dr. Moriarty explains, in a thought-provoking way, how MJ had to adapt apparently bizarre means to try to snatch some pieces of a \\"normal\\" life!  Her contributors are credible people who knew the real Michael Jackson.  All in all, she used more than 200 sources ... to give the reader a real feel of Michael Jackson the human being behind the distorted media images of a \\"wacko\\" megastar.  I highly recommend this book to fans and others!
014312093X|4.0|This is an excellently written spy novel, and that is why it stands above the fray. I will admit that while the writing is excellent, it's apparent it was written for another time. Almost all the action occurs between George Smiley's ears. It's cerebral, I get that. I could have used a bit more action, however. It wasn't boring, but it was plodding. I wanted to get to the end and Le Carré did a commendable job of getting me there. It was a pedestrian pace, though, and I really don't remember a single wow moment. Still, I give it 3.5 stars and am rounding up because of its stature. In reality, I expected more.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|this is the worst app ever you cant even do the first level witch is to do a simple back flip&gt;:(
160774273X|5.0|This book makes you feel like your sitting at the kitchen table taking bread with Ken the author.<br />the introduction breaks down the fundamentals of bread making, the ingredients, the tools<br />and tips & cues of baking good bread at home.  look forward to finishing the book and the recipes<br />.
1451638450|5.0|I'm a fan of the Vorkosigan series, so for me, this was a five star book. I bought the electronic version through Baen and have already reread it.<br /><br />For non fans, I'm not sure how it would go, but probably 4 stars. Would people who don't know Ivan understand the complaint of Ivan's boss? The boss asked why Ivan's mother asked him about Ivan's personal life instead of asking Ivan. Ivan responded, \\"Experience, maybe.\\"<br /><br />There are gems all the way through the book for fans and non fans. It is mentioned that on Barrayar people were subjects, not citizens. Someone notes that the emperor is the only one on Barrayar that isn't a subject and wonders if that makes him an object. Humor abounds and all sorts of characters from previous novels make cameo appearances. Bujold sensibly keeps Cordelia, Miles, and Mark largely out of the picture, because they tend to dominate. The plethora of minor characters would be a problem for a new reader of the series, but are enjoyable to people who've met them before.<br /><br />Bujold had a difficult task in this book. She has a hero that is not an overly ambitious man, and she made him sympathetic and enjoyable.  Ivan is shown at his best. He is brave, loyal and chivalrous. He comes through when he needs to. He's not as bright as Miles or Cordelia, but he isn't stupid.<br /><br />I would not advise people who haven't read Bujold before to start here, although her writing has never been better. If you haven't read the Vorkosigan series, there are a number of good books waiting for you.
B0076HN4G2|5.0|It was stunning.  I would heartily recommend this video.  Everything was superb.<br />I especially liked the camera work with the closeups.  I feel like it was better than being there.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I think that this game is great. first of all it is all about dragons which is awesome. and it may be similar to tiny monsters, but I like this better.
0345803485|4.0|This book made me a little weak in the knees.  I was a little shy about reading it in public.  But, overall, it was very well written and I could not put it down.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|I absolutely love this series I purchased from Amazon. After reading some of the reviews about the packaging,I must say that the package this set came in is very nicely done.I am up to the 5th season, and have to tell you this is funny stuff! Al Bundy has now become my hero. I used to watch this show back when it was on, but never kept up to date on it. So this brings all that back. This family will stoop to anything to get a dollar,other than WORK for it. A shoe salesman who makes nothing trying to survive a moron wife, a dingbat daughter, and horny son. No food ever in the house,and neighbors who hate them. I laugh so hard sometimes it brings tears. This was a great show, and I am glad to have the entire series on DVD. Thanks Amazon, good job.
B009AMAKJU|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be nearly as good as it was.  After all, I'm a dad with two kids of my own in high school.  I should be too far removed from this film's target audience to be effected like I was.  But, this movie is so well done that age proved to be no barrier to my absorption into the story.  The actors are uniformly terrific.  Emma Watson is radiant in her role, and even smaller parts played by big-name actors Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, and Joan Cusack are so well-played that everything in the story feels real.  The affection the kids share, the pain, the angst, all come through without being preachy.  It's simply a year-in-the-life, but it's very well done.<br /><br />I think this is a movie that can be enjoyed by anyone who's ever been in high school, but don't recommend it for children under the age of 12.
B008RTE09S|5.0|You have seen the movie before so this is a review of the blu-ray only.Looks and Sounds GREAT.Obviously the best copy you can get.You know how old and grainy the old VHS and regular DVD's looked.This is a MAJOR improvement.GREAT audio and video for 1967.Dont hesitate to buy.
B003B02O14|4.0|Yes, the story was just brilliant, but I am still deciding whether I like the ending or not.  Forty-three chapters in all, and the last one was a downer...I don't know, but I still can't get over it.  It was a downer on two accounts - what actually happened, and in my opinion, it was written down in a hurry.  I was reading through chapters 40-42, and I was thinking where will this end?  Then suddenly, it all ended there in chapter 43, just one chapter, when I could have read probably 3 or 5 more, unless there is a sequel?  On the other hand though, what happened in the last chapter just serves our protagonist right.  After all he has done, and he thought he got away clean, and what was supposed to be the clincher, the final prize, eluded him.<br /><br />This is a story that started three quarters of the way, then wove its way back to what happened in the last four years or so, then continued on for the next two months.  Grisham's style of relating what transpired in installment was very effective for me.  Like Patricks's lawyer Sandy and his friend Karl, I so desperately wanted to know the complete story - all of it, in one telling; and like them I had to contain myself and not fast-forward so I could relish every detail.  Patrick Lanigan was really such a \\"scheming bastard\\", but for all that he was, I couldn't help cheering for him, and that's why I go back to the ending again - it was really a downer for me.  But then again, what goes around comes around...such is the circle of life.  And oh, the sequel please.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This series is one that everyone has to watch. You will be hooked as soon as you tune in and is legendary!! =)
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, it's just like playing the real thing!! I would recomend this game to friends!!
B009YG2ND8|3.0|Why is amazon limiting this to just kindles? At least put a version out for androids that aren't kindles. I'm not buying a kindle just to play this, when i have 2 androids it works on, but if i were to buy it here I probibly wouldn't even be allowed to download it. I'd be giving this 5 stars but that kindle only limit kills the rateing i'd give it normaly. I bought this game from another place (that shall remane nameless) before Amazon released it here, and for the most part it works on the device I wanted to use it with. Amazon needs to stop this practice, they are only hurting themselves with it. I'd much rather buy stuff through Amazon.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not but it down. I am off to buy the last book, can't wait to see what happens next.

B002RXMG00|4.0|it is a superb movie. Especially if you keep in mind when it was made. I dont think anyone could have conceived something like this way back then.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it sooooooo much like Pc but much better no caves I enjoy survival but they could include seeds or at least have a free app for them.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|If you loved the movie, buying the soundtrack is a must. I hope if you listen first to the soundtrack, you get inspired to watch the movie.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|very nice album. I love the songs. Taylor swift is being improving over the years. Now her music is more mature.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started off a little slow but ended really well.  Creative plot twists with several surprises. If you like mysteries and suspense I recommend this book to you.
0307931803|4.0|Received this great book, that is a classic. I obviously did not read the description very well, as I thought this was a standard size book. Instead it is a smaller, cardboard book. It was a baby gift but instead my 18 month old is getting it for Christmas.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Albom does it again!  He talks about how important it is to enjoy life in all its simplicity.  I enjoyed the way he intertwined three different stories and made them all mess together with a single thread, time. Think about it, perhaps we would be less up tight if punctuality/time did not play such an important part in our daily life.
0060245867|5.0|Great book and love the story. I forgot how much I enjoyed this book as a child. I liked it so much that it was a gift but now I am keeping for my children. Fast ship and it perfect shape.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I was not expecting much from this movie, but it was decently funny. It wont be winning any awards, but its worth a rent.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wonderful app and reliable as well... it is nice having so many options such as alarm tones and snooze options!!
B00004Z511|5.0|Nice package and great music from an amazing band. What else would you ask for? Though this version would be probably for groupies, nothing more.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I Love Nelson DeMille.I have enjoyed all his books.I especially love John Corey.I'm glad he's still alive and pissing everyone off.

B009RI4ZKC|4.0|A movie with such sweet characters.  My husband and I thought it was very entertaining. I loved Bruce Willis & Edward Norton in this.

B00A0NOF7G|5.0|This was a cute, quick read. I liked the quirkiness of the main character. As a mystery, there were enough clues dropped along the way that when the end came, it made sense.<br />Overall, an enjoyable read.

B009NQKXYK|5.0|I'd recommend this movie to anyone. I hope they come out with a series. Give it a watch. However the requirement to write a review as apposed to just rating it with stars if VERY annoying AMAZON. If a person going to trust a review; then a STAR RATING is satisfactory... When I rate my movie rental using my smart phone, it makes this process EXTREMELY challenging. And my smart phone is what I use most of the time; so you might want to rethink your rating requirement to make is more user friendly.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|I absolutely love the walking dead series. I can't wait for the next episode. And AMAZON is awesome about airing the most recent episode quickly.
B003LJRTXS|4.0|Did not take long to really get absorbed in this book, although at first the time changes were slightly irksome, soon it did not matter as the story got its hold on me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game it works good on fire and never gets old they give you enormous worlds to play on and you can have multiple worlds as well!!! its just dang awesome! !!
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|This was an awesome episode!  That final scene was so intense and well-acted by (the character) Rick.  I'm so glad they went that direction and it definitely has us wondering what will happen next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great and is like the Pc.But the game is not like 1.4.2 it is beta and not many blocks. The worlds end also.The game is great get it now!
B003XYE7VS|4.0|The book arrived on time and in very good condition. Now for a few remarks about its author, and how he has become known as one of the \\"most dangerous men\\" in Western Civilization.<br /><br />Darwin opened the door to the destruction of Western Civilization. He didn't intend this of course. It's interesting to see that over the 12 editions of Origin of Species, Darwin moved from his initial belief in natural selection to a Lamarckian version. Had Darwin bothered to read Gregor Mendal's paper on hybrid cultivation by cross breeding -- which led to the discovery of genes -- he might have modified his theories a bit. Mendal's report was found among Darwin's papers, pages uncut and unread.<br /><br />The decline of Western Civilization was not a direct result of Darwin's writings; but evolved from the ideas of those who tried to apply  evolution science to \\"social science\\" in order to control people's lives. Herbert Spencer, who coined the term, \\"Survival of the fittest,\\" started the downward trajectory of the snowball that eventually became Naziism. The term \\"social science\\" is an oxymoron. Yes, statistics are used, but at what price?<br /><br />The debate over evolution continues to this time. One Republican primary candidate stated that anyone who did not believe in the theory of evolution and global warming was stupid (paraphrase). Which theory of evoluton Mr. Huntsman? Which theory of global warming?<br /><br />Origin of Species is a beautifully written book and should be read by all persons who consider themselves to be educated.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its an ok hidden object game. free play is limited. in my opinion, not worth spending money to expand the game.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|One of the most intense episodes in Walking Dead series, no doubt about that. There are some cute moments in it too. Maggie and Glenn coming out from the guard tower. HErshel taking a walk with the crutch. \\"Thanks bro!\\" moment from one of the prisoner. And it ended shockingly. Great way to keep the series fresh!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Good holiday novel. All what it says it is going to be.<br />Looking forward to more by this author later.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl deservers every bit of praise I am about to bestow on it. As an English teacher, I am always looking for a good book (one I cannot put down) that can also stand on its own in a literary sense. I had begun to grow used to sacrificing quality for thrill (think The Di Vinci Code or anything Steve Barry), but with Gone Girl, this is just not the case. Flynn weaves an enthralling story of betrayal and deception, with literary elements to rival some of the best. I would find myself taking pause to think about how this author had twisted my stomach in such knots, feverishly flipping pages on my Kindle. Steer clear if you need a good night's sleep or you want to continue to view your spouse in the same way (I have to admit, I drilled my husband a few times and after reading you will understand why). Gone Girl does contain some \\"colorful\\" language and I would not recommend it to the faint of heart. Nicholas Sparks fans detour away from Gone Girl.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Can stop.watching it, I often wish I was running with the SOA lol great show I can not wait to start watching season 5
B009CPJHY4|4.0|this movie was quite cute and dealt with aging in a bright and funny manner. Wonderful cast and the sights and colors of India were wonderful!
B0088TG252|3.0|I thought this movie was adequate at the time, but even though it's only been a few months since I watched it, I honestly can't remember too much about it, like how it ends.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I really wanted to like this story. I mean it has a great cover, fantastic idea for a story,starts out at a fast pace then once you find out the \\"secret\\" it takes a nose dive down to the bottom of the ocean.<br />You can actually guess some some of the subplot but it was hard to get though once you get to the middle.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|i have had the kindle app on my phone, ever since i knew i could get it.  the text is easy to read although small, it is clear and easy to use.  Since most of us never leave our phones at home, it is much easier to carry our books with us this way. and it's free too.[[ASIN:B004DLPXAO Kindle for Android]]
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|This product not only has a motion detector but also has a light sensor.  The light sensor is extremely sensitive, it does not turn on in rooms with a very weak day-light which is excellent to save the energy.  I used rechargiable batteries that will last forever. The back cover of the battery housing is kind of loose, it does not hold the vecor sticking on the wall. That is why I gave 4 starts, however, you may try to hang the light set on the wall using a screw nail. It is worthy to buy with the price.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have read and enjoyed all Scarpetta books.  An interesting character.  Wish I had her kitchen!! Keep it up Ms. Cornwell.
B0086449YA|4.0|This two CD release, available only as an import,displays a well-rounded,diverse journeyman at work. Sure of himself,yet casual and calm, Knopfler's writing is far reaching, personable and intelligent. Every selection shines. His guitar work,as always,is extraordinary and dare I say,more interesting than any of the &#34;rock-gods&#34; currently making records. An added bonus is the production. The clarity of this album is unparrelled by anything I've heard in 20 years. Really. And yeah,he was the frontman in Dire Straits. 4 1/2 stars. Nearly a masterpiece.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a really good book. It is marketed as juvenile fiction but don't let that stop you. I am a 58 year old man and can wait to get to the third book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is well-written and a fun read by an author that I had not previously enjoyed and would highly recommend.  This would be a good ladies' book club choice.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The way the author introduces the main characters is like putting on comfortable shoes. Then he begins to blend them into their own role as WWI unfolds before your eyes. Besides an interesting story I enjoyed the history of the war, as I had forgotten much of what I learned. At times the story seems wordy but he's just setting the setting the table for the next feast.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|once you start playing,  its very hard to stop! it definately has a few bugs, but it'd great for kids! simple yet brilliant!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book two of this Trilogy by Ken Follett is very well done. Ken is a master story teller and this is one of his best beside Pillars of the Earth.
B000MR148S|5.0|This is a timeless book for all ages. I purchased the book used. The retailer said it was in good condition and only had the owners name written inside the binding. This was a perfect and exact description. Further, the book came on time as promised in 7 days. I purchased this book for my son to replace one I had for over 35 years and it is a wonderful story, great black and white drawings (which are not faded), and none of the pages are ripped, marked, or worn as any book would have with time. Great retailer and I would purchase other books from them in the future.
B008UO7WB8|5.0|Love this show and this episode is GREAT! The Truth game part is the best part of the episode! Highly recommend this episode!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Sweet Tooth takes one into the muddy world of the intelligence service during the early l970's, a time when Britain was deep in the doldrums socially and economically, due to industrial unrest and terrorism.  The opening chapters may give the reader the impression of another simple romance novel, but one soon becomes fascinated.  The entire plot is unusual, superbly crafted from start to finish - an end that leaves one applauding McEwan's mastery of his subjects and clever twists and turns.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fun game when i just want to unplug and destress. i dont have to deal with anything except solving the puzzle...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the BESTEST bible app ever it keeps track of what you have been reading and u also get to choose what kind of plan u want to do
B001NZEHMS|5.0|I bought this back in the day on cassette and then on CD, which is worn out, now I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire. One of the best albums of all time. Definitely recommend to anyone who lobes old school rap.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I LOVE Mahjong.  This one is the exception.  It won't let me go to the next puzzle untill I have completed a \\"mysterious\\" number of puzzles.  It is so annoying, I may delete it from my device and it was one I bought!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I adore this game, and when it finally came out on Android (originally a pc game) I was ecstatic. Still just as fun as its always been, good touch controls. I highly recommend this game.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Really enjoying this game. Touch controls are responsive and appropriate to the challenge level of the game. Super Meat Boy but for android and with a flavor all its own.
159668139X|5.0|This is a wonderful book that is perfect for the beginning weaver as well as one who has been weaving for a while. The instructions are easy to follow and the chapters are broken down into lessons to make it very easy to follow the instructions. I highly recommend this book.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Well written. I read this book with my 12 year old son. We were both able to discuss it. It is a child's view of the terrible time in history.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|LOVE IT! Even my 7 and 8 year old girls play it over and over on their mp3 players! My husband who usually only likes new music that HE finds, loved it as well. Score one for Mom!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|WE loved this movie, very well done and just shows how people from different backgrounds can find a common ground!
B0091REZMW|4.0|wish you didn't run out of energy so quickly and ways to reciece free and more diamonds. other than that I love it!
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|I bought this book thinking it was the 'other' Cloud Atlas: I read it anyway and found it hard to put down. It is like reading a strange train wreak in slow motion. I also like very much the effort the author went to get the historical authenticity and empty weird feel for wartime Anchorage.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a book that is hard to put down.  My wife really liked it as well and she never reads science fiction.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I have always been a fan of Tim Burton and I really liked this one. I would totally tell my friends to watch this movie.
B009UVWBMA|2.0|I really enjoyed her previous 3 albums. This one seems bland and boring in comparison. There are some okay tracks, but none that make me reach for this cd on my daily commute. If fact, I find myself switching over to Speak Now or National Public Radio instead. The clever storytelling songs of past albums don't show up here. Rather you get a song that practically chants \\"stay\\" endlessly. Yawn. I know she can do better than this, as I have 3 albums to prove it. Hopefully her next album gets her back on track. This one? It may be selling well, but I don't think it's going to hold up to repeated listening as her past albums have done.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|If you read the series, you will likely hate the movie. If you didn't read the series, you probably won't get the movie.<br /><br />I don't mind films taking liberties with plot points and such as long as they remain true to the essential thematic core of the novel they are adapted from. Blade Runner for example, deviates quite significantly from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and yet remains one of the greatest SF films of all time because it remains true to the novel's bleak view of our planet and its thematic question -- Who is more human, the humans or the androids? The elimination of Deckard's wife, the almost complete disappearance of Mercerism change the story significantly, but do not alter it conceptually.<br /><br />This movie fails miserably in portraying the true pathos of The Hunger Games. So many key thematic elements are dropped or left unexplained to the non-reader that there is no way you can get to the story's true meaning without having read the series. And if you have read the series, then you will be mystified by the way they gloss over the true meaning of the Mockingjay, the impetus behind the scenes in the cave, and much more. Replacing District 11's tribute to Katniss (the care package) with a simple salute and a riot (which belongs in the second book) takes away one of the most important thematic events in the tale and twists it into something completely different.<br /><br />The key here is supposed to be how Katniss's simple acts of heroism and respect for her fellow human beings bring about a complete change in the people viewing them -- how they change from fans of a sporting event to admirers of her nobility. How they begin to view their own actions in light of hers. It never happens. The film reduces it all to a struggle for power<br /><br />Don't even get me started on the casting of Woody Harrelson, or the incredibly lame manner in which they handled Cinna's costumes...<br /><br />Very disappointing.
B008VDJFFY|5.0|I have to give the author huge props for getting me into modern poetry, if I had known in advance that that was a big part of the book I'm not sure that I would have read it, but so glad that I did. The second book is even more amazing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fresh new romance, it doesn't disappoint.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Great song writing and story telling just like any White Stripes album it is a great way to finish a collection of their music.
B008KL2ITW|4.0|I love when romance stems from an unlikely pairing. The initial concept of the bet was really interesting. I'm looking forward to the sequel. I like that its not just aimed at young adult, I think older people will still enjoy this.
B008N5UX9M|4.0|Steve Harris delivers a new sound that is nothin like Iron Maiden and because of that this is a wonderful refreshing change for a man that we all think we know the musical sound of. If you are longing for a new Iron Maiden type album tis is not it, if you want to listen to eclectic musical chops of a very talented man then this is a must have.
0316010669|3.0|I gave three stars because at least it was easy to read. But it lacked any real depth or insights.<br /><br />It is more like talking in a bar to some guy who has some insights but takes a very long time to convey them.<br />For some light reading it is fine. I am not sure the book is usful in any real way.<br /><br />I suggest Predictably irrational  by Dan Ariely.  It is also light and easy to read but you may come away with an idea or two.
B0086449YA|5.0|Every aspect of this two cd set is wonderful and intriguing. Mark Knopfler delivers on every level of this album, if you have never listened to his solo albums this is a magical place to start.
6304698623|5.0|My daughter and I love this version of A little Princess. We were on the edge of our seats through parts of this movie. One of those heart warming classics. Worth seeing.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|Saludos.<br /><br />  Estoy Muy contento con mi nuevo Invicta Gran Diver, es un gran reloc<br /><br />  para el precio. tengo un reloc Omega, y este tambien entra en la competencia<br /><br />  Suiza.
B00008G7UF|5.0|I love this movie. Meg Ryan is hilarious, the music is fun. Just a great old fashion comedy. Definitely a must see.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a great movie, the end leaves space for a sequel and a lot of questions remain open, but over all is a great movie
B00338QENI|4.0|This is a fascinating story of a young black woman whose blood cells became famous because of their ability to replicate themselves and how they helped medical researchers find cures/treatments for some of the most debilitating diseases that continue to plague the world.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is the very detailed medical terms that may have gone into too much detail to make this an easy read.  However, this did not stop me from enjoying the book and story of this wonderful woman's contribution to medicine.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Galaxy Quest pokes fun at the original Star Trek, but in doing so is extremely entertaining in its own right.  I highly recommend this movie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I also downloaded this for my android smartphone.  The game is a bit laggy on the Kindle Fire but the larger format still makes it easier to play.  The missions and achievements are surprisingly fun considering the repetitive game play.  And who doesn't like Mr. Cuddles?
B008MM9630|4.0|Just started playing but a fun game to pass the time. good graphics. Kids have fun playing the game too
B0036RCVJM|4.0|this book gave a heartfelt insight as to what these heros had to go through in order for people of all nations including Japan to realize that wars just dont accomplish anything but pain in so many ways .
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Well, first of all the story was awesome.  Really awesome.  Kept me guessing right up to the end.  That last bit had me on the edge of my seat!  Then there's the main character, John Corey.  The sense of humor DeMille infuses into this character would be reason enough to read the book even if the who-done-it and intrigue weren't enough.  Although I was really into the story and wanting to find out who and why and all that other real serious stuff, I found myself laughing and thoroughly enjoying the personality of John Corey.  He's a bit off the wall and makes the story so much more enjoyable than if it was just a nail biter all the way through.  Great read.
B004I744AS|3.0|this dictionary is cool although it would be better if it were a offline dictionary because it would be more portable
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I've had this headset for over a year now, and I can safely say that I am extremely pleased with my experience so far. The headset has great quality, with the added bonus of bass boost and a separate volume knob for chat (USB input). About a month ago, however, the left speaker in my headset started crackling. I notified Turtle Beach, and they told me to send them my headset. It cost me $10 in shipping, but it was worth it, because I got an email 5 days after I sent it saying that they would replace my headset for free. I'm very happy with my costumer service experience. Not only did they replace the headset for free, but their response emails were prompt (I got a response within 15 minutes of sending every single time).<br /><br />As I've said, the headset has great quality, and is definitely worth the buy. 60 bucks for a headset of this quality is great.<br /><br />If you end up deciding on buying this headset, then I recommend buying the DPX21 headset instead. The DPX21 is just the PX21 with a DSS sound processor. I bought a DSS for this headset a while back, and it was definitely worth the buy. Instead of the already good quality stereo sound, the DSS converts it to 7.1 Dolby Surrond. If you play FPS games, this is a MUST HAVE.<br /><br />Pros of the headset<br />*Great quality (clear sound)<br />*Bass boost<br />*Separate game and chat volumes<br />*Mic mute switch<br />*Comfortable for short(ish) wearing periods<br />*Long cable<br />*Works with any 3.5mm source, as long as you have a USB source nearby to power the headset with<br />*Excellent customer support within the 1-year warranty<br />*Can easily be upgraded to 7.1 surround with a DSS<br />*Mic quality is clear<br />*Some sound picked up by the mic is \\"recycled\\" back into the headset, so you don't end up talking too loud<br /><br />Cons of the headset<br />*The cable (in my opinion) is too LONG. I'd have rathered they give the headset a standard-length cable, and send an extension in the box. I use theheadset for my PS3 and my PC, and the cable is way too long for use with a PC.<br />*Extended use of the headset can make your ears sore. This happens with any headset, so it's not too big of a problem. I'd recommend taking 5-10 minute breaks every couple hours.<br /><br />In the end, I would DEFINITELY buy this headset again. It's the best headset I've ever owned.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome. It is kind of like Sim city in that you have to balance different aspects of the city.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller works exactly as intended. It offers precise control over whatever game you play with the PS3. You could chuck this at a wall a couple of times and aside from a couple scratches, it would work just fine. Don't try it, though.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I really like these, you can almost imagine Castle writing them, Nikki Heat from his angle, plus plenty of action for us adrenaline junkies!
B0095R64AO|4.0|The movie previews would lead you to believe that The Five-Year Engagement is a true comedy. I would say it was more of a drama with comedic highlights. I enjoyed the movie and I really liked Jason Segal and Emily Blunt together. It just took some time to switch gears since I wasn't expecting the movie to go as dark or dramatic as it does. It is not the light hearted comedy the trailers would lead you to believe.
1582406723|5.0|I'll keep this short. I've never been a fan of graphic novels of any sort. But then I got hooked on the show (though season 2 was awful) and read a lot of good reviews by people who, like me, never cared for graphic novels. Well, I'm hooked. Once I started I couldn't put it down. The b&w artwork, the dialogue...top notch. I plan on ordering the entire series asap.
B001C4T450|5.0|There aren't enough words for how great Gotthard is! Superior vocals & band! Nice that you get some different mixes on reloaded as well! It's a must buy! This is one band you can listen to daily & never get tired of!!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I was glad to read this on my Kindle because the book is over 500 pages long. It has received mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it - couldn't put it down. As I was reading it, I watched an interview with the author on Charlie Rose and was interested that she put an emphasis on the main story that was completely different from mine.<br />She concentrated on the teenagers and I related more to the adults.<br /><br />It is that kind of a book, something for every reader. It would, however, benefit from one of those lists of characters in the front, because it is confusing when the story moves from one family to another before you are sure of who is who. However, the story is rich with details and characters. I didn't find it too long, as some reviewers have felt.<br /><br />My suggestion: try it, you'll find someone to relate to, someone to hate, someone to pity...there's something for everyone.
1608862801|5.0|North's splendiferous writing, along with the gorgeous and colourful contributions of the MULTITUDE of wonderful artists makes this collection a timeless addition to your bookshelf, home, and life in general.<br />without question - THIS BOOK IS TREASURE.
0823003590|4.0|As a beginning artist I found the book to be very informative and it offers a number of \\"perspectives\\" that I had overlooked.  It explains fundamentals in tones, shading, and the construction and placement of various facial features.  Good book and certainly worth the money.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Totally engrossing.  Hard to keep track of the names and relationships (even with the genealogy presented in the front).  Nonetheless, the reader quickly jumps into the world of the \\"piggies\\" and finds that extraterrestrials are not like humans.  Should we fear them or nurture them?  Kill them or help them?  Not at all clear, based on early draconian events.<br /><br />The concept that a eulogy should tell the truth about a person's life is intriguing.  However, you can just imagine many people for whom it would not work at all.  The Speaker would be torn to shreds by the in-laws.  At any rate, a good read and a very helpful companion (sequel) to \\"Ender's Game.\\"
B009CPJHY4|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen...which is why I bought it!  the only one that I have seen that is better is \\"The Intouchables\\"...it is also a must buy!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The plot is suspenseful and imagery surreal. Makes you think in 3D and zero G.  Without spoiling the ending, the irony in how this all works out is a perfect segue into the sequel (Speaker for the Dead). It is also thought provoking in how easily one can shift from one belief system to another. One minor criticism is it is not believable in describing the capabilities and intelligence of children.  I know children.  I have two really old ones. I know some are smart.  But not that smart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very entertaining and surprising end of the trilogy.  I would recommend this series of books to my friends. I enjoyed it very much.
030759565X|5.0|My 4 year old daugther and I got to meet the author in Portland at the book signing tonight.  Deb is very nice and friendly to everyone in that room.  She stops to talk to moms with children.  She signed my book and talks to my daughter and it make my daughter feels so special.  I don't know why people write negative comments about her regarding her son Jacob.  She seems like the motherly type and I only see 4 pictures of Jacob in the book, and there's is alot of food pictures, step-by-step clear instructions, and yummy recipes.  Her recipes always produced good result.  I know her book will delivery good result because I cooked recipes from her site alot and so far everything is tasty.  My first recipe to bake from this book will be the Challah.  Deb includes step-by-step pictures on braiding the round challah.  Deb, if you're reading comments on Amazon, my daughter and I love your book and your web site. We enjoyed talking to you at the book signing.  Please work on your next book and come back to Portland soon.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Simple design, but too many ads. Options to play classic solitaire and multiple suits. Overall recommended, classic game to own.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is a fun app. Very relaxing. My grandgirls love it. The 9month little one prefers  to play with her nose along with gales of laughter.
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|Megadeth, in 90', were one of the best metal bands ever and CTE with Rust in Peace are the proofs.<br />This edition is amazing and it's quite cheap if you think what you're getting!<br />If you don't have CTE, this is your chance to get it!<br />I'm sure you won't be disappointed, because this is Amazon, and especially it's MEGADETH!<br />\m/
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was blown away by this book! This was very well written and kept me at the edge of my seat. I can not wait for the next one EIY TO BE RELEASED!!!

B005LLSNNE|5.0|If you watched the first three seasons, then you know that you can't stop there!!  Season four is every bit as good as the other seasons with a shocking finally.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" is a wonderful story about America in the early 1800s, with some fascinating insight into indentured servitude. Our book club quite enjoyed it with much discussion about that time period in our country. My only concern was the inordinate amount of 'telling not showing' throughout the book. I found myself getting tired of being told 'about what happened' rather than putting me in the action (then I went here, and then I did this, and then he did that other thing) - it pulled me out of the story and made me feel I wanted to skip forward. Overall, however, great details and visuals and a nice snapshot of American life from the POV of an indentured servant and a mixed race slave. Great concept!
B007SGM084|5.0|My favorite! Absolutely love these books! Couldn't put them down, & I've read them before!!! Better than the \\"Twilight “ series that was popular a few years ago!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Its fun but a little hard I started playing it and couldn't find a thing but its also a GREAT way to pass the time!!!!!!!!!!

B0095T3H2U|5.0|I really enjoy Jason Segel in anything he does, and this movie continues that trend. Fun romantic comedy through and through.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The 3.7 update won't work and there's no way to undo it. Probably going to uninstall it because its pretty much useless.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is not Oscar material. This is just a fun alien ass kicking movie that will kill sometime for you and your kids. Keep an eye out for game reference.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|i like this app.  u can chose what wakes u up so it aint that bad to wake up supper early.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|To start with: I grew up watching this film.  I quote this movie more than just about any movie, with the possible exception of Dumb and Dumber with my wife (see my review of that movie for the inside scoop).  As the years have gone by I have read quite a bit of miscellaneous info about the film.  Evidently it was written to be another Dan Ackroyd/John Belushi film.  Well, that got scrapped.  Then they were going to make it akin to a National Lampoons: Ghostbusters, and that got scrapped.  Next Louis Tulley was supposed to be done by John Candy, but Candy turned it down (my biggest gripe with this film--Tulley is annoying, but his classic line outside the restaurant to the dog was great.  However, imagine John Candy doing it!  Ha!  The thought makes me laugh!) and on and on.  The story behind this film is just goodness.<br /><br />But for some dumb reason they only made 2 movies!  With the success of the 2009 video game, there was serious talk of there being a third, but that has not come to fruition.  Maybe they're waiting for the 30 year anniversary.  I'm getting old!  Hurry up already!<br /><br />I will say that one of the greatest events of my adult life was when a local theater, around halloween, put Ghostbusters up on the big screen!  My wife had to smack me for quoting the movie too much cause she couldn't hear over me yammering the lines!<br /><br />So for the love of all that is marshmallowy and toasty, make a 3rd already!<br /><br />And by now if you haven't realized, I'm assuming you know this movie, love this movie, and wear the T-Shirt around like a total dope like me, otherwise, how did you hear about this film?!  I know I'm not getting that old that kids look at me and say, \\"Ghost-what?\\"  It's getting there sadly.  Maybe in my Married with Children review I'll talk about the kid who looked at me and said something like that.  I subsequently drop-kicked him.<br /><br />Anyways, I won't comment on any of the nifty Blu-Ray nonsense, cause let's be honest, Blu-Ray on old films (and dramas--who cares if Harry looks sharper in When Harry Met Sally, we're not watching these kinds of movies for the effects any more) just doesn't really work.  The bad makeup jobs show through as well as the zits and other blemishes of the actors.  Bill Murray's face is pock marked enough as it is on DVD!<br /><br />Ranting aside, this is still one of the all-time best comedies of the 1980's and all-time as far as I'm concerned.  But I'm sure you can tell I'm a touch biased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game subway it nice and it and nice game to play and it good for the kids and for people.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Kamelot bounces back from their most recent effort, \\"Poetry for the Poisoned,\\" which had its moments but langtime fans know they are capable of better. They have developed a concept around \\"Silverthorn,\\" and the music speaks for itself. With great songs like \\"Ashes to Ashes,\\" \\"My Confession,\\" and \\"Prodigal Son,\\" they excel both musically and stylistically. On top of that, they have come up with their best set of hooks and riffs in a while. \\"Silverthorn\\" might not be their absolute best work, but it is certainly on par with their best work. And this is just an all-out great album that all metal fans should check out.
B0018RWM9G|5.0|After recently getting into collecting vinyl, I was very happy to find that this album was available in this format.  Musically, it is one of my favorite Coldplay albums.  But I'm not here to review the music itself (plenty of people have already done that in greater detail than I ever could).  I'm here to review the Vinyl.<br /><br />I was a little reserved at first, since the vinyl album was $24.99, which is notably more than many other new vinyl offerings.  However, I bought it anyway in good faith, and when I received it, man was I impressed.  The quality of this vinyl offering is TOP NOTCH.  The Paper that they used for the sleeve/case reminds me of the style that they use for the cover of Wired magazine - really high quality thick matte paper.  It just lends a certain quality to the whole ensemble.  In addition, they included the CD, and a really nice poster (again printed on nice paper that just says \\"high-quality\\".  Finally, on to the vinyl itself.  It is noticeably thicker and heavier than almost all of my other vinyl, so it is much less prone to warping.  The extra heft really gives it a nice feel as well.  And of course, it sounds awesome.<br /><br />It's nice to see such attention to these small details that really make it stand out from much of the other vinyl albums out there.  I'm glad I was able to add this one to my collection.  Highly recommended.
B009JNXK88|5.0|First of all, let me say that the gaming world would consider me a \\"core gamer\\"; I've been playing video games for over 25 years, and have had basically every home console released state-side since the mid-80's. I play between 10-20 hours of video games a week, if not more when I'm really into something. When touch-screen games started to rear their ugly head I was disgusted, as no amount of smashing my thumb against a glass surface would ever give me the tactile satisfaction and fine-level of control that an array of buttons and a joystick could. Several of my favorite games have even been adapted to the touch-screen medium, most notably Mega Man X, but with such terrible results -- the touch-screen controls do the original game a great disservice -- that I'm going to try and forget that they ever existed.<br /><br />For the most part, I really dislike touch-screen games; I find them to be an unfortunate step backwards in the often ultra-responsive controls which gaming has evolved over the last few decades, and as a \\"core\\" gamer, control response is crucial to any gaming experience.<br /><br />This brings me to League of Evil, which I downloaded because I'm always trying to expand my horizons by giving things (touch-screen games) another chance, because I love action/platform games, and  ... because it was free, of course! Anyway, I am really impressed with League of Evil. This game just might have the tightest, most responsive controls of any touch-screen action game currently on the market, and to beat the time goals on these levels you really need responsive controls. Someone mentioned that this is like Super Meat Boy, and I definitely get that vibe from this game; it's a challenging action-platform game which demands quick reflexes and thinking.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this game ... is that I can't play it with buttons. I hate mashing my thumbs against an unforgiving glass surface, but that's not really a complaint about the game as much as it is a complaint about the medium by which the game is delivered, so I have not subtracted any stars for that. However, I will subtract a star for the fact that the arrow \\"buttons\\" are too far apart; the game sometimes demands quick direction changes; it's really easy to lose track of towards which button you are closest, to not shift far enough in the desired direction, which means you end up going (or continuing in) the opposite direction you intended. Why don't game designers make touch-screen \\"buttons\\" positionable and sizable by the user? At least there is no dead-zone between the buttons, so with practice it's easy to find the sweet-spot between the buttons to really make some fast directional changes. I wish I could just subtract half a star and make this 4.5 stars, because these kinds of control nuances become more familiar with more game play, and the more I play this the less it bothers me.<br /><br />(Actually, forget it; I am going to round-up and just give this 5 stars, because it really is a great game, especially considering the price.)<br /><br />Fortunately, there's ample opportunity to familiarize yourself with League of Evil's controls, as it has over 160 levels. I'm really glad I got this for free during the \\"Free App of the Day\\" promotion Amazon does, but I would gladly pay the usual price for this if necessary. Overall this is a solid action-platform game, and the quick levels (usually less than 30 seconds each with a skilled play-through) are perfect for honing your fine motor skills on the go. There's ample replay value, as each level has a star rating (out of three) based upon the player's finish time, as well as a special out-of-the-way pickup for each level.<br /><br />I highly recommend League of Evil for any fan of retro action-platform goodness.medium by which the game is delivered, so I have not subtracted any stars for that.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I found this to be a quality product at a great price.  Definitely made<br />to fit.  Accessories of this type tend to be overpriced - it was definitely<br />a great find
B008OOYALE|5.0|wonderful and very addicting, but horrible with the in game noteifcations but all in all it is a wonderful game
B006ZVCQNM|3.0|Since I don't want to make you waste your time and I certainly don't like wasting mine, I'm gonna go straight for it. In this review I'm not gonna talk about the relevance of the record and/or its songs (there are a gazillion such reviews floating out there), but simply concentrate on the worthiness of this new re-release at hand. So, is this release worth the cash? Not for me.<br /><br />And I'll tell you why, plain and simple: if you already have the \\"The Very Beast of Dio\\" compilation and enjoy its sound, then you're going to find this release (as well as the other two deluxe editions, \\"Sacred Heart\\" and \\"Holy Diver\\" lacking punch.<br /><br />So let me say it again: I'm not saying this is horrible, I'm not saying it's bad, and not saying that the album stinks, I'm not trashing Ronnie James Dio's legacy. I'm simply giving you an extremely objective opinion based on an extremely objective reference point, so the choice if 100% up to you: If you liked Bill Inglot's remastering work on Rhino Records' \\"The Very Beast of Dio\\", chances are you will be disappointed with Andy Pearce's work for this new Universal release.<br /><br />The package in and by itself is pretty nice and a good idea in principle, but I can't help but feel disappointed with the execution of the idea. This record (and other remastered Dio records) definitely deserved better than this, IMO.<br /><br />Perhaps Rhino will eventually make its own release to correct this? Maybe, so if at all possible, I'd advise you to wait a couple of years for it.<br /><br />In short: great record (not PHENOMENAL like \\"Holy Diver\\", but worthy of 3 ½ stars AT LEAST), great songs (again, perhaps not to the level of previous songs, but pretty cool nevertheless), great idea for a deluxe, remastered edition, but ultimately inadequately executed.<br /><br />Long Live Rock n' Roll, Long Live Dio
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George R.R.Martin has a way of keeping you engaged in the book. It is had to put down.  It is very well written and thought out with many twist and turns.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked it . Now I have to wait to read more of Eva and Gideon<br />Hopefully next book is longer.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addicting.  It's very quick and easy to pick up on.  All of our devices have this game on it!
B009JNXK88|5.0|I like it so far but it can use some more levels and make them tricky.....  that's pretty much it
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl kept my interest from the first to the last page.  I have already recommended it to all my book-loving friends.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|this is awsome, i got it, is about 9 minutes 44 seconds, it beat diablo nemesis, death quetzalcoatl, varlares, jade juplter, scythe kronos, twisted tempo burn fireblaze
B00846REIS|5.0|Read the whole series in less than 2 days. I could NOT put it down. I can not wait for the third book to be out!
B007SGM084|5.0|Totally trashy and I couldn't put it down. Learned all kinds of interesting things! Should come with a warning label and a lock. Not for anyone under 21 for sure!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This Trilogy was the best book collection I have ever read. It had me aroused and crying at times. I couldn't put it down. It was the ultimate female fantasy in a book form! Love it times 50!
1423140605|5.0|The mark of Athena was very good. The only part I don't like is how Rick always cuts the book off at the best part other than that it was amazing and can't wait till the next one!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am an adult, I enjoyed all the Harry Potter Books and was looking forward to an \\"adult\\" book by J K Rowling.  I was very disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool but have to fore close a lot I mean a lot. nice game but you have buy a new game weird
B000002IAS|4.0|Delaney & Bonnie's most popular album unquestionably because of its association with the legendary blues guitarist himself, Mr. Eric Clapton!<br /><br />\\"Comin' Home\\" is based around a bluesy groove and actually not much different from the chorus we hear in Derek & the Dominos \\"Keep On Growing\\" but with Delaney & Bonnie's trademark vocals.  Somehow, the song doesn't feel repetitive.  Perhaps the live setting makes it feel that way.  \\"Little Richard Medley\\" is about what you'd expect- an energetic live performance of several Little Richard songs grouped together (a famous tradition for live rock artists back in the day).  It is what it is, basically.  The vocal melodies aren't really better than the originals, nor worse.  The short bursts of guitar and sax work stands out the most for its melodic nature.<br /><br />\\"Poor Elijah- Tribute to Johnson\\" really showcases Bonnie Bramlett's vocal range, and the Jerry Garcia-like vocals of Delaney are a nice addition.  What *really* makes this song so great is the guitar solo in the middle.  Talk about a splendid one!  Unfortunately the song does lose some of its magic when Bonnie stops taking advantage of her range and dwindles down to a repetitive chorus with the line \\"Nobody's here\\".  \\"I Don't Want To Discuss It\\" has a fast-moving pace and vocals with a scorching guitar solo in the middle.  Truth be told, I don't really think these vocals are *that* great and I can certainly do without the repeating line \\"You're My Girl\\" that borders on clumsily sung.  \\"That's What My Man Is For\\" has exceptionally vibrant vocals courtesy of Bonnie.  If this is her interpretation of gospel blues similar to Carole King, it's wonderful.<br /><br />Overall, pretty impressive but nothing that leaves me wanting more.  This is all the Delaney & Bonnie I'm looking for.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|One of my favorites.  I enjoy this CD just as much as her later one.  I love Adele's voice.  Would defiantly recommend this CD is you like 21.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This movie was awful. Batman played a down and out crippled loser through most of it and the senseless mayham was boring and pointless. many times i couldnt even hear or understand what they said. Catwoman was a great character as was robin but they harldy ever showed them.The story line was lack luster and downright ridiculous. The first was rich with characters and an interesting plot. Dont waste your money with this one. Thus movie was nothing buy hype with mindless drones following along.
B00005S6K8|3.0|It is not the movie that I remembered.  It is Ok.  I find it slow.  I am not a fan of romantic comedies, but I am a fan of Harrison Ford.  I saw this movie years ago so I just didn't remember it was slow.
B0096HNDXY|5.0|This is Kylie's night time album, late night listening - not for the dance floor but those quiet nights in.  Some of her best hits are reconstructed here and the results are startlingly effective. It's not always clear which road we are being led down, the arrangements are highly original and the vocals take unexpected turns but this is one detour worth taking.  Here, chilled out Kylie stands totally centre stage, the clever musical backing (together with fine backing vocalists) supporting her rather than carrying her.  Her voice, a curious mix of youthfulness and adult understanding infuses the lyrics with fresh meaning and draws out their reflective qualities. Many musical styles are covered - Can't Get You Out of My Head charges along, propelled by frenzied strings, Confide in Me is edgier than ever, laced with dark sexual tones, Come Into My World is all trembling classical refrain.  Never Too Late is Kylie's torch song and she channels a vampish Marilyn Monroe in Slow.  I Believe in You is an affirmative lullaby and dance smash On a Night Like This morphs into a bluesy swagger.....this is a listening journey worth taking.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love this whole CD.  There is not a song on there that I don't like.  Will defiantly buy future albums.
B000VMBXNA|4.0|On the one hand, this plot is hilarious, and on the other hand, I wonder if it's so off base.  Truly a quick light read.  Perfect for an airplane ride.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|This cd is the best they have made in a long time, it has been long over due but definetly worth buying.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My favorite movie in past couple years!!  Hilarious!  Tons of action.<br />Good writing.  Great script.  Characters play well off of each other.  3D is OK, but he rest of the special effects are terrific.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a easy read, with careters the you can falling love with. This book end in a spot that you have to read the next book. Chapters are weal written and full of everything you need. I would and will read this book and all they books again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Definitely not a waste of time, best game since Fruit Ninjas. Yet not as good as Jetpack Joyride. Love this game though. very very very addicting. Well! I'm going play it BYE:)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|When this book was suggested for my book club, I was reluctant to read it because it just did sound that interesting & not something I would like.  Boy was I wrong!  The drama, the elements of suspense, the love story (of family) all made for a fantastic story that I just couldn't put it down!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is fantastic at creating magic systems. From the fully realized Mistborn saga that has three magic systems to the still very mysterious system being crafted in The Stormlight Archive series. In The Emperor's Soul, he has given us another fantastic magic system that (without spoiling much) allows people to rewrite the history of objects.<br /><br />Even though it is a Novella, you grow really attached to protagonist, Shai, in the short time we spend with her. Most of that time is confined to a single room, but you would hardly notice it unless someone points out for you. You learn a lot about her past and her way of thinking as she has to sort of explain herself to one of her captors in order to further her own goals in the story.<br /><br />The fight scenes are well done - reminds me of Mistborn - fast and the magic system naturally comes into play to give the protagonist that much needed edge.<br /><br />I could go on about the book, but really in the end it is a quick but satisfying read. It is a world and magic system I really hope he chooses to explore in further books, whether they be novella or novel sized stories.<br /><br />If you like any of Brandon's previous work, you'll like this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a great way to pass some time.  I like the graphics and sounds.  And, this is much better than the real game at the carnival since I don't have to spend money!
B00333NCTM|5.0|A no-holds barred telling of events and the turns of life in the best that his memory can give. And a testament to never giving up and that good things can come to you. And testament to a good love that has lasted through the best and the worst. I think anyone and everyone should read this book. Whether you are fan of the music, or not. Simply to read of the life that has been led is an education and of value to everyone.<br /><br />And blessings to the Osbournes.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Very glad I saw this in someone's wish list.  Saved the URL till the next payday ... then ordered it.  Had a very short wait for the DVD to show up in my mail.  (A Very Big Plus For Amazon.)<br />I was so glad it was my day off when the DVD came in.  I could put the DVD in to the play, pop some popcorn (YES, really did), sit back and enjoy the program.<br />Was very worth the price and the wait.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|I bought it for my 6 year old son's birthday. He loved it. He has spent a lot of time playing with it. Definitely recommended if you have kids that like Ninjago.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|At first I thought it was going to be easy.<br /><br />Then when you get into the upper levels it gets good.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Beautiful graphics! Interesting storyline. Easy to follow screen changes. LOVED this game!!! This is exactly the type of game I look for to play! Thank you!!
0375507256|5.0|Want to feel connected to the past & the future?  Understand how our actions are intertwined?  This excellent novel is a must read.  Well written and creatively presented, if you want to understand the movie - read this first - or second.  I read before seeing the movie and liked the movie but see how it could be hard to get close to the characters with all the shifting -- but I had already become close to them in the book .  THE BOOK ISN'T EXACTLY THE SAME - so if you saw the movie, it won't be boring.
B00A202A3I|5.0|If you are reading this review and you haven't seen this episode yet, prepare yourself. I suggest you watch it alone. This episode was insanely emotional.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was an excellant extension to the Hunger games. Held interest all the way to the end. Recommend to all but, must read in order.
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I loved it<br />4 - I really like it<br />3 - I like it/Worth a look<br />2 - Don't like it<br />1 - Hate it<br /><br />Even though I felt this movie had potential, I just can't give it more than one star. This movie is a mess. I get that it was trying to capture the feel of a 60's romantic thriller, like Charade, but it fails miserably. As my review title says, go watch Charade instead. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were two of the most glamourous stars of their time. Hepburn was beautiful and when it came to fashion was one of the most stylish women around. Cary Grant was suave and super cool, it's easy to see anyone falling for his charms. I'd love it if they'd just release this movie theaters. They used to do that more often, but now you can only see an older movie in theaters if you're lucky enough to have a theater that plays them. I don't think I really need to go into the plot of this movie, there are plenty out there and of course there was the trailer for it as well. I recall this movie got a lot of promotions and even had giant cardboard displays at theaters. And why not, it stars two of the biggest actors today, Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.<br /><br />This part is gonna stir up some controversy because of what I'm about to say; I'm not a fan of Angelina Jolie. I've never seen the hype of her as an actress. And this has nothing to do with the whole Jennifer Aniston/Brad Pitt thing; Hollywood has plenty of this kind of drama going on that it's nothing new. I admit I enjoyed her in Girl, Interrupted, she did a great job in that movie as well as the rest of the cast. In fact her earlier work is way better given that she did riskier roles compared to now. Just about every role she takes on is just very standard Hollywood, and when she was first getting big she was doing all kinds of unconventional roles. I recommend seeing the movie Gia where she plays a drug addicted model, it's a sad movie (based on a true story as well) but it's well made and acted. I also enjoy her in the Kung Fu Panda movies, although the major highlights of those movies come from the action and comedy. But in a way those movies go with her conventional roles of playing a tough as nails women like in Lara Croft or Wanted. So yes, she's done some good movies here and there. But for the most part, she's just meh. She rarely does a lot of emoting in movies, and giving a cold stare the whole time doesn't mean you're acting and giving any real depth. And sure I can see that she's an attractive woman, but not so much in recent years. She's started getting way too thin. And in terms of acting, her other half Brad Pitt is way better and has done some more interesting roles. This movie doesn't help with her looks either. There's the heavy makeup she's wearing and she looks silly with her attempt at a sexy walk. Really I'd say Girl, Interrupted was her last real daring role where she showed off some raw emotion and showed that she can act. But most of the things she does now are just her looking pretty, or trying to be a bad@$$. Now I still need to see some of her newer films. I haven't seen Changeling yet, but my main reason for wanting to see that is because it's directed by Clint Eastwood, who is really good at working with actors and getting them to give a decent performance.<br /><br />As for Johnny Depp, I love the guy. He has a natural charm for sure. Yes in recent years he too has done more standard roles as well. But he at least still entertains me with these performances; Captain Jack Sparrow has become one of my favorite movie characters. And even in more standard films he seems to at least be putting in some effort, more than I can say for Jolie in most things. Not so much in this movie though. I'd say he was doing it for the paycheck. There's a quote by Jolie that she was just doing because she thought hey it'll be a quick shoot and she had nothing better to do. That's the secondary problem with this movie too. Neither are really putting effort in their performances. I can't really buy Depp as a simple math teacher; Depp has no business playing a normal person. His most normal performance was probably the original Nightmare on Elm Street, and that was a supernatural slasher film where he got sucked into a bed followed by a geyser of blood. The other would probably be What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but even in that he was part of dysfunctional family and surrounded by eccentrics. See both movies if you haven't, they're classics.<br /><br />The primary problem with this movie is that it's predictable. Even from the trailer it was super obvious that Depp's character was going to be this international thief, otherwise it wouldn't be exciting enough. If you're star is Depp, of course he's going to be the suspect. Course this movie fails to be exciting as everything moves slowly. I'm guessing the $100 million budget was mainly because Jolie and Depp cost a lot of money. Course I'm sure Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton weren't cheap either. I've seen more exciting, fast paced action films that didn't cost nearly this much. The 2006 actioner Shoot 'Em Up cost $39 million to make, that's more than half of what this movie cost. Look at the first Terminator movie, it only cost $6 million. Sure it's sequel cost $100 million, BUT that movie was fast paced and awesome! The 2003 Italian Job cost $60 million and was more exciting than this; sure it wasn't a fantastic movie but it was at least fun. This movie spends most of it's time wanting to show off the Venice. Sure Venice looks great, but this is supposed to be a thriller with some action and such. It doesn't deliver very well on that. The George Clooney film The American (released the same year) cost $20 million and had some stunning Italy landscapes, and it's pace was slow too, but it did it in a way that was able to still build tension and have some mystery to it. Now I can see the American dividing opinions, but I'll still stand by what I said when I think it has a more engaging plot. Since the twist of the Tourist is obvious, it just leaves you thinking of when they're finally going to reveal when Depp finally admits he's the prime suspect. If he and Jolie had chemistry and actually put effort into their performances I could ignore that because I'd least be entertained. But they don't, and it just gets really tedious. Going back to Charade, certain things were obvious, but again it had a great pace and Hepburn and Grant had excellent chemistry and used their charms. But Depp just looks bored. Say what you will about any of the Pirates sequels, but at least then you can tell he's having a good time in those movies. Also those movies used their budgets well to give us some mind blowing special effects and awesome action scenes (the whirlpool fight in World's End is EPIC!) and the rest of the cast I'm sure see he's having fun so they try to have fun. This movie though isn't fun though, another thing that Charade has above this movie. Most of the cast seems to be trying, but it really isn't enough if your leads can't wake up and do some acting.<br /><br />That's really all I have to say. Hope I didn't ramble on too long. While this may not be super informative of the movie itself, I hope it at least entertained and I've managed to get people to watch the other movies I talked about.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie was good to me.  I felt like it had a few parts that did not need to be in the movie.  Overall I was pleased with the movie.
B008RC72G8|5.0|Loved this movie. Being a big Johnny Depp and Tim Burton fan. Great cast. I had pre-ordered the movie and received it just before it went on sell in stores.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This is well written epic that keeps you engaged for the entire 1000+ pages.  The language used to describe the events in India are fantastic.  I enjoyed it from the first page.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have intended to read \\"Ender's Game\\" ever since I read \\"Characters and Viewpoint\\", also by the author, and an excellent guide.  This distopian novel, with a world created just fully enough to allow our imagination to do the rest, and a protagonist, Ender, who captures your heart, has inspired me to immediatelly read \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" so I could visit with Ender again.<br />I won't stop until I have read all Ender novels, and there are 3 or 4, I believe.

OK, honestly, I originally gave it 5 stars to be funny, but many don't actually read the comments just look at stars.  this game is by far sub-par.  there are many updates needed and less fake reviews.  this could be fun, buts at this stage of development,  it should be free and asking for input from users.  $1.49 is just crazy.
0316228532|2.0|I bought this book for my Kindle and I'm sorry I did because even though I can remove it from my Kindle it will still exist in my Cloud somewhere. If it were a traditional book I could just burn it.<br />If you think the world needs another book about dysfunctional families (I think there are far too many), then maybe you will like Casual Vacancy. It is unremittingly sad, hopeless and dour. I hated it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I would not have understood The Casual Vacancy at all if I hadn't just revisited the entire \\"Prime Suspect\\" series on Netflix.  (A very worthwhile thing to do!)  Having seen the poverty and destitution, as well as the crime, delinquency, and terrible language and attitudes of the \\"estates\\" poor Jane had to deal with in Prime Suspect, I could at least understand what JK Rowling was talking about in terms of The Fields.<br /><br />But I wasn't very sympathetic to any of the characters, even the meant-to-be sympathetic young lady who had sex while leaving her baby brother to his own devices.  What was she thinking?  The townspeople were dreadful, the plot was almost non-existant, and the writing was more than a bit foreign to me. I finished the book because I felt I should, but I'm not particularly glad I did. Better luck next time, JK!
0307591549|4.0|This book has a lot of motivational and inspirational moments.  Shawn has an enjoyable way of relaying stories and anecdotes.<br />I did purchase the Audible version to read along with on my Kindle and that made it a pleasure to follow.  I purchased the physical book as a gift for a friend.<br /><br />I first saw Shawn appear on a PBS fundraiser which got me interested enough to read the book.  Many of his tips can be found shared by him in pieces and fragments scattered online.  Having finished the book, I found some of the info in a TED talk.<br /><br />He explores the emerging field of Positive Psychology.  His main argument is that you should seek to be happy now and that will help you succeed.  This way of thinking being a reversal of conventional wisdom where you need to be successful to be happy.<br />He also posits that traditional psychology has focused too much on making people normal rather than truly happy and thriving.<br /><br />He suggests many ways of achieving that based on applications of \\"Positive Psychology\\" research.  For instance, You can trick your brain into be happy and you can influence others to spread the happiness by smiling.<br /><br />Every day schedule on your calendar a time to consistently:<br />- Keep a Journal<br />- Give Thanks<br />- Exercise<br />- Do good deeds<br /><br />The 20 second rule to eliminate procrastination and build good habits or break bad ones.<br />The Tetris effect.<br /><br />I found that he frequently mentioned experimental studies (often where he was the subject) to the point where someone might think he was overdoing it.  I didn't look back at his references but I believe they'd be valuable to investigate further.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle somewhere between 1-2 months ago. I resigned myself to spending money...fine. However, as of 3 minutes ago, this app completely started over asking me to choose my avatar again (ma or pa). All of the money and time I have put into it were wasted once again. Don't get this app. It is a serious time suck with no real benefit at all.  Beware.
0765316994|2.0|I first saw this book at the Strand Bookstore in NYC. I read the flap copy and actually laughed out loud with joy! Finally, I thought, a writer has addressed a Star Trek plot device upon which my friends and I have often remarked: Why does some poor schlep in a red shirt (one of my friends has named that generic character \\"Ensign Expendable\\"), always get blown away on an \\"away mission\\" (I think it was called a \\"landing party\\" in the original series) when teamed with any of the show's cash-cow regulars?<br /><br />Well, I just finished the book. The Prologue, like the flap copy, is hilarious! After that, the laughs are few and far between, thanks, in part, to the verbosity of the main characters; but it does deal with some interesting teleological issues.<br /><br />It could have been even pretty good, if not for the following gigantic problem.<br /><br />The story ends on page 231, 86 pages short of the end of the book. Good ending. The rest consists of, first, a transcript of Scalzi's blog that reminded me once again why I never read blogs any more--they're usually just the blogger's self-centered, irrelevant ranting, and this one conforms to that unfortunate model.<br /><br />The rest of the book is an interminable ... let's be kind and call it, \\"epilogue.\\" You know how, if you try to explain a joke, you completely ruin it? That's what the last 86 pages of this book do to an otherwise mildly enjoyable read. This is why publishers--well, most publishers, anyway--have editors: to tell the author when something works and when it's embarrassing.  Maybe this book's publisher should hire one.<br /><br />Too bad. Great premise, disappointing execution.
B004I744AS|1.0|I was expecting when I got this app to get the words I needed and get the meaning but I didn't and I'm very dissapointed.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|For fans of the Aliens series, Prometheus is definitely worth seeing. It does not deserve extreme criticism or praise. The story is decent enough to keep you interested (especially since it's a prequel and answers some questions about what led up to the first movie in the series, which remains the best of them all. The special effects are good. It's worth the rental fee. I'm glad, though, that I did not pay to see it in the theater, and I won't be buying the dvd.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0085RQLXK Music From Another Dimension]] I've been an Aerosmith fan all my life, and for what this album is...a record by a band whose prime was in the 1970's and 1980's...it ROCKS!!! Yeah, there are the formulaic power ballads we've grown accustomed to since the Get a Grip era, but if you really think about it, those have been around since Toys and Rocks with songs like \\"You Hear Me Cryin'\\"...however, what I bought the album for is what Aerosmith fans love best about them, the foot stompin' sleazy swagger that accompanies Tyler's vocals and the guitar duel between Perry and Whitford. No, this isn't a perfect album by any means, but for what it is...guys in their 60's mind you, it does the trick. Adding Jack Douglas and writing the majority of their songs is a plus, too. Production is on point and not overly slick like Permanent Vacation. Tyler sounds excellent and I like the way Kramer pounds along on the drums. I conclude that although this does not stack up to their 70's masterpieces it does come close if not equal to what I consider their last great album, 1989's \\"Pump.\\" There is a little filler but all in all it's the most I've enjoyed an Aerosmith album in over 20 years!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I was, at first, put off by some of the one-star reviews of this book.  Since I've enjoyed all the other Child/Reacher novels I decided to give it a try anyway.  I'm so happy I did.<br /><br />I think those who've given this book a low rating may not understand Jack Reacher and his evolution as a character.  Perhaps they were looking for non-stop action and fighting sequences.<br /><br />Instead, this book offers an intricately woven tale of intrigue and suspense which kept me guessing and interested through the last page.  The climactic action sequences are as well-written, engaging, and dramatic as ever but there is also this mystery and tension which builds beautifully from page one.<br /><br />If you love Jack Reacher, this book is well worth your hard-earned dollar.

B005PK4ZHY|5.0|I was ecstatic to learn that I could instantly download and access the season through the new Video on Demand feature. No longer do you have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. I always love the creative way the writers and directors portray what is ordinary in life and make it so interesting and dramatic, yet give it a realism that anyone can relate to. Comic relief not only for the women in the world, but surprisingly the men. This was indeed a great show and every season was cause to celebrate. I am very saddened that it has come to an end. Great run ladies! and hunks!

Young breaks downs technical terms into general layperson terms that anyone can understand (me being said general layperson).  Mr. Young provides settings that he prefers and gives his opinions on various techniques or suggestions on additional equipment.<br /><br />I am very happy with Young's advice.  I've been out in the field experimenting with his suggestions and so far what he has provided in his book has worked great.  I'll update as needed.

B001O6W9QC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a movie about five actors who go out into the wilderness to make a film about the Vietnam Conflict, and they end up getting in trouble with a drug gang and other issues.<br /><br />The films overall is quite entertaining.  A lot of \\"movies about making movies\\" follow a certain formula, but this movie is far from formulaic.  Each character has their own quirks and personality (and weaknesses) which are explored in this film.<br /><br />There are some \\"gross-out\\" and off-color moments in the movie, but if you enjoyed some of Ben Stiller's other movies you will likely enjoy this one as well.

B009VB97EY|2.0|My fiancee convinced me to rent this film with her, and we both ended up with a similar impression of this film.<br /><br />Basically the film is about a group of male strippers who are attempting to move up into the \\"big time.\\"  One of the most successful members of the team, however, is more interested in trying to grow up and move along.  In the meantime, he is bringing along \\"The Kid,\\" as a new member of the show.<br /><br />Overall, the dancing and acting is quite good.  Channing Tatum in particular shines in the dancing scenes.<br /><br />However, the story/character development is very minimal (non-existent for most of the cast).  Very little time is spent outside of the club scenes, and when you see the daily life of Mike or the Kid, you catch only a glimpse.<br /><br />Ultimately, you may enjoy some of the dancing and club scenes, but you will leave the film feeling rather unfulfilled.

1432794426|2.0|Firstly, please let me say that any book which fights Michael's corner in the public domain has my vote.This is what this book does - well obviously one would assume so due to the title. Therein lies the rub. I think I would recommend this book to a first time fan. The opening chapters - the ones which are written with involvement from Michael's bodyguards are the most informative. After that I would say for those of us who have been long term fans, the rest of the book is fairly lightweight and really doesnt tell us anything we dont already know. To me that was disappointing since the title seemed to offer more.<br /><br />I maybe wrong but I feel that Dr Moriarty started off this book with all the best intentions to work with 'The Bodyguards'& produce a tombe which lived up to its name, but unfortunately something went wrong and they parted ways. Suddenly left on her own and with several hundred pages to fill it seems she took the easy way out. There is no doubt that important issues were glossed over when they should have been included. Dr Moriarty should have maybe waited or spent more time on the research to fulfil what the title of her book promised.<br /><br />So all in all as a book which will stand up and stand out, I unfortunately say - no, one for the bottom shelf. As a book to whet the appetite of a 'newbie' fan who is keen to go on and search out the facts - maybe. For me though - disappointing and after the first couple of chapters, very boring and mundane.<br /><br />Sorry Karen

B0091REZMW|2.0|I like the overall game, but there are a couple of things that could use improvement. There are too many goblins and phenomenons that you cannot get rid of without using jewels, which you rarely get unless you purchase them. If you choose not to purchase them, you have to wait for a very long time until you correct enough to get rid of one, which comes back after only searching the room once. I found this so frustrating that I gave up trying to get rid of them. Also, recently I enter a room to find that the list of items I'm supposed to search for is not there. It does not reappear after waiting and selecting random objects does not work- so apparently it hasn't generated a list. My only option once this happens is to leave the room and forfeit the expended energy.After iI leave, the app force closes, but still does not give me my wasted energy back. If I leave the app while in the room with no list, it does nothing and also sstopping the app from the settings menu does not work either. It's happening each time I play, sometimes more than once, which is frustrating enough to make me think about removing it from my device. Nexus 7
0345803493|1.0|This item was suppose to be here by Oct. 30th but has not yet arrived. I am not happy with this
B009JNXK88|4.0|Like it.  Awesome game for it's simplicity, def dig the Retro thing.  And its a challenge trying to get all three stars on every level.  Re-playability.  Great pickup for FAOTD.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|It's cute. Could've been better, but still cute. If you like cats, Dilbert, and/or extremely short comic strip like books, read it! :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|From the beginning to the end it definitely doesn't disappoint!! Two thumbs up. Two down and one more to go!
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game, I wish there were more upgrades though but overall this game should get a 5 star rating
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I just love the challenge of this game with so many levels. And best of all it is free !!!!!!!
B009JNXK88|5.0|I think you should really get this game.<br />It's the BEST pixel game besides Super Mario.<br />I Love This Game!
B007RV6X2Y|4.0|This was a good movie, a  bit of a sleeper but once it started to roll, it all fell into place.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin Dozer is a pretty addicting game! Though it may not seem so at first, you collect prizes to finish puzzles and level up! It is not just getting coins to fall over the edge, there is more to it, but be prepared to spend an hour on it, it is not just a few minutes of a game!
0375507256|1.0|This is one of the most tedious boring over rated novels that I \\"tried\\" to read.. I simply could not force myself to read it..it is back in the book bag to go to a local thrift shop..sorry for the bad review..
B00992CF6W|5.0|it rocks it has every thing i wanted cows, sheep, pigs,and loded with dimonds me and my brother were wating forever for it to come out for our Kindles.
B008OOYALE|5.0|looked a little cheezy but it is really fun. A LOT like tiny monsters though. only complaint is that it takes so long to get any money built up.
0316228532|2.0|This book is very disappointing, definitely not Rowling's best.  The characters are two dimensional and the plot is weak. Rowling certainly is not at her best.
B0087ZFH9Y|5.0|What a treat. Beautiful packaging. Bollocks has never sounded so good. You haven't heard it like this. Lydon's vocals are clearer than ever. From the giant poster to the replica GSTQ single, this is the only Sex Pistols box you'll ever need. I feel like it's 1977 all over again.
B006H4DBA4|5.0|Good quick read, too quick in fact. Good introduction to Sophie Kinsella. Will definately read more of her novels. Thanks
B004LWZWGA|1.0|Chew-your-leg-off-to-escape boring torture session that lasted at least an hour longer than needed.  Endless repetitive scenes that had little to do with the moronic plot, plot holes that were amazingly stupid, inane dialogue, all smothered by an overbearing soundtrack (which thankfully covered up some of the idiotic script).  I suppose if you really want to watch this movie again, having a fast-forward button might let you enjoy the highlights.  If you haven't seen this yet, find something better to spend your money on.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Product is great. The discs are in excellent condition. The box it came in looks brand new & for a great price. I'm very pleased, will definitely purchase other disney movies from amazon.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|As a seeker of truth I was excited about this book because it's written by a scientist who's world view was changed by the NDE experience, and while I enjoyed reading it and had many \\"yes\\" moments while reading it and found many things that resonated with me, I was very disappointed by how little information there was there about God and our universe.  He kept saying that there were many lessons and I kept thinking \\"Okay, he must get to them in the next chapter\\", but he never did.  What were the lessons? What was the knowledge that he received there? I understand that he was stripped of his identity and probably didn't ask any questions that an average human being would ask given the chance, and yet he said that he did have many lessons, but why did he not get into it?  That's the stuff we want to know!
B009JNXK88|3.0|...Motorola Droid X (same as Droid X). I don't even know if I like it, so it doesn't feel fair to give 1 star. There's no list of compatible devices to alert me that it may not work on my device, &amp; the error message ONLY saying, &quot;League of Evil cannot be installed&quot; with no further option or explanation, 3 Stars seems fair since it MAY be a developer issue.
B00634GHJA|5.0|this app is fantastic. I use it all the time and have never had a glitch. I highly recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this might be one of the best battery apps on the Amazon appstore. whenever I plug in the charger into my kindle fire it pops up and shows me how much battery I have left. it also pops up when there's 15% of battery left. 5 STAR APP!!!
0812984412|2.0|I don't understand why this book has gotten so many glowing five-star reviews. It was generally an enjoyable read, and some of the nested stories were quite engaging. I thought the Louisa Ray story was very well done, and I also enjoyed the Orison story. But the Adam Ewing story was slow going because of it's dialect, and I almost put the book down without making it to the second story. Sloosha's Crossin', the innermost story, is *much* worse in this regard, and I never would have waded through that laborious prose if it hadn't formed the core of a book I had already invested a lot of time in. Yes, I get that people speak differently in a dystopian future, but most writers know when to back off of dialect and give the reader a break.<br /><br />The quality of the writing ranges from good to brilliant, but it's hampered by the narrative styles employed for the various stories. The journal of Adam Ewing is not very credible as a journal, the letters from Frobisher read more like journal entries, and the Q&A interview format of the Orison story made for a rather clunky and unnatural telling. And packaging the Crossin' story as a telling of a tale to 'young uns' just forced us into unremitting dialect for what would otherwise have been a very enjoyable read. Perhaps that's in part why I enjoyed Louisa Ray so much -- Mitchell set his devices aside for this one and just told the story straight out.<br /><br />Finally, the odd structure of the book, with all the stories breaking at mid-point and then completing in the opposite order, did nothing for me. Yes, it was a clever device, but it was a cleverness that simply got in the way of the story-telling. There were  a few cross-references among the stories, and some broad hints that all the characters are really the same character re-incarnated. But in the end, the stories just stacked up and wound down. I kept waiting for some deeper reason for the odd structure. What I kept expecting was that from the center story outward, each story would provide the key to unlocking something mysterious about the inner stories it surrounded. But aside from the bit with a tattoo, there was nothing. Nada. Why go to all the work of nesting these stories if there's no underlying reason for doing so. What I thought throughout would prove to be a reward for switching from story to story just turned out to be a pointless gimmick.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|After reading \\"A Walk In The Woods\\", I knew I wanted to read something else by this author.  Fortunately at the end of my Kindle edition, there was a list of books to choose from.  I have always wanted to go to Australia and this title jumped off the page at me.  It was a delightful read, parts of which I have read to friends for a good laugh. Makes me want to travel there even more!!! Thanks, Bill!!!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I wasn't thrilled with this book. I have enjoyed some of his other books, but this one was not that great. Some of it, I think, was because I got tired of the short choppy sentences (sort of a trade-mark of his, but they got old quickly) and also I didn't really care that much about the characters. I did like the main character (The Time Keeper himself) but I didn't feel the other main characters were that well developed which made it hard for me to really worry about them or care what happened to them.<br /><br />If you really like Mitch Albom, you will probably enjoy this book, even if it's not one of your favorites. If you're not a big fan of his, then you probably won't like this one at all. I'm not sorry I read it, but I am sorry I bought it....I could have waited and checked it out of the library and that would have been fine.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I would have to say the picture quality has vibrant colors, and they are quite clear.  However, where are the pictures stored once I take them?  Detailed directions sure would be helpful!  It's also quite hard to take a picture of something you can't see as the Kindle is turned in the opposite direction when taking pictures.  I have to look over my Kindle and hope I have my object aligned with the camera.  This app is in need of much more work!
3836509032|5.0|If you're fascinated with technical drawings, this is your book.  It beautifully reproduces the hundreds of technical drawings developed for the tower's construction, many of them in color.  The large format of the book is essential for capturing the incredible detail.  In today's world of push-button CAD, it's helpful to see what could be accomplished a century ago with T-squares and paper.  Knowing the drawings were created manually elevates them to a work of art.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Okay, its not the Avengers, but its fun!  I enjoyed this film so much as a ride of excitement.  I enjoyed the cast, the silly one liners, the outrageous feats.  This movie is the epitome of a blockbuster!  Special effects, great imagery and overall a decent cast that you find yourself rooting for in the end.  While sometimes it borderlined on cheesy, but you can say that for almost any movie.  I guess if you just expect it for what it is, you will find yourself enjoying a cinematic adventure that takes you away from the world for a couple hours.
B0071BGOJC|2.0|Unfortunately this book follows the same formula as its predecessor - unlikely meetings between far-removed characters that occur just at the right time for the story. It all seems so contrived.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|First, I want to say that I was one of the people who loved the theatrical cut of this movie, though I seem to be in the minority.  I took the \\"unanswered questions\\" as a director's respect for the viewer's ability to think for themselves.  That being said, I was still excited to see all the alternate and deleted footage to get a new perspective on the film.  It really has some eye-opening scenes in there, and if you wanted answers, you'll get quite a few.<br /><br />The only thing that really disappointed me about this blu-ray was that there was no extended/alternate/director's cut of the movie integrating the deleted footage.  I was expecting something more like the Alien dvds/blu-rays that offered a choice between watching the theatrical and the extended cut, but alas, there is no such option.  I suppose they're saving that for the ultra super collector's edition to be released at a later date.  That's the marketing machine for you.<br /><br />Aside from that, the picture is gorgeous, the sound fantastic, and the extras really a treat.  Definitely worth picking up if you're a fan of the Alien franchise, or scifi in general.
6305678715|3.0|Not a bad movie. Not a fan of meg ryan. I wanted to watch this movie because I had just gotten back from San Francisco and thought it would be cool to watch this movie since it's set in SF. Sean Connery is great as usual. So is Hamilton. The storyline is a little rushed and the movie is really just dated. But still not bad for the price. Wish I hadn't have ordered the widescreen version. Aggravating to watch in that format.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a good, solid movie and well worth a watch.  The cast of well-seasoned actors could, easily, have walked all over one another, but they did not.  It is a bit sad at times, but still a great movie.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I like DeMills work some are more fast paced than other but always a good read,it's get the bad guy and do what it takes.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|Great series.  I'm still not sure I like Steve Buscemi in this particular role (even though I really like him in general), but the casting for all the other characters is spot-on; just great.  Kelly MacDonald is perfect for her part as the morally-conflicted decent woman, and she has the most expressive face --one look from her is worth a full-length treatise on whatever emotion she's conveying.  And Gretchen Mol is perfect as the manipulative vamp who's an amalgam of a child molestation victim, Lady Macbeth, and Jocasta Mom--man, what a brew!  All the other actors are great, too.  The sets are great, the scenes are great, the costumes are great, and oh, yeah, the story (and history) is engaging and compelling.  Watch this series.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|House Of Gold & Bones is in my opinion, their greatest album yet. It may not be as heavy but bands change over time and Stone Sour is progressing into a more mature direction. They grew out of the typical metal scene and are getting better with age. It contains more ballads like \\"Taciturn\\" and \\"The Travelers pt 1 & 2\\" heavier tracks such as \\"RU486\\" and \\"Absolute Zero\\". There's a lot of variety throughout that ranges from heavy metal, alternative rock and post-grunge. There's a good variety of hard rock and ballads, quality songwriting also and it's what today's hard rock and metal bands are lacking in today. Most of my favorite rock and metal bands are from either the '70s or '80s  but this is one of the best rock albums in a long time. Audio Secrecy also had potential but it sounded like it was too rushed and they weren't ready for a change in direction, here they perfected their sound and it's more complete. It's easily their crowning achievement but that's open for debate too.
B0040Z9H5K|2.0|I have to admit I don't want to spend a lot of time on this review just like the producers didn't want to spend a lot of time on making sure someone was writing a decent story for this movie. Special effects only get you so far. The first one was way better, and the G4 Iron Man cartoons are done with much more care than this movie.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I wasn't sure what this book was going to be about! I was really surprised! Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. This book was on my \\"to read\\" list for  months, so glad I finally read it!
B009JNXK88|5.0|I love it. Kinda pointless but so addicting. its a must have! i got ot when it was free! but it is dafinatly worth your dollar
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I constantly wanted to know what was about to take place next!  I enjoy books that keep my interest that way the most.  It also inspired me to try to find out more about what happens to children without family ties in this country.  It is a pretty tough go for so many!
0553573403|1.0|Many people cite the book's darkness and violence and rape as their reason for hating this book. I think I would be ok with all that, as long as I thought the book was well-written, and had interesting characters and an engaging plot-line. I found none of that in this book. The only characters who leapt of the page were Arya and Tyrion; the rest were drab cardboard figures-- even when they were \\"complex\\". Ned, John, Bran, Catelyn just weren't made interesting enough. The plot, which is supposedly intricate,  was boring and predictable and marched along at a snail's pace. The world-building was also lacking, and seemed to have been borrowed-- and borrowed unimaginatively, at that-- from every formulaic fantasy book out there. The old-fashioned style of language felt forced and completely fake. When I finished the book I breathed a sigh of relief. Thank god no one's forcing me to read all the rest of them.
0380807343|3.0|Because my daughter was writng a paper, she was using Coraline as a reference to the genre of like books as Alice in Wonderland and the Narnia books.  This was pretty light.  Also watched the video.  Not impressed.  Perhaps you have to be thirteen.
031620157X|5.0|Chris Colfer did an amazing job on this book.  It was fast-paced, easy to read and very enjoyable.  It can be read by all ages, especially as a family.  The concept of this book isn't new, just look at TV shows like Once Upon a Time or Grimm.  But what makes this story really interesting is it has that innocent charm to it.  Two kids go off on adventure and you immediately connect with the characters and their home life.  You will root for the good characters and perhaps have some compassion for the evil characters.  It has that nostoligic reminiscence to Harry Potter or Chronicles of Narnia and will make you feel like a kid again. I highly recommend this book!
1451627297|5.0|I loved this book, but I have to admit that I'm a bit of a time-travel freak! It's not so much the Kennedy event that drives this story, but the possibility of altering history and saving long-lost lives. It's a little walk down Memory Lane with a romance that's simply timeless. The story loses a little ground as it winds to a close, but the ending is poignant. As big as this book is, I didn't want it to be over. If you liked The Stand, you'll probably like this book.
0316228532|5.0|If Twilight or 50 Shades is more your speed, don't challenge yourself.  Now for readers of actual books such as Lord of the Rings, The Great Gasby, The Giver or even The Notebook, this book isn't for everyone.  It is pretty difficult to read for the average reader because it jumps from one character's story to the next, all relating to this devestating event.  What makes this book so intense is that it deals with real life.  You can pretty much take these characters in these different situations and apply them to any city in any country.  We all know the Howard and Shirleys in our town; people who need to be kicked off their high horse.  We all know the Barrys in our town that try to make it a better place.  We all know the variety of teenagers like Andrew, Fats, and Krystal.  Some of J. K. Rowling's writing style is meant to be read as a Monty Python actor with a sense of British humor.  I will have to admit, I was shocked by the first 100 pages with the words and phrases J. K. Rowling used.  It is also why I liked this book because it is so different from Harry Potter, and I LOVE Harry Potter.  Its a shame that people judge a book by its cover rather than the actual story.  This book just shows that J. K. Rowling can write very different stories and still be so enchanting as an author.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|This episode is so good, and yet so hard to watch at the same time. And I'm not talking about gore, even though there's plenty of that. The action, suspense and awesome character moments that make you care even more for these people, are really ratcheted up this season. And this episode is the standout of all 3 seasons so far. I was shocked by Sofia's fate last season, and caught off guard by the season 2 finale, but this episode really puts them all to shame.<br /><br />They lost 2 good people on this day, and it makes for great television.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|I love Ben Goldacre's writing - and this book is just fantastic. Taking on the pharmaceutical industry, Goldacre offers a detailed account of what is essentially a corrupt system in which we all lose. Shocking stuff, riveting reading.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|This review is by a long time Metallica fan and forever will be my favorite band. This is a great rock album with some amazing riffs and drum workings.  The only song I didn't care for was track 8 and their is 10 songs on this album.  But what did it for me reason I have the album is not just for the music I have it for the lryics, example track 2 End of the line \\"The slave becomes the master.\\"<br />Now a few more examples track 4 The day that never comes \\"Born to push you around\\" track 6 \\"Living dead inside\\" I know a few people who feel that way from time to time, and last example track 7 The Unforgiven 3 \\"How can I be lost when I got no place to go\\" \\"How can I blame you when it's me I can't forgive.\\"  To me it shows actually how the band Metallica has progress from their old days to more deeper meaning both in lryics and the music they put out for their fans.  You won't be able to please every fan with the music you put out but I believe the true Metallica fans will listen with an open mind and make up their own minds about this new album.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|Excellent martial art fighting scenes. Action was pretty intense from beginning to end. Having the plot all take place within the apartment complex was an interesting concept and kept the intensity level pretty high. Be prepared for a ridiculously high body count!
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is basically a live album with two bonus songs No cleaf clover and Human.  I personally found this live album amazing and liked every song on it which is rare for a live album.  If your a fan of Metallica like me and enjoy their older stuff still then this is the live album for you.  It is all their old hits put together onto two cd's, I personally feel the did the right thing in putting this album out for their fans and the die hardcore fans of Metallica should agree with me in liking this album.  Not exculding if you have good speakers in your car it will rock the speakers everytime you play it.  This is a must have for the true fans of Metallica to have in their collection of Metallica albums.
B009JCL58G|2.0|The music in Cloud Atlas is phenomenal and is beyond just a film score.<br />That said, the recording of it could have been a lot better.  Many tracks are filled with clicks, taps and shuffling from the musicians themselves, all of which echo and distract from the actual music.  Having noticed it it's now all I can hear.  c'est la vie!
B000002H33|4.0|Master of Puppets is a really powerful metal album with amazing riffs, drums and so forth.  Battery was an amazing intro to the metal album, the album itself is almost perfect though I didn't care for track 6 because of the lryics.  As for the rest of the album their are mutiple songs to love and enjoy plus you can bang you head to over and over again just like their album And Justice for All.  So if you love or like your metal music then look into buying this album and savoring the music off of it. If your already a Metallica fan like myself then you already have this album in your collection of Metallica albums.
B001P06GX4|5.0|My grandson's love this game - ages 6 - 12.  It keeps their attention for a quite a while. I'm very glad I purchased this game.
B000002H97|5.0|Even though I didn't care for one track, track 10 called The God that failed because of the lryics and I happen to be Catholic.  I still give this album a five star rating because of the music and lyrics.  Enter sandman was a perfect intro to a hard rock album.  For those who don't believe it is a Metallica album they just moved pass the metal music into music with deeper lryics with more personal feel to it.  They did lost most of their die hardcore fans with this album, but gain some new ones with this album.  As for myself this album really hit home for me because of the lryics we all deal with stuff but if we are able to stay true to ourselves then we will be able to overcome the struggle within ourselves.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For all you people putting this game down. There will be more updates for this game allowing many many more things. Just like the P.C. and Xbox360 edition. I myself have the Xbox version and I love it! The people at Mojang are working very hard. Just give them time. Over all I think this is a great game!
B00000FCBC|4.0|Metallica decided to put together some songs they liked growing up by bands they enjoyed listening to and had major infulence on them as they progress as a band.  Total their is 27 cover songs I personally didn't care for 5 songs all out all the covers, they were track 7 on cd 1 and tracks 2,5,11, and 13 on cd 2.  Some of the songs I did enjoy though were on cd 1 Turn the page, Loverman, Astronomy, and Tuesday's gone.  But overall an amazing collection of cover songs redone by a great rock metal band named Metallica.  So if your open minded to another bands doing cover songs then look into this collection of cover songs and see how many of them you enjoy.  As for myself I enjoy 22 out of 27 which is pretty good amount of songs.  But make up your own mind as you listen to the two cd's.  My viewpoint once a Metallica fan always a Metallica fan.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|When Harold Fry decides to visit a dying friend over 600 miles away, he is totally unprepared for the journey--no cell phone, no change of clothing, no transportation. He believes that as long as he is WALKING to his friend, she will live. The people he meets along the way are encouraging, talkative, and inspired by his act. Harold himself has time to evaluate his life, a life he discovers has been well worth living in spite of the sadness he has experienced. Harold will become your good friend, too, and you'll be sorry the journey has to end.
B000002H2H|4.0|Ride the Lightning is another example of good metal music done by a great metal rock band.  The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|...and at the low price of &cent;99 it is still cheaper than downloading this free app of the day when you inevitably start bashing your device into your face and cutting yourself with the broken pieces in an attempt just to feel again...God help you if you paid $1.49...
B000002H6C|5.0|And Justice for All is the perfect metal album for any fan of metal music from start to finish it amazed me with both the lryics and music riffs.  Each song dealt with death or illness, Blackened, One, and Harvest of Sorrow.  Eye of the Beholder has one of best Guitar solo I ever heard so far in my lifetime.  The ones dealing with illness being The Shortest Straw and the Frayed ends of Sanity, and speaking of that song I personally loved the chorus at the begginning of it.  So in closing And Justice for All is an amazing metal album that you can and will bang your head to everytime you listen to it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Works great for identifying local hot spots as well as site surveys for available WiFi channels in places like apartment buildings.
B000002HRE|4.0|For everyone out there this Metallica album is actual rock music, I enjoyed 10 out of 13 songs on the album.  The songs I didn't care for were track 5, 9, and 10.  The rest of the album wasn't metal music because that part of their lives is over, they wanted to embrace something different with a different style of lyrics and music.  I will give you all some examples The memory reains great chorus to the lryics then The Unforgiven 2 \\"Open with your truth\\" \\"Turn the page turn to stone\\" and \\"Wait for you or are you unforgiven 2\\" or Slither \\"Ain't no hero's here\\" and last bad seed enjoy the circus lyrics as part of the song.  So everyone out there make up your own mind if you like or love rock music then you will like most of the this album for real rock music and stay true to being a Metallica fan for as long as possible.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a well done product. Quality graphics, entertaining sounds and music, and responsive controls.<br /><br />For the ignorant folks who continue to down rate amazon apps because they're free on Google play you have to realize that on the play store they are subsidized with ads but here they are not so there is a charge instead and they are ad-free.
B000002HMH|4.0|What we have here is a good rock music album just like their other album reload.  I liked 11 out of 14 songs on this album, I didn't like track 3, 9, and 11.  I liked lryics wise Until it sleeps \\"Where do I take this pain of mine\\" and King Nothing \\"Where is your crown King Nothing.\\"  In the end it doesn't matter what music you like as long as you like music then just listen to this Metallica album with an open mind and open ear and find out the songs you do like off this album because most of it is rock music threw and threw.  So in the end pick this album up and make up your own mind about the music on the album.  As for the true Metallica fans out there they should already own all the albums from Kill em all to Death Magnetic.  I personally love rock music as my main choice, and Metallica always combined rock music and metal together over all the years they been together.  So buy this album sit back and enjoy some good rock music and songs you really like blast them in your car or bedroom speakers.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|The world built around this story is fairly novel (the science is iffy, but whatever). I really enjoyed how the blinders were gradually removed from both the protagonist and the readers as the story unwound. I had fun trying to guess what the truth was as I was reading. This is something like the Stepford Wives meets Lost--and this is a good thing for sure! Get this book and enjoy. There are some plot weaknesses, but nothing to really cry about or that significantly detract from enjoying the experience. I really like the books from this writer and suggest that you put him on your list of authors to watch for...
B007UK83S4|5.0|Very well written and insighful book into the inner workings of a rock legend. Very honest , no holds barred. Well done.
B005CYLG5W|1.0|This is terrible.  I own a regular dvd copy of Roxy Music at the Roxy, Sorry, this is a bootleg.  There is no locatable menu, the dvd extras are gone, the picture is much worse than the regular dvd.  It is a bootleg.
B003KGBISY|5.0|One of the more influential movies comes to life on vivid Blu-Ray. And is the case with the majority of movies in the Criterion Collection, it is the disc to own.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|This album was a complete surprise to me. I didn't know what I was to expect, and it was far from what I've expected. Paul really nailed it though. Completely unique from his previous solo albums, yet still has the signature Paul sound. This album is a lot more jazzy, bluesy than the last few albums and seems to have a more \\"complete\\" sound. Half of the album is instrumental, and half with vocals, which Paul has greatly improved. Emi does keyboards on the album and does an exceptional job. This will definitely be taking Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar off of my most played Gilbert album!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was one of those \\"can't put it down\\" books.  I lost a good bit of sleep because I couldn't stop reading.  The author did a very good job in his descriptions.  Being a veteran, I felt like I was going through training and on missions with him.  He really cranked my adrenalin.  Oh, and contrary to the news stories, Obama DIDN'T shoot Osama.  Hope I didn't need a spoiler alert for that lol.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy Pinterest. I have meet so many like minded creative people and have been exposed to so many great ideas of all the thing I enjoy in my world. I have been able to readily get ideas and recipes and have made many of the projects I have found. I love it!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a lot of fun! I played this for hours without even realizing it. I recommend this highly addictive game!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|good,but not great as it has lots of adds, but hey, it is free.  I actually k like it that u can run down ur coins cuz that insuresbthat I dont spend too much time on it.
0525953728|5.0|I was there. Well, no, but I have been on missions almost like this one. I was a team leader with the 1st Cavalry Division's Long Range Recon Patrol as written up in my book (Above All Else). Our missions were 7 days and 8 nights in duration, with only one day off in between missions. I led these other 4 men out into the jungle to find the enemy. So, the Seals tracked their enemy until they had a chance at getting him. I agree with the writer that Obama, probably playing golf at the time of the beginning of the mission, was called into the situation room when their choppers crossed over into Pakistan. After all, they had three other times in which they could have captured bin Laden but obama refused to give the approval. With such laid back leadership, what were the Seals to expect. Would they receive support when needed? Probably not which left them entirely on their own. Fortunately, they had a good command, with back up choppers in the event anything went wrong. And wrong it went so the other choppers were needed. I felt right at home because I was in such a situation where our choppers were needed as written up in my book (A Troop, 9th Cavalry, The Boldest Cavalrymen the World Has Ever Known). A very good book well worth reading, all about the true story of the Seal and their reaching bin Laden. It takes a lot of courage to write a book about the truth and how command has let the ball drop, where you have no choice but to continue on, hoping beyond hope that all goes well.
B007G92QGO|4.0|While this is a murder story it goes much deeper than that.  It clearly shows how parents see their child in totally different lights.  The book kept me reading almost non stop right till the unexpected end.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel app is a great app to keep updated on the weather wherever you can get a wireless connection!  I love this app when I'm traveling!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I can see why this book series is so popular. The author effectively taps into to very archetypal story lines: cinderella and bad boy redeemed. However, the writing itself is very awkward, repetitive and the plotting is slow. Nevertheless, I liked it...but then I like bad boys.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is actually a great game.  Fast pace, and highly addictive.  Touch controls were way better than expected.  Runs great on my old Droid 2 Global.
B007V4530A|3.0|If you're giving a talk tomorrow and clueless about how to get ready, this is a good crash course. You probably won't need it if you've read Garr Reynolds's \\"Presentation Zen.\\"
B004SUWR2C|5.0|have some time to kill? this game is perfect for that!! very fun to play!! i remember playing this as a kid via actual cards not software, the only negative i have is tournament mode. i have played to the last round and went past 5000 points but it has never ended for me. i started it twice and went to 6500 points the first time and 5500 points the second time. i wish there were some instructions for it, i have looked too. hopefully somebody reading this review can answer my question.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|In the photo, the outer portion looks like a quilted fabric.  It's not.  It's a kind of platic material that feels exactly like a shower curtain.  It even sounds like a shower curtain when you run your hand against it.  The colors are more muddied than the photo.  Again, it brings to mind a shower curtain. Keep in mind that as nice as a good cloth case feels in the hand, cloth will absorb rain water and hold it close to the device; this will repel it.<br /><br />I managed to spill coffee on it the first day, with the Fire in it, and I can say that (A) the Fire was totally protected and (B) the sleeve didn't stain. Top scores for protecting the device, and itself, from my clumsiness.
1451627297|4.0|My three favorite books or stories on time travel are Millennium by John Varley, A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury and of course The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. I now add Stephen King's book 11/22/63. King mentions Bradury's story in this story. This was a great read, but I was left somewhat disappointed by the story near the end. (no spoilers). King could have paved a new road about time travel, but instead expanded on Bradbury's concept of time travel with some new concepts. The disappointment came shortly after the major climax of the story and the following chapter about an alternate 2011 that is contrary to the one we are living in. It was too contrived and unbelievable (I could tell King was getting tired of writing this story at this point). King does rescue his plot ideas regarding time travel at his characters' expense, which made me ask why he invested so much in them in the first place. I felt like Jake Epping/George Amberson and of course Sadie were discarded for the sake of the plot budget balancing. There are a lot of holes in the story that kept me thinking about the many ways in which I would have liked to end it or make the story better myself. Other reviewers who concurred thought this book could have been left open-ended and it would have worked. More should have been done with the \\"Yellow Card Man\\" character. Not sure why he had to be so passive and enigmatic and the character seemed to be lazily rendered. King does come to the rescue of his own writing in the last chapters of this story, but left me wishing that I could have asked him some last questions before he decided to bag this story and send it out to the publisher.... Instead, I feel like I ate a delicious meal, but am still not satisfied, unlike when I read Varley's Millennium. When I read that time travel story I was satisfied and had that great sadness one feels when they reach the end of a great book only because it is the end of a great story. That's how I wanted to feel so badly with King's story. It leaves me thinking of ways his great yarn could have been better. And therein lies the problem with this book. It is so great on so many levels, but just doesn't quite reach that intangible zenith I was expecting that I got from Wells, Varley, and Bradbury. There are lots of great takeaways and King has gotten me back into his books again. I love King's ambition and historical takeaways. I recommend this book despite some of its shortcomings after such an engrossing read.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I think the story and the action are great. It keeps your eyes on the screen to not anything of the dialog.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Fun to see Mcgregor and Blunt in a Brit movie with their Brit/Scot hanging out. Pleasant story with some charm that both deliver well on. See it.
B0087ITC9C|2.0|Unfortunately I was really disappointed in this film from director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forest Gump) because of its length and his use of stagnant shots. He chose to stay on faces, floors and eyeballs for a really long and inappropriate (and sometimes obnoxious) amounts of time. His direction seemed very dull and not as dynamic as most of his other films. It wasn't a fun film to look at, although definitely an interesting subject.<br /><br />The shining points of this film was definitely the performance of Denzel Washington (Unstoppable, Safe House) and his honest portrayal of a man who is a true alcoholic. He is real, he is direct with his intent and most of all you understand the angst of what an alcoholic does to hide his addiction.<br /><br />What makes this film a little different was the fact that this was a pilot of a major commercial airline who saves a plane from crashing while under the influence of over double the legal limit in his blood of an average alcoholic. And yes, he saves the plane in some fantastic flying maneuvering and incredible special effects.<br /><br />Written by John Gatins (Real Steel, Coach Carter) who gave a great series of good scenes and monologues to Denzel, he just didn't fill in the gaps too well, because it was slow and dragging throughout most of the film to the point of boredom.<br /><br />Other stand out performances included Bruce Greenwood ( Star Trek 2009, I, Robot) as the union rep that was sent to defend Denzel's character in order to keep him from going on trial for negligence. Bruce is always sharp and direct in his performances which complimented Denzel in many ways.<br /><br />Don Cheadle (Crash, Iron man 2) also chimes in with a good performance as the lawyer that has to keep Denzel out of jail. Don and Bruce together really understand the issues and compassions that this pilot is going through but also know their job maybe too much to handle.<br /><br />Another noticeably weird, yet extremely humorous performances came from none other than John Goodman (Flintstones, The Artist) who must have had a blast has the hippie who deals in drugs and cures for anyone who has an addiction of any kind. John was giving it his all but overall the character didn't seem to fit the film for me.<br /><br />Overall the film is very slow. Not a lot of camera movement and other than the performances mentioned, when they are performing, it was an interesting movie. However, that said, I would wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray, where you can skip past to long, long, long shots/scenes!us performances came from none other than John Goodman (Flintstones, The Artist) who must have had a blast has the hippie who deals in drugs and cures for anyone who has an addiction of any kind.

0449013634|4.0|Harry Hoe is one of my favorite characters, flaws and worts and all. Its been a great ride.  Hope he will be back.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|A great action flick.  The start was a little slow, but once we move into the girl being taken it is great.  I am beginning to think it is impossible for Liam Neeson to make a bad film.  His acting is always suberb!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I was in between books when this one came to my attention, not one I would normally pick. I read it in less than two days. It monopolized all my free time. The time frames between the past and future was an impressive way of story telling, especially for a new author. The content was foreboding, dark, informative and completely absorbing. I loved the book, and I will be looking for more from Elizabeth Haynes!!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Well done action flick on the MArvel charaters they are true to form and bigger than life/animation.  If you enjoy super hero characters like Marvel you will enjoy this movie.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Just got this unit and it paired quickly with my Denon wireless headset.  I have a classical iPod and I can control everything on the iPod as stated.  So glad I found this item.  No more wires and the inevitable hitting into them and knocking the iPod around.  Woohoo!
0316226424|5.0|<3 I love, love, love it! I ha promised myself that I would buy the books again after all the movies were promoted. And lo and behold, I did. :)<br />The cover is beautiful and I truly treasure this and the Saga.
1423140605|5.0|Great book. My sons and i enjoy reading about Percy Jackson and his friends.  In the process we are learning about Greek and Roman Gods and Goddesses.  We cannot wait for the next book in the series. This story is awesome!!!
B005EVVESM|5.0|Bought this album for Moves Like Jagger...at first only listened that that one track.  After awhile got bored with it and decided to see what else Maroon 5 could do and am now TOTALLY in love with this album.  This is one of the few albums out there that I can listen to all tracks and be impressed all the way through.  Hands down, Maroon 5 is a completely impressive band.  For me Hands All Over is there best album, bar none!  Can't wait to see them in concert next year!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was a well-written, oddly compelling story.  Looking forward to the 2nd story in the trilogy- just hoping that the Kindle price (which is half the bookstore hardcover price) goes down.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Not what I expected from he title but better than I thought it would be. Writer has a great marination
B005IQZB14|5.0|I was with her every step of the way. I cried for her losses, I was furious with her for her stupid choices, but most of all I cheered her for her courage and tenacity. Cheryl Strayed, I admire you. Thank you for sharing your fears and dreams.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Out Go the Lights, Street Jesus, and Oh Yeah are absolutely fantastic, hard-rocking Aerosmith songs.  Any of these songs could have been on their three best albums -- Toys In the Attic (1975), Rocks (1976), and Pump (1989) -- and stood out.  Amazing stuff!<br /><br />LUV XXX, Legendary Child, and Lover Alot are all solid rockers as well.<br /><br />If you are more into ballads, you'll like What Could Have Been Love, We All Fall Down, Another Last Goodbye, and Can't Stop Lovin' You (with Carrie Underwood).<br /><br />All in all, if you're even a casual Aerosmith fan, this record is worth every penny.  If it winds up being their last studio album, Aerosmith has a lot to be proud of.  It's not easy for the same five guys to produce a great rock record more than 40 years after they formed a band!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|This is a must have for any deadmau5 fan. Great album. My father even likes the album, and he isn't even a fan of this type of music.
0425263916|5.0|I love the way Sylvia Day writes. I am so excited for entwined in you to come out may can not come soon enough.<br /><br />Packaging for the book was awesome. Came in pristine condition and i got it a day soon that i was suppose to.
B009JNXK88|5.0|If you like platformers at all, you'll love League of Evil. It reminds me a lot of Super Meat Boy, in that the levels are short and fairly challenging. There are tons of levels as well, so you won't be finishing this anytime soon. There's also a briefcase on every level and a 0-3 star rating based on your time, so completionists will have fun with that. The on screen controls work very well and as a result I got used to them quite quickly. There's only left and right arrows on the left side of the screen and two buttons on the right side, so they're not confusing at all. What I am confused by is the people who say the controls are not good...I found that for a touch screen game, they're some of the best I've seen. The bottom line is that League of Evil is a fun, challenging platformer that's great for long play sessions or short bursts.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is the second white cable that I bought.  Good quality.  Works with my Kindle or my android phone. I would recommend this cable.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Excellent disc. Highly recommended. Songs for every mood. Keep up the great work Richie. Almost as good as Stanger in This Town.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|This app works very well. Allows access to files stored in all parts of memory. Easy to use and fast.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|from the first book. Eva and Gideon's attraction to each other is so intense you can't stop reading...I was sad at the end of the book. I miss them already!!
B005SNMR8W|5.0|I absolutely Love this series, it never disappoints. Recommend to all. Gets better with each episode. This season keeps it going
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I find this series to be hard reading at times. I didnt find it interesting until the last few chapters. But it kept me interested enough to finish it and want to read the next one. I just don't find either Eva or Gidieon very likable. Would recommend the book though
B0088ETCHW|4.0|I'm a newbie to swimming, always had a fear of water since I was a kid. It was great to read about the different types of swimmers and how to overcome the inherent \\"faults\\". I've made some good progress and highly recommend the book. They also have a great website and Mr. Smooth app.
0880796863|5.0|Years ago, I bought the Marseille Tarot Cards. I thought they were nice cards, but each time you study a little bit more about Tarot, you see that those cards are \\"short of meaning\\", I mean, their draws are too simple.<br /><br />I really like this Rider Waite Tarot. Beautiful images, and full of meaning. It really helps you to understand and comprehend the meaning of each one.<br /><br />Love it.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a very good game. At first you think it is easy & simple, but as you progress it get's difficult and you don't want to quit trying to get to the next level. If after a few tries at a level to replay, you can't do it, you have to go back to the first level.<br />It really is fun & addicting.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|waiting for energy is so rediculously long. I am not going to pay  real money to play a game thats supposed to be free.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Kind of predictable and repetitive, but still a good titillating read.  Personally was annoyed with Christian's character, insanely controlling!  This is a modern day college girls fantasy.

B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is a great way to keep in touch with my grandchildren who live in another state and be able to see how they are growing.  Anyone who has friends or relatives in another state I suggest they get skype to keep in touch.
1469984202|4.0|This book is compelling and rivoting.  The storyline is fascinating and plausible.  This is a very difficult book to put down, once you get going with it.  My only hesitation in giving it 5 stars is that the level of detail was sometimes a bit long-winded for me.  I like some detail...but balanced out with a lot of action when I am reading Sci-Fi... Authors who get it right for me: Joe Haledman (The Forever War) and most recently Patrick T. German (Progenitor: Palak and the Sky Gods). They both kept me turning pages quickly, not too mired down in any extraneous detail. Wool - Omnibus Edition is a great read, nonetheless and I will definitely seek out more books by this author.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I went to watch the movie in the theatre and was truly satisfied with this movie. I recenlty purchased it on DVD and has watched it about 20 times; I can't seem to get enough of it. Sandra Bullock and the cast did a great job with portaiting the Touhy family. It just does my heart good to know that there are people in this world that does good deeds for people.
B00170DEM8|5.0|I love this old movie and I watch it every year along with White Christmas.  I've always had an interest in the old singing and dancing broadway type movies and have started collecting them.  If you like Bing Crosby, you will like Holiday Inn and White Christmas both.
B002K99P7S|4.0|It is a pretty good movie, but not my favorite. Mostly a back story for a couple of the characters from the other movies.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is a good movie for all ages. It is very cute and very funny. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i luv this game so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is so much fun to play i play it all the time :)
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Patricia Cornwell is always one of my favorite authors. The Bone Yard was a couple of steps down the ladder from her usual works. It was predictable to say the least. I still like the character, Kay Scarpetta a strong well educated and believable woman.  Kindle reader, Bill Davis
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a lot of fun makes. you. think. a really addictive game that is fun for any &agrave;ge. fun for the whole family
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The  story is very good although it seems to be  very confusing at times. She has 2 people that have  been found dead and one that is still missing. She is trying to connect the dots to see if they are connected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. I don't see what the what the whole &quot;glitch&quot; thing is. this app is gr8 and works fine.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a stand alone Scifi thriller.  Good plot and good pacing.  But I don't necessarily see it as a good prequel to alien.  There was too much that could have been done better as a nod to that particular franchise.  Hopefully the next one will tie in better.

B0096DFBZQ|2.0|It was fun but it was very hard to control the guy and if you want a different character you can't because they are all locked.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I read the review for book and decided to purchase for my Kindle. Its a fun story about a mysterious book store that never closes and is involved in a secret society. I liked the story but it wasn't a page turner. I enjoy a book that makes me late for bed! This one I ended up finishing while reading another book that had much more back bone to it. I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it but it's not a book I would read twice.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Sometimes you just can't put this game down. I find myself playing until I can completely beat a level. My children love it too!:)
B009JNXK88|5.0|The League of Evil takes me back to the 8-bit days of old. All you need to do in order to enjoy game-play is pick it up and go. The only difference is that you aren't forcing a cartridge to work and pressing reset a hundred times!!!

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I found these books by accident but I'm glad I did.  I like the story line and the characters.  I'm looking forward to the next book.  I kind of wish there was a more concrete ending instead of cutting off in what seems mid chapter.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend. This was my first book by Albom but won't be my last. This is a fast easy read.  It will make you stop and think about our time on earth & what we have to show for it.  Live each day to the fullest- Tomorrow is a gift!

First he killed a zombie Shane now his mother after seeing his new sister/brother ripped from her. Going to be a pretty interesting season the rest of the way.
0385742886|4.0|The Kill Order By James Dashner is the much anticipated prequel to the Maze Runner Series and sets a new kind of standard for all dystopian novels. Not only did Dashner do a good job in the Maze Runner by he did an exceptional job in The Kill Order. You get a glimpse of the future and how the world as we know it (in the previous books) is today. You get all of the background knowledge of how the flare started. You know how people fit into the other books.<br /><br />The Kill Order starts with a village getting attacked and the flare breaking out. Then throughout the entire plot of the book you get short little flashbacks of how Mark and Trina got to the point where they are. The world was in mass chaos and they have survived a whole year. Mark and Trina were saved by a man named Alec and from there their lives are much easier. He helps them get food, clothing, and shelter. He is what makes it possible for them to be alive.<br /><br />The only downfall of this book is that there isn't really anything new. The typical fight with the crazy people and then barely surviving. Questions that don't get answered and people getting mad. I was expecting some big mystery to be solved and I wouldn't have any more questions, but that's not the case. What happened to the little girl when she went through the flat trans and why didn't Mark and Trina go with her? Will Trina remember Mark again or did she go crazy for good? All of these questions and they will never get answered. Maybe there will be a second to the prequel? I can only hope.<br /><br />I rated this book four stars because it was a good read. It was action packed and you never know what's going to happen next. It would have been a five star if it would of had a better ending where I understood everything but for now it left me hanging and it is only getting four stars. I would definitely recommend this novel to everyone who has read the series. You will gain more background knowledge and it's just an all around fun read!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am an avid reader and I think with out doubt that this is a very good book. (minor spoilers ahead)<br />Now... the plot is sharp and griping, the descriptions are a bit weak and long, the characters are simple on the surface.. but watch it, the villain is just someone following a strict protocol and the hero is an immature violence provoking rebel, at some point it is difficult to tell who is the real devil.<br />Now.. why five stars? simple, this book makes you reflect on your life purpose; in fact, a silo is not very different from our modern debt and media controlled society.
0439023513|1.0|Thrilling, fascinating, enchanting, and even romantic: the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins is best known for its ability to grab its audience by entertaining them with a futuristic and action filled plot. As I was reading the first two books of this series I wondered and waited in anticipation to read the third and final book. What is going Katniss going to become? Which handsome boy will she choose to love? Will Katniss and Peeta head into the Hunger Games arena again? Questions and predictions whirled through my thoughts as I finally opened the third and final book: The Mockingjay. As I made my way through the pages of this book I found myself unexpectedly disappointed.<br />  **Spoiler Alert**<br /> My first disappointment was the characters. Peeta was my favorite character in the first couple books because he seemed to bring hope and comfort to a very violent book. As for the third book, it seemed like he vanished right out of the book. His smile, shy compliments, undying love for Katniss, and even his physical being: He was no longer a main character because he was held up in the Capitol.  He was captured by the Capitol and held captive until three quarters of the book was over. Also, in my opinion, the author, Suzanne Collins, didn't quite make it clear exactly why the Capitol choose to do this. Was it to mess with Katniss? Was it just another war strategy? He was too big of a character in the first two books to just have him be actionless in the third book. Gale is the second character that I didn't like as much in the final book. Katniss and Gale had too much of a history to just throw it all away at the end of the book. Katniss blamed Gale for the death of Prim but who knows if the bombs were the ones Gale made? It just wasn't a very believable break up. Katniss ended up with Peeta, the one who hated her throughout the whole book, and they \\"lived happily ever after.\\"<br /> I was also disappointed with how the book was so rushed. One minute Peeta wasalmost dying in the Capitol with no real explanation, then Prim died within one sentence, and then you turn the page and you find out another main character, Finnick, is also dead. It was hard for me to read and get into because I found myself constantly confused and wondering why things are happening the way they are. The relationship between Katniss and Peeta in the end also felt rushed. Collins didn't show me how they were feeling through their emotions, thoughts, or their actions. Peeta hated Katniss and what seemed like the next day, they loved each other and were planning a future together.<br /> Overall, even though I was disappointed, I love the author, loved the characters in the first two books, thought it was extremely creative, and it was fun to see how it all played out!

1416955070|5.0|A group of demon hunting soilders who are trained at a young age and after accomplishing a task they recieve a mark that gives them some very special powers, that allow them to make fighting demons easier. A young girl by the name of Clary who has had no training and had little to no knowledge of that world is caught up in the battle between the shadowhunters and the demons. Little does she know that this never ending war that she has caught herself up into goes much deeper then anyone has expected.<br /><br />I thought the book was fantastic! The cleverness that Cassandra Clare uses between the characters is unmatched. The Harry Potter series does not compare to the Mortal Instruments series. It was very easy to get into the book. Once  you start reading you can't stop. I don't want to ruin anything for future reader. So to sum it all up it's an amazing book I would recomend it to anyone who's looking for a good series that they really want to get into.<br /><br />It is a very addicting series with intense fights romance suspence, everything a great book should have wrapped up in two covers. An intense book with a very suprising twist too the ending one that no one could have predicted to happen. If you wish to know what happened at the end pick up the book and begin reading.
B000093NLE|1.0|A solid release from Radiohead, and I bought the vinyl based on reviews that stated this recording was best heard on 45RPM vinyl. That may be true, but there is no way for me to tell, as every copy of the 2 LP Capitol Vaults issue I have received has massive pressing problems. From \\"scratchy\\" (like an old, uncared for record), to little clicks and pops, this is a complete disaster. I am very familiar with this recording on CD, and I know there are naturally occurring scratchy sounds and other various effects inherent in the recording, but the sounds on the record are above and beyond these.<br /><br />I don't want to bother my poor seller anymore, who has graciously replaced every copy I have complained about. This is strictly the pressing plants fault, and it's sad they can't or won't address the issue. They can't even have their employees put the record sleeves into the album jacket without forcing them in and causing them to be mangled up.<br /><br />This unfortunately is endemic of many modern vinyl pressings. There seems to be no quality control, which is made more outrageous by the fact customers pay twice what a CD costs for most vinyl albums..so it is truly money wasted. The fact that this is a 180gram \\"audiophile\\" recording just adds insult to injury.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn does a great job of keeping you in suspense and guessing up until the very end. I also especially like how she details and describes the character.  By the end of Dark Places, I felt like I was rooting for the good guy and booing the bad guy!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie was a little far fetched. It seems to be very popular nowadays to demonize the corporate world. Cinematically, it was AWESOME!
030759565X|5.0|I adore Deb's blog, I've made countless recipe's from there and so, when Deb shared news of her forthcoming cookbook I immediately pre-ordered mine. Why? Not because I need a new book but because I knew it'd be great - easy to cook from, full of tips, suggestions for how to tweak the dishes, and fun to read.  Deb is fun. If you read her blog you come to like her... the book is the same. She's a kitchen friend. So, maybe I didn't need a new cookbook, but I needed this one.  It does not disappoint. The recipes are fun, interesting and doable in my normal nyc kitchen. What's more, with Deb's commitment to utility, she includes notes for most recipes (all? - I didn't check) about what can be prepared in advance or what can be frozen. I would love to take it with me for a weekend in the country - the simplicity of the directions make this a fun book to cook.<br /><br />Very useful.  Very beautiful.  Very well organized. Very glad to have it.
B0078XGEK2|4.0|Everyone should read this book, especially now. Many wonderful insights to help deal with frustration and disappointment and how to be balanced and happy. It may be time for us to grow up, realize that life isn't supposed to be easy but it calm still be wonderful if we accept challenges and embrace change.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|For me...<br /><br />...this effort is on par with or better than any series I have seen to date. It's a red herring festival. The character development is inspired...story structure is direct and void of anything that doesn't move things forward. As a viewer I'm utterly compelled because the characters are deep and even though they are in a fantastic context, I relate to them. The writing is not afraid to drive full throttle toward a brick wall and then escape through a crack in the mortar.<br /><br />Clair Danes is sexy and brilliant, and if that isn't enough, I'm interested beyond that point to empathize with her because she is tragically flawed and vulnerable. I want her to overcome the obstacle of her affliction to gain, not only her objective as a guardian of national security, but also as a human that strives to validate herself through the filter of bi-polar a experience.<br /><br />Damian Lewis portrays a seamless combination of contradiction. At one time he is a human being with reflection and a strong sense of self and family, and then again, he is also a robotic executioner and the line between the two is invisible.<br /><br />Couple this with the sense these two opposed characters are somehow connected on many levels in an improbable circumstance, I'm left with an intense compulsion to find out how things resolve.

B0053ZOQMK|1.0|For a story about a lizard sheriff, it was very gritty.  It wasn't pleasant to watch, like an animated movie usually is.  I don't mind movies going outside of the norm, and in fact, I appreciate that, but there weren't any characters that I could identify with or that I felt had any redeeming qualities about them.  Even the hero seemed like too much of an antihero to get behind.  If you watch it, think of it more like a real western like True Grit instead of a cute animated movie.  Because this movie certainly didn't achieve cuteness.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It took me awhile to get into this app, and thanks to some helpful hints Pinterest sent to my email, I was able to begin pinning and creating new boards. It's fun to track the followers you attract, and find new things to pin from their boards. One unexpected benefit is an amazing wealth of money-saving tips, creative ideas, and incredibly good and healthy recipes (my husband is loving all the good dinners). Once I log in, it's hard to quit. I love it!

B008BRC7BE|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of Deep Purple or Back Sabbath and/or the album BORN AGAIN, probably the most under appreciated Sabbath release will most definatley enjoy this collaboration. Not only was it done for a good cause but it features other great icons of that Gillian and Iommi time such as Nikko McBrain and Jason Newsed, just to name a few. Gillian does not have the pipes he used to as you can see on the songs that were re-recorded but it still brings back great memory and is produced well. You also get a lot of raw unreleased music, most notably the last track which is basically just a blues jam session taken from some remote venue early in their careers.<br />******One of the best features of this purchases is the paragraph or 2 that is laid out explaining what was going on in their lives at that time and how many of these classics came to be. a la TRASHED.<br />One can only wonder what more creative genius could have been createdif these two masterminds were able to sustain a better relationship in their prime
B000WAEK0E|5.0|This is a wonderful 3 CD collection of Van Morrison's music - I can listen to it over and over again.  Well worth purchasing.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|UPDATE (12/23/12): I was very excited when the latest update happened and it seemed like my concern about switching between Agenda and other views would be solved. They even included an option to do it the \\"old\\" way or the \\"new\\" way. MAJOR BUMMER: it still doesn't work!!!! If I use the weekly or monthly view and I go into the future and then want to look at the Agenda view for the same time, it takes me back to Today. Same result whether or not the new checkbox is checked! I will have to keep anxiously waiting for each update to see if it gets fixed. (I even check the updates in Google which is not where I bought it from because it seems those updates happen sooner.) I would lower the number of stars because they teased us, but at least they recognize the need. CAN THEY FIX IT????<br /><br />I've used this app for over a year and it is absolutely the BEST calendar app for Android EXCEPT for one major design issue that keeps me from being able to use it as my only calendar app. If you're in the \\"Agenda\\" view and you scroll forward in time and then change to any other view, the calendar will always take you back to \\"Today\\" rather than wherever you left off scrolling. And if you're in the month, week or day views and you scroll forward and then go to the Agenda view, it still takes you back to \\"Today\\". If I wanted to think about \\"Today\\", I would have been on this week or this month at least, not months in the future!<br /><br />I've raised this with the developers several times, but there's been no change. There's no logic to thinking about some date in the future and then being forced to scroll a second time in a different view to get to the same place. So I continue to use the stock calendar app for looking at the agenda view.<br /><br />I would give the app a 5-star review (or 6 or 7) if it weren't for this problem. The flexibility of how to view things and select calendars and the choices for how widgets look and act are great. But I guess I've given up waiting fora fix from the developer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoy reading this second part. I like the characters and very well writing.<br />It' s driving me crazy waiting for  the 3rd book so I'm still in love with Gideon.
0812982622|4.0|Generally, I think that people control their own fates, but in a country as repressive as North Korea, maybe not.  Jun Do (John Doe?) grows up in an orphanage and then finds himself buffeted from one bad situation to another.  Along the way, however, he manages to spend a year in a school where he learns English and joins a delegation of diplomatic imposters who travel to Texas.  His exposure to American culture serves him well, especially in the second half of the book.  In a nation where a single comment can cause someone to disappear, and women routinely find themselves with replacement husbands chosen by the state, Jun Do takes the place of Commander Ga, who is married to the beautiful actress Sun Moon.  North Korea's Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il, is the scriptwriter for all of Sun Moon's films, and he obviously scripts and directs the lives of all his citizens, who live in constant fear and whose knowledge of the outside world is only as accurate as the propaganda that blares from the loudspeakers in their homes.  One of the main characters in the second half is a prison interrogator who lives with his parents.  His parents must be constantly vigilant, aware that their son could turn them in for the slightest infraction; they behave like robots in his presence, never divulging any personal opinions that might be construed as seditious.  The best that the North Korean people can hope for is survival, but for what?  Physical torture, famine, loss of loved ones?  The regime recognizes that there is a strong sense of comradeship among the people that can be used as a deterrent to defection.  If someone defects, his friends and family will suffer the consequences.  Therefore, a defection has to be camouflaged as death or kidnapping or whatever.  It's hard to conceive of such a society, but the author uses vivid imagery to draw us into the horror.  One section describes some of the things the protagonist eats to keep from starving, and I found that section even harder tostomach than the physical brutality.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was even better than the 1st. I wonder what will happen next, I can't wait to read the next one!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I must say I was a more than a little skeptical about this book after reading the differing views and thought to myself what the heck the only way I will know is unless I read it for myself. I was not disappointed, I absolutely loved it! The emails and text between Christian and Anna was hilarious and had me laughing outright at times.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! It is great. You can also download other games just like this one! It is a great game for kids and adults. Considering my parents are 38 and 39, they love it and me a 13 yr old. Our whole family has it and loves it. I say download it and have a blast!!!(:
B009K0P10K|3.0|The quality in streaming is excellent.  The storyline is a bit slow too many repeats from last season break-up get back together.  It more like a day time soap opera.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Very interesting way to present the story!  It hooks you and pulls you in.  Lee is  compelling and then horrifying.  Cathy/Catherine is really strong, even with her issues - even when no one believes her.  She knows her story is unbelievable.  I thought I might scream out loud at the airport scene.

B009A87Z6U|4.0|While it may not be up to the usual Bond standard, Quantum of Solace is a very entertaining action flick that is highly underrated and unfairly judge. Perhaps a lot of people were turned off by a Bond sequel, but I personally liked seeing the continuation of Casino Royale. It was a change of pace and I felt like it was a story worth telling. Most of the films downfalls are, unfortunately, victims of the writer's strike and MGM's unstable position. Trying to shoot a movie that doesn't even have a completed script is never a good idea, but I feel like the creative team did the best with what they could. Craig is, again, terrific as Bond, and portrays the character with a newfound sense of revenge and hostility. I found the story behind the Quantum of Solace to very engaging and there's a couple chase scenes that will leave your palms sweaty.

B0083EY9EI|4.0|I'm thrilled that I purchased this album.  I saw it as a featured Amazon mp3 deal, and I only knew two songs from the listings.  After listening to the samples though, I had to buy it! The songs are catchy and the lyrics are heart-felt. I'll certainly be looking into more music from Sande.
1432794426|5.0|You have to read this informative book written by dr Karen Moriarty. There are more than 200 sources and Thomas Mesereau, who lived close to Michael Jackson for a long time during his trial 2005, has contributed a great deal to make this book real and trustworthy.There are also many behind the scenes stories from people who had the great honor to meet him. The book is filled with love for the man who gave his all to make this world a better place.<br />I highly recommend it!!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Approaches an age-old subject in a fresh way. I do not have enough relevant knowledge on the subject to tell you this book is flawless, but for me, a history buff with an economics education, it introduced enough new information and new points of view to remain a page-turner the entire way through. This book is both interesting and informative, I would recommend it to anyone with even a casual interest in why the world developed the way it did, particularly as it relates to inequality.

B008WCP2PG|2.0|So I was very excited to watch Magic Mike with my girlfriends because not only is it supposed to feature sexy men dancing around scantily clad but I'd also heard good reviews about it from others. Happily I rented it and brought it home for all of us to feast our eyes.<br /><br />I was nearly bored to tears.<br /><br />It seems to be a movie about nothing but bad choices and while the dance sequences can be entertaining (It's Raining Men) there was nothing about the story that hooked me. I realize a story about strippers wouldn't have an intensive plot but COME ON! I found myself looking for the scenes with Matt and Joe more than the lead males (Channing and the \\"Kid\\") and the longer I stared at the screen the more I realized that there really isn't a plot. (spoilers to follow)<br /><br />PLOT SYNOPSIS:<br /><br />Channing Tatum wants to build furniture. He can't get a loan cause he has bad credit. He works a few jobs but the most important seems to be a stripper in Tampa. He makes a friend in \\"the Kid\\" and starts crushing on the Kid's sister all the while screwing this psychology student that doesn't seem to have a real place in the plot other than being his friend with benefits. Meanwhile the Kid does the trashy star thing and gets into bad behavior and drugs. Mike (Channing Tatum) bails him out and the movie ends with him hooking up with the Kid's sister after giving up 10k of his savings and quitting his job as a stripper. He's no further toward his dreams than when he started. In fact he takes about five steps back just to hook up.<br /><br />Like I said - this movie seems to be about making bad choices and the only people I really wanted to see (Joe and Matt) didn't get nearly enough screen time. Dear God make it stop! This was a horrible movie and even for a soft thrill movie the flesh was not nearly enough to save the weak plot and make me over look the dance scenes that were clearly not done by the movie's star.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett at his best. We get to experience WWI through the eyes of his wonderful characters. Ken Follett brings history alive like no other. I am now reading Winter of the World the second book in the trilogy. His rich, strong characters are once again being tested as the world is plunged into WWII. I highly recommend both books.

B000T433CO|5.0|This movie is still heart warming after many times of watching it. I always find optimism and hope renewed. Love is a very strong emotion and this movie has tons of it. Amazon comes through every time I want something in my CD library.
B007THA4FI|1.0|There was not one character in this book who was likeable (well, maybe Mary). So who cares what happened to them? If people can change as quickly as these characters did at the end of the book, why didn't someone simply set them straight years earlier?
B000SW2F6M|5.0|Well worth watching. The cinematography and story line are amazing to see unfold.  A movie you can watch again and again and never grow tired of it.  The director's cut adds more to the story so would recommend that version to see what was left out/changed.
B0090EKRKU|3.0|I watch movies like this to enjoy them. Unfortunately, this movie was just too heavy to really enjoy. I realize that the message is conservation, I get it. But they pounded it too hard. Lost some of the magic that Seuss is famous for.
B000ION79Y|1.0|Steven Seagal plays Marshall Lawson, a commander of an elite military unit, in the 2008 direct-to-DVD Attack Force. While in Paris, three of his soldiers are brutally murdered in their hotel room. He starts his own investigation into their deaths with the help of his much younger girlfriend, Tia, and his military friend Dwayne. He learns that the soldiers deaths are linked to a military drug called CTX, in which Tia was one of the original scientist that helped create it. Whoever takes the CTX becomes an unstoppable killing machine.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Seagal fan and it has been awhile since I have seen one of his movies, but Attack Force has to be the worst. The plot is unrealistic and confusing. The fights scenes are ridiculous, the acting is laughable, and half of Seagal's lines are dubbed due to the script being changed after the movie was filmed. Attack Force is one of the worst movies ever made.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This fictional novel is written in the gendre of a Mitchner.  Extremely entertaining with lots of historical facts.  As a biography fan, I found myself transported back to the tragedy and heroism of the 1930's and 1940's.  Follett gave me new insights into the political ramifications of this turbulent period.  It is a great and entertaining read that I would recommend to anyone.
B007PEIHKE|4.0|I ordered HT702 ATA for voip.ms account. The performance is very good. Setup is easy. However, there are some small bugs of the device and firmware.<br /><br />1. You should leave port 2 untouched even though you do not use it. If you disable port 2, port 1 will not work. I think this is a bug of the firmware. I spent quite sometime to figure out this issue before I successfully setup the device as I only use one port.<br /><br />2. There is a static noise with the Uniden phone. It is a little better with the Panasonic phone but I can still hear the noise. However, using the Uniden phone on Nettalk adapter does not have any static noise.<br /><br />In general, using HT702 with voip.ms is very good. The sounds at both end are very good. The latency is almost ignorable. If the device can improve the above two bugs, I'd like to give it a solid 5-star.<br /><br />One thing I like voip.ms is that it provides several servers in different regions in the U.S. and Canada. You can choose the one near your location so that the latency is minimal. Many other companies are either good for the east or the west, but not both, because their servers are located in only one region. U.S. and Canada are so big! The signal traveling between the east and west needs time, which is not good for VOIP. As an example, I tested in California, it takes only 34ms to ping losangles.voip.ms, while 110ms to newyork.voip.ms. So the Los Angeles server is perfect for me. However, for people living in the east coast, the New York server should be their choice.<br /><br />After one month, I noticed the static noise is sometimes intolerable even with the Panasonic phone. Anyone who considers buying Grandstream product should be aware of this kind of noise. I think their design has a serious flaw on this issue which is small for the product but very important for customer's experience. By googling, I see a lot of complains about the products from Grandstream regarding the white noise. It looks like this is a general issue of Grandstream products.
B002IPG400|4.0|Very difficult reading.  Jane Austen sentences long and convoluted at times.  However, I love reading about that English era so I stuck with it and enjoyed. Austen certainly has insight into human nature and as you read, you will recognize the traits and apply them to people you know.
0307341550|4.0|This was NOT the best book ever, but it entertained me and held my attention until I was done. Unlike Gone Girl, there was no real \\"twist\\" here other than an unlikely suspect - but not unexpected in this particular story. As well, two of two Gillian Flynn books now have had a \\"type\\" for the \\"bad guy\\", and if Dark Places ends up with the same type villain, I won't be reading more. I'd rather be surprised (Somewhat??) with who-dunnit, which was the beauty of Gone Girl.<br /><br />Come on, Flynn. Don't let me down with Dark Places.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"dark places\\", Sharp Objects was a pretty dark story with no real happy ending for anyone. The protagonist is someone you want to root for, but you soon realize she has very deep problems and issues... ones which aren't easy to overcome in real life, and aren't overcome in this story. And so, when this story is over, there is no real cathartic release. Just this horrible, dark feeling about life and humanity.<br /><br />It gets 4 stars for being a great paperback murder mystery, but that is as far as I'll give credit for in this case.
1401937519|5.0|If you only read one book this year, let this one be it. If you only read one book your whole life, this one contains everything you need to know. This quote from page 166 sums it up: \\"Needing certainty shackles my potential for the unexpected. Feeling I don't know, or Let's see what happens, allows my expanded self to provide answers and solutions that may be completely serendipitous and outrageously synchronistic. When I step into the realm of ambiguity I'm really at my most powerful. Letting go of all previous beliefs, disbeliefs, dogma, and doctrines puts the infinite universe at my disposal and works to give me the best possible outcome for  my life. This is where I receive the most internal clarity. It's where magic happens.\\" I couldn't say it better myself, although I did my best to express it without the benefit of an NDE in my book available exclusively on Amazon. Thank you Anita!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I'm a big fan of Ken Follett and somewhat of a history buff.  Needless to say, I enjoyed Winter of the World.  So interesting to read about historical events happening from different perspectives.
B009JNXK88|3.0|the tiltle says it all. it was a fun little game that will keep you busy for probably hours but onnthe kindle fire it kept freezing and glitching and lagging on me. I would reccomend it because it is fun but to me itbis glitchy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is quick and easy to use and not hard to learn.  it has some really cool pictures on there and peaple post really funny stuff on there I hope if you get this app you will enjoy it as much as I have. get it!!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This Game is a lot of fun but is very additive. hope you have a lot of free time. yep yep.
B008Q09K2U|1.0|I enjoyed the previous John Corey novels but this one was a disapointment.  There's not a whole lot to the plot and the characters are very one dimensional.  Kate Mayfield, who was a decently sketched character in the previous novels was the token woman with no individual personality. Throw in a few stereotyped fundamentalist maniacs and a wise cracking cop and that's pretty much it.  This novel was kind of a slog to get through and reminded me more of Cathedral, which I did not enjoy, than of some of Demille's more recent page turners.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Although this app truly makes me hate mornings, it's only because i know it will get me up. This really is the only thing that will get me up everyday. I don't fret about waking up late anymore.

B005T87QCI|4.0|Needs to have a few more options available; having different players and levels. My 4yr old and 8 yr old love this app and have had it for over a month- and still love it. The biggest draw back is the shadow boxing they do once the game is over. They love Real Steel.

B000ICZD4I|1.0|We turned it off after 10 minutes or so. The film quality was really mediocre. Also the jokes were pretty mediocre. Not the best movie.....
0451213092|5.0|Ken Follett never disappoints. have read about 10 of his books, and they are all absolute page turners.<br />From Wings of an Eagle, to Fall of Giants, he always finds brand new subject to write about.<br /><br />As soon as I buy any of his books my friends want to borrow them and are just as enthusiastic about his writings as I am<br />I do even own his brand new one 'Tales of Winter' or some such title, but it is already being borrowed, before I have even read it.<br />All good<br />Regards<br />Elizabeth Williams
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I learn so much reading Nelson Demille's books, and the Panther is no different.  The Middle East region of Yemen is a place I do not know much about.  The customs and way of thinking is so different from the western mind!  He explains everything so thoroughly, and though sometimes the story seems strung out, when it is finished I want more!

B0092C2X7U|1.0|Horrible game. I actually want them to pay me $1.50 for me giving this thing a chance. It lasted less than 2 minutes.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It wasn't as good as the first two, but it was still good. I would recommend it to anyone, but they have to read books 1 & 2 first to follow the story.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Stone Sour has officially risen to the occasion... The self titled was fantastic, but this is even better. I honestly am mind blown by the one star reviews I'm reading... I do not understand how a fan of hard rock would find this album lackluster. When compared with the rest of Stone Sour's discography, \\"House of Gold and Bones\\" is a resounding improvement and a shining example of modern rock done right. Unless you've already decided to hate this album at all costs, I recommend you give it a good, hard listen... It won't disappoint.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I cant buy it or my dad gets mad please make a free version. I would def. dnld it!!!!!!!!!! please make ot free I really want this app!!!!

B009CPEOC4|5.0|This blu-ray has outstanding sound quality and the video has a higher than normal bit rate. The bit rate was pretty consistant at around 38 mbps. I would have liked to see the full length videos of her songs in the same sound quality, but they're only in stereo. The movie about her life was interesting and very entertaining. Glad to have this in my collection.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|it sucks. there is no point to this game. Im glad it was free I would definitely not buy it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved watching this movie n the dynamic of all the actors/actresses...it was entertaining and hit my funny bone all the while. Not to mention all the hot actors...hold that thought, I need to get a fan.  =)
034580404X|5.0|I purchased the trilogy from Amazon and what a good read it was. Could not put the books down once I began reading. I was very frustrated and angry with the first book as I didn't think a woman should be treated like that, but as I read the second and third books the whole story began to form and removed my frustrations/anger from the first book. Good read. I'm going to re-read them to make sure I didn't miss anything. You won't be sorry you bought the trilogy.
B0058UXHHK|2.0|This book started out to be so good. The characters where well written and you could feel for the main character. But the ending was so disappointing. It built is self up and then it was over and you were left saying what just happened. It just ended with no explanations as to why all of this happened.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|Great new mixes by Mark Linett and his crew. The separation is decent and it isn't covered up by too much reverb, which is often the problem with this type of tweeking. Interestingly, In the Back of My Mind does NOT feature the double-tracked Dennis vocals we've all grown up with, but a single voice of heartache, providing us with a different experience altogether. This song has often intrigued me, but somehow I could never \\"hear\\" it - but it is clear now. Great job guys!!
0345803485|1.0|I dont understand why this book is so popular. Its totally a waste of time reading it. The pace of story is slow, super slow. The story itself is unconvincing and childish. It puts lots of efforts describing those sex scenes - which is repetitive - (Anna \\"flushs\\" a thousand times in the book and continues \\"bite lips\\"). Excludes those sexes, the book is empty (it is already quite empty with sexs).
B0085RQLXK|3.0|It sure seems like a long time since the last Aerosmith album. The last time the \\"Toxic Twins\\" and comp. released an album of new material, George W. Bush had just been sworn in as the forty-third president of the United States, Limp Bizkit was still popular and Pierce Brosnan was still 007. After the forgettable \\"Just Push Play,\\" (2001) came the surprisingly good blues covers album \\"Honkin' on Bobo\\" (2004) and then a lot of well documented infighting, Steven Tyler's misguided venture into \\"American Idol,\\" rumors of Billy Idol replacing Tyler, two very good Joe Perry solo albums, and then, finally, a brand new album \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" (2012).<br /><br />I really wasn't sure about what to expect from this new album. In all honesty, with the exception of \\"Honkin' On Bobo,\\" I haven't really liked anything Aerosmith has released since \\"Pump\\" (1989). From the 1990s on up, the band seemed to be complacent and lazy, rehashing the same tired rockers and ballads, album after album. \\"Get a Grip\\" (1993) and \\"Nine Lives\\" (1997) had a couple of good songs, but the albums were overly slick and polished. Then the bottom came out with that godawful song from the \\"Armageddon\\" soundtrack and the very mediocre \\"Just Push Play.\\" It was as though they had transformed from an iconic, legendary hard-rock band into a geriatric Bon Jovi--music for soccer moms and children.<br /><br />After two decades of sup-par material, I was very pleased to read to read that Aerosmith had once again teamed up with Jack Douglas, who produced such Aerosmith classics as \\"Toys in the Attic\\" (1975) and \\"Rocks\\" (1976). I was equally disappointed when I read the liner notes to see that Diane Warren, Desmond Child and others co-wrote (or in Warren's case, wrote) some of the songs.<br /><br />I found \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" a hard album to rate, simply because it's very uneven. There are songs that are great; The album starts out with a trio of outstanding rockers. \\"LUV XXX,\\" which Julian Lennon provides some great harmonies, \\"Oh Yeah,\\" which is a true classic Aerosmith rocker, and the poppie-but-rocking \\"Beautiful,\\" get the album off to a great start. \\"Legendary Child\\" isn't anything groundbreaking, but it works and features a pretty sweet solo. \\"Street Jesus\\" is a pretty solid, old-school, boogie-blues rocker, \\"Freedom Fighter,\\" (feat. Joe Perry on vocals) with its' thoughtful lyrics is memorable, while \\"Something\\" (also with Joe Perry singing) is one of the album's best songs. It's a little off-beat, and it can be described as \\"Beatle-esque,\\" with its' Sgt.Pepper/Magical Mystery Tour-era background harmonies.<br /><br />So, seven of the album's fifteen tracks are very good, but then, then there are the ballads. Those dreaded Aerosmith ballads...and there are a lot of them on this album, a total of six!--\\"Tell Me,\\" \\"What Could Have Been Love,\\" \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You,\\" (with Carrie Underwood?!) \\"We All Fall Down,\\" \\"Closer\\" and \\"Another Last Goodbye.\\" They can be reviewed with just two simple words--garbage & awful. The album's other two songs \\"Lover Alot\\" and \\"Out Go the Lights\\" are decent but nothing special.<br /><br />If you are an Aerosmith fan, I would recommend \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" as it has several really good songs. Those seven songs might not be as good as anything from \\"Rocks,\\" but they are some of the best tracks that Aerosmith have released in the past thirty years. The band sound hungry, revitalized and Jack Douglas brings out the best in them. The ballads, however, are what keep \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" from being a great comeback album. The problem is that Aerosmith are so concerned with staying relevant and writing hits, they wind up with an album that is half-filled with crap. Aerosmith should take a lesson from Van Halen, who didn't care about writing a cross-over hit and released the brilliant \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" earlier this year. I bet that Van Halen's album won't sell all that much less than Aerosmith's new one, and they didn't stoop to getting Diane Warren or Carrie Underwood to help them.ne, and they didn't stoop to getting Diane Warren or Carrie Underwood to help them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is a must read!  Great for all ages as well.  Some foul language, but not overwhelming.  Some violence but not graphic what so ever.  I work with Middle School and High School age kids and I recommend this book to them all the time.  I have also recommended this book to all my adult friends as well.  Such an amazing story, I only hope they make it into a movie!<br />I have never written a review for anything before, as you can probably tell, but I had to for this book series.
B007M45PMU|5.0|the whole album is freakin awesome!  its the sort that you listen to, and i have, on a road trip over and over again and just not get bored of it.  their music has a lot of soul but at the same time can be way happy but not to an excessive annoying degree.  can't wait for more music from them!
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|if you are looking for a variety of hit zepplin songs, this album does not disappoint.  just wish they would come out with one that had them all

0937381888|4.0|If you haven't already, I would seriously consider putting this book into your library for the hobby of Homebrewing. It gives you the basics on how to get started if you have never brewed before and can answer a large portion of the questions you may have as a beginning, intermediate or advanced home brewer.<br />The trouble shooting section goes over the most common issues new brewers may face as well as offering up some suggestions on what can be done to fix the problem.<br />Easy to read and understand for the most part, there are some areas dealing with chemistry that can be a bit confusing but over all a very good and instructional book to have.<br />Its the best place to start for anyone who has thought about getting into Homebrewing.<br />Hope this helps.<br />Happy Home Brewing !
1451696191|4.0|I liked it. I really did. I loved the mystery of the letters. Was the author attempting to reveal a teen with a social disorder? Or, was Charlie simply so smart, he lacked craft and poise? A fact that shone more evidently in writing than face to face conversation? And, just who did he send it to? Doesn't matter. I thought he was real and his innocence adorable.<br /><br />But, I do have to say that it's pretty much a condensed version of Pat Conroy's South of Broad. Awkward high school male befriends brother (gay) and sister (eccentric and articulate). They fill in each other's weaknesses and support each other through high school. Mental illness, crazy/denied/convenient sex, substance abuse, mystery relative constantly creeping in from the past. The similarities are hard to deny, but ... read both, enjoy both.

B008OURHPY|5.0|I first learned about this young lady through a blog that I read on a daily basis. Finding her has definitely been a gift. I have been waiting on this album for a while and it did not disappoint. Her music pulls at your heartstrings, she has the ability to evoke so many emotions. I am anxiously awaiting her US tour and you should too.
0307592731|2.0|It is my opinion this book falls into the sad \\"Could Have Been Good\\" category. I picked it up at my local B&N at the suggestion of one of the employees. I'd actually heard about it through word of mouth as well, and being a big memoir fan I decided to give it a try.<br />I am very much the target audience for this book (26-year old female) but I'm 67 pages in and planning on returning it today.<br /> As far as I can tell the book has little to no structure. She flashes back to her childhood and early 20's intermittently on the trail but the stories don't tie into anything, they are just her floating thoughts on the trail. It's almost like she should've just written the book in journal form, if she'd kept a journal on the trail that would've been a far more interesting narrative.<br />Most importantly, at 67 pages in I feel I have no reason to keep reading. She's on the trail, and ill prepared for the journey. Who decides to hike an eleven hundred mile hike without doing a little research? Without at least going on a few hikes or jogs to train and get in shape? Without knowing the weight of your backpack until literally the night before the trek? I just find that odd....and that was the moment where I disconnected with her.<br />I gave the book 2 stars because she is a good writer. The book has zero structure as far as I can tell, which drives me mad as a reader, but her descriptions are nice and she is good at conveying her emotions and pulling me in there with her, even if she doesn't have any real or metaphorical destination in the book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was AMAZING!!! I wish that the new one had already come out! I recommend this series to everyone so read it!! Thanks for reading!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|An extremely enjoyable read! I have read all of Demille's John Corey books and this one does not disappoint. I didn't want the book to end. True to his style, he writes a very suspenseful weave within the backdrop of Corey's witty dialog. I was happy that at the end of the book, he left it open to another Corey sequel. I just hope I don't have to wait too long! Bottom line: Great Book!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|My biggest problem with weight gain since retirement has been from overeating in the evening, especially late at night. My doctor recommended this book, as a way to reduce cravings from wheat products, which he found helpful for his own weight loss.<br /><br />This book is filled with research studies to support the ideas presented by Dr. Davis, often in great detail. He also brings up similar findings to avoid other grain products, as so much of our food supply is now genetically engineered to produce the highest yields and profits.<br /><br />Therefore, there is no chance of making our food less hazardous to our health within the next few decades. Our educational institutions, both private and government sponsored are very slow to accept research that clearly says there is something wrong with our concepts about nutrition, especially for our increasingly overweight and diabetic population. Then just add to this the untold amount of money influence from the food industry on nutrition education through advertising alone, not to mention how much is paid to the election campaigns of our law-makers to keep their industry taxation and regulation as low as possible.<br /><br />Politics aside, what I got from this book is to definitely try to keep away from wheat products, but also other carbohydrates if you want to reduce food cravings and lose weight.  I also recommend the book by Dr. Thompson called \\"The Glycemic Load Diabetes Solution\\", whether you are diabetic or heading in that direction. Watching your daily glycemic load (GL) lets you eat more of the good carbohydrates - especially those in most vegetables and fruits, and makes weight loss both easy and enjoyable. However, Dr. Thompson does not provide a formula for calculating glycemic load (GL) and provides meal plans that reflect glycemic loads that should be divided by 100, as most calculations are represented for this lower number. The usual formula is GL = GI (glycemic index)/100 x Net Carbs (carb grams, minus grams of fiber), in other words you need to know the glycemic index to calculate the load.  Dietgrail.com has a comprehensive GL list of foods, and a software download option that makes searching much easier.<br /><br />I also considered the \\"The New Atkins for a New You\\", by Westman, et al, but found that it did not consider glycemic load in its recommendations.  I felt this low-carbohydrate only approach unnecessarily restricted many vegetables and fruits, especially in the early \\"phases\\" of the plan, which may produce faster weight loss, but cravings as well. Why fight cravings, the downfall of most weight-loss programs?<br /><br />For now, I'm just calculating GLs to a total of around 50 or less each day, which is similar to limiting to 50 carbs a day, but with much greater eating satisfaction from a greater variety of whole foods. Unfortunately, there is no GL index for most commercially prepared foods, so I just estimate net carbs in these cases - and watch out for added sugars in these foods. Low-fat and low-calorie foods are usually the worst offenders with added sugars and poor value carbs. Overall, following this way of eating steers you to mostly whole food choices, which is probably a good idea. This plan produced more energy after about a week and several lost pounds. A simple plan I can easily stay with and with more food varieties and enjoyment than I have experienced in the past.  I also feel more satisfied during the day, and have much fewer cravings at night.  If they occur, a hunk of cheese or a couple hands full of nuts put them to rest.
B00563K3DA|4.0|The book is pretty good, it atleast makes you think where are you heading professionally as well as personally. The techniques described may seem impractical, but once implemented, they surely will work. Must read...
B002SRQ214|5.0|I upgraded my custom built HTPC from the Athlon X2 7750 dual core to this processor and the speed is noticeable at first boot. All four cores are up and running especially when encoding and editing videos in Sony Vegas 11 Pro. It took 10 mins to encoded a full HD video (3 mins in length) after editing with no problem. Sony Vegas 11 pro is happier with this processor. Adobe Premier CS6 stutters a little but seems to work fine. Encoding the same video in Adobe Premier took 30 mins.<br /><br />One noticeable problem is that when I launch a program it takes longer to appear on screen but after it is up and running it is fast and snappy. I think this might have something to do with my 1TB SATA HDD. Fan is huge but quiet when idling. It gets louder when working hard.

They were things of beauty. This is just the mass market hardcover with an added slipcover and a signature page. Save your money. Buy the standard edition and then just have Neil sign it in person.

B008V59AFW|5.0|Profoundly moved by So DNA. I grew up waiting for every next album to listen to the nuances on headphone night after night. Hearing the raw initial vocals means a lot to someone who's tried to parcel out every track of the catalog from the drainpipe on album 4 to the reverse tape effects in Up. Add to that excitement the brilliant and seemingly effortless mix from tinny cassette to saturated finish and I'm thinking I'm listening to the most ingenious PG product to date. After every album that's come out I've mouthed to myself \\"So grateful you did this, Mr. Gabriel.\\" DNA does it again.

1451620829|5.0|Peter Criss comes across very open and honest in his autobiography.  He relates both negative and positive stories of his life, from the beginning to the present day.  He takes the blame for problems that developed in KISS where the blame is clearly his and points the finger with supporting information when he feels the blame lies elsewhere.  He names names.  He discusses contract details including financials, writes about details of his sexual exploits with women (and bandmates?), suicide attempts, and his drug and alcohol abuse.  However, the point he relates more than any other regards his dedication to rock 'n roll and his disappointment when big money got involved as KISS grew more popular.  Here Peter is clearly conflicted though, both damning Paul and Gene for being so money-hungry and turning their backs on true rock and roll while he also relates throughout the book his strong desire to be fabulously rich and famous as well.  It's hard to have it both ways here, and Peter delves into the quandary of chasing money and \\"selling out\\" or staying \\"true\\" to rock and roll and remaining poor and in hock to the IRS.<br /><br />A good read with lots of road stories and lots of introspection, I read it cover to cover in three sessions.<br /><br />You'll thoroughly enjoy MAKEUP TO BREAKUP if you dig autobiographies or want a peek inside the mind of a rock superstar as he pursued his dream at home, on stage, backstage, and at the after-party.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1451620829 Makeup to Breakup: My Life In and Out of Kiss]]
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had to re-read Bared to You, couldn't remember a thing about it. Found out, it turned out to be a good idea, because it was fresh in my head, and some of the things Gideon said in the first book, had a bearing on this book. Also, this book starts the morning after, Bared to You ends. Eva reflects quite a few times, on Gideon's previous words, to try to understand him. For most of the book, Gideon remains very private with his past, but we end up figuring it out, along with Eva.<br />These two ride an emotional rollercoaster throughout the book, but you can easily tell they are desperately in love, which at times becomes destructive of that relationship. Their biggest problem is understanding the other ones feelings, which Gideon tends to know Eva better than she knows herself. She does some stupid things along the way, but that's one reason we stay on the ride, without the turmoil, the book would be boring. I read it without too many breaks, because it tugs at your heart, and waiting on the outcome is not acceptable. I loved this book. Loved the emotion, the mystery, and drama. It topped the first book in my opinion, and I doubt that I will forget anything about it, waiting on the next in the series.

Here's hoping the path she went down for this effort is a dead end, and that having tried this genre will abandon it for another; it doesn't have to be Potterish, just good.
B005OK81HA|2.0|I have been a number one Scorpions fan since Lonesome Crow.  I even stayed up all night to win front row tickets to see them on their Savage Amusement tour. I did this by knowing 20 songs that were played in 3 second tid bits.  No one could get them right.  I have every CD and saw them on their last tour.  WHY OH WHY did they put out this sad attempt of an album?  Their remakes sound tired and over produced and the cover songs just suck.  This is one awful CD from a great band that just didnt know how to end on a good note. Rock You Like a Hurricane is just awful! His voice is all auto-tuned and robotic sounding, its a horror to listen to!  Sorry Klaus, Mattias, Rudolph and others.....but this is a mess.
B004SIP6BI|1.0|The DVD did not work in my DVD player.  The player indicated that the DVD was defective and could not be played.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I love this CD.  After seeing the movie, I was hooked on the music and plan to get more of his work.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is back and is as sassy as ever. As usual, DeMille puts John and Kate in an impossible situation and as always they come out on top. It was great to see Paul Brenner again. The research the author undertook to write the book is impressive. This book kept a fast pace and immersed me in the middle of Yemen with John and Kate. DeMille's books are always a rush to read and The Panther did not disappoint.
0393316041|5.0|This book is a good read for anyone.<br />He was an aggressive thinker in anything he dealt with,<br />and the \\"aggressive thinking\\" part usually pays off.<br /><br />One lasting takeaway is the duty to object.<br />While Bohr spoke to the best physicists at Los Alamos,<br />most were awed (and mute). He sought out the one who<br />was not afraid to object, and not afraid to be wrong.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Initially I didn't want to read The Hunger Games because I thought the idea of book about children killing children was terrible and disturbing, but I found this book to be about so much more than that. I truly enjoyed reading it and will definitely be reading the next two books in this series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is versatile, witty, and one of my all time favorite authors.  His latest novel, The Panther,set in the  hot, dry desert of the mid-east gives the reader a real sense of that part of the world. DeMille's wit and  the depth of his characters combined with a plot that is right out of the evening news keeps the reader turning pages into the late night.
0385344333|5.0|Part Sherlock Holmes, part Rambo and part gentleman-how could a woman resist Jack Reacher?  Child's 17th thriller did seem a tad familiar, but it read so much better than most of what I find for myself that I didn't care.  I doubt [[ASIN:0985688041 CURED]]you will either.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Compelling , but there can be no solid proof of heaven. While his story is somewhat convincing, and while I am confident there is life beyond earth, I wasn't impressed by Alexander's book. I was much more impressed by his on line interviews. He is a better narrator in person than he is a writer.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This game features some nostalgic 16 bit graphics and music, as well as an easy to use control scheme. Great app, especially for only &cent;99
B001NLKT60|5.0|Great second book, I watched the Dragon Tattoo movie and then went straight into this book, and no problems.  Was a fast read, suspense thriller.  Lived up to my expectations.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This was an entertaining action/drama film. If you have seen the first film in this series then you will enjoy this one.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have this game on my Wii and loved it from the beginning! Even though it was $4.99, I believe it was worth the price! The graphics are wonderful, the sound is crisp, the game has no glitches, and the gameplay lasts for weeks! I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves brain teasers and fun-filled goo! :)
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book and Cheryl's writing style.  She made me feel as though I were on the trail with her.  Very inspirational.  I like the way she weaves her personal experiences and upbringing with her experiences on the trail.  Just goes to show we all can doing anything we set out to do. I can't wait to visit the PCT, even for a day hike.  I highly recommend this book.  It became very personal to me.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Non stop fun, with history lessons along the way. I wish it had been my history book in high school!
1451638450|5.0|It's really hard to discuss this tale without including spoilers, but I'll try.  The only summation that I'll provide is an indirect one; this book takes large parts of the plots of Komarr and A Civil Campaign, mashes them together, turns them inside out, and twists - hard.  This is not the first Barrayar story that has been centered on someone other than her main protagonist, Miles Vorkosigan, though he has been the focus of most of them.  The events of [[ASIN:1451637500 Cryoburn]] left Miles with a very much restructured life, however, and it may be difficult for Bujold to write more about him entertainingly, so it's not surprising that she has shifted to Ivan here.  He has been a background character since early on, and this is where he finally comes into his own.  He's getting respect, he's lost his customary middle name (it has been a running gag across many volumes that he's usually called 'Ivan-you-idiot'), his career is solid and stable - and then Byerly Vorrutyer drops in to ask for a favor.  That's where the toboggan run starts, and this one's got more than its share of unexpected turns.  Along the way, we get a hefty dose of the ever-treasured one-line zingers that have increasing marked Bujold's writing, and some surprising supporting character development as well.  It's clear that Bujold is not done with adding to her Barrayar series, and if this is any indication of what's to come, I hope there are many, many more!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Cute story line with a heart. Good character development and a \\"happy\\" ending. Both female leads are quite lovely and the acting is believable. You care what happens to these characters. Michele Phiefer is gorgeous as always. It's a definate watch.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|this is an old favorite, I have watched many times in VHS on DVD and now in BLU RAY. I have always enjoyed seeing the actors as they developed throughout their carears. I never tire of this movie....it is one of my all time favorites.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app. I play it over and over working at night and it kills plenty of time. also it keeps my children occupied as well. absolutely love this game!!!!
034580404X|5.0|My sister mentioned the Fifty Shades Trilogy books and I was definitely intrigued and anxious to purchase and start reading.  From the start my reading pleasure was enhanced 1000%.  I truly enjoyed all three books and when my husband mentioned that a movie may be made regarding this trilogy, I was again intrigued and excited.  The author was exceptional and very descriptive with \\"yummy\\" details.  Loved all three books!!  Also, loved the term \\"kinky-f...ery\\"!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Juvenile story, the sex gets boring quickly, not a masterpiece of any genre! Managed to finish the first book, mostly just out of curiosity because so many of my friends had talked about it. But I don't think I'll bother with the rest of the series, not very interesting.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app sucks I tried to get to a channel I really like but it looked nothing like youtube so I got losted and I couldn't find it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is actually pretty decent, especially if you like games like I Spy. the recharge time and the diamonds do get a bit annoying though
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I'd like to have similar adventures in the last decade or two of life.  The author shows there is more to life than sitting in an institution at the end.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is a good book to read if you are in a rut and need a more positive outlook on life. It helps you to see what you have to be thankful for rather than focus on what you don't have. You read a chapter a day and it takes you through 28 days of the magic.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I watched this at least 20 times when I rented it but the quality of the audio and visuals were poor on amazons part. Great movie but poor visuals
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You the 1st installment of A Crossfire Novel does not disappoint in the hot and steaminess of romance.  Eva and Gideon are both troubled in their own lives, but seem to be able to bring out the best in each other, even if they are arguing.  Great story!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is so fun I just love making a bunch of games and then I have so many games its just so fun!
B005UDD1R6|2.0|This player is not the easiest to use. It's hard to import music and it only plays what it wants to. I'm not exactly happy with it
1451620829|1.0|You know, the more I learn about these 4 vile human beings, the less I want to know.  Is there any way to \\"unread\\" this book?
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This game is a fun way to fill some time.  I enjoy playing it, but I'm not trying to set a record score or out-do anyone else playing it.  It works well on my HTC Sensation.  The graphics are good and it responds well when I play.  BlocksClassic is pretty much what I was expecting it to be.
B008MEM24S|5.0|good clean fun for kids 4+ kids love it and Perry theme makes learning about gravity water fun for kids
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This is a wonderful, yet heartbreaking story to read. I loved the realness in which the author wrote the memoir.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|keeps me busy when I'm bored cant complain.good time waster. wish the walls stayedc up longer. hats that my reveiw has to b so freaking long
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app is a very simple and handy way for me to check the weather where i am and where i plan to travel
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I just love the Outlander series. It is really hard to put them down...even to go to sleep!<br />Voyager is not quite as enthralling as the first two books. Too many unbelievable things occur. But it is still good and a must read to be able to go on to the next book.<br />Thank you to the auther for her wonderful imagination. Such a talented writer.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book is a beautiful read.<br /><br />This book has restored my love of reading which has recently been tainted by the concentration of my library with text books and guides and journals around autism and the management of autism because my five year old son is autistic.<br /><br />This book has given me more valuable information and insight about my sin whilst being simply hilarious.  I have learn so much without realising I am doing so.<br /><br />The literature itself is classy and a joy.<br /><br />Thank you Mark Haddon, you have championed this condition with this story and given me hope and light and amusement.
B004S5BTD0|3.0|We found the French with subtitles very distracting.  I think it was a little slow because of the subtitles - so it took a while to get into it.  Good movie overall...can't go wrong with Matt Damon.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Every body should read this book. I like how he puts everything together and makes a great story come together.
