B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This woman can write and she has a heck of a story to tell. This book is hilarious. It's a story of incredible strength juxtaposed with incredibly poor decision making. A very honest account.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Excellent! Loved this book from start to finish! Loved that the whole thing was in the male POV. Steamy chemistry between these two awesome characters the whole way through. I haven't laughed so much while reading since &#34;Wallbanger.&#34; Can't wait to read more from this author!
0525478817|5.0|I can't get enough of this book. It is smart, funny and original. A reminder that whatever catastrophe you face, life and all its silly details will always be present. Brilliant!

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It's a fun game where you are the new helper. Your job is to keep the kingdom safe. It's one of gamelofts best. You don't also just plant seeds but you cam also actually fight the Baggins. Great game for all ages
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was so action packed, and fast paced. Surprisingly fast paced! It had everything I look for in a great book and a good read. A brilliant way to end the series. Fans of Percy Jackson will not be disappointed.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I absolutely love Lady A and all of their songs they sing. They are so real and touch my heart everytime I hear them on the radio or listen to one of their CD's..
630471193X|5.0|every chaqracter is written as people are, complex, often conflicted, & a little scared,l. not of the unknown, burt of the unknowable
0345803493|1.0|Who knows...my wife is reading it.  If it has anything to do with the way she is acting now...I would say ..DON'T BUY IT...LOL
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Blake Shelton has a great voice and is a great story teller with his songs! A really good mix of songs!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I think I had really high expectations from all of the raving reviews.  I was able to predict the end and didn't think it was a &#34;great&#34; book.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Wasn't a big Kelly Clarkson fan before but this CD has all of her really great songs on it.  It even had some that I didn't know she did.  Really love this CD

B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Great production; great story line; great acting on all parts. A must see for any histroy buff, or just a Russel fan?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khalid Hosseini, once again, strings together words, phrases and images that transport.<br /><br />You'll feel compassion and understanding for each of the characters, want to know more about them, and then sadness when you turn the final page, because there's no more.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Like this game, can be creative in this blocky game, but its not as good as the computer version or the Xbox 360 Edition, only because it doesn't have enough stuff.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fantastically written, with an excellent plot throughout all three books!  Well crafted scenes throughout, and drama for everyone.  This is not a book to miss!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game but it can get boring after a while.  But its one of those games were if you need something to do its there.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Hobbit has got to be even better than Lord of the Rings. The way the movie is woven into the later is seamless.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|It is a great app. I use it to edit all my pictures. I love it. It has a lot of different things that you can do.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I am not a big Tom Cruise fan, but this is a great performance and an interesting role. I was hoping for a little more from the character, maybe something more along the lines of &#34;Justified.&#34;
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I like this book because it has some funny parts in it and some weird parts but over all its a pretty good book to me and my family.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a fun movie. I got tired of listening to some of the language, but I it did fit with the time period. Some of the scenes were truly imaginative, and it gave the film a wonderful feel.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Have a good sweating time with this work out....wish I had a more time for this.<br />Overall in love with Julian DVD& books.She help to change my life.Very recommend this workout!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|this is one of the best shows on tv today. great story, great acting from our main character, and tons of mystery to be solved. this is a must have for any fans, and future fans.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This app is awesome! Though there are ads, with the most recent update there haven't been any video ads which were really annoying... soo yup; this close to being my favorite app! ( What can I say, I please easily!)  ;)
B004RJMUJO|1.0|poor, already deleted it. dont waste time on this one maybe a first game for a baby or cat or dog
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love it! I got so addicted to it, and it was so much fun.<br /><br />I ended up staying awake for 18 hours straight to finish it and solve the mystery.<br /><br />My daughter wanted to try it next...  8)
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|It gave me much insight to the life of a paraplegic. I also love Helen Hunt. You could see the growth of the people who got to know Mark.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Does not play on my did player says not supported is USA.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This album made me want to see the movie so much more than I already did, which I thought was impossible. The musicality and the talent on this album is sublime. The artists shine all in their own right on the songs and so it just feels naturally perfect. GET IT GET IT GET IT
B0006GANOQ|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over an over again I have over 400 DVD's and never get tired of them
B003MC5N28|5.0|daughter was assigned the reading as an assignment.  she read it because she had too, I read it because I wanted too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series.  Good ending.  I have kids that read the books and wanted to keep up with what they are reading.  It helps to start conversation with teenagers when you can talk about something they are interested in.
0385512058|4.0|Networkers, if you are eating alone, this book lets you know why you should have a lunch partner.It is easy to share ideas....and everyone needs to  eat.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoy books, and read constantly. I was tired of love stories with little meaning. With oh he hot so let me get with him. No, this book is nothing like that at all. This book made me feel a range of emotions. I dragged me in from the very first sentence. It kept you in suspense. It made you sigh of happiness. It made your heart melt and fell sad but hopefully for a happy ending. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to exspirence a wonderful enjoyable ending, with a sweet ending. Just amazing, it took my breath away. I am afraid I will be spoiled for other love stories I read because I will always compare it to this one.
B005UG542S|5.0|Great way of tying up the story of Harry, Hermione, Ron etc., and yet continuing the story via their children.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It charges my daughters kindle fire where as the other cable did not. Works much better. Very happy with it.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|All the hype builds this movie up too much.  Very strange movie. It starts poorly and doesn't get much better.
0143034901|5.0|A great read that takes the reader on trip through the real and the imagined landscapes & characters of Barcelona.  You won't put it done easily.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|You need to simplify the kindle version. It lags bad causing my kindle fire to freeze everytime I try to play! I adore the game just not this version of it.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is a terrific Movie<br /><br />The movie was listed as &#34;Used Very good condition&#34; I would rate it as Like new condition!
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Haven't had it long and it's already no longer charging the kindle.<br />This damn kindle is ending up costing me an arm and a leg in accessories and replacements.
B00AFIOOA4|4.0|My son loved this album.  Great addition to your Smashing Pumpkin collection.  We bought the digital download version instead of CD
B008QTV3X0|5.0|As the season progresses, the acting becomes truly amazing. Claire Danes is the best! We've already started watching season 2!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Never disappointed with her books.  Twist and turns that keeps your mind guessing and thinking.  I love the way she brings the truth out in the story.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Read first three books. Didn't read more because I didn't sense that the many hanging threads would be resolved.<br />Also, I don't appreciate an author's resorting to magic as a basic element of a story.
B00BZB1UMU|3.0|The movie was okay and the streaming quality was good.  About as much as I'd expected.  I plan on watching the others still.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a clever, well written, well acted remake of a classic.  The characters are fresh, with updated technology, yet true to our beloved original.  I can't wait for more episodes!  I would recommend this to anyone, and I have!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It made me appreciate what I have and the way I was raised. The writing touched my heart and was heartwarming.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|My 3 year old loves it, Its such a cute movie! He will watch it over and over!! Totally worth the price.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Any student of US History will enjoy the book.  Provides a very &#34;human&#34; glimpse into club.  Recommend highly.  Appropriate AP USHistory read.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|excellent...displaying a reason for national pride...reminding us of those who are couragious and being thankful for those on the front lines and those who are often not thanked or rewarded
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|For the followers of Downton Abbey a must for your collection. Eagerly awaiting the next years episodes and the further misfortunes that await us.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|If you like ABBA or adult pop, this is a must have! Agnetha's voice did not age over the years and she is- at 63- still a peerless purveyor of heartbreak.<br />Beautiful ballads with a bonus disco anthem.<br />Only 10 songs but every single of them is a gem.<br />NO FILLERS ON THIS ALBUM!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I read this book in two days!!!  The story really hit home for me since I'm caring for my mom!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|This album has NOT ONE memorable ore even remotely good song. TERRIBLE!!! It's almost shockingly bad. Don't waste your money on it.
B008602KQI|4.0|I Was excited to see this on prime and Ca not wait for the rest of the series to come out.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Played it for 5 min and got bored. I guess it would be good for little kids. Glad I didn't buy this.
0880796863|4.0|I consider myself as one of those people who are curious about Tarot so a friend of mine recommended me to get this. Each picture seems very original, which I like, but the only problem that I had was the small book. I like the fact that it does give information of what each card represent, but I would like to have a bigger vision and possibly more meanings.
B000067FP8|5.0|THIS WAS MY FAVORITE ONE FROM THE FIRST ONE BECAUES IT WAS MORE DARKER MORE CHAOTIC MORE FUNNIER MORE HIPPER... AND I LOVE GIZMO
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Well, as great as this show is, I have to say that I completely forgot the incredibly short story arc of this season.  Disc 1 is all about how Ted loves Robin, plus some weird obligatory past stories.  Disc 2 is Victoria. Disc 3 is Ted trying to win Robin back. Some notable great episodes are The Pineapple Incident, Drumroll Please, Game Night, Nothing Good Happens after 2am, and Come On (possibly my favorite, just for the amazing ending).<br /><br />Oh, and everything got to me in 1 piece.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Once past chapter 4 it got me intrigued by chapter 5 totally hooked couldn't put it down.well worth the read
B000F5FR0S|2.0|This book was bought as a gift for someone else and I never got any feedback, so can't comment, sorry.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I saw Big Easy Express on direct tv with This band, Mumford and Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show and I liked this band immediately. I love Mumford and Sons as well. Everybody always mentions the song Home by this band but the rest of this cd is great too. I would highly recommend this cd to fans of Indie-folk.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Fun filled game keeps you on your toes and fingers moving fast and mind working hard to out smart the enemy so your plants are safe and helps you win.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Any album with Brian Wilson has to be good.  His reunion with the others is long awaited and worth the wait.  Strong material and performances.  Even by Love, who has had trouble staying on key in the past 20 years.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I Loved this book! I cannot believe the author is not a man. She thinks exactly like men. Amazing.<br />Very funny and Drew is HOT!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My wife and  kids love this disc.  We have listened to it in the car many times.  Very strong disc as the awards would indicate.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Absolutely great music. ZZZ Top is still going strong and as great as ever. You won't regret purchasing this.  I got the CD so I can load it on all my technology and play on my Bose CD player.  The sound is outstanding.
B000002VSN|5.0|One of the best soundtracks ever.  Performed with such inspiration and talent.  Bought this for the wife and love it myself.  Without the movie this would be an important gospel record.
B00BHU261S|4.0|Not one of the greatest dramas ever filmed, however it was a true story about a great filmmaker.  Anthony Hopkins really didn't pull off being Hitchcock but I'm not sure anyone could.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is awesome.  I stink at it, but it is awesome.  I peaked early with the high score of family and then the kids took over.  We play this on my kindle fire.
B008IBP24C|5.0|Great drama! If you love historical fiction then this is the show for you! Love every episode and can't wait to see season 3!
B004WJRDN2|5.0|This is classic McCartney.  The bonus material, the packaging, and the music is well worth the price.  More for the fanatic fan than the casual listener, it is expensive.  I like that there are different packages that allows any fan to enjoy this piece of rock history.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I enjoyed this series.  Easy to read and I finished entire series in a few weeks because it kept me interested.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I have not used this product for very long.  So far, it is performing well.  It solved my &#34;Not Authenticated&#34; problem and gave me access to my email.
B000I9U75G|3.0|Once I saw the case of the movie I watched it fast as I can. It turns out it was exactly I did not thought about.  GODZILLA WAS SO WRONG! Godzilla looked like a dinosaur from Jarracic Park. It was not what I liked at all, yet it was still OK. Angry Godzilla died in Godzilla vs SpaceGodzilla. Why Would they make him back alive?! Good Plot, Bad Acting and Monster.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|The global map may change, but not Le Carre's ability to tell a great story and do so extraordinarily well. Smiley might not recognize Le Carre's new heroes, but that makes them no less interesting.
B0053TMP24|4.0|Great book but at points it got boring but I'm being hash on it it really is a awesome book.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love the amazing, inspiring talent in these young people, and the storyline is interesting and relevant. I'm 60 years old, but I remember life in high school, and this show captures it very well with, of course, dramatic flair and great humor. Even my husband, who says he can't stand musicals, sits himself down to watch :-)
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|To this day I cannot understand the mediocre reviews given to this film by \\"professionals.\\"  While 2012 was a particularly good year for film, the fact that this was not even considered for an Academy Award in a single category (really?  Not even best score???) is truly unimaginable.  There are few films that one can enjoy by learning new things upon watching them a second, third, or fourth time--but this one definitely qualifies.  This is without a doubt one of my top 20 films of all time.  No other film from 2012 even comes close.  Twenty years from now, many of the films that were nominated for an Oscar last year will have been truly forgotten.  I believe \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will become a classic.<br /><br />For newbies to the film, two suggestions (no spoilers):<br /><br />1.  Like many long films, the first third of the motion picture sets up many things to happen later.  Have patience and listen and watch closely...do not get thrown if you are confused--it will clearly make sense in the end (in beautiful and meaningful ways);<br /><br />2.  The daring decision to use the same actors throughout the film is ultimately a brilliant way to tell the story, but can be confusing if you are not sure what is going on.  If someone watched \\"Forest Gump\\" and then watched \\"Apollo 13,\\" immediately afterwards, they would not get confused by the fact that Tom Hanks is in both films.  He is clearly playing two different characters (that is what actors do).  For the most part, think of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" in the same way.  You will see Tom Hanks and Halle Berry a LOT during the film.  If you know going in that they are playing different characters in different time periods (as are most all of the actors), it becomes easier to follow the story.<br /><br />Watch this film.  You will not regret it.<br /><br />Then watch it again.  You will want to.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Love to write, however it has not been delivered. Please let me know when I might expect it. Thank you.
B008ROGQAE|4.0|Great movie for its time, but technology and filmmaking style have left this one dated.  Don't be put off by the 4:3 format bad footage docu-interview-promo piece that the front - that was supposed to be a parody of corporate promotions of the time and worked well in its day.  But after that, the actual story gets rolling.  Put it in context, and this was way ahead of its time.
B0047YIHLE|5.0|Bought it for my wife's birthday, and she love s it. The picture clarity is amazing. Plus my wife loves the fact that it came from Italy
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Essentially a tower defense game, but not limited to a grid or channel.  So, you can range all over the screen for infinite variations in strategy and play.  WAY too addicting!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great book with an awesome story.  Silver linings had me reading late into th wee hours of the night.  Worth the $.
B00CW665VI|5.0|The perspective told by Drew...genius. How could you not fall in love with that arrogant a-hole!!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed it and want more!!!
B009R659L8|5.0|All of Mary Higgins Clark book you cannot put down<br />From the begining she keeps you quessing what will happen next.<br />Read in one days.
B005H9B44A|5.0|This movie was absolutely awesome! Can't wait until the 2nd one comes out in November!! :) definitley would suggest this movie to anyone!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, so suspenseful. The ending was very unexpected. Have to say the beginning wasn't to interesting but it gets really good, quickly.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|This is my favorite of her movies it has all the action and some comedy perfect combo.  Check it out
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I downloaded it and it said delete 800 megabytes of data. I deleted every single app I had, and I still cant play it. someone help me. why wont it work???? this has to be fixed
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I liked it.  I enjoyed the pace and characterizations.  Won't lie; not the finest story ever written, but I have never laughed quite so hard and for as long throughout a book of this genre before, and that alone will keep me moving forward with it. I thoroughly appreciated its blunt and frank realism and I was glad the character pool was limited (the story keeps you moving ahead and does not drag you through tedious and boring characters that do not serve the plot at hand similar to other like-genre stories I have read [A Song of Ice and Fire comes to mind]). That said, some characters I liked less than others; I disliked having to be placed inside the head of those characters who were painfully pompous, cruel, or cynical (who wants to be inside the thoughts of THAT, though it is looking more and more the trend these days).  Still, their POV was at least concerned with the story ahead rather than these characters feeling like filler.  I feel certain, though, that these characters will prove and serve a purpose across the series far richer than their beginnings (fingers crossed). THE BLOODY-NINE IS THE BEST CHARACTER EVER, FYI. I give the book thumbs up, for whatever that's worth (\\"Sometimes you've got to be realistic about this sort of thing\\")!
B0094D462M|5.0|I love this movie!!! It was Great on my Kindle Fire HD.  The music and the sounds were very good!!!!!
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I thought the movie was very good.  I thought it followed the book very well.<br />I thought Julianne Hough did an excellent job and I hope to see her in many more movies.<br />I also, loved the setting for the movie.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked the movie, but I wish it would had been more like the book.  The Book was very good!!!
1451695195|5.0|After the death of my dad in 2009, one of the biggest questions was &#34;where did he go?&#34;... I have a faith in a Christian God, but I guess I wanted more proof or evidence.  I came across the work of Dr. Alexander, who is right up the road from me in Charlottesville, and thought, &#34;wow, this is such and incredible account from a known Neuroscientist in the area, I just had to read it for more insight.  It was so intense and thought provoking and actually helped deepen my relationship with my God.  I don't know if it's proof as I think that can only reside within the spirit of each individual through their faith, but it's definitely a book worth reading to broaden your horizons in life... and death.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this CD  initially heard them on Sirius XM  and based on that bought this CD,.. They are gifted musicians and you will not be disappointed.
0439023491|5.0|Great book and I love what they are doing with the movies... Jennifer Lawrence! ahhhhh so great!... Books are a great series to read and it's a fantastic story... I wish I could come up with something equally as wonderful!... Maybe one day.  ha ha.. Congrats on all your success Suzanne!  Cheers, B
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Very nice book. Enjoyed it and will tell my friends if they would like a good cop story with some fun , read this book.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this app is very fun..... but after you go on the rope you have to Gpa super slow. Over all this app is fun and entertaining ! FUNN
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A very good app. Bought the Pro, and was well worth the small cost. Let's you know everything you need to know about you battery status plus so much more. A great buy, don't hesitate at all,get this app.
B001224WBS|3.0|Perhaps I liked the lesser known tracks but I feel like this does not represent their greatest hits.  There are good songs and it was still worth the 5 bucks
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|It is fine. Gets kind of boring after awhile.  It does take up time when I'm bored though. My grandchildren like it
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Interesting characters, soap opera drama, fantasy setting, good camerawork, but too much graphic violence, rape, etc, that seems overdone to attract a certain movie or tv watching segment of the population. Its not appropriate for young people or children. I enjoyed it, even though nobody wins, everyone suffers or dies, women are treated like garbage, and it's a male dominated script. On a positive note, love the fantasy, dragons, etc.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|This App was ok kinda but it needs to improve. I want better Amazon Apps alarm.l don't like it at all.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is a fantastic ride - high energy music, great graphics, and easy controls make it easy to play and hard to put down.  The neon color scheme is incentive and your enemies will surprise you.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!
B00138KG8O|5.0|I usually avoid live recordings for a variety of reasons.  This is one of the exceptions I was happy to make.<br /><br />Three master guitarists playing a fusion of rock, jazz, and Spanish guitar.  Absolutely brilliant!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|When you mix asteroids, galaga, centerpiece, with big boss battles, you get a game that is fast and nostalgic.  I Love the twist off all these games together.  The game is fast and fun.  Even for this middle-aged man.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|A brave and searing account of the author's rape and it's aftermath on her life. Alice Sebold is so brutally honest that she makes other similar stories seem like fiction.
B008RC72G8|3.0|This movie is a disaster in many ways. It's not the acting because these are all great actors. No it's the half comedy and half horror concept of a beloved franchise that sank this movie. It was tim burton's biggest flop. I do like parts of this movie. The scenes with alice cooper are just great! and other scenes capture a gothic sense of dread. BUT the movie meanders off into semicomedy and not very good comedy at that. Why not make a real dark shadows movie? OH well we got the parody instead. And that's a shame.  The blu ray looks dark throughout as if filmed with gauze over the lens. This was done for atmosphere but since this is a comedy, perhaps they shouldn't have bothered.  IT's not a terrible movie though as it does feature some good scenes and the effects are great. But all killing is mostly pg rated and silly. So long term fans may want to get the real Dark shadows films on blu ray. As they exist and casual fans may like this comedy , that's not really funny.  But to me what makes this whole movie worthwhile is the 1970's setting and the great Alice Cooper scenes.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best game i have played i have been waiting for this for sooo long finally!! Thank yo u so much for makijg an awesome game
B00CL6G69A|5.0|Hannibal is a very controversial show, Every episode features cannibalism, very graphic horrible deaths and more. The acting is superb. The stories come from before will gram caught Doctor Lector. Red dragon or manhunter come after this series in that regard. Although the films were made in the 80's and 00's.  Still this episode was pulled and I don't have a clue why. They said it was due to the bombing in Boston. But this has no bombings just the usual serial killings etc and Hannibal bonding with a young serial killer character. SO there was no reason to pull it. I had to watch this ep on amazon.com to see it. Hopefully they will not cancel Hannibal , but we wont know until this series airs it's last episode.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|no driver is required for surface pro, recognized immediately. indicator lights are also useful to know status of connection which are often missing with other devices.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|He said it and he is back indeed,<br />I really didn't know what I'd get from this movie,,,, but I'm glad I got this movie,<br />The \\"A\\" man returns with action, drama and humor, prooving that no one is gonna run over his small country town.<br />Very entertaining,
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|WARNING SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I can't really add much more to the other reviews suffice to say that I loved the film as a stand alone action film, but it's not Star Trek . The reason why, is I am really dissapointed that the lead charachter Khan Noonien Singh is played by a white actor. He is meant to be \\"northern Indian\\" and \\"possibly Sikh\\". Ricardo Motalban could at least pass off as this, but Cummerbach? Come on? Saying that Cummerbach is probably the best thing about it.<br /><br />What will they do next? Have a white actress with a blacked up face to play Uhuru? or maybe a Korean actor play a Japanese charachter Sulu.....errrr wait :)<br /><br />I also thought the villain was cliched and the script writers were lazy. When Hollywood script writers run out of ideas for a villain then they go for the cliched, English accent, posh looking English person....as they have here. Why do they seem to think that we Brits are perfect villians for Hollywood films?<br /><br />Other points:<br /><br />1) Starfleet - terminology and the way they act totally wrong. We're supposed to have hope for the future. ....and what's with those stupid hats they wear on parade from military uniforms?<br />2) Interaction between characters is messed up....it's more like a teenage vampire film dialogue.<br />3) Klingons look messed up....did they get affected by the time shift in the parallel Universe?<br />4) Earth and the look of it is not out of Rodenberry's ideal, it just looks like the 90's set in the future.<br />5) Enterprise internally and externally looks messed up.<br />6) I know this is a parallell timeline but there are inconsitencies. Somethings should be consistent with prior to the timeshift. Abrams has messed up his own rules. The Klingon bird's of prey, again look messed up.<br />7) There were an assortment of scenes that were stolen from other films like Godfather Part 3, Bourne Trilogy and Star Wars Pt2.<br /><br />PS I clarified the comments for the person who goes around calling people childish names.
159420411X|4.0|I was very pleased to see this at the library and snapped it up. Five hundred pages later I am a little smarter which is what I hoped.<br /><br />I worked 40 years as a meteorologist and wrote a great many forecasts before I retired. Each one was a struggle. Silver accurately describes the forecasting technique and to my delight he actually appreciates the results. Some very fine minds have applied themselves to the problem of weather forecasting through the years and finally the contraptions, er, computers are becoming reliable now that we know how to use them.<br /><br />They're just one more input to the Bayesian algorithm. I've often thought of Bayes's Theorem and Green's Theorem in the same way -- you have to already have an answer to the problem before you apply the method! Now I see that Bayes's Theorem has a wide application.<br /><br />For me, the book would have been better without the darn basketball and poker chapters, which I skimmed. They illustrate the method but were of interest to those who play cards or watch basketball, mostly, neither of which I do. A section in Chapter 8 would have sufficed.<br /><br />In 1975 I wrote a thesis for my master's using statistical methods. I'd like to revisit that database with modern data-crunching ability. What took me a year to do I could probably do in an afternoon!<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and hope for more from Mr Silver.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|great book collection.... very 50 shades style. less BDSM, more romance/great bedroom book. Took a while to get into it, but worth the first concerning chapter....
B00B6U63ZE|4.0|good read for anyone transitioning positions or being promoted in current organization. references an app for smart phone that was not available.
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|i love Gregory Heinze and Baryshnikov.  Could watch them both dance until the end of time.  great movie to ass to my collection
B008KZVNFS|1.0|I ordered the DVD twice, but neither copy played correctly. Very disappointed, because I so wanted to see this mini series.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I would like to see them make a sequel to this movie. I want more, more, more!! The books are great too. Really enjoyed this story!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|The pizza could have used more pizza, but the pizza was still a five star pizza for pizzaing of pizzas
B0017SWSCW|4.0|I love Jeffrey Archer's ability to weave a complicated tale and hold your interest until the very end. Archer fans will not be disappointed! Great Summer read.
B0090O07S2|5.0|Looks and Sounds like it was shot yesterday.Perfect audio and video.Some nice extra's too.Buy this now.This Blu-Ray is definitely Recommended!!
193700788X|1.0|Thanks for flipping off most of your loyal fans, CH!<br /><br />You made Stephanie Meyer look like the author of the century and that's saying something.<br /><br />For all the moral/religious preachings you do in your books, you're awfully cruel to your own creations.<br /><br />I had to give 1 star because I don't know how to give zero or neg rating in amazon.<br /><br />I wonder if I can get my money back..
B00BB67UNW|5.0|Well played roles, couldn't have picked better actors for their roles. This is a well written, very believable story, fiction? Who knows, it all seems plausable these days. Watch it, twice, catch the stuff you missed the first time. Well done, very well done.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Try to watch the movie in Thermian without dying laughing.  That is after you watch it the regular way.just check special features.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I read Dead Ever After last night. I LOVED IT!!! I liked the way it ended. I always thought they should be together. I am sad the series is ending. I love this series. Thank you Charlaine Harris for a wonderful series. I have all the books in this series.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I can't let go of this game, old school in the better sense, lots of fun and a great amount of gameplay.
B000PHVZNE|5.0|I saw this in the box office when it first came out--it was definitely one of Tom Hanks best roles.
B004TI1WME|4.0|Nice to have a calculator that doesn't forget what you have done, it could do with a little holo but it's on the right track.
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|I didn't get the chance to read the fine print before use of app. Wrote lots of notes only to loose the whole thing 2 times!
B009R659L8|5.0|I have yet to read a Mary Higgins Clark that I haven't loved.  Always exciting and fast paced.  Always have a surprise ending.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|get this game! My cuison has it on his ipod and I could never find on a kindle fire. now its finally here... GET IT!!!!!!!
0321701763|4.0|I found this handbook highly useful, even though I have been a Photoshp-user for quite some time. Excellent explanations and many useful hints, even now after I have moved on to CS6.
B000GOSVEW|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie of enjoyment. John Travolta rocks as usual. And yeah, it's a good watch. Watch it.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|Beware, walking is not safe...Unique fiction as expected from Stephen King.<br /><br />However i was a little dissappointed with the ending.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie was everything I hope it would be. I'd wanted to see it for a while but never got around to it. Jennifer Lawrence definitely deserved the Oscar. She was amazing and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of someone with Bipolar disorder was very realistic and heartfelt. Loved it and plan on buying it on Bluray so I can watch it time and again!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was expecting a mediocre book yet i was wrong. Nice book about how bad life can be. Keep the hope.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Lots of nice,visceral mob destruction. Nothing more satisfying than laying waste to large crowds of bad guys with powerful spells and sword blows. The look of the game is awesome and progression is straitforward as long as you don't mind lots of micro-transactions. That's actually something Ive come to expect from these games. Still a lot of bugs to work out, most noteworthy in my case, the random way the game seems to like to start me back at level 1 after hours of progression (3 times,so far). But overall, a fun way to compulsively waste the hours.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. Clever idea, surronded by interseting characters. Particularly ending was very nice. It was how is was supposed to be.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Heard a lot about this. Couldn't wait to watch Season 2. I love having Amazon Prime to watch on this on my Kindle or computer.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Their first CD was stellar, this picks up where that left off. The cover of Nutbush is worth the priice alone, Miss Lady will rock your socks with outstanding horns. Just go get this release.<br /><br />Excellent work from Start to Finish!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|They ask you to rate this thing right away!<br />But that's okay, I already have an opinion. This game is fun, loads quickly for a fast run now and again. I was upgrading my truck after the first run!
0425252868|5.0|It is every bit as the title indicates &#34;An Incredible Story of Combat and Chivalry&#34; This is a book that you cannot lay down.
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|low resolution is an HD world? not too good.  If you have a low resolution phone then i do recommend this game to you, otherwise its a pass.
B00000J0O2|5.0|good product but a little slow on delivery.  Glad I can still find these cartridges because my printer is a very old HP (works great though)
B001KS0THU|5.0|Classic, great movie. They don't make movies like this anymore. No blood and guts, just good old fashion justice. Classic
B0095P29EG|4.0|I thought that the story line really drug out. This movie only needed to be about 45 minutes long. In saying that, in the end it was a good movie.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Thrilling, heartwarming, and comical! The DVD itself is great. My only concern was that when I received &#34;Catfish&#34; the bottom right corner of the case was cracked so badly that it had a small hole. Oh well. This was a while ago so I don't expect any kind of recompense. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I bought this for my three and a half great nephew.  He sat and watched it over and over again.  He's decided that he's Lady because she is a good dog.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|WOW! This vinyl record is unbelievable! I recommend this to any true Lana Del Rey fan because her music is meant to be played just as much on vinyl as it is through earbuds. My only complaint is that it didn't have &#34;Lolita&#34; on it, but I'm just being picky. JUST BUY IT!
B0038LB4TE|4.0|It's interesting that Leed Child can keep up with the rythm and interest after 13 episodes of the saga.<br />Every time I satart one I wonder if it would be the one where it starts to decline (as I expect will uneavoidable happen)<br /><br />But it is not in this one for sure. A good page turner. Full of action and Jack Reacher's style. If you like it this boook won't be a deception.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My 9 year old has loved playing this game.<br /><br />It takes up a fairly significant amount of Memory and it often takes times to load.  You get a lot of notifications that things are ready.  Its one of those build a community types and collect things.  It reminds me of these addicting games on Facebook / on line that adults get sucked into wasting countless hours like farm ville. I discourage them from playing it.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|I'd say it is a must read for anyone who wants to have an opinion on current global economy.<br />If only some poiliticians forgot abot their re-election and private agendas and worked to create consensus on how to improve the world.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Didn't care much for the App<br /><br />Perhaps because its the  Free Version but it was too limited for me.  My preference is to just use the web browser on my tablet to go to the actual site.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I don't usually read John Grisham but I got the sample on my Kindle and got hooked on this story.  I loved the twists and turns and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Who knows maybe I'll read more of his stuff!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My first experience with puzzle apps was Azada by BigFish and I absolutely loved it, got addicted right away and looked for more like it, I kind of got stuck in the hidden object games, which are fine time killers but just not challenging and I've been looking for more puzzle and problem solving apps since and finally found another. Really great graphics, loved that the hints point you in the right direction but don't tell you exactly what to do. I will definitely get the next one and check out more Fireproof Games as they are available (note to Fireproof, please don't make your apps inaccesible to those with Kindle Fires!)
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I'm getting older and my fingers don't have the dexterity to do acrobatics. It is a true joy to have control of a key board while gamming. I like to put my main keys along the bottom but due to the arc I find the next row up is best if I want to reach all keys with little effort. I have a large collection of gaming keyboard rejects all back in their boxes to stay. Of late I had been working with a &#34;RAZER&#34;. Best of the designs I found but true to all the reviews I've seen the keys stop working nearly as fast as you can get it out of the box.
B0039NCJFO|1.0|Love the movie, we've seen it several times in the past.  This time however was awful, Terrible quality. Very disappointed with Amazon.
0375413405|5.0|This is the best cookbook I have every come across. It is not just a recipe book. It teaches you how to cook. It discusses what to look for in ingredients and how to prepare them for the recipe. Many useful techniques are described with both words and line drawings.  As the Forward explains &#34;the recipes are as detailed as we have felt they should be so the reader will know exactly what is involved and how to go about it.&#34; There are useful tips that aid your cooking in every recipe I have tried so far. And the recipes are so yum!<br /><br />This is not a book for that time when you been to prepare a meal in a short time or when you are feeling tired. It is indeed, as the Forward says, &#34;Written for those who love to cook&#34;.  But I think anyone who enjoys cooking, and enjoys taking the time to prepare really good food for others would fine great value in this book.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|it was working when i got it so I don't understand is why give it a 1not five signed by Isaac fromolz
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved it was told from a dogs point of view. Cute. Not much else to say without a spoiler. Certainly had its up and sad downs, just like life. Enjoyed it, occasionally laughed aloud, teared up too.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Thank you for helping me learn to live for life! My heart and thoughts have forever been changed.  Thank you again!
B00992CF6W|4.0|To everyone so they can know that this minecraft is not really worth it.<br /><br />So see if you can get a better minecraft
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game it's totally cute &amp;&amp;really fun. I like the fish &amp;&amp; the plants look really cool. The hints really help out to &amp;&amp;nemo is so cute(=
B00992CF6W|5.0|DO NOT ! buy block story discovery or craft mars all a pain in the well<br />you know I am pro at this game I built my own facility it's epic !
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's a great read. I love all the details but some of the scenes are drawn out. The ending leaves u wanting more!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My children love this app but they said there's no way to save their progress how do I do this
B005SAJJHM|5.0|Duh!  It's TBBT!  And it has one of the best episodes ever: &#34;The Pants Alternative&#34; (which is the specific episode I bought).
B000SC245E|5.0|My Brother MFC9840CDW printer started flashing the error message that this unit needed replacing, so I ordered it.  But knowing that many printer companies (HP, Brother among them) base such error messages purely on page count and never on actual need, I have held off from installing it.  It's been 3 months now, and still my printer is working very well with the original belt unit in place.  I consider my printer use to be medium, I use it in my home office and I would say my average monthly page count is between 300 and 600 each month, so if your printer usage is like mine, buy this unit when the printer starts to flash the error message but don't install it until you absolutely have to.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I have watched the T.V. show, but had never read the books, WOW, I love the way he writes.  This was my first book and looking forward to reading more of his works,  I like the mystery, but also how he interacts with Nikki Heat, Sizzle!!! Fun!!! Wanting to read more.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought this movie was going to be more of a teenage movie version of Glee. Instead it was a smart comedy and had lots of cool singing segments. It was pretty refreshing to have a movie about a bunch of college kids that didn't resort to the typical sex and drinking as the main story.  We rented this because we didn't have anything to do and my kids had said how good it was. I wish I would have rented it sooner.<br /><br />Highly entertaining and highly recommended.
B00A6CT012|3.0|I think the author is a bit extreme, but there's something I love/hate about this book.  I think I have been so scared of the idea of so little stuff, and the author gives one courage to let go off more of mine.  I am also much more aware of all the packaging plastic etc.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|This was one of the best Alex riders so far I can't wait to read the next one!Good job Ah
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book was very enjoyable and really interests you in reading it. Basically I loved it and you'll definitely love it too. I was sad it ended I wanted to keep reading it :(
B008C20TDG|5.0|I am really engaging is life changing food and exercise behaviors. The approach is explained simple, yet provides science-y stuff to back it up. The upfront information sharing is great and you don't feel like you are reading a boring science-y information book. It's so much more.  I am super excited about completing the whole30. All the tools are there for success. Thanks Melissa & Dallas!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Overall, it was a pretty good movie. Cooper and Lawrence were pretty good in their characterizations. Having said that, however, I'm glad I didn't pay for it in the theater. DeNiro as a work-from-home bookie making bets with the big boy like they were pals? Please. And what was that dancing thing? I found that totally unbelievable and the score they got way too convenient. It would have worked better if they had stuck with the mental health issues.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is an great game for us \\"Gamer Geezers\\" - lots of retro love with homages to several arcade shoot-em-up classics: Asteroids, Centipede/Millipede, Galaga/Galaxians, Sinistar. Plenty of potent power-ups to pack an extra punch!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|This is most certainly not Wahlberg's best. The acting was weak, wooden, and the ending was, well, unbelievable, as in bad . And who let Russell Crowe in with that hairdo and strained New Yahk accent?  Glad I didn't pay for this in a theater. Amazon's rate made it a bit more palatable.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|So different from most of the shoot 'em games that currently exist.  Fantastic. Very fast paced,  just flies on my S3. Brilliant use of color.  Reminds me of so many 80s and early 90s games I loved. It's Galaga meets AstroSmash meets Defender and better than all three combined.  Hooked.
B00BHU9DUK|3.0|The book is an important work of literature and this movie doesn't really capture any of what I loved about the book. I'd rather it were a conventional adaptation, not this contrived stage review.
B007Y36K46|5.0|I'm so tired of the people who are calling this movie a flop.  Disney's marketing department made a fatal error in leaving the word \\"Mars\\" out of the title, and releasing a trailer that made it seem like a run-of-the-mill gladiator flick.  Potential filmgoers would have recognized the name of this story's creator, Edgar Rice Burroughs, through the Tarzan connection, far more than the name John Carter.<br />The story was originally serialized 100 years prior to this film's release, and was instrumental in inspiring much of the science fiction and fantasy adventure that followed it, in books and movies.  And Disney ignored all that.<br />This film, the story-telling, the special effects, the characterizations, all were of a superior quality, and anyone familiar with the source material was highly satisfied with this treatment.<br />There were eleven books in the John Carter Of Mars series.  This franchise deserves to continue!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy this series so much. I can come home after a stressful day at work and watch one or two episodes and it takes all the stress away.  This is just a gentle, fun show.  No violence, no screaming, no hysterics.  Great story lines with some humor and very moral.  The story takes place in England in the late 1800's.  Life was harder back then in that they had to work so much harder than we do physically but I do not think that is such a bad things. It is well worth your time to watch.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|This book is so predictable and boring. It took all I had to finish this book. I don't even recommend it to someone who likes &#34;love stories&#34;.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|The book is a little slow starting.  It skips ahead several years from the end of the last book leaving you wonder what happened to everyone.  Some of these details were filled in as you went but not all.  By the end you were hooked into the new generation.  This is best described as a transition into the new conflict between the Cliftons and the Martinez family.
B00992CF6W|5.0|one of the best games on the app store it would be beter if it  had the ender dragon on it
B006PFSVYQ|4.0|DVD worked great out of the box. Saw the movie in the theater and liked it - this is a real value for the price. I have not tried the Blue Ray disc which also came with the combo pack but I anticipate it will work well also. There are other extra fun things on the disc including the making of the movie, a  hilarious short movie with two of the chicken stars including Carlos and several fun games for the whole family that can be played by simply using the remote control for your DVD player.<br /><br />There was also supposed to be an electronic version of the movie for downloading according to the advertisement but the offer for the download had expired several months ago and last year some time - long before I ordered the video so I believe this portion of the offer was misleading and should not be advertised as such, however, I still believe this to be a nice value even without the electronic download (Looks like the electronic download was designed for phones possibly - not sure if I would have used it anyway).
B00005JKG9|5.0|love it.<br /><br />But I need 18 words still so I guess I will type a few more here and good!
B0095EMOTM|5.0|He got it for a gift and listens to it all the time. Says its a lady singing?  David a girl?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is great! The only bad part is that your haveing connect with a social network to earn hearts.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|The game play was faster than what I thought it would be, which made it more challenging then I thought it to the game would be. it's good to have a game that you cannot be within the first few minutes of playing it. The graphics are awesome. This is a game worth having.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|Caught this last night on HBO. There is no plot, there is no acting, there is plenty of male skin (but as a woman, I have to say it was more awkward than hot), and apparently Tampa has a yellow haze that makes it look like the 6th level of hell hot. I know Soderbergh likes to give a yellow tone/tint to all of his movies, but this was like really bad overexposed yellow.<br /><br />If you like a movie that will make your brain dribble out of your ear from lack of stimulation, this is the movie for you.
1451673442|5.0|this is nothing short of amazing! if know what it's about, and you've tested it out then you'd understand. but the best part is this book helped me understand. I suggest it t all!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its a fun game you get money easily all the maps and cars are cool the grafics are awesome 5 stars
0061733199|4.0|Well written basic and intermediate survival info. Even if you know zero about survival it will get you up to speed and teach you mental, physical and practical steps to take in a multitude of scenarios.
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|If your looking for an action oriented, scifi flick, this one's a pretty good bet. It's surprisingly well written for a movie based on a video game. Premise is only slightly lame, but I was entertained.
B008CIUS72|1.0|I purchased this because I cannot download abobe for my Kindle. But never could get it to open some games, so it was a waste.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I don't like puzzle games, but I decided to try this one because of all the positive reviews.  I'm glad I did because I've found it to be pretty addictive.  All you have to do is match 3 or more tiles together in order to use weapons to destroy enemies within a certain time frame.  It took me a little while to get used to it, but once I got the hang of it, I couldn't put it down.  With its crude 80's music and graphics, this one is a keeper... at least for now.
B001IF277K|4.0|its a good battery ive only used it once and it lasts good enough<br /> planning on using it to upgrade my xperia x1 to android gingerbread for experimenting.....!!!
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is my favorite Disney film.  Beautiful music, gorgeous animation and magnificent color.  And oh, those dancing hippos, mushrooms and centaurs!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A compact game that values depth over breadth. Think 'Myst' updated and placed in one room. I look forward to future titles from Fireproof! Much more relaxing than your average game.
B00CJ1PXNW|5.0|They have a sound all their own although I would put them in the same category as The Sword.<br />This album will grow on you,bought their previous release also and it is just as good.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you don't have a lot of time but like gaming this is the game for you you can play a lot or just play off and on
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game drew me in and kept me fascinated. It has beautiful, intricate graphics, and the puzzles are tough without being frustrating. I look forward to seeing your next masterpiece.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's really easy, and it only keeps my attention for so long. I need 8 more words before I'm done.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I don't often buy entire albums, but this one was well worth it. You'll enjoy it. That all I have to say.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've stopped using my digital alarm clock. This app has almost everything I want from an alarm clock, except I wish the time display were larger.
030758836X|5.0|I enjoyed this book way too much. An excellent, modern-day, love-hate story that you just can't put down. Lots of fun and interesting characters. Well worth the time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining! It provides entertainment and definitely makes down time go by quickly. This is great for kids or adults adults and other players are usually very helpful when needed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story line is timely and believable.<br />Characters &#34;own&#34; their roles.<br />Scenery is beautiful.<br />Music score is spot-on!<br />It is like watching a book unfold.<br />It truly belongs on Masterpiece Theater!
1439102430|5.0|I really loved this volume of Kathy Reichs books,  I have kept every copy after reading them, so far I have all her books, thank you again Amazon
B0093FNZT6|2.0|For a scientist his description of his NDE was very vague.  When he started talking about 'the Creator' and 'Heaven' I realised he was just another religious nutter.,
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My daughter and I just finished this book and it was amazing. It is about a middle school kid who was born with birth defects and is what you might call deformed. Ever since he was a kid his mom always homeschooled him and so now he is going to a real school for 5th grade. He goes through many challenges that every middle school kid should read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Sadly, I have not been the avid reader I once was.<br /><br />I could not put this book down. Like his two previous books, Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, the writing in this book took me places I have never been and kept me longing for more.<br /><br />As with both those books, I highly recommend this one as well.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|this is the best app that's helped me organize what I have to pay out compared to what's coming in!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game. Daughter loves it. Easy to navigate and fun horses, outfits, and backgrounds.. no problems with it.<br /><br />.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It really worked great at first, but today it seemed to be behind what was posted on my pc.  When I signed in this morning on my kindle I checked the news feed and noticed it was older posts from earlier in the week.  I signed on the pc and it was current.  Other than that I like it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Quick way to exercise my brain and have a few minutes of enjoyment. I had this on my phone and added it to my new Kindle Fire HD. It is a lot easier to use on the bigger screen.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|A very well done film version of Austen's Persuasion, this one is particularly worth watching for the incredible presence and performance of Ciaran Hinds. As always when I discuss film or TV, I won't give spoilers, but if you know the story, you'll be very pleased with this version, especially in HD.
1439152802|5.0|Out of the four Kate Morton books thus far, this is probably my second favorite. Has the same twists and turns that keeps you guessing until everything is revealed.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|There have been chopped up versions of this shown on cable TV through the years, but nothing even comes close to the original. The only thing I would have liked would be to able to have seen it in HD. The incredible cast is filled with award winning actors at the beginnings of their careers and Lawrence Kasdan's script was sharp and on point in speaking of a generation who had moved from being whom they thought they should be to discovering whom they had actually become.<br /><br />So many memorable lines in this movie make it a joy to watch uncut and unedited. If you've never seen the full movie, I highly recommend it. It has stood the test of time quite well.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|It was good to watch, once. It's long and slow, but beautiful. I loved the acting and singing is amazing but I wouldnt want to own it or watch it again any time soon
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is an incredibly well done game in the style and spirit of classic arcade space shooters with modern graphics and music. Even if you miss the free download as app of the day, it's worth it.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|Had to watch it for class, not really my kind of movie though. It is a good film and a classic but it is rather slow, I like faster pace movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is much better than temple run 1 and 2.  I love all of the characters you get to choose from. I would give it 10 stars if I had the choice to. That is how much I love this app  if you are thinking about buying it for an app this is definitely an the app to get. HAVE FUN PLAYING IT
B00899F0G8|4.0|I will not buy this on amazon instant because they are charging too much. I mean I cant even download this unless I dishout more money for a freaking kindle fire! It is stupid to pay so much for a show I could lose if amazon goes under. Sorry but amazon you lost my purchase. I bought one episode and just couldnt bring myself to buy the rest of the season.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|Watched Rangoon with my seven and five year old and couldn't believe the language used in a cartoon!  Ended up turning it off and watching something else.  Very disappointed!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I really have nothing to say against it, it is amazing. I cant wait for season 4. Oh and I am not a zombie fan, really. I hate blood and guts and stuff jumpin out at you. But this show rocks.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Not too shabby for a free game.  Battles are fun.  Takes a bit to get used to on the controls, but you can customize the HUD to your preferences and that helped alot.  Have not made any in-game purchases yet, I'll have to keep on eye on when the kids are playing it so that they can't.  You need to be online in order for some things to be done, like removing charms from items, not sure why.  There is also a multi-player mode but I have not tried that yet either.  All in all a good Diablo dungeon crawler type game.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|I loved this, its so artsy and pretty. The visuals are STUNNING. Love love love it.<br />Worth a watch but not a buy
B000F3UAFC|3.0|GOOD QUALITY, EXACTLY WHAT WAS ADVERTISED.  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO FRIENDS.  I REALLY LIKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCT AS WELL.
B004M4VSYW|5.0|Amazing acting, filming, directing and so on. A must watch! But make sure you have a lot of water at hand :)
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I'm glad I didn't read the reviews of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" before watching it; otherwise, I might have been dissuaded from doing so.  I love movies that require you to think and this was just that sort.  I'll definitely be watching this again because I'm sure there were things I missed the first go 'round.  It's not often a movie causes a person to examine their life or their place in the world, but this movie has done that for me.  The acting was amazing and the makeup and editing were first rate.  Even though certain scenes were difficult to watch, it was so beautifully filmed, even the difficult scenes demanded your attention.  Part of me feels sorry for the folks here to called this a waste of time.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|It was recommended to me by a friend. It gives a interesting perspective into why some people are successful but is a real broad interpertation of successful people. Nice read though.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Harken back to the days of lots of action, lots of shooting and more than a few laughs.  There's plenty of ridiculous things in this movie (like the bad guys car that NEVER runs out of gas); but if you understand that this is not supposed to be a serious drama- just an 80's style action movie in the Arnold fashion- then you will be pleased with this movie.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|It was a while that I fell out of love with Rod Stewart. Since he decided he was a crooner. Oh, don't get me wrong, I love a crooner, just not Rod. I am partial to the late 70's Rod, but also enjoy the 80's Rod. Maggie May and Hot Legs were great songs. Well, Time takes me back to the late 80's to early 90's. You know the Forever Young days. He used the mandolin and violin a lot in the songs back then, and I found this album so much similar. I know todays' Rod is not a spring chicken and needs to slow down, so he won't be rockin' out like he did waaaaay back when, but I am glad to see him back this far. This album from the first song  had me boppin' along. I even played a couple songs twice. Then when the hubby came home from work, I played a couple for him. So I really loved Brighton Beach, it was a beautiful song. I also loved the beat in Beautiful Morning. I found it hard to sit still and ended up singing along like I'd known it forever. I lastly loved the track, Time. What a great tune! It really grabbed me.<br />All I can say is welcome back Rod!
B00CFOXBX2|3.0|So, the first half of the movie is about Emily's (Rooney Mara) depression, from which she's been suffering four hard years, since her formerly wealthy husband Martin (Channing Tatum) was sent to prison for insider trading.  Initially, when still able to maintain her ritzy lifestyle in Greenwich, CT, Emily saw Dr. Seibert (Catherin Zeta-Jones) to help her through the tough times.  But then times got really tough and she had to move back to NYC to find work; without health insurance, continuing to see Dr. Seibert wasn't an option.  The movie begins when Martin gets out of prison, and he and Emily must \\"reintegrate\\" back to some sort of life together.  Daunted, Emily purposely drives her car into the wall of a parking garage, which results in an encounter at the ER with one Dr. Jonathan Banks (Jude Law), who becomes her personal psychiatrist and begins prescribing a long list of meds to counteract her depression, including a new one called Ablixa.<br /><br />There's a lot of time spent establishing Emily's state of mind, and a lot of talk about antidepressants and their side-effects.  The Big Bad Pharma Industry gets the type of representation you'd expect.  Emily becomes desperate in her desire to end her life, but knows enough to reach out for help when she needs it and grows overly attached to Dr. Banks, who has a wife and stepson.  The way the dispension of prescriptions is handled can be cliche -- we see the TV ads, doctors are involved in shilling for the drug companies, every woman Emily encounters is on an antidepressant -- which in of itself isn't bad.  However, this time was supposed to be used to set the scene, as it were.  Instead, the movie seems to go off on a tangent, providing commentary about society's/doctors' use of pychotropic meds.  The set-up just goes on too long.<br /><br />Then there's a murder, which is hinted at in the movie's opening shots with images of a bloody floor.  But after that there's a flashback and yada, yada, yada -- it's like anhour later.  Once the murder finally takes place, we're treated to a much different movie.  It actually becomes a thriller.  Except at this point it's not too difficult to figure out what's behind the events that have transpired.  The only thing left to wonder at is how the resolution will unfold, and I don't want to give that away or there's little point in watching.  I will say, reviewers have compared the plot to Hitchcock...I couldn't stop thinking how much it resembles \\"Basic Instinct.\\"  And yes, the subject matter is mature so keep the kids out of the room while you're watching.<br /><br />There are some aspects of the movie that are hard to swallow -- \\"contrived\\" is an apt description.  But it's a well-made movie with excellent acting from Jude Law.  To me, this was by far Law's show.  Channing Tatum isn't a major player.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is the victim of poor writing.  And Rooney Mara is great, but her character is never engaging. Dr. Banks is the one with whom we become involved, as he struggles to get himself out of the mess in which his doctoring -- past and present -- has put him.<br /><br />The reason I think I didn't enjoy the movie more is that it really seems like two different movies -- the first half should have been a quarter, not a half.  And again, there were too many times where the plotting just felt forced.  It's definitely worth watching if you like thrillers; just be prepared for things to be a little slow getting out of the gate. I generally enjoy Steven Soderbergh's work (for those who don't know, he directed \\"Side Effects), but am basing my review of the movie on its own merits.  I wanted more thrilling, and less expositioning.
0425263908|3.0|A very disturbing view of how sex takes away all our reasoning skills.  Eva, fresh out of college and starting a career, is sexually harassed by Gideon, the CEO of her parent company.  He is controlling, invasive and even carries on a hidden, non-sexual relationship with a former lover, even to the point of avoiding Eva for an entire dinner while engaged in conversation with this former lover.  Yet, because the sex is so good, Eva stays with this man.  This is a relationship of two, unequal people, which is disturbing to watch as it builds on a very shaky foundation.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot - I am a (retired) electrical engineer who spent 11 years in Huntsville AL during the &#34;man to the moon&#34; period so the topic of this book was particularly interesting.  I think the writing was excellent, good flow, very descriptive and very reasonable sets of problems faced and solved.<br /><br />I am going to watch other reviews of this book to see how it appeals to readers who weren't as caught up in space travel kinds of things.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Better than IE<br />easy to use<br />Fast to use<br />That all I have to say<br />Bye Bye Good Bye<br />Curtis
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I can access my documents from anywhere with the dropbox app!  For those of us who need access to our work all the time, this is the ultimate tool.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Still getting the hang of it.  Like the variables.  Thanks for the hard work and design and fun.  Good bye.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Have been a fan of the TV show for years so finally decided to read one of the books. I have to say, after watching the show since it came on, the book was not what I was expecting. I did enjoy it though, and plan on reading more of the &#34;Bones&#34; books in the future.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|This game have five levels that will challenge toddlers of different skill levels.  A good buy even if they didn't read the book.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|A little slow to start but then it takes off and just as you think you have it pinned there are twists that keep you glued to this book needing to know what happens next.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|This has kept our 2 year old amused for a few weeks.  In addition to the puzzle itself, there are balloons and bubbles to pop upon completion of each one.  Not a bad purchase at all.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this book! We read it several times in one sitting. So many great details and effects. I would definitely recommend this book!
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is excellent. Suspenseful, creepy and keeps you wanting more. I look for word to watching Asylum. The series is definitely strange. I'm not sure why I decided to download it, but I'm glad I did.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David's characters are great.  Loved the story line.  Loved the fast paced action. Great ending.  Can't wait to get my hands on the next one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game!!!! I love it! My daughter loves the game even more! Very good graphics and challenging sling slot aims and bombing birds.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Action packed Comic Book style story but done well with the perfect actors for each part. Laura Croft is my type of woman; smart, strong, sexy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game overall for everyone in my family! Easier than Bridges. The more level you reach, the harder it gets....good for brain cells to work overtime!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is really cool game but i wish it gave u more money at the beginning of the game. i wish the upgrades for the trucks and buses were less expensive . but it all adds up bc the game is free.  Keyera Marie Estes
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Hubby played this game and he loved it! However you had to buy the game to continue, that is one bad part but at least we know what to expect!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Watched it yesterday. Enjoyed it and didn't fall asleep as I usually do.<br />I would recomend this movie to anyone.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is a good game but I have played it in a good while to get the feel of it. Great graphics and a bit more challenging that the original Original Angry Birds.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great read ! Interesting characters and development of story line. Well plotted. Typical Baldacci production well worth the price and more.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A true classic and well worth the time to read on a rainy day. A few glitches or some mis spellings occurred but you can not beat this complete Sherlock Holmes stories all in one for a Kindle.
B00130UFY2|5.0|I like Matt Damon and also the great story line. A lot of action, a lot of suspense and lots of people involved.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It is one of the GOOD games for kids to play. I have enjoyed playing this game for hours and I don't have to wait long in doctor's office LOL!
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Stylish and addictive.  I'm not usually one for bullet hell shooters, but this is pretty fun.  Plenty of variety in the waves and power-ups, easy to play but a challenge to beat.  Would be well-worth the price, if it hadn't been the Free App of the Day.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Online I've seen that they are releasing additional material for this game either this summer or in the fall.<br /><br />Hope it's true. And it's supposed to be free. My girlfriend and I really had a great time playing this game on our Kindle Fire!!
B00BQBNK04|5.0|This cd is a beautiful cd. Awesome music. Listening to cd I can picture wut scene it on. Awesome cd
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Absolutely love this game!!! My sister(already an addict) turned me on to the game.I'm happy to say I'm completely addicted!!! Try it and you'll be a fan to!!lol
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised on the good acting, good story and good special effects. The ending was abrupt though. I hope the story continues in more installments.
B003XVYLDU|1.0|I cannot understand anything about this book. Maybe it's considered art. I know one thing though. I won't buy any more books by this author.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|le Carre surprised me. Brilliant as say fifteen years ago, after some novels that were in my view below this level
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Brought to life the historic events of our county as it was growing ... Very moving and eye opening.  Thank God for this man who fought for what was right, the true freedom for all men.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|Don't buy it because I have great Internet but this game just won't work so if you don't want to waste money don't get it.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|loved theses movie pq and aq is perfect , arrived very fast ,<br />outstanding movies plus reg free , only bad its only 3d version which i dont mind
B0042LJTQO|5.0|All of Alfred Brendel's recordings show such understanding of the music that they are always enjoyable.  The German Dances are always played as a group in concert and they are very short.  It would be good for students to be able to go directly to one of the dances as well as hear the whole set.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I read it in 3 days.  It was ok but not anything I could not put down. I would still recommend to friends.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun for all ages!!!  I think a lot of people would very much enjoy this game.
B003LXXEFG|5.0|This band has a few, but this one is 100%. Pop tunes, hits, and soundscapes. Great for driving in the rain.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|incredible footage, interviews<br />Linda, irving azoff, geffen, Frey and Henley in depth , Walsh  hysterical<br />great Concert and studio footage<br />Glyn Johns and Bill S.
B00B8WXG9G|1.0|Getting the product was fine but the cd sucks. I guess anka needs some money, I always loved his songs in the good old days!
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|great tunes from all facets SS career<br />only missing one favorite from Manassas<br />&#34;So Begins the Task&#34;  other wise great<br />Tree Top Flyer, Cost of Freedom, Marianne are favorites
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I got it to give me some songs that i love and found new ones to enjoy. I also got it because Garth doesn't like iTunes.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I love it. Even though the middle was a bit slow and got super fantasy, there was something magical about it overall. The beginning was awesome and the ending was awesome. There aren't too many sci-fi movies you can say that about.<br /><br />Would love to see a sequel.<br /><br />Andy
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Very good game. Lots of expensive stuff In here that is FREE! I love this get it it has stickers, paint brushes, completed pencils, and much more.  :)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|great game I love it.  good gameplay and sometimes very difficult. I played zepto labs other games so this is no exception
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|One of the best games made for android, I played it for days, good graphics and sounds and brilliant world design. This game is suitable for 13+ as it has bad language and violent scenes but apart from that a all round great game
B00CRR5YA0|5.0|Giacchino truly knows how to make a score &#34;sound Star Trek&#34;. His use of leitmotifs really brings a sense of emotion as he modifies the way the chords sound to connote the feeling in certain scenes while maintaining the over-arching theme of the movie's soundtrack. The main Star Trek theme seems to have been a bit softened from the 2009 version, with more string and some additional soft brass that really fills out the sound and oddly works for the film, giving it a sense of intrigue and expansion befitting a sequel. &#34;London Calling&#34; is one of the best soundtrack songs I've heard in a while, and may replace &#34;Enterprising Young Men&#34; that I've been using as my phone's ringtone for the past 3 years.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Space ship arcade game to the max! Ultimate shooter with tons of upgrades and weapons, this game is a home run!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love this book. I have never laughed so hard while reading a hot panty dropping romantic and just totally enjoyable book. Drew is a dream (especially while pursuing Kate) and Kate is a terrific lovely and smart woman. I am a fan  and can't wait for the next book of Emma Chase.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is one of my fav games. anybody can play it too. my little cousin and my grandma both love it
B00CDT41RY|5.0|We loved the movie though there was a lot of violence that I don't like watching.<br />I've always been into the classic spaghetti westerns and this does a homage to those movies in a modern way.<br />Great cast and Soundtrack!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Very well done except........spoiler.alert!!...............Wrath of Khan............C'mon J.J........Khan? and Kirk reversing the radiation poisioning scene.........jeez , but I will still buy it and the 3-D was excellent! I would of given it 5 stars except for the copying of the previous story rip offs!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Good story telling. A movie to have on your kids' movie shelf.<br />My family enjoyed it and will watch again and again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Great games and fun to play!! However after each mini game or caring caring for your horse pop up advertisements for other games always appear. Very annoying! Other than that the game is wonderful!
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|my boys love legos and Batman.<br />What more could you ask for?<br />batman has dark humor in this one movie
B00CW665VI|5.0|I just love this book. Is amazing, funny and so well put together. I can't wait to see what she Will right next. I truly enjoy and recommend this book.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Cant say enough about this movie. A true classic story from ERB is enough said.<br />What would be even more epic is if Disney gets the message and makes JC2.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I chose 5 stars because It is so cool, Its a good pass time and fun for all ages!!! AWESOME!!!
B002JB7H8G|3.0|Very early Megadeth song. Not one of the top ten Megadeth songs but still very good! It is definitely need to be on you Megadeth Play list!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this and i thought another one of these games! But i was wrong. This game is so fun
B002N5N5M0|4.0|LIKE THE SERIES!!..<br /><br />I LOOK FOWARD TO COLLECTING<br />EVERY SEASON(SINCE I DON'T HAVE SHOWTIME)...<br /><br />I HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO KEEP IT<br />GOOD AND BETTER...<br /><br />THANKS!!
B003L20IJM|5.0|I bought it for my great grand kids and the love it.  The service was great.  Enjoy Amazon,  it's been a pleasure to know them.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The Way of Kings is a huve book with deep characters that sucked me into a new world. Again Brandon Sanderson developed a new system of magic that hasn't been seen before. Great writing lets you feel the characters and see the world they live in.<br />The only con is, no book number two yet...
B000F1IQNC|5.0|My great grandkids loved this movie,  I had recorded in DVR but one day I lost all I had recorded.  I bought it for them.  The service was great.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I have always liked Carole King as a songwriter and singer. Tapestry really showcased her talent. She is one of the most important people of the R&R era, and Tapestry is one of the top selling recordings of all time.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|I've never flown RC planes because of the fear of destroying  an expensive item after about 10 seconds of use.<br />I got this out of curiosity and I am trying and trying and actually not crashing most of the  time. I am now considering<br />to attempt the real thing. I enjoyed this very much.
B0027BOL4G|2.0|The facts are presented in a factual way.<br />No entertainment value. Pure boring facts !!<br />After the first 40 minutes, i wanted to turn it off.<br />But i kept at it and finished it. Interesting facts of how food gets to your table.
B003O86FMW|5.0|great book.. read it in two days because I could not stop.. i can only recomment it to everybody who needs a book to read...
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The writing is extremely dramatic.  The performances are all excellent.  Charlie Hunnam!  and Katie Sagal!  Dedicated to proving the proposition &#34;Even bikers can be human.&#34;
B00BUCW54Q|3.0|Not one of toms best had a lot of action as most of his films. I think a little less would have been better
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Great program for young artists. Professionals can  use this to make mock-ups of design concepts. love the layers options and drawing tools, tranparencies etc.
B008602KQI|4.0|Of course trying not to compare to book but a good movie. Can't wait to see how the next turns out
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It is cool, love the graphics ..just not as fast paced. It takes a while before the game really gets going.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I'm sure you have heard all the great things said about this movie so I don't know what I can add.<br />But I didn't know the history of this story so I was held in suspense. I enjoyed the wardrobe, Ben Affleck was everything he has been said to be.<br /><br />I will admit I thought it was going to be boring but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining and it helped me have a better understanding of why there still is not peace in the middle east.<br /><br />I recommend this for people over 16 yrs of age.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Love the graphics and story line. The way Spider-Man can swing around the buildings is really cool and the perspective stays intact with no gliches is really high end..love it!!
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|I love this movie. It is visually captivating. It sounds good. It woke me up to what some people want the future to truly be like. And I have become more involved with local politics because of this.  In the movie they have these things they call sick sticks and now they actually have sticks like this but so far they are not approved to be used on the public. There are other aspects of this movie that while futuristic in the movie, have come to pass as well.<br /><br />It's excited, it's emotional, and of course it has your typical feel good ending, but that's what we watch movies for right? entertainment.<br /><br />There's no nudity, very little cussing if any.  There is violence but I don't think they show any blood.<br /><br />I would recommend this for sci fi geeks, 13 and older.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play Flow at the end of my long day. It's mentally challenging yet I find it rather &quot;soothing&quot; to see the puzzles come together. The level of creativity involved plus the bright colors seem to bring together the left and right brain... OCDs like me who have difficulty&quot;shutting down&quot; at days end may also find a remedy in a few rounds of Flow.
B00COGY2P2|3.0|I would have given this 3.5 stars but I couldn't figure out how to do that lol.<br />The thing I liked best about this movie was the chemistry between Tom Cruise (TC) and the starlett I can't think of her name. It was believable and funny.<br /><br />This is not a happy, feel good, good guy wins bad guy loses type of movie.<br />It tackles an event that could very well happen, and then there are consequences that must be dealt with and who likes to deal with consequences right?  lol<br /><br />If you like movies that make you think, well, you have to follow it, and that include themes  that mirror real life...<br />you should watch this.<br /><br />I watched this with my 14 year old son and 21 year old son. I don't think there was nudity, and the violence is no worse than<br />the video games they play.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|One of the best series ever! The acting the plots and cases are genius and deserve awards, fir actors, director and writers.
0439023513|5.0|This book was sent to us very quickly and in the best condition for &#34;used&#34; I have ever seen.  We were thrilled to death for this purchase. I will definitely recommend buying from these people.  I also will probably use them again for purchases.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!!!!!  Was very excited about season 3 and now I'm hooked....Waiting for season four to begin.  Great show!
0345525558|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.<br />A novel about love between a mother & daughter done through<br />a bouquet of flowers.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! It's very comparable to Lost, story-line, plot, and quality-wise. I just wish season 4 was as good as the first 3.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book and with the kindle books great features like a dictionary and highlighter was just so much better. I also really liked the detail omg Suzanne Collins is somehow the best writer in the world to me based on 3 books she's so talented and she should make other hungergames books from another family's child's point I love you Suzanne Collins! :) &lt;333
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The app does the basics well, such as browse, bid and list. However you cannot give neutral or negative feedback!  Positive is the only option.  Otherwise it is a convenient alternative to the regular laptop.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|Now that game loft made that terrible update the game sucks now. I cant<br />understand or read anything on the game
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Old school adventure made to meet & exceed our present day picture and audio expectations!  I saw the 3D version of the movie in the theater and purchased the Four-Disc Combo for continued home viewing.  Walt Disney Studio, please give us fans of this movie a sequel or two to make it a trilogy as originally intended.  Thank you in advance!
B006LSZECO|5.0|There is a reason this has such great reviews and they don't lie. A must read. I am happy I did
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Definitely gave great insights on ways to express love to different people. Definitely want to read more in the series.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Colleen is an excellent author. She really know how to make your emotions come out. Will definitely get her other books
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have just bought this game it is very addictive but at the oNe time enjoyable l cant wait to progress further into this game, at the moment is<br />I am playing with the charger on thanks for a great game. Will be buying more.  Champion
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can't get enough. . Love love love . I was in tears quite a few time. She really pulled the emotion out of me
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Im only on the first board and already i am addicted!!! The characters are cute and the sounds they make remind me of the minions from despicable me movie. Its a fun game for all ages. My 4 year old plays with me. I'm a perfectionist so when i play each numbered level i must get all the stars and thats where the challenge comes in. I am recommending this app because it is fun and great for all ages. I got it free today! Thanks Amazon!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer tells a wonderful story with characters who are believable.  I have read all his fiction books and eagerly await the next volume.
B0096MM9GG|1.0|Two problems:<br /><br />1) The game won't go past the \\"loading\\" screen.  It just sits there spinning the pinwheel for a bit, then drops out to the Droid home screen.  No error message, no hints, no clues.<br /><br />2) Why does the icon on the apps page say \\"POP Classic\\" instead of \\"Prince of Persia\\"?  That's just kinda stupid.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|I have to agree with a few comments already here. James Caviezal would have been such a better choice to play Reacher. I just couldnt get past Cruises small size (and I don't care what you say, Cruise just isn't that great an actor. all I see when I see him in a movie is him jumping on a couch in front of Oprah Winfrey looking like a hairless ape). there is a reason every book describes Reacher. So we all have a set image in our minds what he should look like, very large and tough. other then the coloring, The Rock, would have been an excellent choice too (size wise) I was very disappointed and hope if there is another movie (doubtful with the straight to video release) they choose someone more appropriate.
B001J20ZIA|5.0|With so much bullying going on in the schools this video teaches a lesson even for young children.Never too young to start anti-bully in the home. Even killing of an ant by kids.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have purchase Downton Abbey since the beginning.  It is a gread story with wonderful actors.  I will buy every season when it becomes available.
B006GBHCIK|4.0|It was one my favorite from Vangelis, back in the old days.  Still good, but its age is starting to show...
193700788X|1.0|Charlaine Harris should be ashamed.  Horrible book and storyline to obviously rap up this series quickly.  Sam is bring and vanilla and Sookie should have been with Bill.  What a waste!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so addictive my brother and I almost every day connect with each other. I am still waiting for the 0.7.0 update. The only problem with the app is how long u wait for updates
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The only reason I gave it 1 star is because \\"zero\\" stars was not an option.  I am not surprised that Susan Sarandon is in such a lousy movie, but I am surprised that Tom Hanks is in it.  He normally stars is good movies, not so after watching this disaster.  Save yourself and your precious time & don't bother with this one.
B0093X80VQ|1.0|This story was too strange for me. It just wasn't interesting.  It is ok for kids but there are so many more interesting books out there.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|This is a great album. Wish I had known about this guy years ago. Can't believe he became so popular in South Africa and never become popular in the good old USA.
0399226907|5.0|I really enjoy reading this book to my child. It's a great book!!! The holes on the pages of the board book where the caterpillar \\"ate through\\" are a great visual aid that I'm sure my one year old will grow to appreciate. Very happy with this purchase!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I always enjoy a book by John Grisham; I like his writing style.  The GOOD guys won.  The characters are believable.
031250926X|5.0|I'm sure I love reading this book more than my one year old understands. But I truly do love this book. The slides are a must have for this book. I first saw it during reading time at the library and said to myself I must have it. This makes story time so much fun!!!
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Good beats, great rhymes, broad topics and the same ol Wayne.  Consistency speaks louder than sells...I'll buy a Wayne Album in advance without hearing a second.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|A friend just turned me on to this series, quite simple but very original and keeps you interested. I also recommend the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; which ties up all the loose ends leftover from this series
B000IZXR20|4.0|Far from a perfect movie, but it is logical.  She clearly stated at what point that &#34;guy&#34; makes the mistake and gets everyone killed.  Comedy, great sound and visuals and a short story line.  Make it a good one time a year watch!
B0041CGP02|5.0|I haven't had a chance to listen to it. It's my favorite of all of his CD's! Bon Jovi  is a great person and I Love his Greastest Hits.
B001YV5068|5.0|Love how Spike Lee is changing it up. Love Clive Owen and the Denzel Washington cat and mouse play and great acting all around. Great story line. Great directing. Didn't realize it was a Spike Lee movie at first. GREAT!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|played it for awhile until I ran out of bubbles. that was the bummer. when you like something you run out of lives lol
B004499LX0|5.0|Awesome story. Based on the British play. Only 4 actors. Wonderful acting. Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Jude Law need i saw more.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|Totally different from what I thought it was.  It is not a terrible game, just terrible for me. It would be a wonderful game for children with minor learning disabilities, since it seems to be more of an educational game than just a game for fun.<br /><br />As I stated previously, not a terrible game, just terrible for me.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I purchased this case for my niece and she loves it.  The case is built well, very sturdy and the color is right on with the picture.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|...instead of just being able to rate the episode of doctor who that i just watched.<br /><br />Excellent!<br /><br />Plus the 3 words for the mandatory word count.....
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a fun game ,  but it could be better.<br />You should add more easy missions in the beginning and make expansions easier to get.
B00BSBY38A|2.0|From the trailers, I thought The Life of Pi would be uplifting, with elements of an adventure story.  Instead, it was a brutal lesson of survival in the animal kingdom.  I don't choose to watch those shows where the poor antelope is ripped to shreds by its predator.  I had no idea that that's what I'd be subjected to in this movie.  And to what end?  What uplifting, or even edifying, conclusion can we reach?  Oh yes - animals are animals.  Survival of the fittest.  A tiger may be trained, but he'll never love you or be your pet.  This is not entertainment, in my book.  The 2 stars are for the excellent acting and animation.  Everything else was just upsetting and depressing.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a spinoff that is actually so awesome it deserves more kuddos the way it was designed and layout is brilliant. It gives you the 80's feel with a 2013 twist. Literally kick ass
B004TI5N38|5.0|love the John Puller series.  Action and suspense.  Baldacci style is captivating.  Anyone who like the Jack Reacher series will like the two puller books.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the third time I have read The Thorn Birds. All I can say is I love it, as much today as the first time I read it!
B000HKYN74|5.0|I used to be a big fan of the original Star Trek series but Enterprise is the best Star Trek of them all.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|In my opinion this game is very fun but can be pretty confusing!!! There for I rate this game 4 out of 5!!!!! Although I would recommend getting this game!
B000T1CPIK|5.0|I love this album and certainly wish that Robbie Williams would produce more jazz!  He does absolutely brilliant things with it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm almost at the end of this fantastic book and can't describe the feelings this book gave me while reading it . Is just the perfect book for me , a teenager of 14 years old which only needs love and mystery to get in to something . I like how real the characters of Colleen Hoover are , I just feel while reading this I'm reading some kind a diary from a girl , those feelings are so accurately and precise . Just another leaving person . The way the Sky talks , how swearing in the book is as normal as swearing between  teenager these days , is not a book who tries out to paint a perfect life of a teenager , this book make us teenager or adults to like it , to feel it , to LIVE IT  , because we have experienced all those feelings talks about it. Now Dean Holder , Most of the time when we read a book , a romantic book we get to like and feel those feelings the main character describes about his/her love , because obviously they describe them as an angel fall from heaven , but with Dean not only Sky describes him as heaven , they way he wants sky to feel everything he does , how much he cares , how cute but hot he is . I like how he , from the start demonstrated his attraction and interest for everything single thing Sky does . I love books , just as Sky , the day I found  a boy who asks me to read him some nice book for him ,  I'll know he is the right one . I really lived holder , dean holder .<br />I also like this a  very liberal book , sex , alcohol , gays , suicide , Mormons everything is in it .  I really liked all the mystery that came from the  love of  Sky and Holder . I sincerely died when I readed the real meaning of his tattoo hopeless , hope-less .<br /><br />Truly amazed by this book . And now waiting few days for the next book which is from the perspective of holder  , i know I'll die just reading that .
B007T2XC7A|5.0|I have always been a fan of Miss Jones.  She and her band are very talented and this album shows with such veracity.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|I'd ? to delete all the crud I make and there is limited videos so I'm not a fan of the app much it's not worth  99¢
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I can't help it, I love this kid's music, although I'm sure that I'm NOT in the target demographic - hahaha!
0788859544|5.0|Love this movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The saga continues. I can't wait for next season. This is quality TV. The acting & production are beyond compare.
0449011909|5.0|best book in the series. Lots of battles and killings going very exciting book from start to finish. A must read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|good times<br />like it alot strait forward but still a great game for the simple minded kid in you. thanks for reading. I I I I I I I o I I obi ibijj o ibinoj
B00BRYDKM8|4.0|This book is a very good summary and review of organization and presentation techniques for speakers, workshop leaders, instructors, etc. The author draws from his analysis of TED talks as well as concepts from Toastmasters and well-known presentations (e.g., Steve Jobs, Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and others). Despite the book title, he appears to reference only about a dozen TED talks from the 200+ he claims to have studied. I believe that there is something in this book for anyone doing public speaking. Even though I have given a very large number of talks, lectures, classes, etc., this book will force me to re-examine my style and presentation in the future.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed it and our grandson who is a Dinosaur fan saw the movies for the first time loved the movies
B0094M2S5A|4.0|Great oldie. Love the sound track. Not many movies like these made any more. Good look back with an unfortunate tragic topic as the foundation to the story.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This movie is incredible. Hands down best snowboarding video i have ever seen.......but the cinematography is just amazing. Very well put together, i highly recommend!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I enjoy this kind of game and this is a good entry to the genre.  Match and clear those tiles so you can pay it again.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|If you like pausing a movie every 20 minutes to talk with someone about what in the world is going on this will be a great movie. Everyone speaks in riddles but the twist isn't even very exciting.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|For some reason, the designers of this game really enjoy killing you (the shark).  While it has some cute touches and it makes me laugh maniacally when I eat the swimmers, the game quickly starts throwing out jellyfish and vastly increases your food intake requirements leading to a quick death.<br /><br />NEWSFLASH: I am not feeding a quarter into an arcade game every 90 seconds.  I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this game, but dying every few minutes got un-fun very quickly.  I've deleted it from my device.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fun game, you get to cook and meet new friends. If you play you will also want to try Bakery Story.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I liked the originality of the framing of the story; as with most of life and marriages there are experiences that become walls that then all of the believes of that life must try to cross.  The tension in the lives of the characters was tightly wound and restrictive.  The melting of that tension was the real story.
B000SEIK2S|1.0|The author begins this sci-fi adventure with a novel lure, \\"I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army.\\"<br /><br />This is an excellent way to draw in a reader. And true to the concept of a septuagenarian the author talks us through an old man's point of view from his enlistment in the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF), his transport via Nairobi Beanstalk (a reference to a space elevator introduced by Robert A. Heinlein's 1982 novel 'Friday'), his body conversion, his 'brainpal' implant, some basic training and finally a series of Robison Crusoe war experiences.<br /><br />This book carries itself on the weight of dialog. That is to say, this book is dialog-heavy. Not the kind of dialog-heavy as found in `Glengarry Glen Ross', but rather the dialog-heavy as in visiting grandpa at an old folk's home. There are times when you need to excuse yourself from reading and just flip ahead to the point of the adventure.<br /><br />The book is written well enough that I finished it. It is not written well enough (nor the characters interesting enough, nor the sci-fi world relevant enough) for me to invest my reading time on the other author's novels strung together to form a series.<br /><br />Perhaps you may like it. I started with the Kindle sample then made the purchase. As a fledging writer I love to read mediocre novels and watch insignificant movies to their final conclusion. I do this not because I've already invested the time, but in order to find the flaws in plot, theme, and other classic mistakes.<br /><br />You never know where you may find a true treasure of genius in the cornucopia of sci-fi mediocrity. If you look this at this low-crash trash it speaks volumes about incompetence in writing.<br /><br />The classic mistakes of this adventure are (a) combining ideas from other books into an array of isolated events, (b) steadfast character with no change potential, (c) mishandled conflict of situation (old man vs.nature), relations (old man vs. other bipeds), social (old man vs. group), or even as old man vs. technology, (d) the lack of any small, medium or large climax essentially brings the desired audience ride of expectations down from a rollercoaster into a simple shopping cart push across a parking lot which runs over a couple of worn speed bumps, (e) mishandling of `romance' at every stage from anticipation through dream to frustration to nightmare to resolve or destruction.<br /><br />In short, this is a story about average man performing average deeds in an average future world. It is like reading Jean-Paul Sartre's `Nausea' without the existentialist angst as the adventure.<br /><br />Actually it would be good for sci-fi adventure writers to remind themselves of the base premise of existentialism: there is no intrinsic meaning or purpose to life, therefore it is up to each individual to determine their own meaning and purpose and take responsibility for their actions.<br /><br />As the few poorly-developed characters of this novel take no responsibility or meaning from their actions, I will not be following through with this particular series.<br /><br />I suspect this author rubs his bald head with the grease of incompetence.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The character of Julie and the relationship developed between she and Robbie made this novel especially compelling to me.  Also, the setting of DC is always interesting.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love this movie.  Great acting.  I loved the music.  Heartfelt and definitely carries you away with the story!  Recommend seeing this movie!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A well written accounting of what it means to give up everything to serve  one's country.  The real story is what it takes to be a SEAL and to serve with honor.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|I thought I was reading an episode from the TV series.  I was not satisfied with this book at all.
B0081336FO|5.0|Brilliant writing.<br />Superb acting and execution.<br />They don't dumb it down; they expect the viewer to be intelligent and paying attention. I wish more American TV shows did this. It's depressing how American TV mysteries and dramas have to spoonfeed every thought and line to make sure the poor lazy viewer doesn't get lost or confused and change the channel.<br /><br />Sherlock is outstanding in every respect.
B000209ZAE|5.0|I love this tool! When it comes to being quiet and precision, it much better than a standard Dremel.<br />Rob...
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|...providing you're not one of the \\"Calculating Infinity is the greatest thing ever\\" guys.  If you are, good luck to you.  If you are not, and you are excited to see this band expand its horizons with every new release, then 1) you already own it, and 2) you already realize it's the most solid entry in the band's discography.<br /><br />My wife is bothering me so I have to go, but if even an old married guy like me realizes the brilliance of this, it's important for you to buy ten copies immediately.<br /><br />\m/ \m/ \m/ \m/ \m/ \m/ \m/
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Lots of action acting so so. Kept me in suspense most of the movie not bad at all<br /><br />Cruise was believeable
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing and cool. Some People say that this is a ripoff for 7 bucks. In my opinion this game is worth it. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a very different story. So many seem to repeat themselves. I liked the plot, the love story and a great ending. If you like<br />love stories you must read.
0691126658|3.0|This book was recommended for me to bring along on an African safari.  It was a great resource but for my situation it was a little too heavy/cumbersome.  The pictures and details of the birds were great.  The book as a whole was great.  But, for the average birder going on a safari I used it more as a back up reference and used a much thinner/lighter book for the birds specific to the one country I was in.  If you're not carrying this book around in a back pack then it's great but if you want something a bit more mobile I would pass on it.
B006H5120E|5.0|I got this item because my husband loves this movie and he wanted to know if any 3D moves were all human related.<br />We enjoyed it in 3D. Product was shipped by vendor in great packaging and on time.
6302130379|1.0|It arrived just fine. It's probably my own fault, I didn't realize VHS movies would still be sold on Amazon. I would never intentionally buy VHS. I already owned a boxed set of VHS. So, I'm not happy with the item but delivery was very prompt.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I always like to read the book before the movies come out. Haven't seen the movie yet, but after the book reading I can't wait.<br />It was good from beginning to end. Never expected some of the end. Great story Nicholas, keep them coming.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Tested working on my HTC Evo 3D, Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.<br /><br />Overall the game is just fun, quirky and easy to pick up and play. The controls can be a little frustrating at times but still very useable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game with good prizes to keep you interested! Fun to play with friends or alone. I HAVE PLAYED FOR YEARS!!!
B00008RWC2|2.0|This book is not for beginners. It is more a makeup look-book for makeup artists. I didn't learn any techniques or tips.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This movie is amazing.A great example of humility. It shows how knowledge can free the mind. Also, the quality of the sound and video are excellent.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Great driving Music. I feel Young and cool when I listen to it. My husband keeps steeling it from my car
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|This app is okay. Probably there are others that are much better, but it is enough to do simple things.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I love Michael Buble, He is very talented and I enjoy his music I felt disapointed in this album beacause it lacked anything special and seemed to be a little bland
1439127727|5.0|What a great book to look inside the history of the oval office.  this book analyzes the people and relationships behind the decisions made for this country.
B000002B5L|5.0|There are a lot of explisit lirics, but it is a fantastic album. I really enjoy it<br />Brings mr back to the 90's
B008JFUUIA|1.0|I don't understand all of the great ratings. If you saw any comedy in the late 90s or 00s then you have seen this movie before. Rebel Wilson is hilarious, but was underutilized to carry the whole movie. This could have been so much better.
B009MYARIK|3.0|Fun, breezy beach read.<br />This is not a book you will feel a burning desire to talk about with your friends, but a cute, entertaining story.  It will keep your attention and make you smile. What more could you want beachside?
B0096HIEE2|1.0|If you want to see gyrating men, aren't there many more viable, and free, options available on the Internet? Especially ones where you wouldn't have to listen to Matt M and look at him walking around like Richard Simmons on steroids. I did enjoy the banter between Channing and his love interest, even though her screen laugh needs work. No plot to be found, but there is a vomit eating pig that belongs to a crack whore. So, there's that.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Unlike any game I have played, The Room was challenging, fun and very entertaining to play. Looking forward to the next one!
B00CBKLO52|3.0|While the over all sim is decent paying 2.99 per additional plane, boat, heli or field is way too much. Drop the price to 50c and I'll be buying new things all day long.
B00932A4XE|3.0|I expected more from this movie with such a great cast. It was just &#34;okay&#34;. I would not recommend wasting your time.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This game is like arkham city on ps3 but it is pretty good good graphics and gameplay I highly recommend this game to my friends and family
B009GEOLM4|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. Batman fans will not be disappointed. The story was solid, & they didn't make an aging Bruce Wayne/Batman appear as weak & out dated.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|Great actors Liam Nelson and Robert Deniro incredible scenery great story but a bit of a sad ending bring Kleenex
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I don't use it as a stand very often, I find it difficult to keep it in a standing position.  I have tried to put some type of large rubber band (hair band) around it to support the stand, it works good but can't use it when closing the kindle.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|This was easily the worst movie I've seen all year. The cinematography, acting, and storyline were all terrible. Read the book before seeing the movie and though it's not a brilliant story, the changes made for the movie made an average plot absolutely ridiculous. The budget for this dud must have been just enough to cover Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompsons' salaries because this movie made Twilight look Oscar worthy.
B004SEUJKU|5.0|Unfortunately, there are those Collectors Book only in the United States but for a true fan of the movie, a must have!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I like Lee Child's novels and this was no exception - fast paced, a little romance and all around hero!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Very entertaining, but if I hadn't read the book beforehand I wouldn't have  been able to follow the story.  Am looking forward to season three nevertheless.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Keeps you entertained, ran on my HP Touchpad with no issues.<br />Just wish they would remove the pop-up when you first play it adverting their other games.
B0060D0XE4|5.0|Though i find the movie tacky and expectable, both my kids 9, and 5, found it fun and fascinating. They actually watch it repeatedly for 4-5 times in a row! So if they like it, I like it ;-)
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It is a beautiful film depicting the vision of Edgar Rice Burroughs.  We need a sequel!  This story must be continued!!!
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This is a very cute movie. I have two boys and they both love it.  I think it's a good one!
B003THHIEM|5.0|If you love lively repartee and interesting characters, this is the show for you!  Now I just have to catch up on the rest of the seasons!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My favorite film version of the book, hands down!  In my opinion the book is ALWAYS better than the movie but this film depicts the characters very well, and is much better than other Jane Eyre movies I have seen.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love the Lord of the Rings and this was nothing short of what I expected it to be. It's an awesome movie and I've already watched at least 5 times since I've bought it. It was in great condition and came quite quickly when ordered.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really love this app.  I sleep so much better to the sound of rain that I have been known to turn the sprinkler on the side of the house just for the sound.  This app has a variety of sounds to choose from to enhance your rest.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is epic! Even if you're not a big superhero fan, it's just a fun movie to watch. Each actor brings a lot to each hero as well as comedic relief.
B008HLZUUE|2.0|This book went on and on and on.  At the end I felt like saying, \\"Nothing to see here folks.  Move along.\\"  Coincidence is only interesting if it is meaningful.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie and would recommend to others who have children but be warned the acting is horrible by some of the cast. It's fairly lighthearted, no over the top adult content.
B004NS710C|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen!  Love Denzel anyway, but He is outstanding in this one.  I watch this movie over and over and I still tense up at the really good parts.  Don't really write reviews, but this one deserves it.  Watch it.  I can't imagine that you won't like it.
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|It was an OK movie but was slow paced without a lot of reasons to keep watching at some points. I usually love any film M.W. is in so I was surprised this wasn't better.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What can I say this is one of the best books I have read in along time. The details of the stranded survivor doing his thing and then jumping back to NASA and then his crew mates. But the best part of the story is the end that made me lol so much what a great book that good worth 5 stars
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was. Ignore all the bad press and enjoy. It's no epic story but it is exactly what the book was meant to be.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I am not a gamer but I like to play games at times instead of reading or listening to music. The games I like are quick easy to grasp and challenging. This game fits the bill in spades. Lots of fun  lots of levels and a well done update of a classic.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Safe Haven is a wonderful movie that my entire family enjoyed. Surprisingly well acted story that was beautifully shot. We would all recommend.
1592402690|5.0|An insite into the unbelievable music of The Beatles as told by the 6th Beatle Geoff Emerick. The 6 of them, John, Paul, George Harrison, George Martin, and Geoff Emerick were pioneers. I'm 59 and grew up with these guys but never knew they real history until now. Can't put it down. Great gift too!! A real feel good book
B005LAIHCM|5.0|I just finished watching this movie, and it was SOOOOOO good that I felt like I had to write a review on amazon. :)<br />Jennifer Lawrence is my favorite actress and I had been wanting to see this movie for a while.  She did an excellent job (as always).  The movie is scary, intense, exciting, and made me jump several times.  The characters that I liked completely changed around and my eyes were practically touching my laptop screen during the last half.  Despite that it's after midnight and I just watched it, the movie was soooo good that I'm going to watch it again, though I have work tomorrow.  But this movie is worth it.  If you don't like it, then you my friend have no soul.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a fun game. Hard to get money after a while and even more difficult to get friends. Need more room to start out as well.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I ws so glad that this Movie won best animation last year, and it deserved it,<br />It's about a girl(princess actually) whos parents wanted her to marry one of the young men from the other clans, She hated the idea besides her mother was trying to groom her as per royalty and she fought her and went to see a witch to get a potion  to make her mother see it her way.<br />The whole thing takes place in Scotland years ago.
B0036ORISO|5.0|I love this band.  This album is way good!  I can die happy for finding this band.  In a world of unoriginal, outdated, over-the-top productions, copycats, this band breaks the mold on every level.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is one of my favorite books. The number and scoop of its character is amazing as is the plot. After reading most of the series its very apparent that Erikson knows his work very well. The system of magic contained in Gardens of the Moon is so very much different than in most. Most people that i have talked to say that the first read was rather hard to get though, but i disagree from the opening to its end i found it compelling and enjoyable. The series is pretty long but i haven't found any repetitiveness as of book 7 and i doubt that i will. Thank you Steven Erikson for this very enjoyable work of Deliciousness!
1451695195|4.0|I bought this book because I have been under seige spiritually. It was an answer in many ways, to what has been on my mind. It is extremely timely in answering a host of questions, but mainly, uplifting to the personal &#34;self&#34;. It came along, like so many things in my life, just when it was needed.
B0064QNS62|1.0|What do u expect for free?but worth a try...everyone likes different things...not mine.o well what can I say.not my thing.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I am very pleased to add this movie to my collection.  I have always been a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series and this movie was done very well.  I don't dole out a great deal of criticism for movies.  If the movie was entertaining and I'd like to watch it again sometime in the future, then it passes my test and I want to add to my movie selection.
0143116053|5.0|This is a wonderful read, with a great balance of pathos and humor.  There are laugh-out-loud funny moments, and moments that will bring pangs of recognition.  A lively story and a sparkling writing style make Deaf Sentence a complete winner.  Good literature is alive and well.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A friend recommended this love story. A very moving story and flowing read. A sequel would be great...highly recommend to others. Looking forward to screen version.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Wow! I really enjoyed their first album, and I think that they just added to their potential with this album. I love the mixing up of the styles and standards. She can deliver like no one else. I am very glad that I have been introduced to Beth Hart. Her voice is just so amazing and versatile. When she screams in \\"Miss Lady\\" I got goosebumps. I am hooked on Beth.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|Overall a good game. Good graphics,controls easy and freeflowing. I play for about 15 mins a day.if you want to play longer you have to either play in lower levels repeatedly or pay for upgrades or potions. If this was a one time fee,I would probably pay if it was modest.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|A casual game that doesn't mess about. Good for a quick bit of fun, with enough mechanics to keep it interesting.
1594745692|5.0|The Zombie Tarot is my very first tarot card deck, and I am SO glad I decided to go with this deck. I love zombies, so the second I saw it on Amazon I knew I had to have it. The booklet it comes with is so helpful, too. The booklet coupled with a book on tarot from the library, and I'm learning so much! I've done a few readings, The Eyeball and The Severed Head seem to be the most popular spreads that the booklet teaches you. This was definitely a great place to start.
B005LAIISA|5.0|My kids asked for this movie after we rented it.<br />The best song in the movie is at the end and you can't buy it on itunes in that version.<br />So, we listen to it in the movie and dance and sing around the house.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Loved the movie, looking forward to Ironman 3. I hope it's a follow on for the Avengers. Looking forward to more in that series as well.
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|Great movie. I looked for this movies months ago on other sites and gave up, then I stumbled on it
B0010T3UUM|4.0|Very comfortable but bigger than advertised. I ordered a 15 and had to send back for a 14. Other than that and the fact that they will melt if you get hot oil on them, I love these shoes. Had major foot pain until i put these on and now my long days won't be so long.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I bought this for my kids because I knew they'd enjoy the story and the animations of No. 5.<br />As expected they loved it!  I encourage you to share it with your kids and other cute 80s movies that are similar -- like: &#34;Batteries Not Included&#34; -- they loved that one too.
B004X75RK4|5.0|The premise of the story was almost believable, and the situations that resulted, tho somewhat predictable, were funny and didn't rely on gutter language
B000SW4DV2|4.0|My brothers like it and were entertained by it even though i thought it was very boring and cheaply made.
B00C4YZ12C|1.0|I cant download because it says this app is incompatible with my device. Why? This is the free app of the day right? Why would yoeu make it an app that doesn't work
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It works the way its supposed to and works great at it but i hate that it is always running.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the most amazingly thought out games ever. It has an incredible plot, cool graphics, and good updates coming out fast. I would like to compliment Mojang and the user community (specifically SkyDoesMinecraft, Minecraft Universe, and Deadlox).
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Completely unplayable i did not even get a chance to play as this game would spam for me to buy something.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Mental illness impacts a huge number of families and needs to have the stigma removed so more peoplle can get help to live the lives they deserve.  Why is it easier to admit to a family member being a substance abuser (a choice) than to admit to a family member with mental illness (not a choice)?  I know this is a generalization and the issues often go hand in hand.  So see the movie and experience what a lot of families deal with daily.  It's heart warming and a sweet change from the pairing of 'mental illness' and some of the horrific headlines of the past few years.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book<br /><br />Was really intense<br />I would recommend this to twilight lovers<br />I love it's that I couldn't stop reading
0399165274|5.0|Forsyth fans will be pleased with THE KILL LIST. Set in our day, the book deals with the nightmare of ongoing terrorism. The details are fascinating and one can see that the author knows his stuff on military gear and tactics. \\"Kit\\" Carson is the main character sent to deal with a terrorist who has won many disciples and been responsible for terrible murders. Forsyth is careful to give Islam its due and focus on jihadists, many of whom have strayed far from the teachings of Mohammed. This is a novel that reminds us of the continuing nature of the challenge before us: namely dealing with terrorism and fanaticism. Forsyth writes well and his narration moves forward at a steady and exciting pace. This is a book mystery lovers will enjoy.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is really cool, but I wish the suits were easier to vet cause u have to buy it twice. Overall it's cool
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I can't believe what I'm reading about this release, on here and elsewhere. My guess is that in about 2-3 years this moment in time will come full circle and Random Access Memories will be lauded as the beginning the next big musical movement. Not that this sound hasn't been made before. In fact that is pretty much the point. Not to mention Daft Punk is actually a little late to the party. And when I say party, I mean the party that is revitalizing the original movement. The band is a concept, the music is conceptual. Take it or leave it. Suspend disbelief. Just listen to the music and forget about the genre war garbage. If you truly don't like what you're hearing then I don't understand why you bothered to listen in the first place. This is deep down dope funky electronic music. Supremely stylistic sounds that absolutely deliver. The haters will always spew their garbage but remember that Daft Punk or any musician doesn't have to do anything just because they've already done something.<br /><br />My favorite so far is Instant Crush. I'm sure that will change over and over again with each listen.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|awesome game this is a must to play is easy to play and understand  what's  going  no matter the skills you will be in the game a long periods  of time

1423140605|3.0|I expect the hate-messaging to start not long after I post this review since I seem to be in the minority opinion, but I'm sticking to my guns: compared to everything else I've read by Rick Riordan (which is all of his output since the first Percy Jackson book), this book felt padded and disjointed and ultimately I did not enjoy it as much as the previous volumes in this series or in the Percy Jackson and Kane Chronicles series.<br /><br />Riordan has successfully divided his books between multiple point of view characters before, so I don't think having four point of view characters (Percy, Annabeth, Leo and Piper) is the cause of the disjointed-ness. I think the problem is that the author is just trying to fit too much story into what should be a fairly focused book: the mission of the Seven to fulfill the prophecy. Every one of the seven demi-gods involved in the quest (the four aforementioned plus Frank, Hazel, and Jason) have their own sub-plots that need to be addressed and advanced, not to mention the characters they've left behind or are striving towards: Tyson, Rayna, Nico, Ella, both Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter, even Athena herself -- all of these folks need to be mentioned and weave in and out of the fabric of the quest. That's a lot of personalities to juggle, a lot of bodies to manipulate, and it doesn't always gel smoothly even in Riordan's capable hands.<br /><br />We expect a certain formula from Riordan at this point in terms of the focal characters' encounters with mythological beings in the mortal world, but this book has more of these side-quests than any previous and that added to the feeling that the book is padded. Because every encounter has to follow the formula: the hints at who will be encountered, followed by the reveal, followed by the meat of the encounter (for better or, usually, for worse), and finally the method by which our focal characters escape the encounter to continue on their quest. Even though every single one of the encounters in this book does tie into the main quest in some way, it still felt like there were too many: the visit to Fort Sumter, the meeting with the sea-centaurs, the encounter with Narcissus and Echo, the evil naiads, Hercules, the sea gods in the Atlanta aquarium (this scene in particular felt the most unnecessary to me personally) ... I'll admit that the mythology geek in me loves all of this but there was just so much of it, I started to feel like the author was simply delaying getting his characters to Rome for some reason.<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending might have been that reason. I think, as an author, I'd have felt a bit of trepidation at writing that ending, leaving at is does certain beloved characters' fates very much up in the air (so to speak). Of course, knowing there's another book to come in the series, I'm pretty sure those characters will survive to the ultimate showdown (and if anyone of the Seven are to pay with their lives, I don't suspect it's the two whose lives are currently at risk, for fairly obvious reasons). The cliffhanger ending is also one of the best parts of this book: Riordan gets the emotional stakes for the reader and plays to them expertly.  It doesn't completely counteract the feelings of padding and disjointedness that plague most of the book, but it goes a long way towards the hope that the next book, The House of Hades, will be a return to form for Riordan.ounters in this book does tie into the main quest in some way, it still felt like there were too many: the visit to Fort Sumter, the meeting with the sea-centaurs, the encounter with Narcissus and Echo, the evil naiads, Hercules, the sea gods in the Atlanta aquarium (this scene in particular felt the most unnecessary to me personally) ...

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I was hesitant at first when I heard about this game from a friend, yet it is surprisingly fun. It mixes bejeweled with combat and time and classic 80s graphic that you get from games back then. Try it out really it's fun. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it is short. I beat the game under 5 hours my first play through and then about 3 and a half hours my second play through. Plus its cheap and at a reasonable price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game every time I play it I get addicted and play it for longer than I was expecting. Great way to pass time.
B00C061I3K|1.0|This entire album sounds like Ross from \\"Friends\\" in that episode where he tries to relive his insanely crummy 80s keyboard playing days in the coffee house. Is this a joke?
0316056863|4.0|As expected, Tina writes a book that you cannot help but laugh at. However, she also offers up some really insightful advice. This woman does it all.
B001N9BGGY|5.0|Fell in love with Jesse and Celine in Before Sunrise.  This continuation is so honest and real, I fell in love all over again in Before Sunset.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I walk around all day with different songs from this album stuck in my head.  Normally I hate when that happens, but my mental-Lumineers-jukebox makes me smile.  I can't wait for more.
B004UPANGM|5.0|Not going to comment on the movie content.. just the quality... ED2 was meant to be stupid fun. Nuff said.<br /><br />Quality on Amazon Prime was great with this movie.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I haven't read the books and I have no intention on reading them. I also hate when movies, especially good movies, get put down due to the fan base of the books being \\"let down\\" by the movie. You have to look at it as two different forms of art and appreciate it for what it is.<br /><br />Beautiful Creatures really surprised my, due to the fact that on the back of the blu ray case it says it is a mix of Twilight and The Hunger Games. Now I didn't hate the Twilight movies, but they are definitely not in my top must watch movies, though I did really enjoy New Moon, just because the wolves are kick ass in that movie.<br /><br />Personally this movie had a Dark Shadows look and feel to it, which didn't bother me at all, cause I extremely enjoyed Dark Shadows, which similar to this movie, took a beating due to the fan base of the old TV series, which again was totally unfair.<br /><br />By now after reading the numerous other reviews you probably already know the basis of the movie. Yes it is a love story and that might turn alot of guys off, but there is plenty of kick ass scenes, and the love story really doesn't overwhelm the movie. There are something like 500 special effects shots in this movie, so there is plenty of eye candy for us guys. The dinner scene and the big storm at the end are my two favorite scenes.<br /><br />Overall I think you need to already rent this movie. Give it a shot and don't listen to all the 1 star reviews from the fans of the book that are po'ed that it is not exactly, word for word, like the book. Watch it as its own piece of art and I promise you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.
B004EPZ034|1.0|I have never had a 400 pound man full on cheap Mexican food diarrhea in my mouth, but if I did I would have to imagine that the experience would be very similar to watching Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked. For starters the character development of alvin was underscored by the large cocaine use of Dave. The motifs of death and the prospects of the inevitable death that we all face illustrated by dave's addiction and eventual suicide overshadowed the playfulness of the children's movie. If Edison knew that this movie would eventually exist, he would have stopped invented the technology to create motion picture and promptly bashed his head is with a blunt object till blood no longer flowed to his brain. \\"Sacre bleu' \\" Semone's French accent was below par and she slaughtered all of her verb conjugations. Crap, my friends, crap is the only word in the english lexicon that approaches the appropriate descriptor of this so called film. Please, I ask you, no I beg and beseech to destroy any copies of this movie immediately. It is absolutely imperative.<br /><br />I have set up a hotline for those who are recovering from the tragedy of watching this movie. Please call:<br />555 555 5555<br /><br />Text: \\"I'm been chipwrecked\\" to 55555 to donate to the foundation
B00746O3X8|5.0|The first time I used the MCH-25 harness system was almost my last.  Both my camera bodies were in their holsters, with long lenses, as a group of racers that I was shooting came into view.  BOTH cameras were stucvk in the holsters, and no matter which way I pulled and twisted to release them from the locking devices worked, and I missed the shot.  I almost tossed the harness in the trash bin.<br /><br />As it turned out, it was my fault, since I hadn't made certain that the attachment on the base of the camera bodies were tight enough, and aligned correctly for quick removal from the holsters on the harness.  Once I got that right, the MCH-25 has worked perfectly ever since.  It pays to read ALL the instructions!<br /><br />The best thing about the MCH-25 system is that it keeps the camera close to your body in an easy to reach and very secure location and orientation, even when running from place to place.  No bouncing around, or banging into you or others, or worse yet, hitting the ground or other hard stuff when you kneel down or lean forward.  With most other strap systems, even those with additional chest straps and such, I usually need to use one or even two hands to keep them steady when moving around.  With the MCH-25, no problem.  The holster stays tight and secure, as do the cameras and lenses, even with long 500mm glass, and all &#34;hands-free.&#34;<br /><br />I'd buy it again and recommend it to others.  Just be sure to read the instructions!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|so I bought this game, thinking it looked really fun, which it is without a doubt. BUT, I tried buying the cheat types and it charged me for it, and yet it says I never did. What happened?
B008JFUP0I|4.0|It is hard to believe that the 5th entry of a series, any movie series at that, is the best of the group.  Fast Five did just that with the Fast and Furious movies.  Over-the-top action sequences, a great cast of action stars and recognizable faces from each of the films before, and enough ridiculous dialogue to keep the humor both intentional and unintentional.  How could they top themselves?  Well, watch Fast &amp; Furious 6, and you'll know how.<br /><br />From the post-credits scene of Fast Five, we knew that Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) would be back in part 6.  Hobbs (Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson) and new partner, Riley (Gina Carano), investigate and find that Letty is a part of a new group of hijackers, similar to the crew we've come to know and love from the Fast &amp; Furious series.  The leader and main target of this new group is Owen Shaw (Luke Evans, a name to keep tabs on, he'll be a much bigger star in the next couple years).  In order to properly combat this new group, Hobbs goes to Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and has him put together his old team.  Following the events of Fast Five, the group is spread out all over the world:  Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) has just had a baby boy with Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster); Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) parties with women in his personal jet all over the world; Tej Parker (Chris &quot;Ludacris&quot; Bridges) gives back to the poor by rigging ATM machines; Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) are trying to settle down in Tokyo.  They all get the call from Vin, and the group comes together to help Hobbs.  In return for bringing down Owen Shaw, Hobbs will allow them to figure out what happened to Letty, and give them  all pardons so that they can return back to the United States from being fugitives.<br /><br />From the moment Hobbs is shown on screen, in a scene where he beats up a man as big as him by throwing him around an interrogation room, you know you are in for a ridiculous treat.  The action throughout this movies is top notch, from the first sequence where the group meets Owen Shaw and his team, featuring &quot;evil twins&quot; of everyone in Vin and Hobbs group, including a martial arts ass-kicker played by The Raid: Redemption star, Joe Taslim, and a large muscle bound body builder type, played by newcomer, Kim Kold.  Shaw and his team enlist the help of 'flip cars', which look like a cross between Indy 500 racing cars and the futuristic cars of Mad Max and The Road Warrior.  The chase sequence sees Hobbs jumping out of a car and onto another one from a bridge, and Letty shooting Dominic without knowing who he is.  It's ridiculous, but would we have it any other way?  This leads to more epic car chases, macho posturing between Hobbs and Dominic, as well as humorous turns by Roman and Tej.  A love subplot exists between Han and Gisele, Brian now is a father, and Owen's past of working with Braga (John Ortiz), the villain from the 4th film, are all made known throughout the film.<br /><br />The action remains the focus, because let's face it, there's only so much ridiculous dialogue that can be said by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and The Rock.  We care about the characters, but only to set up the next action sequence.  Highlights are a fight between Rodriguez and Carano (twice!), Joe Taslim showing off his martial arts abilities, and a highway chase sequence featuring a tank destroying everything, including human life, without so much as blinking.  At one point in the sequence, you will suddenly suspend disbelief and watch multiple characters fly through the air as if they were non-superhero superheroes.  It doesn't matter, the fact remains that it's so much fun to watch, your brain will enjoy anything at this point because of the excellent film-making at hand by director and series takeover writer, Justin Lin.  The real treat is the final action sequence that sees the group chasing down a cargo jet on a runway (that might be 10 miles long with the amount of stuff that happens) that features flying cars, fights between everyone in the hero and villain group on top of cars and inside a cargo jet, twists, turns, and deaths of characters, leading to a pulse pounding conclusion so awesome and over-the-top, you'll have to catch your breath afterwards.<br /><br />How could anything follow this?  Stick around to the final scene before the credits, and you'll be in disbelief as the series comes full circle and finally explains the strange Tokyo Drift movie and Han's inclusion in all of this, as well as the next movie's villain.  The creators of this series, mainly Justin Lin and Vin Diesel, known exactly which buttons to hit to make the series a who's who of action stars today, while creating a cohesive universe of characters for a movie that just started out as a typical action film back in 2001.  It hits all of the points it needs to:  HUGE action setpieces, a great cast, macho dialogue, hot women, fist fights and gun fights galore, and plot twists aplenty.  I for one love every single one of these movies, and cannot wait to see where they go from here.  Fast &amp; Furious 7 is coming next year already, now with James Wan at the helm, I hope he can keep up the energy and fun that Justin Lin has brought with Fast Five and Fast &amp; Furious 6.  I also hope Sylvester Stallone is taking notes for his Expendables movies, because the Fast &amp; Furious movies are outdoing him by a long shot in terms of action and star power, and they show no sign of slowing down.  I'll be the first one to tell you that this is the best movie of the summer so far, and I'll watch this series until Vin Diesel is an old man flying through the air to save his children from driving a car over the top of a skyscraper.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Just love this it is a great pass time and so relaxing for me. I was so happy to get it, is a nice game.

B00B04NJLW|1.0|I have seen plenty of stupid, pointless movies, but this one takes the cake - I would rate this zero stars if I could.  This sounded like it would be an interesting idea, and then I actually watched it.  To be fair, there were probably three good shorts: D for dogfight, R for removed, and X for XXL.  For the most part, I have a hard time believing that this was an actual planned project, and not just something cobbled together by someone that obtained the rights to a bunch of random short films and then shot some new things trying to shoehorn it all together.  This is being marketed as a horror movie, but it's really more like a of a bunch of odd foreign art films. I'm really surprised that the producer or co-creator of this POS had the gall to post a review here under the title 'I've got kids to feed here!'.  Yes, a person who claims to be a parent decided to release a movie that includes pedophilia and miscarriages in toilets as entertainment.. Well, you did achieve one thing - This was the first Blu-Ray (or DVD for that matter) I've ever bought that I actually threw in the trash after I watched it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I downloaded this game I played it it was super fun I seen the full version on my computer but my computer broke down and I was sad for a while but then on Christmas I got this kindle fire and it had minecraft pe subway surfers and a bunch of other games to but mostly I was happy download this app and you'll be  happy two.

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|By: Jamie Reed<br />Published By: St Martin's Press<br />Age Recommended: YA- Adult<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Rating: 5<br />Book Blog For: GMTA<br />Review:<br /><br />'Eleanor & Park\\" by Jamie Reed was a good read that was set from Omaha in 1986. This was a sweet first love story of Park who was half Korean, with green eye with his \\"skin the color of sunshine through honey\\" and into alternative music and comic books ant Eleanor who was the new girl 'big, awkward and poor' the oldest of five kids with a painfully difficult home life, along with her \\"red crazy hair with a weird necklaces handing around her neck and scarves wrapped around her wrists.\\" These two meet and began sitting by each other on the school bus. After some time they will share Park's comic books. As time goes on they fall in love over the objection of their parents. This is where I will say you must pick up the novel get a well written story. Be ready for twist that will keep you turning the pages to see just what will be happening next. The characters were very strong and developed so well though the read. I like this author's style of writing...the music and comic books were simply off the chart good. In the end will there be a happy ending? You will find this read 'short, charming , witty, entertaining, emotional' and just a down right good read that I would definitely recommend to you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive and fun. I love this version of temple run the best because of all the upgrades it already has that you do not have to buy, on the other hand the original temple run is fun to, but  I would like to stick like glue to temple run two.  In temple run two you have four different characters to choose from and in the original one you do not get to choose you have to stick to the same character. The first time I played temple run I thought it was lame but now that I actually play the game it is awesome!

I loved the movie and<br />wanted him to be able to compare the movies to the books to see how well the movies followed the original story lines.I plan to purchase the rest of the series as he continues reading the books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful acting and great story telling.  Did you really need to kill off two key actors in the story line.  Do you really need to include homosexually story lines into this wonderful family story?  Is it a requirement of every tv show today to have homosexually incorporated into cast?  Why follow the pack?
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was funny, sexy, and very well written. To be honest having the male point of view was the best. OMG, Drew had me laughing my ass off. I actually read parts out loud to my husband. Gotta say this will be one of my favorite books. I will be reading this book again soon. Well done Emma Chase!!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I became hooked on the free version on this game and other GRaveDefense series early on. Finally purchased today after completing Hard on all levels and Insane on several others. Disappointed that my progress wasn't saved after in game purchase but love the game. Play on...
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Yeah, so the title basically says it all. The story is intricate, complicated, messy and violent. However, there is a certain beauty to its litterary style that makes it impossible to put down.<br /><br />The auther places all sorts of cues in these books, and I find myself ever at argument with the friends who has also read them all as to what is real, what is random, and what is bait.. Never has a book (or just a story for that matter) been able to do this.<br /><br />They are long, but that is not the problem, that's the best part.
B00BKBCM4A|3.0|I saw her video on TV and Really liked the song so I thought I get her CD. Well that one song was the only good one on the CD. All the rest had a very 80's tech sound which I am not fond of. Knowing this I would not buy this CD again. Sorry Jessie.
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Good Return for Arnold, it is good to see him back in action films.  I am happy with this film, considering that Arnold has not starred in a main feature in years.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|As a computer junkie, I have struggled for years with carpal tunnel syndrome. After my latest bout, including an extremely unpleasant neurological test, I decided to get serious. The pits was when I thought I would have to give up Civ5, but Evoluent came to the rescue. This is &#34;disruptive technology&#34; at its best. Evoluent turned the mouse on its side and produced a solution that is not only orthopedically correct and effective, but also works better and more accurately than any other device I've used over 20+ years and is even sexy. Carpal tunnel, goodbye!! Civ5, welcome back!!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Started this book on a recommendation from a friend, and glad I did. As a story, it's a very slow start, but I still find myself unable to put it down. Definitely looking forward to starting Day Two tomorrow!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Still putting out good story lines somehow. Golem, Men of Letters. Decent stuff for sure. Interested to see where they go from here.
B00785P2QC|1.0|I have  been playing this game for a couple weeks now and have fount it pretty fun. Although I haven't purchased any credits or anything, I still have  managed to get to my current level of 28. There are some achievements you cannot complete without purchasing more credits since the really cool stuff require at least 30. Also there are many hills and such that you cannot just use your in game money to bulldoze which require MORE credits. Also buying land is annoying at times when most of the area you just bought as  an expansion has hills you cannot build on unless you buy more credits or wait long enough and log in everyday to get a  daily bonus to receive free permit points.<br /><br />Right now, I am encountering SERIOUS bugs/ glitches in my lv28 city. The majority of my buildings have fire damage/ sick and I cannot repair or bulldoze them and they stay gone. ALL menus stick, money does not increase or decrease, cannot select trash to dump out for any building, timers for new action points do not change, none of the vehicles are moving, population or any other stat changes whatsoever. The game will even crash completely too back to my home screen!  If game is restarted, ALL buildings that were removed are returned. This is so bad I cannot even play it whatsoever anymore because it doesn't work at all. So building up my city has been a total waste of time and effort.<br /><br /> If this game worked as it should I'd give it 4 stars (one less for the cost of buying credits) up to level 27 but currently I give it ZERO! PLEASE FIX THIS GAME!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I have been in contact with someone from G5 regarding the issues I've had with this game. I answered all of their questions and explained, sent screen captures of how messed up my game was to them. Customer service wasn't all that great since I repeatedly had to explain things that were wrong although I clearly stated I was using a KINDLE and NOT a phone upon initial communication. At times it was somewhat frustrating since it seemed like they didn't even read the messages I sent.  So after multiple clarifications,  I was told that it would be forwarded to their IT department. That was over 2 weeks ago and I have not had any changes in my game play, that being, still basically frozen although being able to see all the destruction still there. My advice to anyone considering spending REAL money doing things in this game, BEWARE if you get to level 28! I will post an update if anything is fixed. I doubt it, but I'm hopeful.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The story was unusual. The photography was magnificiant. I enjoyed the French dialogue<br />How does one train  a tiger  like<br /> that?
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Although the author jumps from character to character, it is a good read for lovers of The Lincoln Lawyer. I would recommend it.
B006AN78XS|4.0|I ENJOYED THE setting and the time period of the story.<br />The photography was beautiful. I especially like the French and Spanish introjected in  the dialogue. I did like the way  all writer and painters enter in and out of the story line. I did not apreciate Woody Allen throwing in his political opinions on the TP. That was not entertaining and detracted from the film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very fun I like this game slot hurrah! I like to take care of my horse yay alcohol Iove this game!!!
B00CRS88IO|5.0|I enjoyed this historical adventure story about James Bond creator Ian Fleming or `17F' as he was known. It's packed with brilliant action sequences that makes for a rollercoaster read. NID secret agent Ian Lancaster Fleming skis, shoots, parachutes and more. There is an alluring femme fatale and two cool villains, a scheming French admiral and boatloads of sadistic Nazis. I would like to have seen more of the German villain, General Bock. Also, his assistant Masha is introduced but then forgotten about. Bock's airship was a cool villain's lair. There are two main ideas in this book. First, there is the historically accurate spy story about a British mission to secure the French navy during Germany's June 1940 invasion of France. Second, it's a huge wink and a nod to one of the most famous pop culture icons in the world - James Bond. Everything that inspired 007's creation is here: the gruff boss, the plain secretary who loves our hero, babes galore, guns, gadgets, hardware and exotic locales, a deformed villain and the world-might-end level of stakes. What makes `The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada' brilliant is that somehow Damian Stevenson pulls off this audacious high-wire balancing act. The book is a great historical novel and a fascinating exploration of the inspiration behind the creation of a character who is still so popular around the world that his last movie (`Skyfall') grossed over a billion dollars!<br />I was given an ARC copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
B00CRS88IO|4.0|As a World War II buff I am always on the look out for something different than the usual stories of heroics on the battlefield. Damian Stevenson's novel about the real Ian Fleming, who worked for British Naval Intelligence during this period, fits the bill.<br /><br />In this work, reminescent of a James Bond novel, Fleming parachutes into German occupied France in 1940 with two million pounds in gold. The purpose is to negotiate the purchase of the French navy from the rogue Admiral, Darlan. If he fails the British will destroy the French fleet rather than allow the Germans to use it as part of their planned invasion of Britain.<br /><br />Naturally, all Fleming's plans go into the toilet as soon as he hits the ground. From thereon he must improvise everything he does with the assistance of the French Underground, a challenge in itself.<br /><br />The book is a real page turner with chase scenes, fights in boats, motorcycles and ships. I was looking for even a train but alas there was none (I'm a train buff, too). Of course the girls find him irresitable.<br /><br />Stevenson has definitely done his research. His descriptive details are spot on the therefore believable. This gives the story the credibility that it deserves. If you want a story of espianage and suspense that keeps you turning the pages, then this book is for you. A strong four stars.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Mortal Instruments is one of my favorite series and I truly enjoy reading over and over.. I was hooked  from the very beginning just as Clary was when she first laid her eyes on Jace . I love  the concept of this series which makes it so unique and who doesn't love \\"marked\\" characters. Watching Clary's character grow as well as Jace through out the book is refreshing because unlike some books where it's about sex, in this book it's about finding themselves and who they are meant to be. Another reason I love this book is because it is so diverse when it comes to some of the characters. I cannot wait to see this book on the big screen after so many years of being an avid fan! Totally recommend this to anyone looking to read something new and different!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Second time I have read it...and will read again I am sure.  It's frightening that orphanages like that existed into the 90's.  Jamie's story is well told and satisfying.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|very addictive a great for killing time. I like to replay all the levels and get all awards and 5 stars
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It was free and addicting and fun my brothers like it and I like it and the cars are cool but no top on them it makes it hard.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely reminded me of must but without the massive frustration.  Hope the next one is longer as I'm sure to buy it!
B000I5SY5U|5.0|I have been thinking about watching this movie for a while, but thought it might be cheesy or boring. While it does have a bit of cheese in it, I absolutely loved this film. I am a big musical fan so that helped, but the overall story arch was also quite good. Note: if musicals are not your thing, this is probably not for you. I would say this is more of a musical than Moulin Rouge
B00COGXX7A|4.0|It's nice to see a movie with a happy ending but this movie was a whole new take on a love story!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love this game everybody needed to try it l love play on my Kindle Fire HD. It's fun l love all Mahjong games and Amazon too Thanks again..<br /><br />Patty Thilman
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|The took A LOT from \\"Van Helsing\\" in this movie, with a few Matrix effects in between. The movie was \\"ok\\" and there's a lot of cussing, which they certainly didn't need. I guess they had to add to the script to make it seem more \\"grown up.\\" They had some cool special \\"blood\\" effects and of course Gemma and Pihla were nice to look at. I don't know if it's something I would watch over and over again. Not the worst movie I have ever seen.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful movie. I would recommend this to anyone. Touches all hearts.<br />Hold on to life it self. I thought it would end the way it did. Her realizing that the women who was<br />her friend was in deed him wife. Great movie.
B00B769XB8|3.0|It's a combo of Van Helsing and The Matrix with more cussing, cleavage, and blood. It was \\"ok\\" not sure if I would watch it again but Gemma and Pihla were nice to look at. Nothing really new to see here.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Okay for all those people out there that are bashing this set, you must be stupid or just dumb. Of course the first movie isn't going to look amazing because it was made in the early 90's! So converting that to blu-ray will make it a lot better, but it was still shot with an older camera, not an hd camera like we have no a days. After watching the first movie, all I can say is that it looks amazing. Yes there is some grainy parts in the beginning of the movie, but after that its beautiful. Vibrant colors, amazing shadows, great lighting brought out in this release. For the second movie, again it is grainy for the first minute, then again looks beautiful. People need to watch the whole movie before making a review.... In this movie, it was much more darker, that's what speilburg wanted, and you can instantly tell the difference between the blu-ray and the DVD version. Much more is brought out In this release that you couldn't see before. Now for the third movie, I had no issues with it being \\"grainy\\" what so ever. This of course is the best one of them all, quality wise because that it was made with better cameras and technology. Comparing the blu-ray and the DVD is no even possible because the blu-ray blows it away. Much more brighter and much more detail is available on the blu-ray. The dinosaurs look realistic and the environment looks gorgeous. So does the lightning and shadows as well. In the end, this is a great set to own if your a fan of the series! Much better then the DVDs and it is really worth it! Oh and just a tip, if you have a surround sound system..... Hook it up and watch these bad boys! It is ten times better!
B00BMQDM10|4.0|Made me smile. Nice light read for the beach. Very predictable so dont be expecting any surprises. I really enjoyed it none the less
1623420148|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you start reading and you get upset towards the end of the book because it is about to end.  The story is written from a males point of view which is hilarious!  The chemistry between Drew and Kate is perfect.  I only wish that I had 10 more books to read by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really fun game, it is very interesting, also this game's scenery changes all around the world to your favorite places,i hope of your new to this game you'll enjoy it!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Avatar is an amazing movie.  James Cameron did a phenomenal job!  The graphics are out of this world!  This is a movie that both action and romance movie lovers can enjoy together!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Hours of fun...very little freezing up! Less than 2%! Great and challanging game! A bit addicting. You wont be disappointed! And it's free!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|As an old school gamer, I used to play space invaders, Galaga, Moon Cresta and so on.<br />This one easily beats all the invader or galaga wannabes.<br />First of all, it is damn fast.<br />Next, the enemies are funny -  they use chain formations as in galaga and all of a sudden mock you with a classic space invaders formation.<br />Then there are asteroids - Atari type ones.<br />Last but not least, I just love direct control - just  tap anywhere to direct your ship there OR trace it with your finger.<br />Destroyed enemies leave powerups to collect.<br />Unfortunately, there are no save slots, you only can opt for continue when you restart.<br />By the way, at level sixteen you get a boss. Cerberus is no pushover.<br />A tip how to kill the boss: move up very close so there isn't anything between you and the Boss.<br />Keep blasting away.<br /><br />Tons of fun I say :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. I liked the way it flowed from the first book and look anxiously forward<br /> to reading the next. I recommend it to anyone 12 and over.
B007REV4T8|1.0|One of the poorest James Bond movies ever made. Poor story and lacks any real theme. Craig not so good in this one. Does not live up to the James Bond series.
B000GRUS22|5.0|I try and collect all of Enigma's music I love it all and this one I like allot for all of you who like Enigma or love them I say go for it.
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|Everville - The First Pillar by Roy Huff<br />Reviewed by Lucy Pireel<br /><br />With this novel, which is like Harry Potter aimed at a younger public, the author very crafty draws in the adult reader too. He does so by creating fully developed characters whom I could root for. Plus the world he created is utterly believable.<br />The plot has some very nice surprises. It is hard to write an elaborate review without giving away spoilers and I would hate to do so, because the fun of this book are those twists and unexpected shifts, which are by the way properly foreshadowed to the observant reader.<br />All in all a book well worth your time and money--to both the adult and young reader.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|I have always been a fan of Enigma, some I like more then others but they are all good. If you love Enigma go for it. I like it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't even tell you how many times I've read these books.  Great story, can't wait to read more!  Enjoy
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I love Enigma and all their music, some I like more than others but it's all good. If your like me go for it I'm sure you will always find a few you will like allot and the rest will grow on you and you may turn out to like them better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just candy for the brain! Fun read, but you can't read this series out of succession. Excited to read the final book.
B001MSMULG|4.0|I was first introduced to Daniel Silva when I read \\"The Reluctant Spy\\"' which was so awesome that I next read \\"\\"The Mark of the Assassin\\" and the follow on\\" The Marching Season\\"''  Another two excellent reads.  The Kill Artist follows in this same vain, another excellent read.  I annoying to the next in the Gabriel Allon series and I can't wait to get to it!  Daniel Silva has become my current favorite author.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app gives me a choice of where I put things. love it. I can keep things in order now.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|What a wonderful love story.  Very good to the last chapter.  I would guess many of  Las Vegas weddings did not end like this one.  May be a few did.  Excellent read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. This book grips you from the first sentence to the last.  A must read for anyone with an imagination.
1616550414|1.0|It is \\"cheap\\" because the books are damaged from the cover... we ordered 3 books and all 3 were damaged from the cover, like if they hit it with a crowbar or something and the hardcover its damaged from the edge, it looks damn ugly, because its a Collection Item. I've been reading a lot of people that says their books are damaged same way I'm telling too.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love the game until when I go to the concert hall after I watch the video it flicks to the home screen Please fix this After I would give it a five. I am on level 96
B00CS7ZXFK|5.0|I loved hearing these songs, plus the short commentary between them.  It brought back such memories of growing up in Southern California listening to the Beach Boys.  Some of the original members have passed, but the most creative member, Brian Wilson, is back with the group.  That is very special.  Yes, the voices have changed and they are older, but the harmonies (with great supporting musicians) are there..  And through this music, I smiled with joy for the entire album.  I also found their tour itinerary and will attend in person this summer!
B00684J49U|5.0|Despite  the soap-opera nature of this series, I've got to admit that it is a guilty pleasure for I and my wife to watch. Over this many episodes, we get to really &#34;know&#34; the characters...sorta like gossiping about old school mates...
0670014893|5.0|The only problem is that Orwell was 30 years too early when he titled his book &#34;1984&#34;.  2014 is more appropriate.  We have the technology...now.  As in 1984, the problem is &#34;whom do you trust?&#34;
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Iron Man, but I was expecting more with this game. It's still fun, yes, and very addicting, but I wish the developers at Gameloft would have added more pizzazz to this game.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is not for everyone. You are either going to get it and like/love it or you aren't going to get it and you are more than likely going to leave a crummy review on here or imdb.<br /><br />When I say &#34;get it&#34;, I don't mean &#34;if you don't like this movie then you are not cool&#34;. It is just subject matter that appeals to some people and doesn't appeal to others.<br /><br />You don't need a synopsis from me and I certainly won't write any spoilers about it. If you think it sounds interesting, give it a try. You never know...
B003NX75B8|5.0|I highlighted more passages in this book on my Kindle than I have ever done on any other book.  I laughed.  I cried.  The book took my places I didn't expect to go.  And I'm a 50 year old man!
B006RJTIF6|5.0|This is the classic military knows best story, and Lancaster is brilliant as the megalomaniacal general who sees the move toward nuclear disarmament as weak. Douglas is perfect as the loyal patriot with a conscience.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|The characters are crafted so carefully and capture your complete interest. The story ducks and weaves with a tantalising effect!
B004LROUNG|3.0|A little slow in parts but I did enjoy the book.  I have always liked Grisham's lawyer books. Characters believable as well as the overall story.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Quentin is a genius.  I love this movie everyone in this movie does a magnificent job I have seen it 3 times. As far as it's controversy I don't get it I'm sure except for the character django everything in this story is an exaggerated aspect of what may have happened for example a slave couple running away together or Mandingo fighting ect all very plausible things that may have happened unfortunately . Movies great though the scenes are in typical Tarentino  fashion.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I've read three of the Jack Reacher books and I thought I'd write a review for those who are new to the series.<br /><br />Is Jack Reacher a man you can root for or is he a cold blooded killer?  Is there a lot of graphic sex and gratuitous violence?<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a tough guy and a little bit of a loner and a drifter.  But he doesn't have an attitude and he is capable of having feelings and relationships.  So he's not a cartoon or a stereotype--he's fully fleshed out, a \\"real\\" person.  I do like him.  He does a lot of violent things, but he has a moral code.  His moral code is that he stands up for the good people and the bad people are disposable.  And there are some really, really bad people in the Jack Reacher novels.  The situations can be quite disturbing if you're sensitive to that kind of thing.  However, I find it is pretty easy to skip over the violent parts without losing the thread of the story.<br /><br />There is usually a romance that heightens the stakes, and the stakes are always very high, creating a lot of suspense.  But the suspense isn't unrelenting.  There are areas where Reacher has to do research and interview people, and there are conversations and ruminations.  The romances are sweet and sexy, and there is nothing graphic, gross or crude.  The bad guys sometimes act out sexually, and those scenes are disturbing without being crude. I skipped over them.<br /><br />As for language, I really don't remember there being much.  As tough as Jack Reacher is, and as evil as his opponents are, Lee Child somehow gets by creating realistically violent and even evil situations without reverting to profanity or obscenity.<br /><br />The books are gripping and I get very involved in the stories and find them hard to put down.  Good writing, well-formed characters, solid plotting, suspense and a little romance keep me wanting to read more.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Maybe I'm in the minority but all these 007 movies are boring as hell. Ive heard good things about this movie so I gave it a chance but had disappointed results . I stopped watching it a little past half way.
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|Best songs were &#34;Burn, burn&#34;, &#34;Ready to Die&#34; and &#34;Job&#34;. Songs like &#34;Dirty Deal&#34; and &#34;Gun&#34; were a little boring, although the social relevance was not lost on me.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I have a three year old daughter that I love spending time with her . Some movies are torturous watching but this one is very entertaining.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved how flawed the characters were it made them seem that much more real.  I was surprised by some of the twists because usually I can guess what is going to happen. Let me tell you the bad boy stays true to his character and you can't help but wish you had someone so intense in your life who feels with such abandon. He doesn't always do the right thing but it comes from a good place. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie is very good I love movies based on true stories , very suspenseful , if you don't already know what happened.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a really fun and addicting game but the only downside is that it is some times kind of slow

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I've played this through more than once. it's sort of liked bejewled (match 3) and an fantasy RPG. It's really hard to describe.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|The best of all the classic arcade games eooled into one neon adventure. This will be an instsnt classic with everyone wanting more more more.<br /><br />Very impressed with this game. Will be looking to see what else this publisher puts out.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|nothing compelling about this one way or another. I can't really say anything good or bad about this game. cheese
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Eleanor and Park is a wonderful story about two unique teens whose friendship and love carry them through hardships.  Adults play roles of either support or abuse, but the main focus is on the caring between the two young adults.  I truly enjoyed reading the book.
B0064QNS62|2.0|THe gameplay is slow and sluggish, I don't enjoy this game. and honestly marv gives me nightmares at night, I mean come on, who wouldn't be scared of the way he doublehands the pickaxes??

B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|This movie was difficult to follow if you haven't read the book.  There was too much going on and I think they did a poor job tying it all together in the end. I was excited to see this and ended up very disappointed.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Love the story line,action packed scenes and well played. Also great on location scenes  around the globe. Mr. Cruise does not disappoint at all. I hope he returns for the next one!!

B004SDEP38|1.0|I deleted it. You download this app and then it tells you to download the pro version. What a waste!!
B000FCK65W|5.0|A Tree Grows In Brooklyn is a very special book.  I've read it, maybe six or seven times over the course of my life - this and Maggie Now by Betty Smith.<br /><br />It's a very timely story because we're seeing this more and more - poor children not having access to resources that might help them develop skills that are not associated with being poor: like being a writer or an artist or a dancer.  Schools offer so little now in the arts and yet traditionally it is the struggles of living that can temper those gifts.<br /><br />The story is essentially about a family and how they support one another through the best and the worst.  it's about being human and imperfect and not always understanding our differences, our hopes and yearnings.<br /><br />The center of the story is Francie, a rather lonely, lost and sensitive child who is very creative/artistic.  She is born poor, attends school in old Brooklyn where it's 40 or 50 to a classroom and no one cares if you can craft a beautiful story.  It's also about a father, however damaged and fragile, who gives his little girl the joys and hopes she needs to have and the encouragement to be the woman she was meant to be.  Fathers are very important to young women in a very specific way and this book chronicles this dynamic quite beautifully.  It also speaks to mothers and daughters and how difficult and strained that relationship can be as well.<br /><br />It's one of the most beautiful and poignant books ever written.  I love it and I'll buy the kindle just so I have it on my devices to read again perhaps.
B0041D843M|4.0|This book will astonish you, anger you, and motivate you toward change.  Start with the first four chapters and you'll get the main points pronto. What you read will stay with you.<br /><br />The convincing research conducted by T. Colin Campbell regarding the benefits of a plant-based diet is nothing short of revolutionary. Following Dr. Campbell's advice may not be not easy but it is worth pursuing, even in small steps. Small changes reap big benefits. If the carnivores among us can't all go all the way to apply his revolutionary nutrition findings, we can all  begin to give his work serious consideration. His findings on nutrition and disease have inspired me to do my best to keep cancer and heart-disease at bay through better nutrition. As a new septuagenarian, reading this book convinced me it's never too late to change my eating habits. Even those with a disease process already in evidence may find help and new hope in this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son plays this game for hours and he absolutely loves it!  Even my 3 yo grandson plays and they LOVE IT!!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|A story of twins, murder, and mayhem.  The story is well developed but very, very dark and quite foreboding.  I am fascinated with twins and that's what I found so interesting in this story.  It is a slow read, not really a beach read.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|I played truism app at my friends house but when I tried to download it on my kindle it didn't work
B000FBJEL0|4.0|Conspiracy Club is a good mystery before you even know what the crime actually is or who the suspect(s) is/are; the reader spends some time trying figure out whether there has even been a crime.<br />  I have been an Alex Delaware fan since &#34;When the Bough Breaks&#34; but after reading 10 or so there is a sort of predictable if comforting formula.  Conspiracy Club was nearly as much fun as the &#34;first time&#34;.  So while there is a psychologist-protagonist, he isn't Delaware, he has a different set of friends, he is not as  personally cool as Deleware and he doesn't live in Los Angeles.  And, face it, Saturday Night Live's satire on Californication echos of Alex Delaware's Los Angeles.  So, this was a good solid mystery, with lots of good twists, with a different set of characters and context.  Fun.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I really love this show.  Love the fact I can purchase it and watch on my Kindle!!!  Hope the seasons keep on coming.
B0054CUETG|5.0|This is, in my opinion, Asimov's best book; certainly the most fun.  A science fiction mystery that works on both levels and they said it couldn't be done.  It is a sequel to The Caves of Steel and surpasses it.  The only thing missing are the original illustrations from the magazine version.  Otherwise, it is nearly perfect.  A society so phobic that it cannot bear its members and a detective who can't stand open spaces.  The contrast sets up a situation that is socially intriguing.  And Asimov doesn't cheat.  Think as you read and you might figure it out.  All the clues are there but not too obvious.  I love this book and envy anyone who is reading it for the first time.  John Dickson Carr could have done better.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|We only watched the first VERY LONG 15 minutes and it was a total waste of time- plus the words were mumbled so it washard to understand
0375830995|5.0|After reading Karkus Zuzak's &#34;The Book Thief&#34;, I bought this books, which he had written prior to that.  I absolutely LOVE reading this book, and am almost finished reading it.  Zuzak is a funny, brilliant writer.  I recommend this for anyone of any high school through older person (as I am) who wants a truly GOOD read.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hilariously funny is the only way to describe this book. After seeing all the reviews, I had to jump on the bandwagon. This book is STUPID, IGNORANTLY-FUNNY!!I know I have burned several calories just from laughing at Drew and Mackenzie. I did a lot of highlighting. I LOVED that this book was told from a male's POV especially Drew's POV. Not only was he telling the story of how things went down between him and Kate but \\"schooling\\" women on how men are and what to do and what not to do. He was more than just a man-whore.... he was self-centered, spoiled,a momma's boy, and arrogant. I dont think I have ever met a character like him before. I think I may have a secret crush on him. LOL!<br /><br />Now that darn Kate Brooks, was something else. I loved her attitude and how she didnt take just take the crap he dished her, but she fault back hard. Her mouth was just as \\"smart\\" as his. She definitely gave him a run for her money. The first female to ever tell him NO and was intelligent. Drew hated the fact that Kate was competition as an investment banker. I still crack up just thinking about what she did to his computer. I loved the games that they played with each other. This chick rocked!!! Even when Drew messed up majorly she didnt take him back right away. I didnt feel sorry for him one bit. I was happy when she said NO after he said he was sorry. Little Drew had to grow up and learn that some things are worth fighting for, and she held her ground till the end. That office scene where he mimicked the Notebook would have won me over also. I had to read that part twice.<br /><br />Now that sweet like niece of Drew named Mackenzie just stole the show/book. She was so freaking adorable and funny. She truly loved her uncle Drew. I loved the idea of the curse jar. Drew was constantly putting money into the jar. Oh and the Thanksgiving scene, I had to cover my mouth from laughing out loud because I was not in the proper place to do so.<br /><br />Because of how funny this book is, I suggest you read this at home so you can laugh out loud and not care about who is listening and disturbing anyone. Even without the delicious sex scenes, the comedy is enough to sell this book on its own. If you havent read this book, I highly suggest you do... immediately!!!!
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|love this story Tatiana Maslany does a great job playing multiple characters and she's beautiful. I hope the show last for more than a few seasons .
B00004TDTO|5.0|In all its wide screen glory. My favorite movie of all time. Will spend the whole summer watching this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I find this app very entertaining and fun.Also you do not need to buy anything with your own money. So keep your wallets in your pockets.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Amazon, takes notes please. This is what a free app should be!  Can't believe it's been over a year since i five star afree app. Oh and a previous review by a blind user ssaid there isn't an exit button. Well there is.  On the main menu at the upper right corner they is an X. Tap it to exit the game :) Thanks dev
B000GWE44U|1.0|My daughter wanted to see this movie, she has heard and seen all of the references so I decided to pop for the rental. This is my first bad experience with Amazon, it took forever to download. And then it skipped like mad, I deserve credit on my account. Or just a refund. If you try it I hope it works for you.<br /><br />  P.S.  I contacted Amazon and they promptly refunded my money!<br />  What a great service!
159463176X|5.0|I watched Khaled's novels since I was like 17 and I absolutely loved all of them.<br />I was quite excited when I knew that he is releasing his new book and as soon as it got released,<br />I rushed to Amazon and purchased it.<br />So far, I am loving it. I read to my boyfriend :)
B00BEU6JVY|5.0|If you loved Justin Hayward in the Moody Blues and had been less than thrilled with his previous attempts on his own... this Album is for you!  In fact it is for everyone who likes clear classic rock that has those wonderful melodies.  Justin has pulled out some of the greatest songs I have ever heard him write and placed it along side a few of his oldies with a new twist.  His voice is as great as it was when he was twenty and while most of the songs go with the classic rock sound, he throws a few that have a slightly blue grass tone to the mix.  One of my favorites on the album is 'One More Broken Dream' which has that classic heartthrob melody that Justin has been writing ever since he began.  Trust me... a wonderful album that you'll be listening to over and over again!
B000L53D4O|5.0|I can't say enough about this product.  I buy it for all my 1 year birthday gifts.  The one year olds I have given it to all love it.
B005VPXNV2|4.0|fashioned entertainment from the master, himself. Unfortunately, not all of Steven King's books get this kind of a royal treatment for the big screen but Misery is one the few that holds its own.
B00BIQU1K4|3.0|I've been a huge Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson fan since 1997 when I first heard Signify.  I've loved most of his work and followed him extensively.  I've enjoyed all the changes in sound, but I'm a bit bewildered by this one.  I know Wilson is a huge 70s Prog fan.  I grew up listening to the same stuff.  However, to me this album is simply too regressive.  If I wanted to listen to King Crimson, Yes or Genesis I would do that.  It sounds to me like he's trying too hard to emulate his Prog heroes and to be honest he doesn't have the talent for it.  His great talent is making simple music sound complex and emotive.  Much of the album isn't coherent and seems to exist only because it can.  Other than the title track and Drive Home, which fairly quickly lost their charm, this album left me feeling nothing which I would have thought impossible coming from him.<br /><br />I only give it three stars for the quality of the engineering and mixing.  I hope Wilson loses this Prog fascination on his next album and gets back to what he does best. To me Insurgents is a far more interesting, experimental and fitting of Wilson's talents than this one.
B000HZGBLA|3.0|I'm guessing this is probably one of the more successful video game to movie pieces  going. Angelina Jolie is beautiful and she carries the movie as best as she can but If I had to choose, I'd probably recommend Resident Evil.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the graphics and I play it all of the time.  Very simple and easy to play.  And right now it is free.
B00471Z3CI|4.0|..favorite. Great story telling and visuals. What a fun day with a movie is all about. Hopper and Spielberg put together a classic with this one.
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|It is wonderful to see that research proves a self evident truth - do good unto others as much as you can and good things will happen to you
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Harris seems to make a case that we have free will to the extent that we can condition our impulses. He might have unpacked it a bit to acknowledge that unconscious processing makes capacity available for executive function. The two systems are complementary. We couldn't manage executive function if we had to consciously control our uncritical responses. It's not much of a case for determinism if we have executive function and we can condition our impulses.
B00821OX98|4.0|It's action packed since the first episode. Very realistic. Not in love with the lead female doctor her acting needs help.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A different type of story, very interesting, but a little gory.  Did not really like watching children kill each other, but the story kept me interested and I had to keep watching to the end.

B0063M22QO|4.0|Like the different levels and puzzles you get with this version. I am rather new to this game but am finding it to be easy yet challenging.
157421327X|3.0|I was disappointed as i was hoping for better instructions or better examples.  but it kept me entertained while on jury duty so it worked.  i have since found several better choices.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have a router in the basement and use the a Kindle in an upstairs bedroom. I used the analyzer to check the relative strength of available channels and found a better one than that automatically chosen by the router. I chose this channel on accessing the router, and gained an extra 6dbm. This was worthwhile because the bedroom signal was close to marginal. Also like the other graphical representations, especially the updating signal level meter.
B0068FZ024|5.0|The story is well put together of three broken men and how Seabiscuit brought them toghether. Great twist to the ending of the movie.  The video and sound are spectacular in blu-ray.
B000007XUQ|5.0|We expected a CD with 10 to 14 songs, what we got was 2 CD's with 13 songs on CD #1, and 14 songs on CD #2.  Amazon is actually the only online company I wish to deal with.  Anything I have Ordered from Amazon.com is as good as, or better than as listed, delivery is constantly at least 3 to 5 days earlier than as stated, and finally... My Orders are ALWAYS!!! right.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I am so sorry this show was cancelled. I really enjoyed all the characters, and the singing and dancing. It was so much more intelligent that Glee.

B0011BGY66|5.0|I did not know Vampire Weekend, or of them, until a few weeks before the recent release of their third album, Modern Vampires of the City.  Which I loved.  And that led me to go back and buy Vampire Weekend and Contra, their first two albums.  I love them all.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Difficulty scales well, very entertaining. Got it for free and would recommend it for at least 5 hours of gaming. Easy to pick up and put down with some innovative slider game play.
B008I43DYU|1.0|I tried a simple division problem ...362/12 and got some strange result 3.0'''' with &ldquo;e&quot; before the last number.  I really didn't understand. Am I supposed to move the decimal mark?
B00632HWOG|1.0|I am ai fan of classic Yahoo. This new version is super awful. If this is suppose to be a change for the better,  well in my opinion it is horrible. I am deleting my Yahoo account and moving on to. G mail.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|could have more of a story line and background. but still fun<br />it could use some ground asolt and walkoround to really compleate the intensity.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this system works very well. the adjustable skill of the computer is excellent, it being very up to date on stratagy. love it!
B003QSLW0K|1.0|The way the characters interacted with each other set a very poor example for young children.  The moral was not strong enough to justify the means it took to get there.  The characters were very unattractive and did not compliment the culture that was represented.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Powerful, invigorating in its ability to make me believe in the nobility and the power of man to face such cruelty, irrationality, barbarism, evil and adversity, yet overcome and triumph against all odds in such a powerful way.  A must read for anyone who ever thinks about ending their life.  Victor Frankyl is inspirational if only for his willpower, courage and commitment to continue on life's journey.  His self analysis and that of his captors reveals an extraordinary wisdom and his courage to share this part of his life to all is a tribute to the human race
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|I love Mark Wahlberg. If you enjoy anything he's done in the past you will like the film. Don't hesitate to buy it. Its a solid cop film with interesting twists and bumps in the plot. It definitely kept my attention. Mark's character is an interesting anti-hero who finds redemption. Personally I love films that explore themes of redemption because they personally give me hope. I also identify with Mark because he's a &#34;man's man&#34; and I love seeing that on film. I think alot of guys identify with his roles and like to hear there's always hope even for the most wayward of the flock.<br /><br />Hope for the broken and redemption for the lost. Great film. Keep it up Mark.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because you can try an  win people and things.<br />It's good.because it's free.<br />I wish there was a second one but in it you can do different lands.<br />Your sincerely<br />  AMI

076781214X|3.0|I don't have many particulars about this one as it was a gift for someone else. She stated that she liked it though.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Arrow is a great show, but once in a while I wonder if he is &#34;black mailing&#34; people or saving the city.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|There seems to be a lot of experimentation in the music composition and choice of sound samples, but somehow Grimes manages to connect everything together to make it sound like a beautiful piece of art.<br /><br />These songs are energetic, upbeat and uplifting and epic.  I've been listening over and over on my ride to work every morning, Grimes is a great way to start the day.  There just seem to be a lot sounds of things that evoke this sort of nostalgia from a world that never existed, and almost fantasy world, but real because this music make it so.
0451232577|5.0|I started with &#34;World without end&#34; and couldn't wait to get your next, and next, and next,,,,,,  I'm almost finished with &#34;Winter of the World&#34; and waiting for your next book.

B004S5C8WG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Easy read with unexpected twists. If you just want to get lost in a book this is worth a try.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is more than just a &quot;tip of the hat to retro shoot-em-ups&quot;. It is a work of art in its own right. There's nothing cookie cutter about it and it is absolutely well put together in such a way that it still feels unique even though it is instantly familiar. The graphics are astounding -- especially for a mobile device. The gameplay is fluid and fun; the multiple control options only make it that much better because you can choose your poison. There are enough levels to keep you busy for quite a while. The intensities are there but it never gets annoying. The difficulty is there yet the game never feels unfair. Truly an amazing achievement of programming and good game design. Absolutely 5 stars!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I enjoyed this book but wouldn't put it high on my list.  Really hard to believe that this guy could let his girlfriend try and kill herself without actually trying to help her.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Awesome game I think. It was really fun to play with family and friends. I enjoyed trying to figure out what they drew and then try to draw a picture.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics are really good. Like it says you seamlessly switch between levels via a free download (you get 3gems for doing it!) It's a fun challenge, some obstacles appear just before you get to them. ITS LEGIT AND U NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I have a hard copy and a copy on my kindle. This book is like a book of wisdom for everyday situations. I tell everyone about this book because it has helped me immensely through the years just getting through life's ups and downs. You can apply any of his teachings to your situation and you will sail through it with grace and ease. My bible...
0743435729|5.0|Following the beloved On Basilisk Station by some two years, now Captain Harrington is thrust into yet another uncomfortable and untenable situation. It is by courage, loyalty and honor that she fights her way through to protect The Honor of the Queen.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game works well but the pop ups which came with it are terrible. Annoying and difficult to close, should have been warned before installing the app.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Having just returned from vacation, this movie was entertaining to watch. Denzel has a repetitive annoying swirling tongue against his cheek thing he does in this movie that's odd.
B00000I07P|5.0|Go watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure if you need more prospective.<br />I need 8 more words so I'll conclude with &#34;WILD STALLIONS&#34;<br />...is this enough
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As all the books in this series.  I loved them.  Gripping and memorable.  I wish there was another one like the previous 3 but sadly all things come to an end.
B0091WD4ZQ|4.0|99% of this movie is just a conversation between 2 people.  They fill up the screen and both have a commanding performance.  Although Ethan Hawke is a great actor, he has more physical and verbal tics that can get to you after awhile, but all in all, worth watching.  Holds up well over time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would have preferred a better ending. I will read another of her books, like her style of writing. Thx
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|HILL climb racing is the best. I think you should get it. You can upgrade your car and get new maps.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A good perspective on how the war affected all involved. I found some of the facts introduced new to me and refreshing.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Watch it several times and you will notice new ways that it ties into itself. The first time will take awhile to make sense, but once it does, it will draw you into it's world.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|At long last, Edgar Rice Burroughs's A PRINCESS OF MARS comes to the screen in this spectacular re-imagining of the Barsoom series of novels. You don't need to have read a word of Burroughs but you will recognise elements of his work, pillaged by other writers and film-makers since the first book's publication a hundred years ago. Without John Carter, there would be no Star Wars, Superman, Avatar, Stargate... Let's just say, popular fiction and film would have been very different.<br /><br />This remarkable legacy aside, Andrew Stanton's film is a corker. There are no short cuts to audience gratification.  Stanton expects his audience to have emotional intelligence, at least! Taylor Kitsch deviates from the leading man archetype - his Carter is a reluctant participant.  When the extent of his personal losses is revealed in a wonderfully cinematic moment at the film's turning point, it moves me to tears every time - assisted of course by Michael Giscchino's beautiful score.<br /><br />Lynn Collins is a stunning Princess Dejah - beautiful, intelligent, strong and vulnerable.  She and Kitsch share a playful sense of humour as their characters bicker and bond.<br /><br />The natives of Mars, the many-limbed Tharks are flawlessly created and performed with, can I say humanity? by acting worthies Willem Defoe and Samantha Morton.  The pet Woola, has to be seen to be believed - and loved.  Every home should have one.<br /><br />But above all it's the story: a rip-roaring sci-fi adventure with humour, intelligence and emotional impact.  If there is not at least one sequel to this film, than this world is doing itself a disservice.  I want to go back to Barsoom!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I read this fantasy book series alongside visiting and learning about real castles, cathedrals and strongholds of southern Europe.  Being able to see artifacts that the characters might have actually used and to visit structures very similar to those which they inhabited really made me feel a part of the stories told (even if only as one of the smallfolk).  Learning about the sordid histories of the ancient cities was also a wonderful parallel.  The SOIAF series, however, has dragons and zombies, so that's pretty cool, too!
B00BTABOCS|5.0|Once again, Iron Maiden deliver a product the quality that their fans have come to expect. I have been a Maiden fan since 1984 and with one minor exception (VXI) I have never been disappointed, and this is no exception. The remastered sound is excellent. My old video tape of this performance has long since worn out... so it makes me quite happy that they have FINALLY put this one out in digital format.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Clean graphics, solid controls, and good gameplay. It's not amazing, but it's not bloated with a story or training missions or any of that fluff, so it's quick to get into. It's the first FAOTD that I've enjoyed in a long time.
B00C9VFWP6|5.0|This is the Live After Death for the 2010's. What an excellent live recording! Stu Block is easily one of the best voices in metal today and makes a magnificent addition to Iced Earth.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|The last five minutes of this movie is my favorite. Superb acting, great dialogue, and that song....<br /><br />\\"Quintus<br />Free my men<br />Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated<br />There was a dream that was Rome<br />It shall be realized<br />These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius\\"<br /><br />If you havent seen this yet you are missing out
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled IS as good and as funny as all the reviews I had read said it would be - I absolutely LOVED this book! The writing was fresh and original, and I loved reading a story from the male's POV entirely.<br /><br />Drew narrates the story and the way he tells it is as if you are right there with him and he is describing the scene as he goes.<br /><br />\\"See that guy - black suit, devilishly handsome? Yeah, the guy getting the blow job from the luscious redhead in the bathroom stall? That's me. The real me. MBF: Me Before Flu.\\"<br /><br />I did end up loving Drew. His character evolved throughout the story into the kind of man you could fall in love with and spend the rest of your life with. I also liked Kate. Together they created enough tension to keep the story interesting without becoming unbelievable and annoying. I also liked their family and friends, especially Drew's sister and niece. They all helped bring the story together in a fun way.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Before watching the seventh season of Dexter, I couldn't imagine how the writers of this show were going to keep me interested for another season.  After watching the first episode...I was hooked again!  Although some of the earlier seasons are still my favorites, this season was still quite entertaining.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I was held in suspense while I 'knew' the young protaganist had done something, I was surprised at the end.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesomely Addictive. I can play this game for hours. Definitely would recommend a download. And the movie kicked ass too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game that has room for improvement. The game has no glitches that have been found so far. Graphics are decent but load quickly.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I wished they had stayed with the story from the book a bit closer.  But the series was enough to keep me wanting to watch more.  I'm waiting to watch session 3 until I'm done with the book.<br /><br />Season 1 held closer to the book than 2.  But they were both great.  I found myself saying, hey that's not the way it happened, but to my wife who had not read the book, it made no difference as it was still very compelling and an epic series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun and addictive. Totally hooked have it on my phone, kindle etc. Have recommended it to several friends. Everyone should try it out!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|excellent writing style - told in the 1st person. Captured me from the start and very hard to put down. Horrifying and facinating at the same time
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. It makes you want to hug your kids and family a little tighter and keep your kids young forever.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love the characters and am looking forward to the fourth book of the series as the readers were left wondering at the end of the third book as they were at the end of each previous book.
B003L20IHE|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend who asked me if i could find it. Apparently she was elated when I presented her with a copy.
B00004R99F|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies as a kid and my husband loved it too. So glad to be able to share it with my kids
B00AAX68HG|1.0|Population, my kindle. never got a chance to try it. as soon as it finishes the intro video and I hit play, it closes. west.
0887431453|5.0|I love having workbooks for my kids. It allows my to be able to &#34;home school&#34; my kids and prepare them for preschool.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I Pre-ordered the \\"History of the Eagles Super Deluxe Limited Edition Box Set\\".  The DVDs do not work.  DVD 1 did but not the other two.  I contated MusicToday the people that are handling the orders and they sent me out a replacement.  THESE DVDs DO NOT WORK!!  I have tried to contact MusicToday with no return reply to date.  This is almost June and I still do not have a working DVD set  Unbelievable that the Eagles would allow this type of poor service.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great movie.  It's a shame it got screwed over by Disney's on the way out marketing department and thus wasn't appreciated by a bigger audience at the box office.  Hopefully a sequel gets made some day.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I am not really happy with the game-there is too much involved with it.<br />I wish I could have it removed from my Kindle-but, I don't know if that is possible.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|After watching the Season One DVDs, I was hooked! Soap opera at it's best for sure, but it really draws you in. Intriguing characters and the lifestyle, clothes, furniture, etc. of the 1960s is fun to watch and reminisce. Real life events of the times are also depicted and it is easy to get caught up and think back to how your own life was affected by these events. Great story lines for each of the characters. I can't get enough!
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's fun for being a farm-based game. You get so many stamina points that you use to pay for actions. It's the same formula as most Facebook games. Once you're out of stamina, you wait to recharge. As you level, your base stamina increases, which is a very welcome change.<br /><br />The story itself is standard: you start with a village and grow your kingdom in order to fight an evil king. Where the game shows charm is in the semi-sarcastic banter from your support crew. As you fight your way across the continent, you also can recruit the vanquished foes. If you are lucky enough to have friends that play as well, you can unlock and enhance better skills on your army.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good way to waste time here and there. I definitely recommend talking a friend into playing too.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I've read all of her books and this one was also fun. totally contrived and frivilous but so what;  a great escape. laughed and cried. a wonderful quick read into pure fun.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Got like a fellow South Carolina fan. This is good music. Really like the mandolin parts. Cool video on wagon wheel.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Gave to my young grand sons - 6 and 4 and they loved it.  The magic is still there for all ages.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Hugh Jackman's best role to date.<br />Some of the younger cast sing beautifully. Worth seeing just because it wasn't sung in a studio, but live. And yes, Russell Crowe was wrong for the role of Javert. Can't believe he actually passed he audition. He sings 'Stars' OK, but in general everyone else blows him out of the water. He is the weak link in this movie acting-wise as well.<br />Helena Bonham-Carter and the guy who played Borat provide much-needed comedic relief.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|So formulaic, so against logic, so against the laws of physics, so cliche, so unfunny (unless you like dumb plots), so like Randy to like this movie.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Hate musicals but bought it for a collection.<br />Saw the movie and some of the cast were brilliant. Won't probably listen to this again, but it's in the pile anyway.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We love all the temple run games! This one is no exception. My daughter plays it all the time on her tablet and mine.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Lovers of British period drama will LOVE Downton Abbey. Well-acted, gorgeous location and well-written. Think nastier Upstairs Downstairs. You are completely caught up and want to ring the necks of  most of the caracters, because, well, they are just so nasty.<br />Get the entire Series and the Christmas Specials o u don't miss an episode.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I'm not a fan of fiction and most of my reviews are of non-fiction books, since I am always more in search of real stories and fact reading.  Well that might be why I bought this book both on the Kindle and Audiobook.  The Audiobook was great because it is read by the author himself.  This book had two things that interested my 1. Semi autobiographical perspective of the author's writing experience 2. Tips on writing.  King has always interested me, although I haven't read any of his books, since every time I pick one I end up giving up on fiction half-way through the reading.  His outstanding success as a writer is something I admire and respect since I have a lot of friends who love his books.  After reading On Writing I could understand his bizarre fiction full of gore and supernatural.  His personal recounts on real life experiences have made his life as unreal and supernatural as one of his books, like his near to death experience when he was hit by a car while walking near his home.  This book I guess still preserves that fiction style, which has been successfully translated into blockbuster movies and now has been adapted to his personal autobiography.<br /><br />Although a bit loose on writing tips, On Writing is more a recount of experience and the whole thought and discipline process gone through his most important works llike Carrie, The Stand,  The Shining, Death Zone, etc.<br /><br />On this book you will find<br />-Recount of the author's his early life and initiation in writing<br />-Writing habits and approach on novel writing success<br />-Detailed development of his most famous works and how Carrie made him famous writer<br />-King's struggle with alcoholism and how he dealt with it<br />-First hand recount of the accident that almost killed him<br />-Author's reading list recommendations<br />-Future projects and perspective on life
B007REV4T8|5.0|Technological advances in special effects threaten to overwhelm movies like this, but Bond does it again.<br />The Adele song is so overplayed, however.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I have a challenging job that requires me to spend a lot of time thinking. The games I like therefore must occupy my mind in such a way that I don't think about work. This game is challenging enough to keep my mind occupied but at the same time easy and relaxing. My 5 year-old nephew enjoys playing with me. I would have given the game 5 stars except for the fact that there was no way to turn off the music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if u all love this app like me you can get it for Pc and xbox I stared playing minecraft in the Pc version the Pc version is much much much much much better than Pe and xbox is better than pe too if u think this is amazing u will blow up when u play Pc
B007IO1X5C|4.0|I guess I liked this because I agree with his premise that some things are degraded or corrupted by being sold. He write in an easy to understand fashion with many concrete examples of things for sale.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love dragonvale. You should really get it. I play it whenever I get a chance and I enjoy playing with all the dragons<br /> I know you will ,too
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONES. Love the newest features. Great graphics too. TIME TRAVELING IS FUN WITH OM NOM.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I have watched this set so many times that one of the discs went bad. So I had to order another one. Well, worth the $25 for a new set. I highly recommend this to people who felt like outcasts in high school, possibly to the popular people who are able to take this representation with a grain of salt, and to high school and possibly even college professors and adjunct faculty, especially those who teach introductory courses that every student must take.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This action in law office compares somewhat to action in police office set forth in The Closer. I find it difficult to limit viewing on Kindle Fire to one session in the series.<br />Excellent program.  Thank you.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|the kids love it. farmville with a twist. great colors and story lines. plays flawlessly on the Kindle Fire. recommended
B007IXWL2C|4.0|They are Great books I'm looking forward to finishing the thirdnand continuing E L James books ,one of my favorite authors
B00B2QA646|1.0|They took a very serious book with a heavy subject line and turned it into a vaudeville??? Horrible. I could only make the first 15 minutes and it turned me off so serverly. The producers, director and writers need to go look at the new Les Mes movie and see how they treated that one...they didn't try to change the tone of the original story.<br /><br />I trusted this Keira Knightley movie because she had been in a fairly decent adaptation of Jane Austin's book but I should have read the reviews! If I could give this zero stars I would !!!! Hated, hated, hated this!
B00CS65JS2|4.0|They've always done their own thing and this album is no different.  I had to spend a few days with it before I could appreciate it and it is definitely NOT an EDM album.  This is the first proper &#34;real&#34; album from Daft Punk.  Almost no samples (save for &#34;Contact&#34;)  This album really showcases the songwriter qualities in our favorite robots.  Heavy funk and disco influences.  I definitely recommend the Slate review for this album if you're looking for insight into why this album is so important.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books to date, but did miss this one.  Great way to start a new series.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|When I bought this wonderful 99&cent; game I was not expecting such a amazing Game!  I NEVER get bored of punching the evil monsters this cool game has to offer. Tho there is many types of monsters, I really wish Noodlecake could add some more.  I love upgrading my player so I can look super rad when I am punching my foes. I really hope the game developers read this review, and if you are.... Thank you so much for this super amazing Game. I highly recommend this game to everyone out there reading this message. :)<br />  Sincerely, Catman9123
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My boys love to play this game. It is so much fun.  I highly recommend this application. Try it you will like it.
0143039482|5.0|If you like Steinbeck, this is a good one. Well written, interesting story that holds your attention to the last page.  Too bad it had to end.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|Takes a little getting used to, but works pretty well. Looks nice and protects my Kindle. Lobe being able to turn it however I want to and stand it up.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|Steinbeck at his best.  What a story packed in 107 pages.  I think of the characters so often even though I read the book a while ago.  A definite must for Steibeck fans.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is what all arcade shooters should aspire to.  Vibrant colors, smooth level progression, cool powerups, and bosses...<br /><br />Definitely get it.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I enjoyed the story which was a delightful mix of humor and the reality of a painful time in our society when African Americans were treated as property, not as people. I was from the north and did not become aware of these facts or ideas until later in life. I am still appauled that it ever happened.
B000GCFD72|3.0|This book has some very interesting concepts that make a lot of sense. It takes a long time to get to them though. First half is a tough read, filled with countless scientific study results and constant repetition of the underlying &#34;problem.&#34; Once you get passed that it gets a little more interesting.<br />It feels like it was a pretty good, 3 page, informational pamphlet that got stretched into a book. I just kept feeling like I was reading the same information, slightly re-worded, over and over again.
B00821OX98|5.0|this is one of the better sci Fi series, good character build up and interesting storyline. you recommend,  only 10 episodes 2 seasons so far.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I don't always rate games, but when I do its because I enjoyed it much more than I had expected to.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|I just wonder where this is going and how can everything be explained?? Book 3 has some big questionable shoes to fill!
B00BIVN82M|3.0|Not as good as his other recordings.  Song selection could have been much better.  Wouldn't buy it again.  It was a long wait ...Hope his next one is better & doesn't take years to produce & distribute!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this CD by Justin Hayward.  The only problem I had was that whoever packed it up for mailing didn't do a very good job.  As a result the case was broken when I received it.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This movie was more than just a Cinderella story. It is also the tale of a young girl growing up without any loving parents, only the memories of her father. Angelica Houston does a great job making you hate her especially towards the end.<br />A wonderfully touching movie most women cannot help but like.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|As a dog lover, this book was very touching, fun, and very enjoyable to read. Makes me wonder just what my Lab is thinking!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so addictive and......... it is just plain AWESOME!!oh and plz make more.....plz!:) if you don't at least I have both the temple runs. Plz make another 1.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is totally awsome.  don't worry about the price it's worth it.not MINECRAFT yet but updates are making it better.
B000I186FW|4.0|For a long time, I avoided viewing this because it held no interest. Was I pleasantly surprised!!! This Video is really interesting and quite good!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is worth 6,99 sorry it does not have dots but eneyway I like a setting in the setting that makes no enemy's on survival mode
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting enjoyable worth the money to buy extra coins must play game cannot put down super game. super super game great for Car rides and lunch times love it love it
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I wish there was a zero option.  JJ trek is not Star Trek.  This is fast and furious in space, nothing more.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|It looks simple but requires a lot of thinking and calculation. It's also beautiful. 5 star for me. It may not be easy for other but kids will liie this
B009NY43NY|3.0|It's the final Sookie book in a series that I've been addicted to since the beginning. Yes, it's sad that it's the last one, but I found it just as hard to get through as the last couple of installments. Why? I was bored. I don't care what Sookie cooks, or eats, or thinks about cooking. I want the action and love and suspense that made me read the first eight books over and over. I do think that things wrapped up nice enough for my satisfaction, but the whole time I felt disappointed with the lack of UMPH behind the writing. I don't have an issue with the Eric situation - he is who he is and I think his actions stayed true to his survivor mentality. I'm not sure how I feel about how Sookie's love-life ended up...in some ways it makes sense, in others...it seemed forced. But, I still paid a ridiculous amount of money to read this on my kindle, and in all - I'm not too disappointed.<br /><br />The Good: I do think it was a worthy ending. Left room for some follow up should Charlaine choose to do it, but I enjoyed seeing some of the old characters come back.<br /><br />The Issue: The writing. I don't know if it's because of all the other authors I've read (mainly indies!) since my addiction to Charlaine, but the quality of writing just wasn't what I've come to expect. Even the blurb irks me.<br /><br />In summary: 3 conch. A meh end to an awesome series and characters that will stick with me forever.<br /><br />Originally appeared at: http://ambergarr.blogspot.com
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app.is excellent it is very addictive you will love it. It defiantly deserved 5star it is amazing. I love it and so does my younger brother. It is brilliant
1450419895|5.0|I really like the variety of workout plans and the very detailed drawings.  Great book for the low price.  Would highly recommend.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Moving story about forced battle by one person against other singular tribes and the hardship and struggle one person endured to<br />come out ahead and bring pride and glory to her family and friends
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game itself is pretty cool and both the kids and I rather enjoy it. However,  the game tends to randomly freeze up and not work for up to a couple of days then just randomly start working again. Hopefully this quits, otherwise we will just have to delete it.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|A little far fetch but plausible if they had a battleship ready to relive it's mission for what it was built. Just goes to show that even though your old you can still bring the battle to the enemy and win
B008CLI4N4|1.0|I bought this as a gift based on reviews. Unfortunately, I just looked at some of the reviews and the overall rating, but not the one or two-star reviews. After we watched the first episode and decided not to see any more, I went back and looked at one of the one-star reviews. It described the series as &#34;porn disguised as art.&#34; I agree.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|I love the fast pace and complicated mix of story lines, which have become typical of Jeffery Archers work. As told, you are kept on the edge of your seat, trying to anticipate what is coming! I like Archer's style and as in this case, find the stories to be compelling. He is my favorite author and has been since I opened the first of his books.<br /><br />I would suggest this story to anyone with a fascination of business. The rough and tumble of so many great success stories and their outrageous twists and turns is not lost here. You may not admire all the paths taken, but you will be fascinated by them. I believe this tale parallels  a true story which played out in similar fashion not too many years ago. It is a good read, well done.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Speaking as a fellow expat, I liked how this book handled the out-of-country experience. Lots of verisimilitude and a good sense of place. The plot was also fast and well-paced. A little hard to assemble the puzzle pieces at times, but that's the nature of thriller plots. The characters were a little weaker. Even in a thriller, the motivations have to spring from the character, and neither Kate nor Dexter -- once we learn all that was going on with them -- quite make sense in their multiple roles. Both spouses hide things from each other that one wouldn't think a spouse could hide.<br /><br />But let's face it, if thriller characters acted like the rest of us there would be no story to tell. The plot kept me going; in fact it kept me fascinated. And the final reveal was a genuine surprise.
B00000427L|3.0|I love Rachmaninov's piano concertos and I got the four I love best. This one is okay but I then ordered the same concertos by Philippe Entremont/Andre Watts because those two CD's are the ones I really wanted. There is a big difference in the way the piano is played. They are on two separate CD's just like the ones I am replacing.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this great adventure!<br />I went to bed each night dreaming of the next chapter. The characters felt so real and I loved them all! Great job!
0156027321|3.0|I think I had my expectations built up too high prior to reading this book. I was incredibly let down and felt a little dumb when I discovered late in the book it was fiction. The only thing that compelled me to read it, prior to knowing that fact, was that I thought the events actually took place. It was written as such to make you believe so.
B0092MKFIY|1.0|This download is the worst quality i have ever purchased from Amazon. So not worth $1.29. I enjoy this band and love this song but have to give a 1/5 rating on quality. _Do not_ purchase this song from Amazon.
B00A18KCSQ|5.0|Thank you so much for this product. It was a great price, and everything sounds perfect. Looked almost new. Hope to due business again!!!:) A+++:)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Surprising twist at the end! This book has a quick beginning and just keeps going. It's interesting the lengths a parent will go to protect their children as well as themselves.
B000002H70|5.0|Thank you so much for this product. It was a great price, and everything sounds perfect. Looked almost new. Hope to due business again!!!:)
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have a love/hate relationship with Nicholas Sparks novels, but this one was well worth reading. I enjoyed it very much!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Excellent sequel to series1.Looking forward to series3. The acting ,clothes, even accents of the actors seem to be exactly right.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose a five star rating because this book was so well written, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could seldom put it down. It was actually my first ebook. Can't wait to begin book two of the trilogy.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Read the books not thinking I was going to like them but after waiting and read them along with watching the movie made it much more enjoyable. Can't wait for the new one
B001TODCII|5.0|Adult family movie,  action adventure good guy versus many bad guys with alot of violence.  A former CIA divorced father must apply his craft to rescue his daughter from euro based Human traffickers.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|Don't get it save your money it's fun but impossible to beat so don't get it it got me angry and I stopped playing it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is the fourth book I have read in the series and I love it. I am in the middle of book five now and don't want it to end.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Number 1, I don't have an Android.............I have an iphone..........therefore..........I do not have the Weather Channel on my phone! How about a refund?  or fixing this mistake?????
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Well written from the perspective of Enzo, one of the best dogs in the world, loyal, fun-loving and forever trying to be a good boy. A heartfelt story of a family who looses too much too soon and the fight to keep it all together. Emotional and yet not over the top. A great read!
B00B935SUY|4.0|The story of a recording console, a studio, and the lost of art analog recording. Directed by and with a lot of facetime from Dave Grohl, with lots of musicians (like Neil Young) chiming in.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|This doll is adorable and my daughter loves her. However, she was disappointed that the listing stated that there was a long attachable hair piece, hence making the hair just like Rapunzel. There is no separate hairpiece. My daughter shopped on Amazon, chose this doll and paid for it with her own money. Too bad it wasn't 100% as advertised.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|A captivating drama.  I cannot believe it took me so long to get to this movie. It has to be one of the most moving that I have seen in a long time.  I usually do not enjoy foreign language movies, but the sub titles worked great and I forgot I was reading it.
B004P7CN5O|1.0|Like all Tarentino things this is silly, childish, ridiculous, moronic, garbage.  You shouldn't pay to watch it.  You should be paid to watch it instead.
1433502410|5.0|This is a great study Bible. I haven't done a lot of extensive reading on it yet, but I'm looking forward to studying 2 Thessalonians soon.
B0058O84G0|3.0|Ordinarily I love historical epic dramas and although I did enjoy this book's characters and story, I found the technical historical and political facts heavy reading and tough to understand or take in fully.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Given what our Congress is currently doing, it is too bad this is Science Fiction, and not a news report.  Fantastic cast, brilliant premise.  But who could ever listen to Slim Whitman's Indian Love Song again without imaging your boss's brain exploding....
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|The game itself is exactly what you expect.  Unfortunately there are too many ads; they would even sometimes come up when I hadn't even run the game yet and was simply unlocking the phone.  I uninstalled it without completing it.
B000FA675C|5.0|I am reading this slowly and gathering the whole picture. I like to not have to misplace my book after a session because it's in the computer.<br />.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I could do an in-depth review that hasn't already been done, but I want to at least add to the voices of the 5-stars. The storytelling and suspense of this was amazing. It made me care about most of the characters rather quickly.  There were some parts that could be seen as a little tedious in detail, but it seemed to be used as a device for the suspense--so anxious to know what will happen next, but... a little more waiting is in order, done well.<br /><br />I bought this and the Shift Omnibus on a day they were both on a deal. If the Shift Omnibus holds up anywhere near this, I will likely be paying full price for Dust upon its release.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|This app is very helpful when you admin Facebook fanpages. It's nice to be able to keep that separate from regular/personal Facebook.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is easy to use and has many features.  I highly recommend for those wanting a Bible on their phone/tablet.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I saw the screen shots and the little demo they had and thought, \\"Wow, I would have loved this game as a kid.\\" I picked it up anyway, just because I wanted a look at the beautiful, sweet graphics for a while. Then, yada, yada, yada.... three hours later and I still couldn't put it down. This wasn't for my younger self, I *LOVED* this game. Well worth the two dollars they are asking for. It is challenging, responsive, addicting, graphics are beautiful, gameplay is fun. What isn't there to love about this game.<br /><br />Word of advice, don't press so stinking hard! My finger was killing me after the first half an hour, so I started swapping between my index and middle finger. Just ease up a bit and trust the reaction of your screen.
B006M4F67A|1.0|I was never able to play this; it's fairly large for a phone game, and I had to uninstall it since I couldn't move it to my SD card (where there is room).
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Enjoy this movie!
B000U6BT40|5.0|Sheriff Carter is funny, smart and oh so normal.  So is Zoey.  After that all reason goes out the window.  Interesting characters develop who are funny, smart and oh so weird!<br />And some are a little evil so watch and see who surprises you.
B007Q476KU|5.0|The realism and intensity of the battle scenes were a bit too much at times.  The human kindnesses shown to the horse during its life encounters are touching while the brutality heaped upon it by others is beyond repugnant. Yet the horse's spirit is never broken and its mission to find home and his master stays firm until fate brings all into reality.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This case is versatile and durable. The convenience of being able to swivle the direction of the screen and also access to the usb ports is great. Looks sleek and smart.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|Richard Donnor's Superman movie is probably my second favorite incarnation of Superman.  There is not much to say about say about a classic film like this that has not been said already.  Donnor brought the man of steel to the big screen almost perfectly.  I respect this film, because without the superhero movie genre might not have gotten off the ground. There are however, some issues that I have with the film that I will explain later.<br /><br />This film is played to be more of an epic, and a well done one.  I have not really seen this approach done before in a superhero film.  The film begins with Clark's father Jor El (Marlon Brando) and his mother Laura putting him into the ship going to earth.  You also see the image of Krypton exploding.  In the next sequence we follow Clark growing up with his adopted parents Jonathon and Martha Kent.  We also get glimpses of his life in Smallville.  Then we see him finding out about his origins and who his real parents are.  He seems to spend the rest of his adolescence training with his father Jor El in the Fortress of Solitude.  The next sequence we follow an adult Clark Kent, played by Christopher Reeve, start his life in Metropolis, working at the Daily Planet, and finally becoming Superman.  He also meets Lois Lane, played by Margot Kidder.<br />More than an hour passes before we actually see Superman do anything.  Normally I do like when a movie takes its sweet time in showing the superhero like with Amazing Spiderman.  This is because many times I find the origin to be boring.  However, this one of the few times where taking its time did not really bother me that much.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve is phenomenal as both Clark Kent and Superman.  He is able to encompass those two personas with ease.  To many people he is Superman, and I can see why.  To be honest though, I like Superman the animated series with Tim Daly and Justice League better than this, because I grew up with those shows.  However, Reeve is my second favorite Superman.  Margot Kidder does a great job as Lois Lane.  Kidder is probably my favorite Lois.  Reeve and Kidder have great chemistry on screen.<br /><br />What I do not like is how Lex Luthor is portrayed in this.  Lex comes off as a joke in this, and his part is played up mostly for comedy.  I grew up with the cold calculating business man Lex Luthor.  This Lex is more of a generic Saturday morning cartoon villain bent on taking over the world (or at least a small portion of it) and comes off as more of a nuisance for Superman than an actual threat.<br /><br />I also did not like the ending.  The way Superman fixes everything in the end makes no sense whatsoever.  Even for a superhero movie with a premise like this, it is silly.  It also is very weird character wise.  It was explained earlier that Superman is forbidden to alter the course of human events, but by the end he does exactly that and suffers no consequence for it.<br /><br />Overall, despite my complaints, this is a classic movie.  Whether you are a fan of Superman or superheroes in general this is a must see.  However, I am sure everyone already has seen it.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I've been spending entirely too much time playing this.  It would be cool to have more boards or variety, but as is it's already a lot of fun.
B005DRNXS6|4.0|While I like DARK STAR for its quirkiness, I found the behind the scenes material invaluable.  Seeing the direct line between the computer (complete with its sound effects) and ALIEN was fun.  I enjoyed it, and found it impressive for the time it was produced.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Really, those who didn't like the ending should go back and read the previous volumes. It was predictable. Although I feel that the author rushed a few things, and really stretched to bring back all the previous boyfriends, it was a fairly enjoyable read. I'll miss the series, but am looking forward to more from Charlaine Harris.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I learned much about her and admire her more for her contributions. However, I do not share her political views and opinions.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|It seemed that I could see and feel so much of what she had described. I certainty call this a must read.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The show kept me coming back for more, love this format (no commercials) pause or stop at will & pickup where I left off.
1250012570|5.0|I received this book for review from Netgalley.<br /><br />I loved this book so much! First, I loved the 80's references (it's always nice for us \\"older\\" YA readers to be able to connect to a book for nostalgic reasons). I loved that Eleanor and Park weren't your typical couple. And I loved how I felt reading this book - it made me remember my first love and those strong emotions that I experienced...there is just nothing like it.<br /><br />Eleanor was new to the school. She lived with her mom, and 3 younger siblings...oh, and a horrible, HORRIBLE stepfather. They lived in a \\"bad\\" neighborhood. Eleanor wore clothes from Goodwill that never fit right, much less were trendy, and they rarely had enough food to eat. She even mentioned that she didn't even have a toothbrush...she rubbed salt on her teeth in the school bathroom. She was also overweight and had bushy red hair and freckles. She was basically a walking target for ridicule as a new kid.<br /><br />On her first day riding the bus, everybody refuses to share a seat with her...until Park takes pity on her and shares his seat with her (although he wasn't very nice about it.) From there, a relationship is born...they discover that they have a lot in common - comic books, music, books...there is so much for them to talk about! Park, who also feels like a misfit as he is the only Korean kid at school, realizes he is falling for this unusual girl. And Eleanor is REALLY falling for Park. Hard.<br /><br />But, she has to be careful. Her stepfather keeps a tight leash on her, and she has to hide her friendship with him. She also knows that she is not the type of girl that Park's parents would want their son with. Park's mom is a beautiful, tiny Korean hairdresser. His dad is a good looking, strict army veteran. Eleanor feels very out of place in their \\"perfect\\" home. At first she tries to hide her own family life from Park, but slowly she begins to share about the horror that she lives with.<br /><br />The love that blooms between them is indescribable...so sweet, and the only way I can think to explain it is \\"perfectly imperfect.\\" It seems that all odds are against them, but they just love each other so much. I love that Park, even though he described himself as a misfit, he seemed to be popular and goodlooking, could get past Eleanor's outward appearance, and love everything about her. He didn't love her in spite of her flaws, but loved her because of them.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away -  because I HIGHLY recommend this book - but be prepared to be sucked into this unusual romance and all the emotions that come with it. I hope you will love Eleanor and Park as much as I did! I am totally looking forward to Rainbow's next book Fangirl. I also received this one from Netgalley, so hopefully I can get to it soon!
B0091VTISO|4.0|Honestly, I decided to watch this one because I wanted to test something on my tablet, and figured if it sucked I wouldn't be missing anything.  I was surprised when it turned out that the movie was actually pretty watchable.  Maybe I'm over-voting it because my starting expectations were so low, but, regardless, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Plenty of good violence, plenty of boobs.  What more can you ask for from a Conan movie?
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I like the retro graphics like the classic asteroids with plasma look. Very fun and challenging. Sound is good and diversity of levels keeps it interesting.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|This movie was so sweet, I thought she would go with Duckie but in the end she picked the rich guy.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|I bought this as a gift for friends who say they love it.  The sound is evidently perfect and they have played it practically non-stop since they received it.  i can highly recommend it.
B003XDVVNQ|2.0|I got these for summer and because they just looked so cute! I thought oyster would go with anything and they have vents on top and at the sides to keep your foot cool. Well, I got them. First of all the color was a white white not an oyster. But I thought it was just my pair. Then I tried them on........NOPE. These run very, very, very narrow. Did I say they were narrow? I wear a 10 and could barely fit my feet in them. I walked in them for 2 minutes and immediately took them off and sent them back. Maybe it was just my shipment but they were not comfy at all. So I can't recommend them you.
B004KPHQR6|4.0|I think this movie was entertaining....its not a documentary and at the time it made as much sense as any other plot!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|The App is easy to operate. You can utilize existing music off of your Kindle. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0011B8W6G|5.0|I have all of JJ albums and for whatever reason, didn't pick this one up. It's a very solid album. Song for song it's one of the best. IMHO.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|Wow this movie sure opened my eyes on what drugs can really do to you.  It's amazing how well they were doing before and bad it got in such a short amount of time.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|British actors at their best.  Often the sound of DVDs leaves something to be desired but this is very clear.  I would highly recommend it.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|It easy to take apart ,very light and mobile. The design is great that you're not looking down at the computer and keeps from straining the neck and back muscles.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|At times because chapters often change to another characters point of view, it can be confusing as to who and when is telling the story.
B00COO2D6O|4.0|This version is taking a bit to get used, with the changes to this version.<br />But it seems to have a lot of potential.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|I enjoyed Winter Of The World and would recommend it. It's relatively easy to read and is very informative about many countries caught up in World War 2
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Classic and one of the best tv shows right now.  A bit of a let down after seasons 1 and 2 but a let down season in walking dead is an oscar for another show and likely a set up for something great.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It looks so fun. I was pretty excited until I tried to download all the stuff and after 3 hours it was like 1% .... like how does anyone get it to run on the kindle fire ??
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was a good value. Five batteries for one great low price. It was very convenient and the  item shipped very quickly. Thanks.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Personally, I love this series; HOWEVER, when I first tried it, I could not get into it because I hadn't read any of the book. If you want to love this series, then I'd recommend reading at least the first part of the book because George R. R. Martin has a ton of characters and more than a couple subplots.
B0040I09RM|5.0|But still great.  Even if you're finding it ridiculous, stick with it.  The payoff is worth it in the end.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burrows since I was a small child. When I first heard of this movie, I was so excited to see it and so scared they would ruin it. For a ERB fan this movie delivers! Even though some theatrical license was taken, it in no way detracted from the story. I think it made it a little easier for those unfamiliar with the story to follow and understand what was going on. I sincerely hope a sequel is made!!
B002RHGYOA|4.0|This was a good read and I'm really happy to have read the next in this series.  Well worth the read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first book simply blew me away. I think the thing about this book that kept me reading and reading is that the characters are so real. But secondly, it's that they don't even know the type of world they are living in and you find out along with them. It makes you want to know more every time a little more is revealed about these silos. Usually, I don't like flashbacks in books, but this author clearly used them with great skill to foreshadow and build suspense.<br /><br />While I was reading the second book, I have to admit some frustration. It was very dreary with all this walking up and down stairs without clear reason. It ended in a tragedy that didn't make much sense to me at first. However, all the books work together well in one big Omnibus and I can see why book 2 is the way it is.<br /><br />Then it rocked all the way to the end. Lots of cool reveals happen and are dished out in a perfect kind of way. I'm looking forward to reading more of Howie's work.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo game I have found I have a bunch of different versions I tried and ended up deleting them because they sucked. I would definitely recommend this game to any bingo fans
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I love the characters, and the story carries on faithfully to the book. The only downside is that the language gets cruder. It's not a deal breaker by any means, but swearing without a point (be it characterization, atmosphere, etc.) gets boring.<br /><br />Still, overall, I love it and have watched it over and over again.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book really makes you<br />Think of your childhood,  makes you think of things that you did that were kind and things that maybe you wish you could change.  This book really dose pull on your heart strings, and makes you want to believe in miracles.  At the end you understand the miracle that really happened and the way it touched everyone in their life.  Just read it its really good
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|In fact, better than the book. hey, what so tough about a guy thats 6'5'', 250, beating a guy - much more impressive when its an average Joe.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|I found this a confusing book to read but had to keep going.  Eventually, it all came together and I enjoyed it and am glad I continued with it.  Glad I have read the 3 books in this series.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is hands down the most fun I've had on android in a very long time. From the moment you start playing you get a great feel for the game a'la 80s arcade shooters like space invaders. The graphics and intensity of this game are astounding.. I literally cannot put it down. Best free app to date! Even if this wasn't free now I would buy it and I've never paid for a single android game.. It is that good.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have read this novel several times now.  Unlike all the others that have followed, there is genuineness and no camp in these words.  I am hugely bummed that the movie is going to Bethesda typical &#34;zombie&#34; flick with lots of CGI.  Shame on you, Brad Pitt for going the chickens#[+ way out to show how much a macho hero you are.  Right - CGI hero is more like it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The best app I have EVER played. Please please please...do more...<br />This app was genius!!! I am so excited to see what's next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is so fun and challenging anyone who doesn't have it should get and i know that they will love it!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|linkedin is a geat program for anyone who wants to keep up with different jobs- you can make friends and learn from them too
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mincraft and have played all versions but I only own poket edition so I get to play it all the time. But how can you rate this 1 star and it needs updates
B0029LCJJS|5.0|It is as good as 'The Six Wives of Henry Viii' - maybe even better.  Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|He's 62 and it's his second album.  He's been trying to make it in the music realm for a long time!  Very enthusastic about life!  He was near death.  His music explains the &#34;soul&#34; of america!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is awesome play it! Even though you pay for it I don't care. it is literally awesome!<br />do not rate 1 star! rate 5 uh huh yo!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I love this movie. Had never heard of it, and a friend recommended it, so I bought it. My 4-year-old grandson loves it, too!
157421327X|3.0|My expectation was higher, I think the books mcneill be nice to have a preview. Okay product, arrived in good condition and on time. Thank you very much
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is just like being at the fair. a little slow at first be it draws you in. I like it.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This story kind of gets you pulled in and you don't want top stop reading it.  Enjoyed it very much.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I am recommending it to everyone. I plan to read it again. This book validates so many things. Thank you Eben Alexander for writing this book.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is very real and very helpful in making people understand what is important in life and how to live your life so you are in touch with what is important.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this movie. It's not as epic as the first Lord of the Rings but everything from the scenery to the battle scenes are great!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a captivating continuation of the first two seasons. Each episode makes satisfactory progress toward resolving previous dilemmas, introduces new twists & turns, and concludes with a cliffhanger.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Such an addictive, little dungeon crawler game. It consists of a fun upgrade system which makes you want to keep improving your gear and continue playing. The old school music and graphics were a nice touch, too! Wish it was a tad bit longer simply because upgrading gear and meeting the objectives in each dungeon run were fun challenges!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Any time I read that I will not like a movie I have to check it out.  And... as usual, they put down a good movie.  I saw John Carter at the theater and bought the DVD!  And, again as usual so happy I ignored the naysayers.  Taylor Kitsch is fantastic!!  I have watched John Carter on cable several times and really hope there's a sequel.  The action is quick and fun and fast.  I highly recommend, if you have not seen \\"JOHN CARTER\\" to check it out.  Remember, a lot of those who put down movies are jaded and bored with everything.  Have a great time and sit down with cold drink & popcorn to watch a really good movie (Taylor's not hard on the eyes either ;-)
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Since I've started to watch this show, I am cooking more at home!<br />Go figure!<br />Hannibal is a delicious show.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|There is NO reason in the world this should be 27 Dollars.......I am a Total Beatles Fanatic but this turns me off!! It's TOO expensive for a restored BluRay...
B00BSBXZDY|4.0|This movie is great for many ages.  All the characters in this movie and there respective &#34;voices&#34; are hilarious and they took more then 30 minutes to write the story.
B004M3GDI4|3.0|The light is made to fit the Petzl climbing helmet. If I was required to have one by our safety department then it's good to have brand comparability.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The stories illustrate the resilence of children left without parents or resources.  One has to admire the<br />way they approached their lives.  Ones does not admire the way many of them were treated by the<br />adults in their lives.  The author has carefully researched the information revealing how problems<br />were solved in those years.  Surprising!
1609611543|5.0|I went wheat-free for two months, at the advice of my doctor.  During the first month, I felt no difference.  During the second month, I thought I felt better - my head was clear, my energy improved.  I did not lose weight, but that was not my reason for trying a wheat-free diet, since I wasn't overweight to begin with (I was overloaded with candida, and the wheat-free diet was meant to starve the candida).  I can say that I could not wait for the two months to be over, and of course, when it was,  I slowly added in all my favorite wheat foods -- pizza, bread, bagels, crackers, cereal, etc, and it was as delicious as I remembered it to be.  But my energy level sagged, and I couldn't think clearly.  Since I had spent my whole life feeling that way, it didn't seem odd to me at all. However, by the time my diet had returned to what it was prior to the diet, I was crying all the time and having thoughts of suicide.  I had panic attacks.  I wanted to die.  I really didn't relate it to wheat right away, though.  Depression wasn't new to me.  But after a month of feeling like I wanted to kill myself, by chance, I ate a couple of gluten-free meals that someone else prepared for me, and suddenly, I realized - it was the WHEAT!  I tested negative for celiac disease, but I will never, never again eat wheat. Reading this book absolutely solidified it for me.  Read it and try it.  You may be able to see what it means to really feel healthy for the first time in your life!
B009CGR416|5.0|This movie had me laughing out loud on many occasions. The sense of humor is sharp, and intelligent. The style of this movie gave me hope for the future of movies simply due to the way comic-book style fight scenes could be made to look believable (within reason), engaging, and exciting.<br /><br />Not sure what else to say other than &#34;Watch this movie and have fun&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I normally don't give 5 star reviews.  This book deserves it.  I have gotten so bored reading the &#34;regular&#34; PA fiction type books, and this one was just the thing I needed.  The author is great at painting mental images through his text, and I felt like I was actually trudging along through the Silo in his work.  An excellent plot, and a great story told exceptionally well!!!  A thoroughly enjoyable read, and an excellent value for the price.  Thank you Hugh Howey, and please write much more material for this world!!!
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Christian Bale is the best Bat Man ever! This movie is awesome on every level from the script to the fight scenes.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|A troubled girl with a drug problem is brought to a creepy cabin in the woods by her brother and her friends for an intervention. So when she becomes possessed by the evil in in the woods, her friends think she's just acting that way due to quiting drugs cold turkey. Soon they realize that's not the case and that all their lives are in danger and that's due to one of them reading from a creepy book out loud.<br />  Richard Roeper gave the film one star and I sometimes agree with him but not in this case. The movie is an actual remake that's good. The film is very gruesome but the Sam Raimi dark humor isn't missing from it. While there may be no Ash (Bruce Campbell), the actual hero is a little bit of a surprise. I'd actually recommend this Evil Dead to fans of the original and I can't say that about most remakes.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|The overall plot was good and the movie was well put together.  It's a good movie rental to watch at home.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I very much enjoyed the whole story and how they portrayed the different social classes.  Also the depth the king was willing to go to get what he wanted.
0061673730|5.0|This is an excellent book, I've been told to read it by many people over the years and I'm glad I finally picked it up!  The only gripe I have is that the vendor listed my copy as VERY GOOD condition, which the book was not.  If you've ever wanted to read it.....DO IT!!!
1476719071|1.0|Though this was addictive, well - so are cigarettes but they aren't good for us or bystanders. There is so much to offend a thinking reader - from young adults who abuse themselves for profit (fighting & downing shots), that portrays college as one giant party, a young woman who secures her worth in a family of men by cooking for them even though Travis is a capable chef, characters who smoke - and the characters who think that the smell whiskey & smoke on a man is sexy, female characters who are in college and have a huge budget for spa days... What 19 year old needs all those spa treatments with skin full of collagen and rapid cell turnover? The ridiculousness just went on and on - all ending in a Vegas wedding in the wake of a horrific fire. Gosh, seems kind of insensitive to jet of to Vegas while families are identifying the remains of your classmates. I could go on and on with the offensiveness of this book. I will only hope that if my daughter reads this kind of stuff as a teenager that we can talk about the plots and characters.
B004PYWRQC|5.0|I rented this movie for my wife, she has never seen it before. It still was as great as I remembered.
0307476464|5.0|I'm not going to go overboard with my review here like some people. I'll simply say that F.-Eri's character was absolutely amazing and I could literally picture her in my head every second she was described by Murakami. Everyone else in the book was incredibly well portrayed too. The cult leader I kept envisioning the guy from the Aum cult that ordered his followers to release Sarin gas in the Tokyo Subways some years ago. Overall, the love story and how it ends was satisfying and kept me reading well past the 900th page with fervor and excitement. I think what people don't realize is that when your favorite author releases a book the size of a Bible, you have to be very grateful for this reason alone, as it means you'll be reading something from your favorite author for at least a few weeks or a month. The next thing you have to realize is that Murakami is telling a story of epic proportions, but the grand scale of his book is found in all the little details, of which there are thousands. That is what makes the book epic...it's not some mass land battle with dragons and elves, nor is it some huge murder mystery solved at the end, but rather a tale of one lover trying to reach another lover through the metaphysical world that can only exist in a Murakami novel. Congrats to Murakami for giving me the greatest book I have ever read and probably ever will read. I can't wait though until your next book is translated into English!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really dislike the pop up advertising.Oil<br />They are very annoying and happen very frequently. I really like the game
B0029LCJJS|3.0|Over all it's very good but a little to much skin for me. I did really enjoy the costumes as they were very realistic and well done.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|it was a fantastic, very well written story about his personal experience.  Until I read the book I had my doubts about if there was really more after we pass.  His journey was amazingly described in a very scientific way.  I now believe there is something wonderful for us at the end of our lives.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|This is a great tool if like me you have a ton of logins both professional and personnel.  There are some quirks around certain pages on sites like salesforce where it keeps prompting to save but there's no login information to save.  Also took me a bit to find the 'replace' option.  Multiple accounts at email sites can confound the auto-fill but I just don't use that feature now.  The password generator needs some ability to enter a seed.  One that the user thinks up in order in inject a little more randomness.  I haven't figured it all out yet but I'm having fun with it.<br /><br />It's almost 5 stars
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|The acrobatics in this movie are amazing!  The story line is a definite sleeper not a lot going on there.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|Difficult to find fault with a product that works where it should (my Samsung Note 10.1), starts up quickly, does exactly what it should do, and doesn't seem to do anything it shouldn't do. I got it because I already use Foxit on Windows in preference to Adobe product.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son loaded this on my kindle and I thought &#34;what a waste of space it is taking up!&#34; I am having a hard time putting it down!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This was intricate and gripping.  I really enjoyed Jude Law as he worked to find the truth. Good character development.  My husband and I were glued to this one.
B005MQW5RI|5.0|I have been watching it over and over again. Love the twist and the story flow. Enjoy it even more now that it is on 3D
B00B4804KS|1.0|I was disappointed with the transfer. This was weak. I will never buy a 3 d movie<br />Awful and bad
B000UUF69A|5.0|I grew up on a much different(cooler) TMNT but my kids don't know the difference they love this program no matter what I say.
B00ATPVA78|2.0|The game was okay but much to short.  The puzzles were good but more could have been added.  It just seemed that it was rushed and not fully developed.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Excellent. Beautiful graphics. Entertaining and fun. Time will fly a by as you get more and more involved and intrigued by it all
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love hidden object games and have played hundreds so it is good to know that there are some like this that are such high quality for enjoyment.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Horrible writing...great action. Please try to remove some cheese from the next one.<br /><br />The books are good but the movie disappoints.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm as addicted to this story as Gideon is addicted to Eva! While it's at times, over the top, the characters are well written and the story is exciting and romantic.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My family really enjoyed this movie.  My two sons now have new nicknames but they were wrecking my stuff before this movie came out.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love this entire series. Fans of twilight and Harry potter will probably enjoy these books.  A lot of drama involved, but still a great book. I enjoyed it and couldn't wait for the next one!
0385349947|5.0|This book brings to light an important subject. it was throughly researched and plainly presented. I wish I had 100 copies to give to the women (and male)  friends who think that they may not need to read this book, because they DO!  it is an easy read.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Just weird unnecessary gory shots for the sake of it. The story could have been molded much better. Blowing people all over with weird red splashing did not add to the storyline.
B001VFTYWI|3.0|I had read it when first in paperback. I had forgotten, so I bought the Ebook version. First, I have never paid $9.99 for a book in my life. Second, it was so long I had to recharge my Kindle several times. There was no reason to have been so long as much didn't add to the story it was just wordy for the sake of it.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is really fun! I couldn't put  it down last night to go to sleep. I like the graphics a lot also.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|College is a new beginning for Abby Abernathy.  She's trying to leave behind a painful past.  She almost does it.  Almost.<br /><br />Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox is THE Big Man On Campus.  A misunderstood underground fighter fighting to pay his way through college who has tattoos and a motorcycle and refuses to date a girl in lieu of one-night stands.  Not exactly what you'd call boyfriend material.<br /><br />Until Travis meets Abby.<br /><br />Why does the good girl always fall for the bad boy?<br /><br />The main story in BEAUTIFUL DISASTER is the volatile relationship between Abby and Travis.  The relationship is fraught with the high-highs of a new love and the low-lows of that same new love that abut obsessive and stalker-like behavior.<br /><br />Aside from the relationship between Abby and Travis, there are other relationships that I found interesting in this book.  Abby's best friend is America, \\"Mere\\".  Though the draw of this book might be the story of the romance, I applaud the best friend story.<br /><br />Childhood friends, Abby and Mere, decide to attend the same college far away from their home and Abby's past.  Mere knows Abby's story.  She's not telling.  Mere has made a promise to Abby that she'll be there for her and be her \\"conscience\\".  Mere quickly falls head over heels for Shepley~~who happens to be a cousin to and roommates with~~Travis.  Through every complication, Mere is there for Abby and Abby for Mere.  Best friends.<br /><br />On a personal level I have had a hard time deciding how I feel about this book.  The character of Travis sends up a million red flags (and the title of the very first chapter is none other than \\"Red Flag\\").  When things are going well between Travis and Abby it's all sunshine and smiles.  When things are not going well~~things get broken.  This story is fiction.  In real life, if Abby were my best friend, I'd want her to run far and fast from the Travis-types of the world.<br /><br />There is now a sequel out to this book called WALKING DISASTER that is told from Travis' point of view.  I'll definitely be reading it!<br /><br />✰✰✰✰book called WALKING DISASTER that is told from Travis' point of view.  I'll definitely be reading it!<br /><br />✰✰✰✰
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I was so disappointed in the dictionary that came with my Kindle Fire HD that I ordered this one.  I love this one because I can type in the word I am looking for and it goes right to that word.  If you can do that with the one that came on the Kindle Fire HD I couldn't figure out how to do it.
0786958731|4.0|Good product, but I get bored playing..you kill a monster, loot it, move on...kinds bland. Should have got Decent 2nd Edition
B00CATSONE|5.0|It was an absolutely inspiring book that definitely drives me to not be afraid to imagine. The author uses really nice simple words to read and digest while precise and full of important information which is very rare in this kind of topic. Well Done !
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This was the perfect topper to a special gift for my little granddaughter. She was thrilled when she opened it and for the price is was great. The price was good and the delivery was ontime.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|This is ok. It's fun, but not exceptional. Will keep at it, maybe it will become more so as it continues.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Very easy reading.  Gives you a good insight to Jobs.  You sense he was a hard man to work with.  You had to be very, very good to stay with him.  He wanted the best & it had to be his way.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Love it I love to look at true stories And to see the out come and how they are living now.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Love this game...good storyline good picture love looking at all the different locations....part 2 is also good played that one a while ago
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game a few days ago and so far its great the only thing I just wanted it to be a little slower when you hey the jetpack other than that it was great. Also it would ne better if all the fast characters to be already unlocked and get the coins faster and better that's all.other than those things it was awesome and I'd totally gt get something like this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also the creators should make a different version of this game
B009NY43NY|5.0|I sure am sad to see the last of Sookie Stackhouse but I enjoyed the fact that all the players from previous books had an ending to their stories.  Charleston Harris books are as always fun
B004FOA84A|4.0|This was a fun game. Not too hard, but entertaining enough to keep me at it. Could be longer though.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is fun. It is different the the tablet version. You can't see it as well as the tablet version.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Really nicely done. If you loved Galaga, then you should definitely give this game a try.  I only played one tine and got to level 14. The graphics are very pleasant,  the music is not horrible,  but I already turned it off.  After my one time of playing it seems to me that this is a well made game.  I'm looking forward to getting back to the action.  And yes it also has asterois show up too. Thanks for the free game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. I've always wanted my own horse and now this gives me a chance to practice the ideals of owning a horse. I love it.
0525952926|1.0|I have read and enjoyed all of Ken Follett's novels except this latest release.  He has a wonderful knack of choosing a period of history, developing characters from all strata and give the reader a true prospective of an era dealing with multiple issues, political, social, commerce, personal and many other factors in society.  One feels he is actually living in the era.  Many of his endeavors have roman a clef aspect to them, so one learns history and is entertained at the same time.  I am a retired surgeon who has mainly read academic history books for the past forty years and am presently working on a Masters in History.  I do enjoy a great historical novel as break from my usual fair.  I found Follett's Winter of the World  very superficial, cardboard-like with poorly developed characters and light treatment of historical events.  It reads more like a Harlequin romance novel than a serious historical novel.  When you have so many characters on one palette and the enormous number of events and factors that compose WWII on another palette, you can't create a paint of worth but mere fuzzy outlines that leaves the reader bored, in fact I had a difficult time finishing the book.  Follett could have and should have made a trilogy of this era and would have allowed him to maintain his quality. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AND FEEL IT IS WASTING ONE'S MONEY ABD TIME READING IT.
B001QK91TY|5.0|Refreshing time capsule of Americana.  Filmed at a time when the innocence of our country is a valuable national treasure.  The images of this film will tease your sensibility.  This wonderful film will reverse the social erosion taking place today and it shows<br />the individual qualities we all share and were shown openly in a quite different society. The &#34;charm&#34;, evident in a world of<br />promise.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Third time is a charm, had troubles in the beginning.  However, Amazon Customer Service was excellent to help send new cables until we found one that works great.
B000I3SYEI|4.0|This is certainly the best Star Trek movie with the original cast.  First Contact is a contender for best Star Trek movie along with this one.  But, Wrath of Khan is really an example of the best that Star Trek movies can be.  There is action, suspense, some philosophy, great characters played by great actors (including Montalbán as the villainous Khan), and good use of the sci-fi roots of Star Trek.  Everyone talks about how the new movies generalize the material to a wider audience.  I think Wrath of Khan could easily be enjoyable to the same audiences now and this one will stand the test of time.  This movie is good edge of your seat fun...you are in for a treat if you haven't seen it before.  Enjoy!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The best series I've ever watched. Fascinating characters, great plot and surprising twists.  I really can't wait to see season three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is so fun and time consuming great for draining time also it has so many games on the game
B00354YA4U|4.0|A very quick read and highly intriguing. Great suspense and you won't forget the pubic hair. A bit slight but against the usual over sexed trend.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use, clear tabs, decent quality pictures, good buy/sell /unsold options ....hmmm....do not know what else to say...Yay ebay?
B000I55YV2|4.0|I like it when the good guys win and they did it with style and class. Car chase was good
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Many people think of the Goonies with nostalgic memories of the 80s.  This movie really is more than that, though it is unmistakably a product of that decade.  This movie does stand the test of time.  It is a fun adventure.  The kind we all wished we could have had when we were kids.  The filming location in Oregon depicts the lush lands of the Pacific Northwest and sets a great starting point for the burgeoning young adults on a mission to save their homes.  The young actors do a good job of making their characters three dimensional and the adult actors (particularly the Fratellis) really round out the ensemble.  You may even recognize the main character Mikey as Sean Astin from The Lord of the Rings films or Rudy and Josh Brolin from No Country for Old Men.  This is a great one for family movie night.  One note, that though the film is rated PG, there is a quick slip of language at one point in the film and some younger children might find one of the characters a little scary.
B0000025ZK|5.0|Excellent price and in perfect condition! I had this on cassette tape but wanted to get the more permanent version since the music has proven the test of time. Gilmore never goes stale!
B003VW54QO|2.0|Disappointing production values.  Story line lacked nuance. No complexity of character.  More a formula movie in the studio system days as opposed to a classic.
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|I loved season 1 and figured I would wait patiently until season 2 released because i just don't watch regular TV.  However, this non-release of Season 2 is starting to seem silly - and i have forgotten why i was excited about season 2 in the first place.  I suspect the marketing folks mis-judged our willingness to wait a stupid amount of time.  Had we not had to wait so long, we might have more readily paid the high price.  Won't now.  No longer care enough.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was okay but it's the first book where I liked the movie more than the book. But it wasn't bad.
B007PS0DTI|4.0|added stuff, i want to see if they make a 5th movie because there is some stuff I would like to see more of. but over all not as good as the first 3.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I gave this a 2 because I love hidden object games. If this game connected to my FB game then it would get a 4.  Why start this game over at its slow Pace when I've done all that on FB.  It's also difficult to move around rooms on Kindle Fire in night mode.  Sorry but deleting this app.  :-(
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game/puzzle box! Great test for insight and logic.  Make sure you turn up the sound it enhances the experience
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is full of excitement that is great for all ages. I read all three and then had my husband read them who also could not put them down.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|This game is rather fun, but as someone who has the actual board game, it is missing a few options.<br /><br />First, the official Blokus rules call for the blue player to go first, followed by yellow, red, and green. In this app, Red (player) goes first, followed by green, blue, then yellow.<br /><br />The app only has the options for the player to play one color (always red, with computer playing other three) OR playing all 4 colors. A better way would be to choose which colors should be player controlled, and which computer controlled. For instance, a player could choose to be blue, have another person play yellow, but let the computer control green and red.<br /><br />There are some glitches in the app. You can actually switch to view what pieces are available still for the computer, and immediately place one, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THAT PLAYER'S TURN. The computer will then place the rest of the round, which can result in some players placing no pieces that turn. For example, selecting the blue player at the start of the game (with the option for computer to be controlling green, blue, and yellow) and placing a blue piece on the board will make the computer immediately place a yellow piece. In this situation, red and green would not have placed. You can then repeat this, allowing the green player a huge advantage in having the board nearly to himself. OR if you choose to place for the yellow player, the computer will then place a full round for all four players.<br /><br />I've also experienced some glitches where pieces placed disappeared from view. The red dots still appeared to show where you could place around it, but the piece itself was invisible.<br /><br />Lastly, the scoring is not the same as the Blokus game. The scoring bonus for finishing is missing. My rules state that if a player places all of his or her pieces, he or she gets a bonus score of +20 points if the last piece played was a the single dot, +15 points otherwise. This bonus is missing on the game.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This book was beautifully written, with well developed characters and a page turning plot. I am only sorry that I finished it so quickly, and there is not more by this author (yet?). I have recommended this book to several friends, and would encourage those who appreciate well constructed, thoughtful fiction to try it. If you prefer action adventure or steamy romance, try something else.
B00AVIKMN6|4.0|I would say its average for a movie and doesn't really shine. But I came across this when i was in the mood for something that i could suspend my disbelief for and I was happy. It works well with the other movies and some how adds depth when you see it after the others. so I would say its good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Captivating sequel. Can't put it down once you start<br />Can't wait to download book three. Not enough time in the day for reading
B006GWO5NE|5.0|works real good I love the fact that I can charge it and still be using it. Does not get twisted up
B002ZHKZEC|1.0|I bought this back in Nov 2010 when launch.<br />When i received it, i have watch thru all the 5 discs, all were working perfectly.<br />after a few months when i try to watch it 2nd times,<br />all except disc 2 is able to play.<br />I have over 300 blu-ray titles, and this is the only titles that can't play properly.<br />I have tried my 2 blu-ray players, ps3 and blu-ray drive on my computer.<br />And as i only discover it few months later when i try to re-watch,<br />it had passed the exchange period.<br />So now i won't buy any BBC America blu-ray.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very useful app having installed it a few weeks ago on my Kindle fire it has provided me with all the information I need to know about its battery life and when best to recharge , wouldn't be with out it now.
B00425S1H8|3.0|Bit Expensive For Cable But Over All Everything Was As Expected Driver CD, Good Quality USB But I Was Not Able To Work This One On Kubuntu Because I Think Kernel Version Was Old On Kubuntu And Was Not Supported By The Device
B000I9X54Q|4.0|its good, not as good as the first but its a nice add on to the story and good if you see rise of the lycans.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love Bones! The story has all the twists and turns you expect and some new ones.  Worth the read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love that it learns and predicts the way I like to type. Great app, lots of options for customization.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent! Usual great writing. I love it when the loose ends of a story get tied up! Salander continues to be strange but she grows in this book.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Very thorough, accurate, and easy to personalize. I use it every day and love it.  A great app for Android.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Lee Child, great as usual, but I got so tired of statements being turned into questions (blah blah blah, right?), it became a distraction. I could see one character having that speech pattern, but all of them?  Otherwise, excellent read :)
B0024SQW2Q|5.0|This movie makes the first and second movies much deeper, and the story between these two is nicer than selene and Mike
B005LAIIKI|5.0|There were so many things going on in this flick I had to re-wind to make sure i was seeing what my eyes were telling me. It is a classic! hillarious at times & tons of action. I love all of Tarintinos Movies & this one doesn't dissapoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting plot, complex characters, lots of action.  Couldn't stop reading it! Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The best game I've ever downloaded. Anyone can play but there's some challenges there too. I've played it over and over and it never gets boring.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its a preety cool game. I like the cars not the guy. LoL! you will most likely like it to. it also does not lag
B00CW665VI|5.0|I didn't know if I was going to like this book, but I have fallen in love with it. I love drew he is a real man and to think that a woman wrote this she has to have a real man in her life helping her out.  It was really funny, very sexy, and had a fabulous finish. Definitely worth every penny.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|well leaving you wanting more. can't wait for new season 6to start so I can see if what I think will happen???
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I almost never purchase entire albums because I'm so picky about what songs I like. However, I enjoy every song on this with maybe the last song as an exception. If you're looking to expand your music library, you can't go wrong with this.
0446554995|4.0|Unfortunately another cliff hanger for the next book (hate that). But if you like a science fiction, suspense, good vs evil type read...this is it. Really suggest you get the entire Pendergast series so you understand the entire story line.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Grew up watching these shows.  It is nice to be able to watch them again.  Some of these old shows are better than the current shows on TV now.
B00CE379IM|4.0|Finall something that's not about Vampires not over the top drama and bs.  My kids wanted to see this and they push the envelope on the pg 13 rating
B00CRS88IO|4.0|I was given an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This is a thrill-a-minute, action packed, James Bond-style action extravaganza. There are enough bullets and explosions for three summer movies. I loved every page. The writing grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the last page. It definitely leaves you wanting more. I eagerly await the next installment in this cool new series.
B0072OFM28|4.0|I was a little skeptical about this because I so loved Andy in the title role but I think Liam came into his own. And the second season is just as bloody and charged as the first. The emotional connection to the characters is still there as well; perhaps even more so because they go through even tougher situations and you just want them to succeed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok I love subway surfers it is so addictive . Great on kindle iPhone and other similar devices, if you enjoy temple run, you'll LOVE this ;) enjoy :D
B00270WH3Y|2.0|Some old recordings just sound poor.  Perhaps they were manufactured from records rather than from original masters.  In any event, it sounds poor and I do not listen to it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this works great for kindle i have had no problems with it. the only problem i have is that i can not save pics on it
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I thought the story unfolded at a good pace and wrapped up nicely.  I would have liked to know a little more from each of the characters--what Ben thought about in prison, what Diane's experience was like, something from Debby and Michelle.  Overall very good.  If you enjoyed Gone Girl I think you will really like this book.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I came away from this movie extremely impressed.  Character development in this movie is done through the way that the movie was filmed, the way that shots are framed, and not through dialogue.  Dialogue just serves as a bridge into the next scene.  By doing this the director was taking a very big chance that people just wouldn't \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />Judging from the reviews on here, many people didn't \\"get it\\" and did not have the patience to actually pay attention.  If you need happy endings, Hollywood styled plot-lines, and bright friendly subject matter this probably is not for you. If the artistic side of movie-making appeals to you and you can stomach highly stylized violence, then this is absolutely something that you want to see.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I thought the first season was a little slow but I did enjoy it, even though some of the things the girls did were just plain stupid. I have to say though half the fun of the show is seeing what the girls will be wearing next.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|I downloaded this to my Droid 3. I have unlimited data plan, etc, but this app would not work at all. It would not find my location and there are no directions whatsoever to set this up. I found it extrememtly difficult to use (maybe because it could not find my location also). Before I get any comments, yes I do have GPS on my phone and all options are activated, including date roaming, etc.  My Google maps works just fine and is much easier to use than this one. Took it off phone as it is a waste of storage.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|I really hate big, bulky phone cases. Thankfully, SPIGEN must have had me in mind as they designed this one. The rubber at top and bottom will hopefully protect my phone if/when I do drop it. The non-curved beveled edges actually give me a little more grip than the last case I owned. Though I haven't purchased any additional center-covers (or whatever they call them) I like the idea that I could if I wanted to.<br /><br />This case is a definite buy!
B0017HEX76|3.0|Thank goodness it has the English version.  No problem with the product, it is more with the seller not specifying that it was the Korean version. Ultimately it is my fault for not carefully reading all small print descriptions.
B008KW43TE|5.0|Simply brilliant! No other words. If you have the album already, then you know what I'm talking about. If not..stop stalling
B00004YRQA|5.0|This memory card worked fine, I ordered this awhile back and I forgot to leave feedback, shipping was fine, memory card worked as intended.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Really enjoyed it; great way to kick start Doctor Who again I thought. It has some episodes that you just know you'll never get tired of watching over and over.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Such a great game to play if your stress and what a better way to cut up fruit sure wish I could make a salad out of it.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|I  was a little disappointed by the disco direction of Daft Punk's new album, so I bought Reconfigured to remind myself why they deserve my money, even for experiments like RAM. This album was exactly what I needed: solid electronica, with a great orchestral basis.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I don't play many games on my Kindle Fire HD, but I have had fun with this free version of Angry Birds.  It is very addicting.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is oddeeehhh fun and I like how the creatures got larger also there's a knight there's not antithetic game on anything
B002FOQXZK|4.0|Okay so got the album, great album like it a lot, problem is though the MP3 version that is downloadable, is missing track 8?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books! I would reccommend them to every person I could! I read them when they first came out, but decided to buy them for my tablet just recently. If you are trying to decide whether or not to get them, I say get em!! :)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It connects to the Facebook version so you always have contact with your teammates and what you do on one device in the game is reflected in the other. If you love BINGO you will love this app.
B007SPPANM|5.0|After watching mostly HD for a couple years now  SD doesn't compare, but this movie is so well done in all departments that it should be in anyone's video library as a keeper.<br />The music in particular creates an intense feeling of awe as some of the cataclysmic scenes are shown and strongly enhances the visual effect.<br />Glad I bought this.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love t hat you can create your own relaxation melody...I get to pick my perfect combination for my mood and moment. Simply wonderful!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I love this game! The music and graphics are fantastic and the game is a lot of fun to play.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|remember the music, remember the story, and remember the romance...this is the best movie version of the story so far....with excellent casts and great visuals....
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love the HP books and movies. I was soo excited when I found all 8 of the movies for soo cheap, in this pack. I reccommend the books and movies to everyone I know, already. So, I definitely recommend them to all of you!! :)) I can't wait to have my HP marathon!!! (with the movies this time, hehe)
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I LOVE THE O.C. I've seen all of it, and I already own the first series, so to finally have the second series in my hands was amazing. Now I can watch it whenever I want, and I always love watching all the bonus features and commentary.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I rarely get through an entire book, even if its slim reading...<br /><br />This book is slim reading and I got through it in one setting and found it to be the best written thing I've read in a long time.  This person writes so well on a subject that could easily bore you with tears.  I was captivated by the life of this person because of this author.  Even in college chemistry, you don't get told of Tesla's entire story or amazing contributions in the way Sean Patrick brings it to you in this e-book.  Its simply amazing reading and it inspires you to live a greater life, a more meaningful life, and to want to know all about chemistry, math, and physics!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I was captured from the onset. Funny, well written, and uniquely voiced - I couldn't put it down once I started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My friend got me into this whole minecraft thing. Now I'm playing this game about every single day. This is a must get game.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|the idea of bringing up this true story into movies is really unspeakably amazing...a movie that will remind us to always appreciate those we love, the family, and faith....no matter what...
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I love this types of game and this is the best one that I have run across yet. The game play is fun and gripping. Simply put, you destroy ships to level up and if you get hurt you loose levels till you die. Also the scoring system keeps you coming back for more!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Pretty awesome movie despite bad reviews! I would watch it again. Love action movies, & highly recommend this one! Pleasantly surprised & advise not to go by bad reviews :)
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|Please note that this review is for the non-rooted functionality of the app.  I cannot attest to how well it does on a rooted phone.<br /><br />I really did want to like this app.  After all, the Adblock Plus add-on has been at the top of my \\"must-have\\" list for some time when running internet browsers (Firefox, Chrome) on my computer.<br /><br />This app required me to set up a proxy server.  While not all that difficult, one may have to look up instructions to do so properly for your specific device.<br /><br />The app blocked many ads while web browsing, however I did still get plenty of ads in my apps.  What I really couldn't live with, however, was how negatively it affected my phone's performance.  Anything that was using the internet seemed to load much slower than usual.  Heck, even trying to use S Voice was hit or miss.  Half the time, it would hang on my request for several seconds then return an error.  After removing this app, S Voice and overall performance returned to normal.  It seems likely that this would be caused by the proxy server setup.<br /><br />While the app offers some functionality, its flaws are just too glaring for me.  I would not recommend this app due to the device performance cost that comes with it.<br /><br />A few weeks later I gave in and rooted my device.  I am now using AdAway and it is everything that I expected this app to be.  It blocks all unwanted apps in a seamless manner (without noticeably affecting performance), and makes it easy to maintain an up-to-date hosts file.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing. It is one of the only games that I play. I find no flows in this game
B009JCL58G|4.0|David Mitchell is a writer I have just recently become familiar with - I just found out he went to the same university as myself and I have really enjoyed getting to read his books - I have just finished Ghostwritten, and am currently reading Number9Dream.  He has a distinctive style which mixes reality with subtle fantasy and sci fi to express thoughts about life and the world we live in.  Cloud Atlas the film can definitely take a couple of viewings as the style is so different from what we used to in our normal linear world of movies, but once you grasp the subtle connections between the stories, this becomes an engaging and thought -provoking treatise.  Some have found this too much to stomach and perhaps don't appreciate such tenuous plot links, but the thematic links are much stronger than at first evident, making this a very interesting and engaging film. The book is even better - but when is that not the case?  The soundtrack is a great companion and features the haunting music of the Cloud Atlas Sextet written by Mr Frobisher, one of the rather more tragic characters in the film.  The other tracks, whilst containing some rather more film soundtrack numbers has some great music that stands on its own and is worth a listen.  Welcome to the world of Mr Mitchell
B0057R5G6E|5.0|we all know the movies, we all remember the excitement as the T-Rex preys...but for this limited gift set, you don't think twice, you would definitely buy it and enjoy the whole adventures over and over again...
B00AMUOP22|5.0|thks so much!<br />Been listeming to it many times when working out. I thank you for your speedy shipment.<br />Look forward to more music.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is very spiritual it is what love is all about.It is about God,miracles and faith.It tells how one person with enough faith,love and devotion to God can change not one person but a whole town and for the better it lasts.It tells you that miracles do happen and listen to God with your heart not your ears....
B001NHNG64|4.0|Fun quick read book.Not quit as good as his later novels.  I will still buy other reacher books as theay are a fund quick read.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was a great book. It shows the messed up part of life that is the beauty of this book.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!! I had been wanting this game for a while, and when I finally tried it I got totally hooked. The stuff you can make is hilarious and I can't wait until New worlds are added. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It`s a very good book, I already told all my friends about it, telling them to read it before it becomes a movie!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Considering some of the movies that are popular in the cinema these days -- from dumb, car-related flicks like the \\"Fast & Furious 6\\", \\"G.I. Joe\\", \\"Identity Thief\\", or the latest Tyler Perry dreck -- it's no surprise that most American movie goers aren't imaginative, well-read, or, let's face it, bright enough to understand or figure the relatively simple, but true, message behind \\"Cloud Atlas\\".<br /><br />And expecting them to be able to figure out that Tom Hanks, as Zachary, is speaking in the sort of broken English that would be prevalent after an Apocalyptic event due to set backs in civilization -- heck, it's even prevalent in parts of society today -- or to have the maturity to sit and figure out the disparate plot threads as the movie progresses is likely expecting too much of a society that has everything spoon-fed to it (via TV and the internet).<br /><br />But for THOSE VIEWERS INTELLIGENT AND MATURE ENOUGH (always remembering intelligence and maturity don't automatically come with age), \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a visual cornucopia and a heartfelt message of hope.<br /><br />The various stories run the gamut of \\"genres\\", from an Historical sea-faring adventure set in the 1800s, to a romance between two men (one of them a bisexual musical composer) during the 1930s, to a mystery during the 1970s, to a comical misadventure amongst old folks in 2012, to a science fiction thriller in the mid 21st century to a dystopian, science fiction/fantasy parable in a time after an unnamed, apocalyptic event (the time in which Zachary lives).  All of it \\"framed\\" by an aged, \\"story-telling\\" Zachary as he recounts his life, and the lives of others, to a group of young children.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already encapsulated the various plot elements (check out the five star reviews, you'll find plenty), so I'll just say that the writer/directors and the actors have all done a great job of bringing together six disparate stories and making them one whole vision of world peopled by THOSE WHO TRY TO HELP ONE ANOTHER and THOSE WHO ONLY PREY ON OTHERS.<br /><br />A five-star film-viewing experience, for sure.d by THOSE WHO TRY TO HELP ONE ANOTHER and THOSE WHO ONLY PREY ON OTHERS.<br /><br />A five-star film-viewing experience, for sure.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|if you believe in love and the Beatles, then you must have this movie as your collection...with breathtaking visuals, and songs popularized by the Beatles, you would definitely sit and enjoy your time for the journey across the universe...
0812982622|5.0|This book is beautifully written and crafted. It takes you on a heart wrenching journey through the paradox that is North Korea. The words help vivid images come to life and you can sense the hopelessness of even the special class as they know their status and fortunes can slip away quickly. Just a beautiful book about a doomed nation.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love fruit ninja! This game is addicting and really fun.:) I love all the blades you can unlock, and all the different modes of gameplay. Way better than the free version, and great as an faotd.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|GREAT ACTORS, GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY, GREAT STORY, VERY ENTERTAINING, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT !!!  DON'T EVEN WANT TO WATCH THE PRESENT REMAKE...
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Thoroughly recommend this novel.  As always the author really captures the time and historical detail of the period and gives a great insite.
B005OGS5BG|4.0|with a beautiful tale of this blonde girl surviving law school and finally shows that there's more than just being blonde, i would definitely suggest you keep this movie as your collection so you can watch and laugh and be inspired together with your family, and your friends, and your beloved one... :)
B005IQZB14|4.0|A great memoir.  Made me want to hike the trail.  Reminded me of Bill Bryson A Walk in the Woods from a female perspective.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love, love love this game!!!! I'm working on getting the stars on all the boxes, there are a lot of boxes and more are being added. Get this game, don't listen to the bad reviews, get this game!
B00CWIMY3O|4.0|I am writing this before the season has ended but I can safely say it's been one of the best seasons of anything I watched this year, including The Following which unraveled badly by the end. I cannot wait for this to come out on disc, I will be buying it for certain. Great show, great dialog, and excellent casting. I wouldn't change a thing. :)
B004S49YEM|3.0|I did enjoy it but not as much as some of his books.  I found the story to be a little bit predictable.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Almost Home is classic Carey. It's a return to form for Mariah and her voice is in fine form. This is one of the best Disney songs in years.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I grew up in Kansas, so The Wizard of Oz is like the cornerstone of cinema to me. Needless to say, I was excited to see a prequel. But going into it, I kept my expectations neutral, as I always do. Even still, after it was over, I was just sad to witness something so timeless be utterly destroyed. I wish I had the neuralizer from Men in Black so I can just forget I ever saw that stinky cheese disguised movie. I will say that the script for the movie probably looked really good, because the story was, well good. BUT everything else about the movie was the cheesiest, DISNEYIEST crap I've ever seen. It's no wonder Robert Downey Jr. backed out of the main role after meeting with Sam Raimi. I swear, Raimi's way of directing is stuck in the 90's.  It seems as if he tells all of his actors to act goofy and retarded in every one of his movies. If I could, I would give this 0 stars, but Amazon made me put 1 at the least. I can't believe I even took the time to write about this. Hopefully, if there's someone out there like me reading this before watching the movie, it will lower their expectations and they will enjoy the film. I'll never look at any of the actors in this movie the same way. They have all dropped down a notch in my book. Especially Mila Kunis. (Not that she was that high up in my book anyway. And Franco, you better get used to picking up Downey Jr's dropped roles, because that's all your gonna get for the rest of your life.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all of the cut the rope games and I absolutely love them all! This is a GREAT addition to my collection. For anyone who likes the original cut the rope, this is different enough that you should try it out.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|This movie was not good. It was overly cheesy, and...well...I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Still, a lot of people like a lot of really bad movies these days, so enjoy.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love how this app works!  It allows you to bring in almost any radio stream from almost anywhere.  It remembers where you have been and provides suggestions for streams that you may like.  I really enjoy this app.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The products involved in the package looks very good and the express is also time-saving. This package is not a bad choice.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT TOM BELIEVES IN, BUT ONE THING I ADMIRE IS HIS ACTING ABILITY. LOVED THIS AS MUCH AS I DID HIS VERY FIRST - RISKY BUSINESS - BOTH CLASSICS IN MY MIND
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This is a lot like beleweled but with an action game twist on it. I think it's a great game, it's more challenging than bejeweled and its really fun that you can do things with the tiles that you match. Would totally recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games that are a little different.
B002WCLG48|5.0|If your into Halo and Anime then I would seriously buy it... I love Halo have every game and anime is a big thing to me so buy amazing movie.
